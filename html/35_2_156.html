Public Accounts, I am pleased to present the seventh report of the 
Standing Committee on Public Accounts.
<P>
	Our committee examined chapter 23 of the report tabled by the 
Auditor General of Canada in November 1996, dealing with 
materiel management in the federal government. The report 
contains eight recommendations.
<P>
	I merely wish to draw your attention to the following paragraph 
which, I think, accurately reflects what we wanted to say. The 
procurement and use of materiel is one of the federal government's 
costlier activities. It is therefore of vital importance that this 
activity be properly managed in order to keep costs to government 
and the taxpayers who fund it to a minimum. At the same time, 
these resources have to be intelligently managed in order to ensure 
that they deliver maximum value.
<P>
	Pursuant to Standing Order 109, the Standing Committee on 
Public Accounts is asking the government to table a comprehensive 
response to this report.

purpose of the bill is to permit individuals who object on 
conscientious grounds to paying taxes that might be used for 
military purposes to direct an amount equivalent to a prescribed 
percentage of the income tax they pay in a year be diverted to a 
special account established by this bill.

He said: Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to discuss more criminal justice 
matters, specifically Bill C-55 and the need to toughen the law 
when it comes to release of offenders and the designation of certain 
offenders, especially violent offenders.
<P>
	There is no question we need some substantive changes in the 
sentencing procedures as well as in the area of incarceration.
<P>
<B>(1015 )</B>
<P>
	In a way prisoners have it too good on one side and on the other 
the line is not clear, if they step over it, on what should happen to 
them or what could happen to them. As a result there is a certain 
arrogance that has developed within the prison population of those 
who are bent on committing a lot of crime. There is no punishment 
within the correctional system. It is obvious this attitude would 
manifest itself in the lives of so many offenders and so few have 
their attitudes corrected in the system as it exists.
<P>
	That has been evident to me as my colleagues and I have 
travelled across the country and have stopped in at various prisons 
in Canada. Some of us have been to the United States and looked at 
some of those prison procedures and methods of incarceration, but 
we are talking about Canada and the attitude of prisoners in 
Canada.
<P>
	Are the politicians of the day doing what is best not only for the 
country, for the community, for the innocent, but also for the 
prisoners themselves? For the most part I would have to say a 
resounding no, the  politicians of the day and the government of the 
day, the Liberal Party, certainly are not doing what they should be 
doing to curb the attitude of the criminal.
<P>
	In response to their view of what should be done and to the 
outcry from the public, the justice minister brings forward Bill 
C-55. When we look closely at the bill it appears to be doing the 
right thing. It is incremental in its scope as far as change is 
concerned but ultimately it is not really coming close to what has to 
be done when we look at the rate of victimization in the country 
from the hands of those who are constantly reoffending.
<P>
	My first motion seeks to deal with the dangerous offender 
application and to bring about the provision that would allow the 
crown to give notice at the time of conviction of an application 
review. What we are seeking to do is have that review take place at 
any time during the offender's release.
<P>
	I have had an opportunity to look through some of the more 
recent convictions of offenders who have been released. After they 
have served their sentence or a portion of their sentence they have 
been released. All the reports clearly point to the fact that they are 
going to reoffend. Yet because of the present provision the law does 
not allow for a dangerous offender application to go forward after 
they have been incarcerated. It has to be done at the time of 
sentencing.
<P>
	That is an injustice because so many times offenders are released 
back into society they immediately reoffend and are put back into 
the system again. That is at a great cost to the taxpayer, but then an 
unnecessary victimization is taking place because the crown or the 
government, corrections Canada, has chosen not to make that 
application at the very front end. There should be a provision to 
make an application of dangerous offender at any time during the 
incarceration of that offender.
<P>
	I looked at some offences that took place in my own riding. I am 
going to make mention of one in particular, a fellow by the name of 
James Tocher, a pedophile. As far as I am concerned a pedophile is 
a dangerous offender, but there is no provision for that 
classification in Bill C-55 presented by the justice minister.
<P>
	The justice minister for one reason or another has failed to 
expand this whole area of dangerous offender.
<P>
<B>(1020)</B>
<P>
	Mr. Tocher has been charged on numerous occasions with 
pedophilia. The last account was for three young boys he attacked 
in Calgary this year. He is subject to sentencing. He is a former 
hockey coach and he made these attacks, these manipulations, very 
carefully. Unfortunately pedophiles are very devious people in the 
sense that they manipulate their way so that they can get a hold of 
children almost at anytime.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9704"> 9704 </A></B>
<P>
	Since 1984 Tocher has been in and out of prison. He would spend 
a few months in prison, be released for a  few months more after 
reoffending and then be released and reoffend. He has been before 
the courts five or six times and all basically relating to the same 
thing.
<P>
	After the second time I would suggest that this man should not 
walk the street, and yet this is the case. He has been in and out, in 
and out, and no application made. It is often the case that the crown 
will not proceed in that fashion because it costs too much. The cost 
of victimization and revictimization is much higher than what 
dollars and cents would be to hear the case and make an application 
for dangerous offender.
<P>
	A man like Tocher should be classified as a dangerous offender 
right off the bat or at anytime during that first sentence served. 
Once he has served his sentence and it is clear that he is going to 
reoffend the application can be made again and his time extended 
and extended if necessary.
<P>
	That is one of the other provisions that we had made in our 
review of this legislation, as an amendment, that after 15 years if it 
is clear that this person is a dangerous offender and is going to 
reoffend then at that time there would be an opportunity for review, 
not in the short order provisions that have been placed by the 
justice minister on Bill C-55 where he has extended it from three 
years to seven years. We would like to see the review take place 
after fifteen years of time served.
<P>
	I have colleagues who are going to speak to this area to a much 
greater degree. My colleague from Surrey-White Rock-South 
Langley will certainly do that.
<P>
	A third point that we feel is very necessary and again dealing 
with dangerous offenders is the sentence served upon second 
conviction of a personal injury offence would be an indefinite one. 
The subject has not learned his lesson the first time. By being 
subjected to a second offence and through the court hearing it 
would be an automatic indefinite sentence and a minimum service 
of time of 15 years. We are designating that as two strikes and you 
are out. In California is a law where there is a three strike provision 
which has certainly targeted a small element of the criminal 
society. It has put them under a restraint that takes any violent 
offender out for life. This is one area that we would like to see 
extended into our provisions in the Criminal Code. Here is the 
opportunity for the Liberal government to do exactly that.
<P>
	I want to quickly point out that when it comes to long term 
offenders we would like to see that list of offences include many of 
the sexual offences and especially sex crimes against children. 
Those are our four amendments. My colleagues are going to deal 
with each one of those in a broader context. I am trusting that the 
Liberal government and those in this House will take consideration 
of what has been provided for here and vote in favour of the 
amendments.
<P>
<B>(1025 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
wish to respond to the motions which have been put forward by the 
hon. member. I wish to address these amendments as a group. I 
believe that would be the appropriate way to deal with them. They 
are all amendments to the dangerous offender and long term 
offender components of Bill C-55.
<P>
	A new long term offender procedure which targets sex offenders 
is central to Bill C-55. Equally important are the changes that Bill 
C-55 proposes to the existing dangerous offender procedure. I 
suggest that Bill C-55 significantly increases the ability of 
prosecutors to obtain very long sentences against sex offenders and 
of course gives the courts the authority they need to impose these 
long sentences.
<P>
	Bill C-55, in its present form, has received widespread support 
from victims rights groups, from prosecutors and from the police 
community. Many of the witnesses before the standing committee 
said that Bill C-55 is a major improvement.
<P>
	What the amendments which the hon. member proposed try to 
do is expand the dangerous offender and long term offender 
procedures, but they do so in a simplistic way and in a way which 
would distort these carefully crafted measures and potentially 
lessen their impact.
<P>
	Let me give an example. One of the amendments would 
postpone the initial parole review of a dangerous offender until 15 
years into the sentence. Bill C-55 sets the date at seven years. The 
current law is three years. In other words, the government has 
found a middle ground between the Reform Party amendment and 
the status quo. There is good reason for this.
<P>
	The Supreme Court of Canada has ruled that a parole review is 
especially important when we lock someone up for an 
indeterminate period. What is a reasonable period to make the 
offender wait before the initial parole review? In fact, no one gets 
out after only three years. Not very many get parole after seven 
years either. This is comparable to the waiting period for parole 
eligibility of sentences for very serious violent offences. That is 
why the government chose to set parole ineligibility at seven years.
<P>
	The courts would not allow a waiting period of 15 years. It 
would be struck down as conflicting with the charter of rights.
<P>
	Let us examine another of the proposed amendments. It proposes 
that an offender convicted of a second serious personal injury 
offence or perhaps even a broader list of offences would 
automatically be found to be a long term offender, without any 
special application being made. In other words, it would be two 
strikes and you are automatically out.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9705"> 9705 </A></B>
<P>
	The Reform Party has taken the well designed, long term 
offender procedure in Bill C-55 and undermined the entire 
structure of this measure in an effort to get its cherished two 
strikes and you are out law on the books.
<P>
	Let us spend a moment on the long term offender concept so that 
we can all understand the importance of this amendment. First, the 
idea came from a report by a federal-provincial task force on high 
risk offenders which federal and provincial justice ministers 
endorsed. The long term offender concept is a way to get at serious 
repeat sex offenders. It allows the court to add up to ten years of 
intensive supervision to the sentences of sex offenders. Moreover, 
if the crown does not get them with a dangerous offender 
application, it would probably succeed in getting a long term 
offender designation. Indeed, Bill C-55 gives us a double barrelled 
weapon against sex offenders.
<P>
	The long term offender concept has also been seen as involving a 
special process, a special application, a thorough assessment of risk 
and an intensive hearing that goes beyond the normal sentence 
hearing. We need this special process partly because there is the 
prospect of locking this offender up for a very long time.
<P>
	We also need to have a detailed assessment of risk. The long 
term offender rules allow a 60 day assessment by a range of 
experts. We need to have this special hearing so that the pattern of 
offending can come out in court and so that the extent of the 
offender's criminality can become fully evident.
<P>
<B>(1030)</B>
<P>
	The amendment in question does violence to the very nature of 
long term offender procedure by making everything automatic. 
Every offender would be subject to a long term offender 
designation without distinction. The pattern of past offending 
would not come out and the court would lack the information it 
needs to judge risk and impose the appropriate long term 
supervision period.
<P>
	An automatic long term offender finding is so unselective as to 
be arbitrary in its use. It would encounter serious charter problems. 
The long term offender procedure as set out in Bill C-55 is 
structured to work hand in glove with the dangerous offender 
option.
<P>
	If the criminal is not found to be a dangerous offender, in many 
cases he can easily be designated a long term offender in the 
alternative. I prefer a double barrelled effective option to the 
Reform's scatter gun ineffective approach.
<P>
	Let us call the proposed amendment the son of Bill C-254. It 
would allow a dangerous offender application to be brought at any 
time during the sentence of an offender. This is very close to a 
recent private member's bill by the member for Surrey-White 
Rock-South Langley. It was examined in parallel to Bill C-55 by 
the Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs.
<P>
	It is safe to say that Bill C-254 received absolutely no support 
from the two dozen witnesses who appeared before the committee. 
Unlike Bill C-55 it was defeated in committee for very good 
reason, I might add. Allowing a dangerous offender application to 
be brought years after the offender has been sentenced is 
unconstitutional.
<P>
	Bill C-55 creates a six-month window of opportunity beyond 
sentence whereby the crown, having given notice to the convicted 
person, can reserve the right to seek a dangerous offender ruling 
within a few months of conviction. It can only do this when new 
evidence comes to light.
<P>
	By contrast, the Reform Party amendment would wreak all kinds 
of unconstitutional havoc. Offenders would be sitting around for 
years wondering if the dangerous offender application might be 
brought against them, even though according to the charter of 
rights everyone has the right to know what the penalty will be for 
the crime.
<P>
	The courts will not allow the criminal justice system to 
resentence offenders for the same conduct. The four amendments 
are not helpful. Together they seek to widen the net of dangerous 
and long term offender measures and in so doing weaken both.
<P>
	If implemented, the amendments would catch small fish in the 
net and lessen our ability and our resources to deal with the most 
serious offenders. The government has taken an extensive and 
profound amount of time to get Bill C-55 right. I wish the Reform 
Party had done the same.
<P>
	It is very typical of Reformers to bring forward amendments to 
legislation, to promote legislation in public which has no hope of 
meeting the tests of constitutionality. If they brought forward the 
amendments they talk about, there would be serious violent 
offenders and serious sexual offenders taking advantage of 
unconstitutional laws and wasting court time. There would be no 
effective measures to use against them in the end.
<P>
	In contrast, the government is bringing forward measures that 
are effective, enforceable and constitutional as another part of the 
package to ensure safe homes and safe streets.
<P>
	As has been said on many occasions, the government has acted 
forthrightly and sternly to bring forward amendments to the 
Criminal Code. More amendments or more changes to toughen up 
the criminal law have brought than in the history of the nation in 
the last 3.5 years.
<P>
	We have seen the results. A reduction in the crime rate is one. It 
is also a result of taking a broad based approach to social justice 
and jobs, in addition to measures in the criminal law to bring about 
a decreased crime rate.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9706"> 9706 </A></B>
<P>
	I urge the Reform Party to look at the results and to promote 
laws that are constitutional.

<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank 
you for allowing me to speak at report stage of Bill C-55.
<P>
	The members for Prince-Albert-Churchill River and Calgary 
Northeast have raised interesting arguments. We will be looking 
primarily at Motion No. 3, which warrants particular attention, 
because it aims at amending section 753.1 of the Criminal Code, 
and more specifically subsection 2.
<P>
	The section concerns applications for declarations of long term 
offenders, that is, people presenting risks. I do not think that, in its 
bill as presently worded, the government goes far enough when it 
sets the criteria the court is to decide on to determine the risk of an 
individual's reoffending.
<P>
	Thus the government says that the court shall be satisfied that 
there is a substantial risk that the offender will reoffend, if:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-the offender has been convicted of an offence under section 151 (sexual 
interference), 152 (invitation to sexual touching), or 153 (sexual exploitation), 
subsection 173(2) (exposure) or section 271 (sexual assault), 272 (sexual assault 
with a weapon) or 273 (aggravated sexual assault)-</BLOCKQUOTE>
or has:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-engaged in serious conduct of a sexual nature in the commission of another 
offence of which the offender has been convicted.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I consider the bill falls particularly short where it says ``engaged 
in serious conduct of a sexual nature''. I think the terms should be 
clarified. In this regard, Motion No. 3 before us goes a lot further, 
because it defines in large part and limits the entire notion of the 
conduct of a sexual nature the court may consider serious.
<P>
	Thus Motion No. 3 would oblige the court to consider the 
behaviour of a sexual offender serious when the person has been 
convicted of an offence under
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-section 151 (sexual interference), 152 (invitation to sexual touching) or 153 
(sexual exploitation), subsection 173(2) (exposure) or section 271 (sexual assault), 
272 (sexual assault with a weapon) or 273 (aggravated sexual assault).</BLOCKQUOTE>
or has been found guilty of
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a.1)-an offence under subsection 160(3) (bestiality in presence of or by child), 
section 170 (parent or guardian procuring sexual activity), 171 (householder 
permitting sexual activity by child), or 172 (corrupting children), subsection 212(2) 
(living of the avails of prostitution by a child) or 212(4) (obtaining sexual services of 
a child).</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a.2) an offence involving a person under the age of eighteen years under section 
155 (incest) or 159 (anal intercourse) or subsections 160(1) and (2) bestiality and 
compelling bestiality).</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a.3) an offence involving a person under the age of eighteen years under section 
144 (rape), 145 (attempt to commit rape), 149 (indecent assault on female) or 156 
(indecent assault on male)-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	At the end is added, and that the person: ``has engaged in serious 
conduct of a sexual nature in the commission of another offence of 
which the offender has been convicted''.
<P>
	So, as we can see, the list proposed in Motion No. 3 is much 
more comprehensive than what constitutes a serious offence of a 
sexual nature, since the list is not limited to the three or four 
offences identified in Bill C-55 at the moment.
<P>
<B>(1040)</B>
<P>
	Committing bestiality or compelling children to do so seems to 
me to be extremely serious conduct of which the court must take 
account, and the present wording could allow an argument to the 
effect that it was not so serious, since it is not so described in the 
bill's proposed wording of section 753.1.
<P>
	The official opposition and I feel that Motion No. 3 greatly 
improves the guidelines that will be used by the courts to determine 
whether a person is an offender requiring supervision. In this sense, 
we must strive for precision in our criminal law, in our Criminal 
Code, in order to ensure uniform application of the law throughout 
Canada.
<P>
	We do not have the time to wait for the Supreme Court to rule, in 
five, six, seven, eight or ten years' time, that such delinquent 
sexual conduct is highly unacceptable conduct that should 
normally be taken into account by a lower court.
<P>
	We can determine right here in the House of Commons, the ideal 
forum in which to do so, what we consider to be serious delinquent 
conduct of a sexual nature that must be taken into account by the 
court. We can do this here, without leaving it up to the courts to 
decide, as the present wording of section 753.1 would have us do. 
The definitions of delinquent sexual conduct, as proposed by the 
hon. member for Calgary Northeast, are therefore a step in the right 
direction for counsel and also for the courts called upon to enforce 
these provisions following royal assent and passage of this bill. The 
official opposition will therefore be voting in favour of MotionNo. 3.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley, 
Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it gives me some pleasure to speak to Bill C-55, 
although I feel the government's response to dangerous offender 
legislation falls far short of what it should be.
<P>
	In my 3.5 years in this place I have concentrated a great deal of 
my time and energy in looking at dangerous offender legislation, its 
shortcomings, and ways we could  improve upon it. I introduced a 
private member's bill to the House in the first session in April 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9707"> 9707 </A></B>
<P>
1994. It passed unanimously at second reading and then was buried 
in committee by the Liberal government for over two years before 
it was dealt with when Bill C-55 came into play.
<P>
	The hon. member for Prince Albert-Churchill River made 
some inaccurate statements in the House earlier when he said that 
none of the witnesses at the committee studying both Bill C-55 and 
Bill C-254, my private member's bill, supported my bill. He is 
correct in that the Liberal members of the committee did not 
support any element of it. They completely gutted it and refused to 
bring it back into the House for consideration.
<P>
	There were witnesses that did support it. I would like to give 
representation from the committee that studied the two bills. I 
quote Chief Julien Fantino of the London Police Force who said 
that Bill C-55 and Bill C-254 were a significant steps in the right 
direction and that high risk offenders must be differentiated from 
the rest of the inmate population and handled accordingly.
<P>
	He went on to say:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>If a person is deemed to be so high risk, so dangerous and so likely to reoffend, I 
quite agree there ought to be some state imposed controls and conditions, some 
governance of such an individual, to the point where communities are absolutely 
guaranteed that person will not constitute a risk to anyone.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I will share some evidence from Professor Hart and Professor 
Hare from Simon Fraser University and the University of British 
Columbia who are experts on violent offenders. These men have 
spent their careers studying dangerous offenders and psychopaths. I 
will share some of the comments of Professor Hare to the 
committee. He stated: ``The evidence was very strong that the 
psychopathic offenders in fact did not follow the pre-release plans. 
They did not follow the rules and regulations of the program. They 
were violating them all the time''.
<P>
<B>(1045)</B>
<P>
	Professor Hart went on to say: ``-psychopaths commit 
significantly more violence overall, but they actually commit very 
different kinds of violent offences as well-psychopaths tend to 
make decisions quite quickly to commit violent crimes that are 
instrumental for economic gain or other reasons. It's not simply a 
result of strong emotional arousal or things like that-you find they 
are actually much more violent and violent in a different way''.
<P>
	Professor Hare goes on to say: ``Their violence is predatory, 
planned, premeditated, dispassionate and cold-blooded when 
compared with the intense emotional arousal that often leads to a 
violent act for the rest of the offenders''. They are speaking about 
the 15 to 20 per cent of the population that can easily be assessed as 
psychopaths.
<P>
	I want to go on to what the victims of violence groups have to 
say. Mr. Sullivan stated: ``It is unfortunate that the committee 
could not have dealt with the bill sooner,'' speaking of Bill C-254. 
``It would have been very valuable had the committee dealt with 
that two years ago rather than waiting for Bill C-55-Bill C-254 is 
not whether or not it is a good idea. I hope we can all agree that it is 
a good idea. Strictly on a public safety platform this bill would save 
lives. Make no doubt about it, this bill would save lives''. He is not 
talking about Bill C-55. He is talking about my private member's 
bill C-254.
<P>
	He goes on to talk about the charter. He talks about who the 
charter is protecting, the victims or the offenders and took very 
great exception to the argument that Bill C-254 would not survive a 
charter challenge.
<P>
	It was very clear from the testimony of many of the witnesses 
that they fully supported an attempt by this government or any 
other government to identify-and they can be easily 
identified-those 15 to 20 per cent high risk offenders who do not 
respond to treatment, who are not likely to be able to go back into 
society and lead meaningful lives. One of the experts in these 
matters said that you can detect with the same accuracy a 
psychopath as you can that treatment for a heart condition is going 
to relieve angina pain. I would suggest that heart patients are not 
going to refuse treatment, the angioplasty or whatever, if the high 
percentage of them know that it is going to help them.
<P>
	The witnesses supported this government or another government 
taking a much stronger stand in keeping dangerous offenders, the 
15 to 20 per cent who are a high risk of reoffending, off the streets; 
not long term offenders, not giving them an extra six months after 
the time of sentencing, but when they are identified right up to the 
last year of being released from prison, of being designated or of 
allowing the system to keep those high risk offenders off the street 
to protect our society from people who have been tested and who 
have been selected as individuals who cannot be treated, who 
cannot be trusted to not reoffend.
<P>
	When questioned by the committee on how reliable was the test 
and when can we start using it, we were told that it is very easy. The 
success rate for juveniles age 13 and 14 is just as great as it is with 
adults. The testimony of the expert witnesses suggested that you 
have a much greater chance for treatment of a juvenile who has 
been assessed than you do with an adult and that rather than 
wasting the resources on trying to change the behaviour of an adult, 
where you are not going to succeed, those resources should be 
placed where they can do the most good.
<P>
	There is no question in my mind that the government, as with 
many other pieces of legislation, has taken the easy road. The 
legislation is not prepared to do what it should to protect society.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9708"> 9708 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1050)</B>
<P>
	The government is fooling itself when it claims to be making all 
these substantive changes in the justice field, for example, in the 
Young Offenders Act and the areas of sentencing and high risk 
offenders. It is fooling itself if it thinks those changes will make a 
meaningful difference in society.
<P>
	In the next few weeks and months people will have to make a 
decision. They will have to decide whether the government's weak 
approach to all these issues is what they want or whether they want 
a government that is solely committed to the protection of society. 
Unless I am naive, I thought that was what government was all 
about. I thought government was governing for the people, that it 
would make sure the majority of the people in society were being 
cared for and provided for and that their protection was being 
guaranteed to them.
<P>
	I did not come to this place thinking we were here to make sure a 
few people were going to get preferential treatment, that the 
offenders were going to get better treatment than the victims, that 
high risk offenders were going to be put back out on the streets to 
reoffend, to cause more grief and heartache for innocent victims in 
society. I assure the House that is not why I came here. That is not 
why I have spent three and a half years trying to get the government 
to understand the concerns of Canadians.
<P>
	Canadians want somebody to be concerned about them. They 
want a government that will look after them, their wives, their 
children, their families, not the 15 per cent to 20 per cent high risk 
offenders who have committed violent, vicious acts, sometimes 
murder, sometimes not. The emphasis of government should be on 
the protection of society.
<P>
	This legislation needs to be amended. If the amendments we are 
presently dealing with at report stage will help in any way to add 
some weight and protection to society, then members should 
consider them. The government had an opportunity three years ago 
this month to deal with this issue but it chose to sit on it for over 
two years before it brought in other legislation. It did this in order 
to take credit for being concerned about the needs and the 
protection of society.
<P>
	This is a joke, the government is a joke and the people will have 
a chance to change that in the next coming months.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to participate in the debate this morning on Bill C-55 which 
deals with high risk offenders. In preparing to do so I was struck 
with the fact that if we had tougher laws and if we had dealt more 
seriously with violent offenders earlier, many of them would not be 
in the position they are in today.
<P>
	While Bill C-55 has some improvements, it is really a 
half-hearted response to the demands of the Canadian  people for 
tougher action on criminals. When I hear the response of the 
government about its concern for legislation that will pass the 
charter, it is saying there is more concern in that area than there is 
for the safety of Canadians.
<P>
	I know the government has to be aware of the consequences of 
any legislation but nevertheless the message that is going out is that 
it is giving the benefit of the doubt to criminals rather than to 
law-abiding citizens. That is the environment or the thinking that is 
evident on the other side when it is preparing legislation to deal 
with changes to the criminal justice system.
<P>
	This is a major concern of Canadians. Next to unemployment, 
Canadians are concerned about safety in their homes, in their 
streets and in their communities.
<P>
<B>(1055)</B>
<P>
	I recall in my home city of Barrie during the 1993 election 
campaign that three residents in my community were murdered. 
The impact that it had back then was very significant. As a matter 
of fact, an accused is now just being brought to trial. That 
reinforced the fear that exists not only in my community but all 
across Ontario and Canada for the safety of law-abiding citizens.
<P>
	The government is failing in what is a major responsibility to our 
people, that of protecting the life and property of law-abiding 
citizens. Should these citizens ever become victims they discover 
to their horror that they are failed again. They discover the 
difference between their rights and the victim's rights. I applaud 
my colleague from Fraser Valley West who has put forward his 
private member's bill dealing with the rights of victims, something 
that is long overdue.
<P>
	Earlier I said that this bill was a half-hearted response by the 
government to deal severely with violent offenders. If we want to 
look at a half-hearted response I do not think there is any better 
example than Bill C-45. It dealt with violent people in our 
communities. The lack of commitment to deal with violence is 
shown in that bill, which is really the bill that introduced two-tier 
killers. If you are convicted of first degree murder of one person 
you are eligible for parole but if you kill more than one person you 
are not. That is not what Canadians are looking for. If you take a 
life, whether it is one life or more, you should do your full sentence 
of 25 years.
<P>
	It raises the question: Who do we work for? Are we here in the 
House of Commons to represent our voters? Reformers are. We are 
here to represent our voters. We ask our voters questions and we 
listen to what our voters say.
<P>
	I want to share the voice of my riding of Simcoe Centre. I want 
to share the responses to the householders I have sent out with 
questionnaires dealing specifically with the criminal justice 
system. The first was a survey dealing with section 745 of the 
Criminal Code, the faint hope clause. I did this survey in the spring 
of 1995.  Section 745 of the Criminal Code allows convicted first 
degree murderers to apply for early release after serving only 15 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9709"> 9709 </A></B>
<P>
years of their life sentence. I asked: Do you believe this section 
should be eliminated? Of the 1,645 who responded, 85 per cent said 
yes it should be removed, 9 per cent said no and 6 per cent were 
undecided.
<P>
	On the question of capital punishment, in the fall of 1995 I 
asked: Do you support the holding of a binding national 
referendum on capital punishment? From almost 1,600 
respondents, 78 per cent said yes, 15 per cent said no and 7 per cent 
were undecided.
<P>
	In the spring of 1995 I asked my constituents about Bill C-68 and 
gun control. I asked: Where should the primary emphasis in new 
legislation be placed? The use of firearms in criminal acts and 
firearms smuggling or additional restrictions on legal gun owners? 
Of the responses to that survey 87 per cent said that the primary 
emphasis should be on firearms used in criminal acts and firearms 
smuggling and only 4 per cent said there should be additional 
restrictions on legal gun owners. There were 1,645 responses to 
that survey.
<P>
<B>(1100)</B>
<P>
	The last question dealing with criminal justice was on the Young 
Offenders Act. That was in the fall of 1994. The question I asked 
was: ``Do you believe the Young Offenders Act should be changed 
to ensure more adequate punishment of young offenders?'' There 
were 2,200 responses to that survey. Ninety-seven per cent said 
yes, 2 per cent said no, and 1 per cent was undecided.
<P>
	The responses to the four questions I just outlined clearly 
demonstrate the constituents of the riding of Simcoe Centre want 
us to get tougher with criminals, particularly violent criminals in 
society.
<P>
	Let us take a look at each of the issues and the overwhelming 
support that is evident in my riding. Section 745 is the faint hope 
clause dealing with first degree murderers. There was a murder in 
my riding. A young father by the name of Kaplinski was murdered 
by Kinsella and Sales. I talked to the family. When we talk to the 
families of victims we understand how tragic it is when they have 
to relive the horror of the murder at a section 745 hearing.
<P>
	My riding is very much in tune with what Canadians from coast 
to coast want when it comes to capital punishment. I understand 
that 76 per cent of Canadians support capital punishment. In 
Simcoe Centre it is 78 per cent.
<P>
	With Bill C-55 Bernardo will still be eligible for a hearing.
<P>
	We had the gun control bill. The problem with the bill is that it 
gave us a false sense of security. Many in society think it is the 
answer to making their homes and streets safer, but it is not.
<P>
	Where are the government's priorities when it would spend up to 
$400 million for gun control to supposedly make society safer for 
women and only spend $4 million on breast cancer?
<P>
	Then we have the Young Offenders Act. The grandmother of 
Sylvain Leduc visited Ottawa last week. He was murdered by 
young offenders who showed no remorse. There was no apology. 
There will be no deterrent and these young people will go on to a 
life of crime.
<P>
	Whenever groups of school children from my riding visit Ottawa 
I meet with them. Many of these school children are victims of 
young offenders. I asked them for a show of hands on what they 
think about the changes we are proposing such as lowering the age 
and identifying the young offenders. The majority of them said we 
should be lowering the age and we should be identifying the violent 
young offenders in our communities. Even our young people feel 
that we should be getting tougher with young offenders.
<P>
	We would like to see Bill C-55 strengthened with two strikes and 
you are out. We do not believe violent offenders should have an 
unlimited ability to reoffend. We should be able to designate 
someone as a dangerous offender at any time during the sentence. 
We should not be restricted to a six-month period. We should 
broaden the definition of dangerous offenders to include 
pedophiles and sexual predators.
<P>
	Canadians will have an opportunity in a few weeks to voice their 
concerns about the government's lack of desire to deal in a serious 
way with what is a major problem for Canadians not just in my 
riding but right across Canada. They want violent offenders to be 
held responsible for their actions, particularly young offenders. If 
we dealt with them in a more responsible way they would not go on 
to a life of crime.
<P>
	Their day is coming. It is only weeks away. It will be a major 
issue in the election campaign. I am looking forward to Canadians 
voicing their support for the only party that has a platform to get 
tough with violent criminals.
<P>
<B>(1105)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
a pleasure to speak to Bill C-55.
<P>
	We heard a lot about dangerous offenders and some offences that 
should be included in the dangerous offender category. I will try to 
explain to the government the need to categorize and identify why 
certain offences should be under the dangerous offender category.
<P>
	Why is the public looking more and more to articulating why 
certain offences should be categorized and why there is a lack of 
trust the judiciary will actually call a spade a spade and give out a 
sentence in proportion to the crime committed? In doing so I will 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9710"> 9710 </A></B>
<P>
try to explain  why the judiciary is out of sync with society and why 
victims today have lost confidence.
<P>
	For instance, during the sentencing of a man who broke into his 
estranged wife's home while on probation, Judge Louis Matheson 
said that: ``I don't know whether it is your own fault or you happen 
to have a very sensitive mate who is easily rattled''. Twelve days 
later the man's girlfriend was shot to death and he was charged with 
her murder. I raise this story to try to show why the system of 
justice is out of sync with victims and those who may become 
victims and their expectations.
<P>
	During the sentencing of a man for sexual assault, Judge Louis 
Matheson said that if the victims had been women instead of girls 
he would have thrown it out of court. Can we imagine the logic 
behind that statement?
<P>
	Frederick Metcalfe of Oshawa was given a two-year less a day 
prison term followed by three years of probation for grabbing a 
three-year old boy and kicking him in the stomach in the house 
Metcalfe shared with the boy's mother, his girlfriend. The blows 
ruptured the boy's liver and pancreas. He also suffered permanent 
brain damage that crippled him physically and mentally. He cannot 
walk or talk and has lost vision in one eye.
<P>
	Although Metcalfe was charged with aggravated assault, Justice 
Sam Murphy was not convinced the brain damage the boy suffered 
that night resulted from the attack. After one doctor testified the 
boy could have suffered a brain aneurysm, Judge Murphy 
convicted Metcalfe of a lesser charge of assault causing bodily 
harm. He was given two years less a day for a savage attack on a 
child who is now crippled for life.
<P>
	These decisions in our courts are happening all the time. People 
are sick and tired of them. People are apprehensive that there will 
be real justice applied in a courtroom today.
<P>
	Some wonder why we are demanding in Bill C-55 that certain 
types of offences be included in the dangerous offender category. 
The reason is that we cannot any longer trust the decisions of those 
who should be making them.
<P>
	Not too long ago in 1989, to show how consistent things are 
because I can give some very recent situations, Douglas Schwartz 
raped and maimed a 7-year old girl very close to my riding. He 
raped her so savagely that her vagina had to be surgically 
reconstructed. As a result of an appeal in 1991, not so very long 
ago, Judge Allan McEachern reduced Schwartz's prison sentence 
for that attack from nine to five years because he said there was no 
evidence that Schwartz was either sexually deviant or a risk to the 
community. These are facts I am talking about here.
<P>
<B>(1110)</B>
<P>
	He concluded that Schwartz's thinking was impaired by drink 
when he assaulted the child. The magnitude of  the chief justice's 
error of judgment became apparent when Douglas Schwartz was 
found guilty in the Supreme Court of British Columbia of sexually 
assaulting a woman six months after his early release from jail. 
That is what we are talking about, yet the House wonders why we 
are asking for these kinds of offences to be included in dangerous 
offender status.
<P>
	They are not made up stories. They are errors in judgment. They 
are loopholes in the laws of the country. They are problems that can 
be resolved in the House of Commons, but they are not being 
resolved.
<P>
	The folks over there can say that Reformers are some kind of 
group of extremists.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fewchuk:</B> You belong to the cult.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> I hear the member. People 
who live in Ontario, Atlantic Canada and other places are getting 
ready to vote. I can assure Canadians that the members sitting here 
are very close to their communities. They see these kinds of 
situations day in and day out. These real horrors are happening 
without the government being accountable.
<P>
	I heard the Minister of Justice say in the House: ``This person 
just got a conditional sentence. I know he raped and tortured this 
young lady, but it is going to an appeal court''. I say: ``You 
spineless creature''. It is in appeal court because he did not have the 
courage of his convictions in the first place to exclude serious 
offences from conditional sentencing. That is the problem.
<P>
	We have debated this point until we are sick and tired of debating 
it. Now we are dealing with Bill C-55 and we are telling the 
government that included in the list of dangerous offences should 
be a whole bunch of other offences that have been left out.
<P>
	What will the government do when we have a repeat of the 
Darren Ursel situation in British Columbia, when these same kinds 
of offenders offend women? What will the government do when we 
stand here and tell it to look at what it has done? The government 
will say that it should have gone to appeal court, that it should be 
appealed, that more money should be given to the lawyers to appeal 
it.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> The member says: ``Hear, 
hear''. They agree with it.
<P>
	The government will say that we should leave the decisions with 
the judges of the land who are well known to make abysmal 
decisions in some cases.
<P>
<B>(1115)</B>
<P>
	I hear decisions like sexual assaults ``occur when the woman is 
drunk and has passed out, and the man comes along, sees a pair of 
hips and helps himself'' from a judge.

	This country cannot afford to have a government in place that 
does not have the courage of its convictions and will not legislate 
law. It cannot afford to have the judiciary-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am sorry, the member's time has 
expired.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
today we are debating yet another of the bills the justice minister is 
trying to rush through the House before an election call at the end 
of the month.
<P>
	Suddenly the justice minister has decided that he should look 
like he is doing something to give justice to Canadians. That is 
good. One wonders why it has to happen just before an election, 
before the justice minister is going to the voters.
<P>
	In any event, here we are debating the fourth or fifth justice bill 
that is supposed to go through the House in a very short period of 
time. Bill C-55 is an act to amend the Criminal Code with respect 
to high risk offenders.
<P>
	If there is a high risk that a criminal or an offender, if released 
back into society, will harm or violently reoffend, then this bill is 
supposed to protect society from that person by ensuring that he or 
she is not released back into society until no longer a high risk 
offender.
<P>
	The original Bill C-55 was not very effective in this, therefore 
the justice minister is trotting up once more to strengthen it. It 
would be good if he succeeded. Unfortunately, as usual, a timid 
half measure is being trotted out, is being aggressively sold and 
marketed as a substantial move forward to give Canadians the 
protection that our society needs and is not getting.
<P>
	It is up to Reform, as usual, to point out how misleading and how 
ineffective these measures are. It becomes a marketing battle where 
the Liberals and the justice minister say ``we sure got tough on 
crime, you are a lot safer with us''.
<P>
	It is up to the opposition to point out how ineffective and how 
unsubstantial these changes are that are being sold as the real 
goods. As a well known commercial says, where's the beef? There 
is precious little in so many of these measures.
<P>
	Yet if we do not support them, the minister then turns around and 
in a very politically crass way writes letters to the newspapers 
saying Reform has voted against his wonderful measures to protect 
people, failing to mention that these are not wonderful measures at 
all and do not deserve anybody's support at least not most 
Canadians'.
<P>
	Here we are with Bill C-55. It is very interesting because Bill 
C-55, as members know from some of the speeches and 
interventions of my colleagues, does not apply to a whole list of 
violent criminals and certain people who are dangerous to society.
<P>
	Specifically, it does not apply to those who prey on our children, 
who are sexual predators and who are pedophiles. This is a very 
interesting omission because it could so easily not have been an 
omission and because our debate on this bill follows very closely 
on the heels of our debate yesterday on Bill C-27.
<P>
<B>(1120 )</B>
<P>
	Bill C-27, as is so typical with Liberal bills, puts a lot of hearts 
and flowers into the preamble, which of course has no legal effect 
but always plays the violin as to how the Liberals are so concerned 
about the safety of Canadians. Then the measures that follow do 
little or nothing to really follow up substantively on that concern.
<P>
	In the preamble to Bill C-27 the first two paragraphs provide a 
general context and affirm Parliament's concern about violence 
against women and children in the areas addressed by the bill, 
acknowledging children's heightened vulnerability to and greater 
need for protection from exploitation and abuse.
<P>
	Paragraph 6 of the preamble recalls Canada's undertaking in 
ratifying the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child 
to protect children from and prevent their sexual exploitation and 
abuse.
<P>
	Paragraph 8 of the preamble expresses Parliament's wish in the 
interest of promoting the life, liberty and security of women and 
other victims of criminal harassment to strongly denounce that 
offence by strengthening the law in relation to it.
<P>
	Here we have some nice Liberal rhetoric about the need to 
protect children from sexual abuse and exploitation. What do we 
have the very next day? We have a bill concerning criminals who 
are known sexual predators, who are dangerous to the safety of our 
children, who could be kept indefinitely out of society to protect 
our children, and these people are totally missing from the list of 
offenders who can be designated dangerous offenders under Bill 
C-55.
<P>
	We have to ask why that would be when there is a lot lip service 
paid to protecting our children. In the very next bill that could 
protect our children from sexual predators and from people who are 
very likely to reoffend, and since we know that individuals falling 
into this category are a danger to our children, why on earth does 
Bill C-55 fail to ensure that these individuals can be kept out of 
society and protect our children from them? I have been told, and I 
am sure Liberal members and the Liberal justice minister know, 
that there is no known cure for pedophilia.
<P>
	Not only does the bill omit that category of offender, but we have 
introduced an amendment to correct this oversight. That is very 
kind of Reform, I would say. It is doing our job in a constructive 
way to make sure that the stated objectives of the Liberal justice 
minister and the Liberal government to protect society are actually 
carried out. We have done the responsible thing.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9712"> 9712 </A></B>
<P>
	I would like Canadians to watch very carefully when it comes 
time to vote on this amendment to include sexual predators and 
those who exploit our children in the list of people who can be 
kept indefinitely incarcerated under the dangerous offender 
provisions of Bill C-55. I am willing to bet that the Liberals will 
not put that in the bill. They will vote against the Reform 
amendment. But during the election they are going to play the 
violin and say ``boy, do we ever care about protecting children''. 
When push comes to shove and they could protect children, that 
is not in the bill and they will not even support an amendment 
to put it in.
<P>
	I get pretty tired of seeing letters like the one printed in the 
<I>Richmond News</I> on March 23 where the justice minister has the gall 
to say: ``We're really trying to protect this society but Reform 
won't support us''. I guess not with this kind of hypocrisy and 
nonsense.
<P>
	The hearts and flowers, the preamble, the nice stuff that is 
written at the beginning of these bills everyone would agree with. 
What Canadians need to do is look at the substance of these bills 
and see if there is any beef in them. Nine times out of ten there is 
none.
<P>
<B>(1125 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to take part in the debate on Bill C-55 and to speak 
specifically about the amendments we propose to bring this bill 
into line with reality.
<P>
	This bill has generated a lot of interest for people in my riding. 
One of the reasons for this interest is a couple was murdered at 
Valleyview 10 years ago by a fellow who is serving some time in 
one of the penitentiaries. He is due to be released by May 1. I want 
to use that case to illustrate how badly this Liberal government has 
handled the whole criminal justice issue. It will also illustrate how 
our amendments to Bill C-55 will help to correct some of that 
imbalance.
<P>
	In the last few weeks we have seen the justice minister 
scrambling to shore up support. He knows he will be in grave 
trouble during the next election campaign. The Liberal government 
is in grave trouble because it has mishandled the whole criminal 
justice issue during the past three and a half years of its mandate. 
This government should not be returned to office because it is not 
reflecting the concerns of Canadians.
<P>
	Let me give this example of what has been happening. The case 
of Rod Martineau is a classic example of what is going on all across 
the country. it clearly illustrates the effects of this bill and the 
importance of change. Rod Martineau is the 27-year old man who 
assisted in the murders of two Valleyview, Alberta residents, Les 
and Ann McLean, on February 6, 1985.
<P>
	On that day both he and Tremblay went to the McLean home 
with the intent to rob. Seventy-year old Les McLean was the only 
one home at the time. The men held him at gunpoint and waited for 
his wife Ann to  return home. Patrick Tremblay, Martineau's 
partner, then shot both of them in the back of the head. The very 
day this happened, Rod Martineau had just been released from a 
young offender facility in Grand Prairie. One of the case workers 
had driven out to Valleyview to be released.
<P>
	The two men murdered this couple because they were looking 
for some money from their business. Martineau was only 15 years 
old at the time. He had spent quite a bit of time in institutions. 
According to the son of Les and Ann, Rod Martineau could have 
fled the scene at any time of the impending crime while his partner 
perpetrated this crime. Instead he helped to hold the two people at 
gunpoint while he waited for the murder to take place, and he 
assisted.
<P>
	Martineau first appeared in youth court but was then transferred 
to adult court. He was subsequently charged with second degree 
murder but this conviction was overturned by the supreme court, 
another example of our Liberal justice system. He was then 
sentenced to six years in prison after pleading guilty to 
manslaughter, robbery with violence and possession of a weapon. 
He was considered violent and an escape risk.
<P>
	The son of the victims says that at no time has Martineau shown 
any remorse at all for his crimes. He has not accepted rehabilitation 
while serving his sentence, yet we are still letting him out on 
statutory release. I think he has had three releases to this point.
<P>
	He was to be released the first time after serving only two-thirds 
of his sentence. How is this possible? We have our current justice 
minister to thank for this. Bill C-41, which the justice minister 
introduced a short time ago in this Parliament, allows for six types 
of conditional release. Martineau, a convicted killer, qualifies 
under the statutory release portion. This is an automatic release. 
The parole board has no say in it. All it can do it set conditions and 
return the individual to the penitentiary if, and in this case when, 
the conditions are violated.
<P>
	As most people in the Peace River constituency expected, within 
a few short weeks of Martineau's being released under that 
statutory condition as given to him by the Minister of Justice, he 
was back in jail. That was no surprise. The correctional service 
says that half of all Canadian cons freed under the statutory release 
portion flunk out and are reincarcerated.
<P>
	Although 30 per cent are rearrested on technical violations such 
as drug charges and abuse of alcohol, a full 20 per cent of those 
who are out on statutory release commit new crimes. Yet a 
spokesman for Correctional Service of Canada said that all it can 
do is its best to make the transition to the community as smooth as 
possible for those who are let out on statutory release. The law is 
the law, after all. Who do we have to thank for that law? The 
current justice minister and his Liberal justice system which is 
failing Canadians. Canadians are  upset. They are angry. I hope 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9713"> 9713 </A></B>
<P>
they will make a strong case in the next election to correct this 
problem.
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
	Since the first statutory release Martineau has been released 
twice. After all, the poor guy has to have a chance to get back into 
society. Even though he has a drug problem, has never shown any 
remorse for his actions and has never accepted any rehabilitation, 
the poor man has to have a chance. On October 3, 1996 and on 
February 21, 1997 he was released. Both times he violated the 
conditions of his release almost immediately and was returned to 
the slammer within days.
<P>
	This man will be back on the streets on May 1. His sentence is 
up. He is the type of individual who should be held in prison 
because he is a danger to society. Although it is clear to the people 
working in the penitentiary that Martineau is likely to reoffend, he 
will be released. They have no say in it because the justice minister 
has converted his sentence to a conditional one and his time will be 
up.
<P>
	Given the lack of remorse and his drug problems, surely he 
would qualify if Bill C-55 was amended to reflect the concerns I 
have addressed. Specifically Bill C-55 should state that any 
individual who can be determined to be a danger to society should 
not only be assessed during the first six months of the sentence but 
at any time during the sentence. If there is any belief that convicted 
killers or persons who committed a serious crime can be 
rehabilitated, surely the assessment should take place near the end 
of their sentence, within the last six months.
<P>
	The current legislation states that we can only determine if a 
person is a dangerous offender within six months of sentencing. 
That does not make any sense. Our justice critic, the member for 
Calgary North, suggested an amendment to the legislation. As my 
colleagues who have spoken before me have stated, the chance of 
the Liberal government accepting an amendment to Bill C-55 to 
allow an assessment to be made at any time during a sentence is 
about nil.
<P>
	We have to wonder what is the motive. We have seen a lot of 
window dressing in the House on criminal justice issues. The gun 
control bill is a perfect example. Bill C-68 was modelled on the 
handgun registration system that has been in place since 1935. It is 
a poor model to use. We have more crimes being committed with 
handguns now than we had before in spite of the fact that there is a 
registration system. Now farmers, ranchers and other law-abiding 
people who use guns in a responsible manner will have to register 
their rifles and shotguns.
<P>
	Most people see the bill for what it is. It is window dressing, 
looking like something is being done about criminal justice. It is a 
disservice to Canadians who want some real action on law and 
order and a stronger criminal justice system. It does not mean 
harassing  farmers, ranchers and hunters. It means attacking the 
real problem with the criminals.
<P>
	On the other side the justice minister brought forward 
conditional sentencing in Bill C-41. He suggested that if people are 
to be designated violent offenders they can only be assessed during 
the first six months of their sentence.
<P>
	Does that make any sense? Does the government believe in 
rehabilitation? Obviously that is not the time to do the assessment. 
The assessment should be done at any time during the sentence. It 
would make more sense if it were done closer to the end of their 
sentence when we could see whether or not they were still a danger 
to society, have shown remorse for their action or have accepted 
rehabilitation. Things that make common sense do not seem to be 
the way the justice minister proceeds.
<P>

	Members opposite will have a chance to vote on the amendment 
of my colleague from Calgary Northeast on Bill C-55 which states:

	I challenge members opposite to vote for that amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak to Bill C-55. I congratulate my 
colleague from Calgary Northeast on the work he has done on this 
important issue.
<P>
	For 3.5 years members of my party have continually fought for 
the rights of Canadians to live in peace, free from being abused by 
criminals and free of criminal acts. The government has repeatedly 
watered down any solutions put forward. In the view of many 
Canadians and many members of the House it has not done the job 
it should have done in trying to protect Canadians. It should have 
made the protection of innocent civilians the number one priority 
of the justice department. The government continually pursues the 
theory that the most important aspect is the protection of the rights 
of criminals instead of the rights of innocent civilians.
<P>
	I will deal with a few issues in Bill C-55 and some of the things 
suggested by members of my party. One of the most egregious 
occurrences throughout the tenure of this Parliament is that 
criminals who have been proven to be dangerous to Canadians, 
pedophiles, sexual predators and people who simply cannot control 
their violent tendencies, go into the cycle of crime, punishment, 
incarceration and release. The real victims are Canadians who are 
subjected to their violence.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9714"> 9714 </A></B>
<P>
	I remember working in a jail some years ago. I was called to 
the jail one Sunday night to visit an individual who was to be 
released. I was the doctor on duty at that time. When I started 
to examine the individual he attacked me and the guards who were 
with me.
<P>
	When I looked at his rap sheet of violent behaviour that was 
longer than my arm. He had a psychiatric problem. It was not his 
fault. He was to be released into the public the following Monday. 
As sure as the sun rises in the east, he will commit another violent 
offence and hurt another innocent civilian.
<P>
	I spoke to the head of the jail. In my naivety I asked how an 
individual who both he and I knew would hurt somebody else could 
be released. His response was that it was the law and he could 
nothing about it.
<P>
	It is one of the reasons I am sure many of my colleagues and I 
got involved. We have seen examples of situations where patently 
violent people are being released into the public. A person who has 
committed a violent offence may have a psychiatric problem, may 
be paranoid or a paranoid schizophrenic and may need medication 
and an environment where he can be treated. It is not fair for him to 
be released. Certainly it is not fair to the public that will be 
subjected to his behaviour.
<P>
	Once again the government had three years of ideal opportunity 
to do something about the matter but it has done nothing. 
Furthermore it has done nothing to address the precursors to crime.
<P>
<B>(1140)</B>
<P>
	Another tragedy occurring throughout the country is the 
movement of psychiatric patients into the community at any cost. 
Some of them ought to be moved into the community and will 
function very well there. Some however do not.
<P>
	We need not look any further than at the streets in the downtown 
core of large urban centres to see many patients who are living in 
conditions of squalor and abuse because some bright light in some 
ivory tower decided they were better off in the community than in 
an environment where they can be taken care of, medicated and 
live safe and productive lives.
<P>
	A silent epidemic is occurring in our communities across the 
country. Unfortunately the government has again chosen not to 
work with its provincial counterparts to try to deal with the issue.
<P>
	All of us in this room know of individuals who have psychiatric 
problems. Some of them function very well in society but a small 
segment of them do not. It is high time we realized that some of 
them need to be in a care giver environment where they can be 
medicated appropriately and taken care of. This subgroup of 
individuals cannot take care of themselves. They do not deserve to 
be wandering around the streets, living in squalor and not being 
medicated.
<P>
	I put forward a private member's bill 2.5 years ago, the three 
strikes and you are out bill. It said that any individual who commits 
three violent offences should be put in jail. People who have 
demonstrated that they are a danger to society should be put in jail 
for 25 years. The government refused to make it votable and hence 
it died on the Order Paper.
<P>
	My colleague from Calgary North repeatedly fought for the 
same issue. Again it was stonewalled by the government. Why has 
it stonewalled the Reform Party? Why has it repeatedly 
stonewalled my colleagues from putting forth constructive, 
sensible solutions to keep individuals who are dangerous offenders, 
a harm to society and a harm to innocent civilians off the streets?
<P>
	My colleagues have made reasonable suggestions. They asked 
that the dangerous offender designation be expanded. I ask the 
public to listen to members of my party who wish to expand the 
designation. We wish to extend the dangerous offender designation 
to individuals who commit sexual interference crimes, people who 
obtain sexual services from a child, people who corrupt children, 
people who commit sexual exploitation of children and sexual acts 
against children under the age of 18 such as incest, sexual assault 
and sexual assault with a weapon.
<P>
	How could the government argue with a party that wants to 
protect children from being subjected to individuals who find it 
acceptable to rape children and commit sexual assaults on them?
<P>
	Furthermore my colleagues raised solutions that would make it 
an offence for anybody to commit rape, attempted rape or indecent 
assault on a male or female under the age of 18 years. They are not 
misdemeanours. They are serious offences and acts of violence. 
These solutions have been put forward by them in an attempt to 
protect innocent civilians from violent offences and assaults.
<P>
	Can we imagine a woman, a man, a child or a teenager being 
subjected to these offences? Can we imagine the people who 
committed the offences being free to go wherever they wish? Can 
we imagine the sheer, stark terror in their minds? They are 
innocent. They do not deserve to live like that. All members of the 
House have constituents who have written to them detailing very 
poignantly and passionately the fear in their lives after being 
subjected to these atrocities and what comes after. They are the 
victims who pay the penalty and will for decades to come. Most of 
them never, ever get over it.
<P>
<B>(1145)</B>
<P>
	With respect to the issue of prevention, the Minister of Health, 
the Minister of Human Resources Development and the Minister of 
Justice need to address the precursors to crime. There is a need to 
tap into some of the very good ideas in our country to address the 
precursors to crime. It does not involve counselling when a person 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9715"> 9715 </A></B>
<P>
is 20  or 30 years of age. It involves dealing with children at the 
ages of four and five and their families.
<P>
	Only by addressing family circumstances and some of the 
terrible violence, sexual abuse, neglect and assault that some 
children endure, will we be able to truly stop the growing tide of 
youth crime later on. Only by dealing with these children and their 
families will there ever be a possibility to stem the tide of crime, 
particularly violent crime in our society.
<P>
	In closing, we have laid down our gloves and have challenged 
the government. My colleagues have put forward constructive 
solutions. We now challenge the government to amend the bill to 
make it more fair and to protect Canadians from coast to coast.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Bill C-55 is an act to amend the Criminal Code regarding high risk 
offenders, to amend the Correctional and Conditional Release Act, 
the Criminal Records Act, the Prisons and Reformatories Act and 
the Department of the Solicitor General Act. It takes in a lot.
<P>
	I ask the question: Does the Reform Party believe in tightening 
up our laws concerning criminal justice? The answer is absolutely.
<P>
	Then the question comes from across the way: ``Then why does 
Reform not support specific bills such as C-55 which is before us 
today?'' The answer to that is because such bills are inadequate and 
the Minister of Justice will not listen adequately and make the 
changes that are needed.
<P>
	In fact, Minister Rock has gone on a bit of a counteroffensive-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I would ask all members not to refer to 
their colleagues by their surnames, but by their constituency or 
ministerial title.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ringma:</B> Mr. Speaker, we are talking about the Minister of 
Justice, who has launched a bit of a counterattack which really tries 
to finger Reform.
<P>
	He says in the excerpt which I will read from this column: 
``Rather than working constructively with the government, Reform 
has repeatedly voted against key government initiatives designed 
to protect victims rights''. The reason we do that is to try to get the 
Minister of Justice to bring forward legislation that is meaningful 
to Canadians as well as to criminals who we should be attacking.
<P>
	I guess the perfect rebuttal to the Minister of Justice has to come 
from some of the victims of crime. I have in front of me a statement 
from Gary Rosenfeldt, the parent of one of Clifford Olson's 
victims.
<P>
<B>(1150 )</B>
<P>
	Mr. Rosenfeldt writes:

<BLOCKQUOTE>The exact opposite is true. John Nunziata's bill to repeal section 745 passed 
second reading in the House in December, 1994, despite active opposition by the 
Liberal cabinet. I know, I was in the House that night and I watched the proceedings. 
The government then stalled the bill in committee and failed to introduce its own 
legislation until the last moment in June of 1996, immediately before the summer 
recess. The bill was not able to be passed because the government did not give it a 
high enough priority and thus required all party consent.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is what we are going through here over and over again with 
more and more legislation.
<P>
	Mr. Rosenfeldt goes on to say:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It is unconscionable to suggest that a government with a 50-seat majority should 
have to rely on the consent of the opposition to get its legislation passed. The bill 
failed to pass because the Government of Canada and its justice minister failed 
victims' families and all Canadians in its priorities. At that time, Mr. Rock tried to 
blame the Bloc. Today he tries to blame the Reform Party. If Mr. Rock is looking for 
responsibility for the Olson hearing proceeding, he need only look in the mirror. We 
are confident that all Canadians will remember that Clifford Olson's platform was 
built and maintained by the Liberal Party of Canada.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	We are going through the same thing on Bill C-55 as we went 
through on the legislation I just mentioned and even on legislation 
that is coming up. The Minister of Justice has failed to act in a 
timely manner.
<P>
	The Canadian Police Association has taken the unusual step of 
taking out a full page ad in yesterday's <I>Hill Times</I>, the paper of 
April 14. In it, the Canadian Police Association is taking issue with 
DNA legislation that the minister is perhaps going to bring 
forward.
<P>
	What they say in this full page ad open letter to all members of 
Parliament is that although they want this DNA legislation, and 
they want it as bad as the Reform Party wants it, they have 
reservations about it.
<P>
	They say: ``It is difficult for us as the association which has 
initially and vigorously promoted the need for an effective DNA 
data bank system to write to you now urging rejection of this bill as 
currently drafted''.
<P>
	No doubt, the Minister of Justice will counterattack the 
Canadian Police Association for doing this. However, the Canadian 
Police Association is talking, as the Reform Party is talking, 
saying: ``For goodness sakes, you have had three years and more to 
wrestle with these things. Why have you not put in the amendments 
that we and others have suggested?''
<P>
	The Canadian Police Association goes on to say: ``In the press 
conference held last week to introduce the bill, Justice Minister 
Rock reflected that it is important that we get the DNA data bank 
correct the first time. We  could not agree more. We think, all of us, 
especially Canadians and you as their elected representatives, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9716"> 9716 </A></B>
<P>
deserve better than what has been thrown together in these dying 
days before an election lest we suffer under it for years to come''.
<P>
<B>(1155 )</B>
<P>
	That association has put quite clearly what are the issues. The 
issues are inadequate legislation and the attitude of the Minister of 
Justice toward legislation that he proposes which is counter 
proposed by members in this House. I am afraid the minister has 
far too liberal a view of what we think is needed.
<P>
	Let us look quickly at the four motions that this party is 
proposing as amendments to Bill C-55. The first motion is an 
attempt to strengthen the bill, to make it effective legislation. Will 
the government listen? That is the question. Motion No. 1 proposed 
by the member for Calgary North would allow the crown the right 
to seek dangerous offender status for persons convicted of crimes 
causing serious personal injury at any time during that offender's 
penitentiary sentence. That is the nub of it. Bill C-55 as currently 
proposed is inadequate. Reformers are saying we should be able to 
seek dangerous offender status at any time during a sentence.
<P>
	The next motion that we have moved to amend Bill C-55 would, 
on conviction for two or more violent offences causing serious 
personal injury, would automatically make any offender a long 
term offender. It is easy to see why the Minister of Justice opposes 
that. It is a little too strong. It is a little too hard hitting.
<P>
	Motion No. 3 proposed by the Reform member for Calgary 
North amends certain things. We believe that this list of Criminal 
Code provisions does not go far enough in the legislation for the 
purpose of assigning long term offender status to certain criminals. 
This amendment would expand the list of offences used for 
designating criminals as long term offenders to include a wider 
variety of sexual offences, especially sex crimes against children. 
Surely we need tough legislation in those areas, but we are not 
getting it.
<P>
	The final amendment proposed by Reform is Motion No. 4. 
Under the current provisions of Bill C-55 there would be a review 
of indeterminate sentences after seven years of custody rather than 
three. That is going in the right direction. We propose that it would 
be after 15 years. I see my time is up.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Comox-Alberni, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
gives me great pleasure to speak on Bill C-55 dealing with high risk 
offenders.
<P>
	In a couple of words, this legislation is not enough. The 
categories need to be expanded. My colleagues have given 
numerous examples of the areas that need to be addressed.
<P>
	As my colleague mentioned earlier, it is the 15 to 20 per cent of 
high risk offenders, those who cannot be trusted not to reoffend, are 
the ones who need to be dealt with and are not dealt with in this bill.
<P>
	Once again we see the Liberals tinkering with the problem and 
not really addressing it. We have seen that in the three and half 
years that we have been in this House. I would like to go through a 
number of these bills and show where the government has played 
around on the edges and has not addressed the issue.
<P>
	I will start with Bill C-68, gun control. Canadians want crime 
control, not gun control. I have been a hunter for 25 years and I 
wonder why I am the target of the Liberal legislation when the 
criminals will not register their guns.
<P>
<B>(1200 )</B>
<P>
	In my mind it is very much a tax grab. It is a $100 million 
registration. It is more money into the coffers of this government 
and the bottom line is that it will not solve crime. We would have 
been behind Bill C-68 100 per cent if it solved crime but it does not 
do that.
<P>
	The government was very short in its thinking. About 25 per cent 
of Canadians are gun owners. These people have long memories. It 
is a rural versus an urban issue. It is not a party issue. As we saw 
when the government was voting, a number of government 
members who were largely from rural areas voted against this bill. 
They represented their constituents and they were punished. That is 
what happens to a Liberal member who votes for his constituents 
against poor legislation. Reform will repeal this bill because we 
want to deal with the crime aspects of guns, not implement a 
registration system that does not work.
<P>
	Another issue is victims rights. Over a year ago my colleague 
from Fraser Valley West brought the victims rights issue to this 
House. It was voted on and passed at second reading by this House 
and then it sat for over a year in committee. All of a sudden we are 
getting into an election, so what does this government do? It is 
trying to rush through the victims right issue which will not pass 
because there is not enough time. The government is trying to gain 
ownership on an issue. It must have done some polling and 
recognized that Canadians are fed up with a system that gives 
rights to the criminal that are over and above the rights of the 
victim.
<P>
	My colleague was just commenting on the issue of the DNA data 
bank. DNA is like a fingerprint. Every individual has a different 
DNA imprint. Whether it is a bit of saliva, a drop of blood, a hair or 
a drop of semen, the DNA imprint can be taken and placed in a data 
bank. The government is now bringing this through at the last hour 
knowing that it will not pass as full legislation. For the life of me I 
cannot understand why a tool like DNA testing is not at the top of 
the justice minister's agenda.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9717"> 9717 </A></B>
<P>
	Consider Bill C-41, conditional sentencing. My colleagues have 
brought up many examples to illustrate  that conditional sentencing 
simply does not work. They are letting people out on the streets 
who are reoffending. People are committing horrendous crimes and 
they are not spending a day in prison. The judges are letting them 
off. Conditional sentencing is not working.
<P>
	On section 745 of the Criminal Code two words sum up the 
Liberal justice program: Clifford Olson. The government had the 
opportunity with section 745 to keep Clifford Olson behind bars 
but it did not do that. In my mind the government is going to pay 
for that come election day. Canadians are sick and tired of seeing 
an individual who murdered at least 11 children playing and 
tinkering with the justice system. He is using it and hundreds of 
thousands of taxpayer dollars. He is laughing at each and every one 
of us, which is absolutely wrong.
<P>
	Reform would hold a binding national referendum on capital 
punishment. Let Canadians decide. This is far too important an 
issue for politicians. During the Mulroney era, 80 per cent of 
Canadians said that they wanted the return of capital punishment. 
What was the Tory answer? Canadians do not really know, they do 
not really understand the issue. The Tories would not bring it in. 
Let Canadians decide. Hold a binding national referendum on the 
return of capital punishment for first degree murder.
<P>
	This is a long list of legislation the government has brought in. 
The Young Offenders Act is another example of where the 
government has tinkered with the edges but has not dealt with the 
problem. There must be accountability in our youth. Young people 
who commit crimes must be accountable, as must their parents. 
That is not happening. Their names have to be disclosed. The 
community should know what these young people have done. They 
are laughing at the system. They know exactly how far they can go.
<P>
	My 17-year old son will tell me exactly what goes on in school. 
The kids sit and talk about it. They know where the limits are. The 
ones who want to break the law play the system.
<P>
<B>(1205)</B>
<P>
	The justice system is in a mess, from the Young Offenders Act to 
the judges to the parole system to plea bargaining. The government 
is not addressing the issue.
<P>
	Canadians are tired of seeing offenders walk free, victims being 
abused and a government that does not deal with this issues. These 
will be election issues. Gun control and the Young Offenders Act 
will come back. The government will have to account on election 
day for its poor performance.
<P>
	Bill C-55 concerns high risk offenders. It is another example of 
the government not going far enough. We need to go further.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Okanagan Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Bill C-55 deals with serious offences and the  consequences that 
should be the result of engaging in behaviour which can be 
described adequately by two adjectives, heinous and repulsive. We 
find these offences difficult to express and difficult to define.
<P>
	The proposals which have been made by my colleague would 
add at least ten to those which I am prepared to read into the record 
this morning. They have been listed, but I want to review briefly 
the things that are being discussed.
<P>
	Serious offences should include sexual exploitation of others, 
bestiality in the presence of children or insisting that a child 
commit bestiality, a parent or a guardian who procures sexual 
activity from a child, living off the prostitution of a child, obtaining 
sexual services from a child, incest, sexual assault, sexual assault 
with a weapon, threats to a third party or causing bodily harm, and 
rape.
<P>
	Any one of those is extremely serious. Not only are they a 
violation of the person, the consequences to the victim are 
automatic, immediate and very often permanent. Yes, the 
individual may learn to adjust. Yes, the individual may go on with 
their life. Yes, the individual may draw a line and say they will 
forget the incident and move on. Inevitably and invariably the 
victim of these kinds of behaviour says that it does not go away. 
The healing process which is essential in order to carry on normal 
activities and have a normal lifestyle is very difficult. Very often 
we do not deal with these offences with the sincerity and 
seriousness which which they ought to be dealt.
<P>
	There is a provision in clause 15 which gives me cause for grave 
concern: ``If the long term offender expresses the interest in being 
supervised in an aboriginal community, that community must 
receive notice of the supervision order and have the opportunity to 
propose a plan for the release and integration into the community''. 
That is a very good provision. However, it would appear to be an 
example of the Liberal government's decision to treat some 
Canadians differently than others and bring about inequality.
<P>
<B>(1210 )</B>
<P>
	Aboriginal communities will have the right to a notice of the 
release of a high risk offender into their community and the right to 
become involved in planning for their release. Other Canadians do 
not receive this notice or opportunity. That is a very difficult 
situation.
<P>
	We need to know that this kind of provision ought not to exist. 
The offender is as dangerous in one community as in any other 
community. The issue has to be laid to rest once and for all. We 
have enough distinction and separation among Canadians. The time 
has come to build a united country, a country in which individuals 
are equal, where provinces are equal and where we can look 
forward to equality before and under the law, before and under the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9718"> 9718 </A></B>
<P>
Constitution and under every piece of legislation in this country. 
Notwithstanding the comments  that are being made from across 
the way, every one of us should be equal and we should all be 
treated equally before and under the law.
<P>
	The time has come for us to recognize that we have to do that. I 
would suggest that the hon. member who is making some 
comments should check his facts to see that we do subscribe to and 
recognize the equality of individuals before and under the law. We 
need to be factual and honest in our situation.
<P>
	I want to go on to another thing here, victims. There are two 
kinds of victims. I talked about the first set of victims, the ones 
against whom rape is committed and against whom all kinds of 
influences are brought to bear. Those are the direct victims. There 
are indirect victims as well. These indirect victims are the families, 
associates and friends of the victims who suffered directly.
<P>
	The mother of a child who has been raped suffers seriously, not 
in the same way her daughter or her son did, but suffers 
nevertheless. We identify with our children and our partners. Mr. 
Speaker, I cannot imagine what kind of an impact it would have if 
your wife were raped. If the Minister of Justice would have that 
kind of experience in his family he would not treat this in quite the 
same way as it is being treated at the present time.
<P>
	Those are not the only indirect victims. The other set of indirect 
victims are members of society.
<P>
	Not too long ago Mindy Tran was killed in Kelowna. Still today 
young children on their way to kindergarten are saying to their 
parents ``mommy, should we not stop that person over there, she is 
walking alone?'' They are afraid. This young person who is going 
to kindergarten and who said this did not know Mindy Tran and the 
anguish and agony that was created in the family, but she did 
understand that there is danger out there. If that kind of danger is 
allowed to go on unhampered and unhindered by the kinds of things 
we do to serious offenders, we as a society are in trouble.
<P>
	There are the direct victims but there are also the indirect 
victims. There are some who would argue that this whole business 
of punishment really does not deter anyone. In a sense that is true. I 
remember having a bit of a discussion not too long with a young 
fellow who said that fines deter. He said when he drives he slows 
down when he sees a policeman. I said ``After you have passed the 
policeman you speed up again, right? Are you breaking the law? 
You broke the law before and you broke the law again after so you 
paid the fine. Have you sped since you last paid your fine?'' He 
said yes. Fines do not deter.
<P>
	In some cases where people are a threat to reoffend in a similar 
way, we have to make sure that society is protected to the degree 
possible so that the offence does not again take place in that 
society. Something has to be done that will protect the rest of us.
<P>
<B>(1215)</B>
<P>
	I want to go beyond this point and indicate that we need to get 
into the business of preventing crime in the first place. It starts at 
home with an individual sense of what is right and what is wrong. 
Actions begin with thoughts. If we think right we act right. If we 
think wrong we act wrong. If we do not have a good governor of 
what is right and what is wrong in our conscience we will do what 
is wrong.
<P>
	If we want to engender in our communities, our people or our 
citizens a sense of justice and fairness, we must also build in a clear 
understanding of what is right and what is wrong. That means 
strong families where values can be transferred from one 
generation to another and where the parents exemplify and 
demonstrate in their day to day operations how they can actually 
live in a just, fair and upright society.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have been listening to the debate all morning. It is 
passing strange that Reform members are the ones who seem to be 
concerned mainly with justice issues. It is very strange we are the 
only ones who are critiquing the bill. There are other opposition 
parties in the House. Why are they not addressing it?
<P>
	I attended the NDP national convention in Regina this week. It 
did not convert me. I am still a Reformer. In fact I am probably a 
much stronger Reformer than before I went there. It was interesting 
a party that claims to be a national party did not mention justice 
issues at its convention. Somehow they were forgotten. There was 
no mention of unity issue other than a mention that social programs 
would keep Quebec in Canada and democratic issues were not 
important to Canadians. I beg to differ.
<P>
	The NDP claims to be a grassroots party. It neglected the 
important element of making sure its constituents were 
represented. To omit that subject in a national convention was a 
gross oversight.
<P>
	Members of the NDP did not talk about the Young Offenders 
Act. In the province of Saskatchewan crime is a major problem. 
People will commit crimes, wreck vehicles, do all kinds of things 
and write on the windshield of vehicles: ``Thank God for the Young 
Offenders Act''. We have a huge problem. They openly hide behind 
the legislation. That should have been mentioned at the NDP 
convention.
<P>
	They forgot to talk about capital punishment, something that 80 
per cent of the people would like to see come back. Of all things 
they omitted discussion on gun control. I wonder why. I guess there 
is a big split between the national NDP and the provincial NDP on 
the issue so they do not want to talk about those things. The forgot 
to talk about consecutive sentencing.
<P>
	Many issues need to be discussed, but let me come to my 
primary point this morning. What is the primary purpose of 
government? We should be dealing with that  fundamental issue. 
Everyone in the House will agree the primary purpose of 
government is to provide for law and order in society, to protect 
citizens, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9719"> 9719 </A></B>
<P>
to protect the weak and vulnerable and to protect those at risk from 
the criminal element taking advantage of them. That is 
fundamental. That is foundational. That is what we should be 
doing.
<P>
	The purpose of government is to restrain evil within society so 
that we can continue to enjoy freedom, move about freely and 
pursue various things in our lives that we think are important. The 
government must provide for that and it is not happening the way it 
should. Bill C-55 is a very good example of a Liberal government 
half measure to control crime.
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	I have no illusions about the limits of government. To some 
extent we can pass the best laws in the country and it may not 
change people. We can pass laws. We can enforce them. We can 
control evil to some extent. However we cannot make people good.
<P>
	Reformers recognize the need for strong families in society to 
allow for the transmission of values, for cohesion and stability. 
Families are the basic building block. Without strong families all 
the best laws in the world will not do any good.
<P>
	That is why the third part of our election platform deals with that 
important aspect. We need that balance. Much of what government 
is doing is eroding the emphasis on the value of family in society. 
We need that.
<P>
	How important is the issue of justice? Let me give an example 
from my experience in my own town. My children have all 
attended the local high school. They describe to me what it is like 
to sit and listen to young offenders who return to school the next 
morning and boast about what they did the night before, the 
exploits for which they received no punishment. They mock the 
justice system. They laugh at it. They openly ridicule it.
<P>
	How serious is that? It affects good children in the school. 
People who respect the law and are trying to do their best begin to 
say that it does not matter what they do. They ask why they should 
try to do their best, study or do well at their jobs. They see justice 
not being enforced and the law being openly disregarded and 
mocked. That is why government has to do its job. That is why I am 
addressing this issue.
<P>
	Let us look at some of the problems. I have a whole series of 
articles on problems within the system that directly relate to Bill 
C-55, the half measure the Liberals are trying to push through in 
the dying moments of Parliament. It is a piece of legislation that 
needs to be fixed.
<P>
	One headline ``Deviant Justice: He raped, served his time and is 
coming to a neighbourhood near you''. Violent sexual offenders are 
being set free in society. No  wonder people are questioning what is 
going on. No wonder they are asking why the government does not 
do more to control crime? We need to do more. Bill C-55 is a half 
measure. Criminals still have more rights than their victims. That is 
a serious problem.
<P>
	I sat beside Marie King Forest during the parole hearings of 
Darrell Crook a couple of months ago. She could not understand 
why the justice minister allowed the man who had murdered her 
husband to continue to torture his victims by coming before a jury 
and appealing his sentence to reduce it to 15 years. She could not 
understand the pain and agony that the justice system puts the 
victims through. It is not acceptable.
<P>
<B>(1225 )</B>
<P>
	Mr. Crook was able to talk to the jury openly and to explain what 
a wonderful person he had become. The victims could not speak 
openly to the jury. What they had to say was censored. They had 
statements they wanted to read and those statements were 
censored. Why? It was because criminals have more rights than 
victims. Mrs. King Forest's son could not read his statement 
because the judge said it might influence the jury in its decision.
<P>
	For Heaven's sake why do we have these hearings? I cannot 
understand. There is something seriously wrong with our justice 
system when criminals have more rights than their victims. It tears 
my heart out to see the pain and agony the victims of murderers 
have to go through when they attend parole hearings and listen 
every couple of years. There is something seriously wrong and we 
need to correct it.
<P>
	Many more topics need to be dealt with. The fundamental 
problem is that government is not doing its job. It is not protecting 
the citizens. It is allowing violent rapists and murderers to be on the 
street. I hope at some point we address this matter further.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="ANACTTOAMENDCERTAINLAWSRELATINGTOFINANCIALINSTITUTIONS">AN ACT TO AMEND CERTAIN LAWS RELATING TO 
FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Raymond Chan (for the Minister of Finance, Lib.)</B> 
moved that Bill C-82, an act to amend certain laws relating to 
financial institutions, be read the third time and passed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to present 
Bill C-82 for third and final reading. The legislation before us has 
three main objectives: to strengthen protection for consumers of 
financial services, to ease the regulatory burden on financial 
institutions, and to fine tune certain provisions of the financial 
institutions statutes.
<P>
	This bill is the product of extensive consultations. We started our 
review of the financial institutions legislation in 1995 by 
consulting with a range of stakeholders, including consumer 
groups, industry representatives and other interested parties.
<P>
	In June 1996 we released a consultation paper entitled ``A 1997 
Review of Financial Sector Legislation Proposals for Changes''. 
The House of Commons Standing Committee on Finance and the 
Senate standing committee on banking, trade and commerce held 
hearings on this paper last fall. Their views and the views of other 
stakeholders are reflected in the measures in the bill before us 
today.
<P>
	Since we tabled Bill C-82 on February 14, we have received 
comments from interested parties imposing some modifications. In 
addition, the House of Commons finance committee has conducted 
a clause by clause study of the bill and passed amendments. As a 
result, there have been several modifications to the bill since 
second reading. They are largely technical, mostly helping to 
clarify the language contained in provisions. As a result  of the 
review, the legislation we have before us will ensure that the best 
interests of consumers in the financial sector are served.
<P>
	I would like to elaborate on key measures in the bill. I will begin 
with a subject of tremendous importance to all of us and that is 
consumer protection measures. There are several.
<P>
	First, consumers have made it clear they want better privacy 
protection in their dealings with financial institutions. Accordingly, 
the bill before us provides authority to require that financial 
institutions establish procedures governing the collection, 
retention, use and disclosure of customer information, implement 
complaints handling procedures and report annually on complaints. 
Once the legislation is passed, regulations will be introduced to 
implement these requirements.
<P>
	Following up on the recent federal-provincial agreement to 
harmonize the cost of credit disclosure regulations, the bill 
enhances the disclosure provisions of the financial institution 
statutes. As a result of these changes in similar amendments to 
provincial statutes, disclosure practices will be improved and made 
uniform throughout the country.
<P>
	Hon. members on all sides of the House are aware of the 
concerns about the potential for financial institutions to exert 
undue pressure on consumers when selling financial products. The 
government takes these concerns very seriously and is taking 
preventive action. Bill C-82 includes an amendment to the Bank 
Act to prohibit coercive tied selling. The government intends to 
bring the amendment into force on September 30, 1998. But before 
that date, the government wants to see two things achieved. First, it 
wants all financial institutions to adopt a policy on tied selling.
<P>
<B>(1320 )</B>
<P>
	Under the policy, financial institutions will be expected to ensure 
that their staff clearly understand and do not engage in 
unacceptable sales practices. The policy would seek to maintain 
high customer and staff awareness of procedures for reviewing tied 
selling complaints. These procedures must be transparent, timely 
and fair if they are to be effective. In the case of the major banks, 
they have internal ombudsmen, all of whom will deal with and 
report on tied selling complaints.
<P>
	Second, the government will be seeking guidance from the 
House finance committee. That committee has been asked to 
review tied selling concerns across the sector and the progress of 
financial institutions in addressing concerns through their policies. 
The committee will also consider how to differentiate between 
beneficial and anti-competitive forms of tied selling. The 
government has also asked the Senate banking committee to 
undertake a similar review of the tied selling matter. This process 
should enable the government to assess how the self-regulatory 
procedures have been working.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9732"> 9732 </A></B>
<P>
	In the consultation paper, the government resolved to work with 
financial institutions and consumer representatives to improve 
access to basic financial services for low income Canadians and 
information about fees for all Canadians.
<P>
	While the government is not proposing legislative changes in 
these areas, the major banks have made a number of commitments 
to address consumer concerns. For example, to improve access 
they have agreed to ensure that only two pieces of signed 
identification will be required to open accounts or cash cheques. 
This is decreased from the current requirement of three.
<P>
	Also, employment will not be a requirement for opening a bank 
account and staff will be trained to follow these policies and be 
sensitive to the needs of low income people. The banks will also 
ensure that clear and understandable information about products 
and services, including low cost banking options and ways of 
minimizing service fees, is readily available in publicly accessible 
areas in branches.
<P>
	Moreover, the banks are working with Industry Canada using 
Industry Canada's Internet site to provide information to help 
Canadians choose the right financial services for them, minimizing 
costs.
<P>
	During the consultation process we heard convincing testimony 
about regulatory burden. We want to act on what we heard. Bill 
C-82 contains important changes for foreign banks, changes that 
will lower costs and improve operational efficiency which will 
benefit many Canadians. In particular, regulated foreign banks 
which own a schedule II bank will no longer be required to hold 
other financial institution subsidiaries through a schedule II bank.
<P>
	The bill also proposes changes to ease regulatory requirements 
for near banks. Near banks are those entities which do not generally 
take deposits, that are not regulated as banks in their home 
jurisdiction, but do provide one or more banking type services.
<P>
	The approval requirement for near banks will be reduced. Once 
they receive an initial approval to enter the market, they will not 
need further approvals. The condition is that their unrelated 
activities not include taking retail deposits.
<P>
	In addition, the government plans to develop a new framework 
for the entry foreign banks, including a new branching regime. This 
regime will encourage new banks to enter the Canadian 
marketplace and allow existing foreign banks greater opportunity 
to compete. It should be noted, however, that this latter initiative 
will continue on a separate track from the legislation before us 
today.
<P>
	Until the new entry framework is developed, foreign companies 
offering a limited range of financial services and now operating 
unregulated in Canada as well as new entrants that meet certain 
criteria will be allowed to continue operations as unregulated 
financial institutions.
<P>
	Another element of the bill recognizes that banks are not all the 
same. Some do not need the retail deposit insurance offered by the 
CDIC. This is the case for banks which deal mostly in the 
wholesale market. The government will permit banks that do not 
take retail deposits to opt out of CDIC coverage, provided they are 
not affiliated with another CDIC member. This will reduce their 
costs and streamline regulatory requirements.
<P>
	The bill extends the in house powers of financial institutions. 
Currently financial institutions can engage in certain types of 
businesses only through subsidiaries. After reviewing the types of 
business that must be carried out through subsidiaries, the 
government has decided to permit financial institutions, with the 
approval of the Minister of Finance, to carry on both information 
processing and specialized financing activities in house. These 
changes will reduce the operating costs associated with those 
activities by promoting effective management. Furthermore, the 
increased flexibility for specialized financing activities will 
improve access to venture capital for Canadian small businesses.
<P>
	A number of changes are proposed to streamline the self-dealing 
regime. This regime implements control over transactions between 
financial institutions and persons who are in positions of influence 
over or control of the institution.
<P>
<B>(1325 )</B>
<P>
	While the government believes that the basic framework 
remains sound, certain provisions of the regime impose 
unnecessary costs. Bill C-82 therefore streamlines the operations 
but the conduct review committee narrows the range of related 
parties and allows subsidiaries of the federal financial institution to 
transact with each other.
<P>
	These are all important initiatives aimed to cut down regulatory 
burden. The initiative before us does not stop there. We are 
proposing to fine tune legislation.
<P>
	Changes have been introduced in the area of corporate 
governance to encourage financial institutions to adopt appropriate 
processes to manage risks. For instance, the duties of the audit 
committee will be clarified. The rights of policy holders of 
insurance companies will be enhanced. For example, the bill 
proposes to reduce the number of policy holders' signatures needed 
to allow for a proposal nominating directors to be circulated in 
advance of the meeting.
<P>
	Regulatory adjustments will be made to provide more flexibility 
to financial institutions seeking to enter into joint ventures. These 
adjustments will enhance the ability of financial institutions to 
make alliances, enter new markets and compete more effectively at 
home and abroad.
<P>
	The legislation also includes a number of amendments to 
enhance access to capital for mutual insurance  companies. First, 
such companies will be permitted to issue participating shares and 
second, flexibility will be added to the demutualization regime and 
it will be extended to apply to all mutual life companies, not just 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9733"> 9733 </A></B>
<P>
the small ones. It should be noted, however, that a large mutual 
insurance company will be required to remain widely held once it 
is converted into a stock company.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	A few days ago, the opposition raised the issue of transferring 
policies. This is an important issue and I would like to say a few 
words about it.
<P>
	A solution to this problem will require more studies and 
consultations. The mechanisms of supervision and the contractual 
rights of those insured must both be taken into account. 
Consultations are already under way between representatives of the 
federal government and of the Province of Quebec. Following 
these consultations with the provinces concerned, we will be able 
to arrive at a satisfactory solution in the near future.
<P>
	But I must add that Bill C-82 contains a great number of 
favourable measures. All major stakeholders and myself want to 
see this bill passed as quickly as possible.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	There you have it, Mr. Speaker, a pretty significant package of 
changes, important to the well-being of consumers of financial 
services and that is just about all of us. It is important to the 
financial sector and this too is significant for all of us because this 
vital sector underpins the whole economy.
<P>
	I urge the House to move quickly to pass this important 
legislation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is with some pleasure that I debate this bill at third 
reading. I am also very disappointed by the results of the vote held 
a few minutes ago in the House.
<P>
	Let us begin with the few positive notes to be found in Bill C-82. 
The official opposition is happy to have helped remove two 
important sectors from this revision of the financial institutions act.
<P>
	The first of these sectors is the sale of insurance through 
chartered banks. You will recall that about two years ago the banks 
asked the federal government, specifically the Minister of Finance 
and the secretary of state responsible for financial institutions, to 
allow insurance products to be sold by chartered banks, thus 
creating undue, not to say unfair, competition with insurance 
brokers and underwriters in Quebec and in Canada.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois fought very hard to have this provision 
dropped from the bill before us, and we won. It is, in our view, one 
of the great victories of the official  opposition and of the Bloc 
Quebecois since the beginning of this term of office.
<P>
	The second sector of Bill C-82 where there is some cause for 
satisfaction is the leasing sector.
<P>
<B>(1330)</B>
<P>
	Once again, the Canadian chartered banks claimed, a few years 
ago, to be accredited to offer car leasing arrangements to 
consumers. Car dealerships in Quebec, as in Canada, rose up in 
opposition to this. The Bloc Quebecois took up arms over this both 
in the House and in the finance committee on their behalf, and we 
won the day.
<P>
	Why did we share the dealers' opposition to the banks' offering 
car leasing? Purely and simply, because the dealerships did not 
have the guarantee of the financial institutions, nor of the federal 
government and the Minister of Finance, that the banks would be 
prevented from owning fleets of automobiles.
<P>
	The second major reason for our opposition, and that of the 
dealers of Quebec and Canada, was competition-related. Let me 
explain. The banks lend money to dealerships, and if they were also 
involved in selling car leasing services, the free play of 
competition would be somewhat distorted.
<P>
	The banks would have had a major lever for unfair competition 
with dealers; for instance, they could have cut back on their lines of 
credit. We had no guarantee on this, and that is why we did not 
hesitate in the least, right from the first weeks, to support the car 
dealerships in Quebec and in Canada that were calling for these 
guarantees, before the banks could be allowed to offer leasing. So 
those are the two good things about Bill C-82.
<P>
	On the down side, I have just referred to the vote taken in this 
House a few minutes ago at the report stage, when the three 
amendments proposed by the Bloc Quebecois were defeated by the 
Liberal majority-by the Reformers as well, but that is less 
important. The Liberal majority defeated our three amendments.
<P>
	And what were those amendments? The first one objected to a 
provision in Bill C-82 under which financial planning, which is 
strictly a provincial matter, will be regulated by federal legislation 
through the chartered banks.
<P>
	In other words, the banks may offer financial and financial 
planning services, which come under provincial jurisdiction, and 
those which offer these services will not be subject to Quebec law 
or Ontario law or any other provincial legislation. However, those 
which offer financial planning services through bank branches will 
be subject to federal legislation.
<P>
	This is the kind of intrusion we always felt was entirely 
unacceptable. In our amendment, which was defeated unanimously 
by the Liberals, we suggested a form of opting out.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9734"> 9734 </A></B>
<P>
	When provincial laws to that effect exist in a province, the 
provincial legislation applies to financial planning services offered 
through banks and other institutions. Where such legislation does 
not exist, the federal legislation applies.
<P>
	From the outset, the intent of our amendment was to provide for 
opting out, so that provincial jurisdictions would be respected. The 
Liberals turned down a reasonable proposal. They said no and 
preferred to add to the regulatory burden.
<P>
	From now on, in Quebec, Ontario and the other provinces, there 
will be not one legislation to regulate financial planning services 
but two. We have become accustomed to this tendency which, 
instead of removing or relieving the burden on the financial sector, 
favours adding more regulations, resources and all manner of 
things which, in the final instance, merely increase inefficiency and 
create uncertainty, which includes passing this kind of legislation 
and turning down reasonable amendments that allow for opting out 
in areas under the exclusive jurisdiction of the provinces.
<P>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
	The second amendment we proposed concerns tied selling, in 
other words, putting pressure on the consumer to buy services in 
addition to those he is seeking from a financial institution. In fact, 
the issue of tied selling comes under the Consumer Protection Act. 
The Consumer Protection Act is provincial and covers an area 
under provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	Once again, the Liberals preferred to drop our amendment which 
suggested opting out as a possibility where the provincial 
legislation provides adequate protection for the consumer.
<P>
	I think our colleagues opposite and this government generally do 
not know the meaning of exclusive. Exclusive jurisdiction means 
there is only one player, not two or three. Instead of abiding by the 
definition given in the dictionary, they prefer to add more 
bureaucracy. They go overboard on regulating, protecting and 
developing the system, wrapping it in the Canadian federalist flag.
<P>
	Federalism, according to members opposite, is supposed to be 
synonymous with greater efficiency, certainty and stable markets. 
When we talk about the financial sector, stability is important. 
Instead, in the past two years, and especially in the case of this bill, 
the government has proved the very opposite is true by trespassing 
on provincial jurisdictions and adding new levels of regulations.
<P>
	The federal regime is synonymous with overlap, inefficiency, 
duplication, over regulation, uncertainty and instability. So much 
so that the players in the financial sector-and, as finance critic for 
the past two years I have met people in the financial sector in both 
Quebec and Canada-do not know whether they are coming or 
going.  They sometimes wonder what sort of crazy world they are 
in, since everywhere else there are two watchwords: deregulation 
and performance.
<P>
	What we have seen in the financial sector for two years is over 
regulation, administrative sluggishness and reduced ability to 
compete among the businesses in the various sectors, including 
finance. Speaking of competition, and the competitive strength of 
businesses operating in the financial sector, this was the focus of 
our third amendment, which was roundly defeated by the 
government for no apparent reason.
<P>
	I have so much to say, and since you are giving me the time to 
say it, I must be able to get out my arguments. I was saying that 
there is a third amendment concerning competitiveness, the ability 
of a company operating in the financial sector to compete. Under 
Bill C-82 and federal legislation on insurance companies, which we 
thought this bill was amending, a provincially chartered insurance 
company cannot acquire either all or part of an insurance company 
that is federally chartered.
<P>
	I will give the example of Quebec, because we have a blatant 
example of companies being blocked from becoming fully 
competitive. A Quebec insurance company operating in the Quebec 
insurance market cannot acquire blocks of insurance policies from 
another company that is also operating in the Quebec market, if the 
latter company is federally chartered.
<P>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
	On the brink of the 21st century, when we should be talking 
about unrestricted competition, free markets and efficiency, this 
provision in Bill C-82, uncorrected in federal legislation on 
insurance companies, is incongruous to say the least. I would say it 
runs counter to the spirit of the North American Free Trade 
Agreement, which talks of unrestricted competition and economic 
and financial integration.
<P>
	It is also contrary to the spirit of the last treaty, in 1993, of the 
World Trade Organization, which already contained provisions to 
liberalize the financial sector internationally and which is 
continuing-starting a few days ago in Geneva-to talk about 
greater liberalization, a more permissive environment if you like, 
with respect to international financial transactions, regardless of 
their nature or the country of origin of businesses operating in the 
financial sector.
<P>
	We have here an obvious case of barriers that are not 
commensurable with the effective operation of the insurance 
market. It is something that is a bit strange and that has the effect of 
making it easier for foreign companies-French, Brazilian, 
German, Italian, Norwegian, Finnish, you name it-to buy 
operations, in whole or in part, from Canadian insurance 
companies, something that provincially chartered insurance 
companies in Quebec are not allowed to do. It is complete 
craziness.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9735"> 9735 </A></B>
<P>
	Like most branches of insurance companies operating in 
Canada, branches of foreign companies are federally chartered. 
Federal legislation therefore makes it easier for them to do 
business in Canada and in Quebec than for Quebec entrepreneurs. 
This state of affairs is quite simply unacceptable.
<P>
	I will take the example of L'Entraide. This is a company whose 
head office is located in Quebec City. It is average in size. It hopes 
to take advantage of the development of the insurance market and 
the great rationalization now taking place. It wants to grow and 
improve its performance and its presence, and it has the chance to 
do so by buying up a block of insurance policies from a federally 
chartered company, whose clientele is located entirely in Quebec, 
for $1.3 million.
<P>
	This may sound like a huge amount to taxpayers listening today, 
but in the field of insurance, where certain transactions run in the 
billions of dollars every week, it is not all that much. Compared to 
the transaction we saw last weekend in Les Affaires, this is not 
going to shake up the insurance sector. We will come back to the 
other acquisition I mentioned, which appeared in <I>Les Affaires.</I>
<P>
	So the insurance company L'Entraide, a Quebec company with a 
provincial charter, wants to acquire a block of $1.3 million of 
insurance in order to expand, to enhance its efficiency and 
competitiveness in the broadened North American and 
international markets. The federal government says it is not 
allowed to do so. It is not allowed to do so because it is a 
provincially chartered company, and a provincially chartered 
insurance company is not allowed to purchase, in whole or in part, 
the activities of a federally chartered insurance company. Even if 
this federally chartered company is involved in the Quebec market, 
has Quebec insurance policies, the provincially chartered company 
it is not entitled to acquire those $1.3 million in insurance blocks. 
That is utterly unacceptable. That is discrimination, pure and 
simple.
<P>
<B>(1345)</B>
<P>
	This is all the more discriminatory in that most insurance 
companies, which are Quebec subsidiaries of foreign companies, 
are federally chartered. The four major Canadian insurance 
companies, with head offices in Toronto, are federally chartered.
<P>
	So, by continuing this discrimination and rejecting the 
amendment we proposed at the report stage, the government is 
offering the insurance companies and subsidiaries of foreign 
companies an opportunity on a silver platter to expand in the 
Quebec and Canadian market, to increase their profits, and their 
shareholders' dividends, through policy holders in Quebec and 
Canada.
<P>
	Moreover, the four major Toronto-based federally chartered 
insurance companies are allowed to expand in Quebec by acquiring 
blocks of insurance, and they are  entitled to do so because of their 
federal charters. Yet a Quebec insurance company operating within 
Quebec cannot do the same. If being ridiculous were fatal, there 
would be no one alive on the other side of the House. It is a mental 
aberration to maintain such discriminatory treatment toward 
Quebec insurance companies.
<P>
	We heard all manner of things during the debate on continuation 
of this restriction. One of the arguments presented by the 
government-I was going to say the opposition, since they are the 
opposition as far as our amendment is concerned, you understand 
what I mean-one of the major arguments presented by the 
Minister of Finance, by the Secretary of State responsible for 
financial institutions, by the assistant to the Minister of Finance as 
well, was that consumer protection came first and foremost.
<P>
	Consumers would not be sufficiently protected if provincially 
chartered insurance companies were allowed to acquire blocks of 
insurance from federally chartered companies. They are more 
protected when the one acquiring such insurance holds a federal 
charter, even if it is a subsidiary of a foreign company with its head 
offices way off in God knows what country. In that case, the 
consumers are properly protected.
<P>
	On the other hand, if the acquiring company is a Quebec 
insurance company, regardless of how good the consumer 
protection is, no way. But the Minister of Finance, the secretary of 
state and senior officials go into a blue funk when you mention 
anything that would promote the expansion of the Quebec 
insurance sector.
<P>
	Whether they operate under a provincial or federal charter, 
insurance companies in Quebec must apply annually for a licence 
to the inspector general of financial institutions of Quebec. Every 
year, the inspector checks the solvency of all insurance companies 
operating on Quebec soil before issuing a licence that must be 
renewed every year. federal body.
<P>
	Second, the inspector general of financial institutions requires 
all insurance companies, under provincial or federal charter, to be 
members of the Société d'indemnisation d'assurance de personne, 
which is also involved in providing maximum protection for the 
consumer.
<P>
	When we have a situation like this where we are watertight as far 
as solvency is concerned, whether the charter is provincial or 
federal, and where plenty of checks and balances are provided by 
the inspector general of financial institutions and the Société 
d'indemnisation d'assurance de personne, using consumer 
protection as an argument no longer makes any sense.
<P>
	If that is the main objection, it no longer exists because whatever 
their charter and whether they operate in Quebec or Canada, 
insurance companies cannot be faulted on consumer protection.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9736"> 9736 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
	Consumers can depend on the system, and policy holders are 
protected on the Quebec market by the inspector general of 
financial institutions and within the Canadian context by the 
Société d'indemnisation des assurances de personne. So what is the 
problem? Why are they so reluctant to move? They are in such a 
funk that a golden opportunity was missed for a company like 
L'Entraide d'assurance-vie du Québec to acquire a block of 
insurance worth $1.3 million.
<P>
	They are so reluctant to move, although they have run out of 
arguments to prevent this kind of company from expanding, from 
becoming more efficient and a bigger player in a very competitive 
insurance market and even more so with the liberalization of the 
financial sector throughout the world.
<P>
	On the weekend, I read an article I mentioned earlier, in Les 
Affaires, which said that Royal Life Canada had acquired an 
interest in Gerling Global. For your information, Mr. Speaker, 
Royal Life is a branch of a British insurance company. Gerling 
Global, which sold the blocks of insurance, is a branch of a German 
company. On the weekend, these two branches of foreign 
companies operating on Canadian soil, both under a federal charter, 
concluded a transaction in which Royal Life acquired part of the 
life insurance portfolio of Gerling Global for $12 billion. Twelve 
billion dollars, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	Two companies, subsidiaries of foreign insurance companies, 
one British and the other German, were allowed to acquire a block, 
to carry out a transaction involving a transfer of $12 billion worth 
of insurance business. Federal legislation permitted this, but it does 
not permit Entraide, a Quebec insurance company, to buy a $1.3 
million block of insurance policies from a federally chartered 
Canadian company. That is ridiculous.
<P>
	On the other hand, we keep hearing that we must look out, that 
there are consumer protection problems. My eye, Mr. Speaker. On 
April 8, I wrote the Minister of Finance to remind him that there 
was a problem here. The Quebec minister of finance has also said 
there was a big problem in this area. I think the government's 
inertia is hiding something.
<P>
	It is not that this is a complex issue. It is straightforward. The 
government had only to accept our amendment today instead of 
rejecting it, and the matter would have been resolved. The problem 
is one of pure discrimination against Quebec insurance companies. 
It is so discriminatory that the Quebec minister of finance even 
offered to amend the Quebec law on trusts and savings companies, 
which discriminates to some extent against federally chartered 
trust companies. But he was turned down.
<P>
	Mr. Landry said he was prepared to amend the Quebec law on 
trust companies so long as the federal government were quick to do 
the same thing to legislation on financial institutions to enable 
provincially chartered insurance companies to acquire blocks of 
insurance from federally chartered companies. The Minister of 
Finance turned up his nose at this attractive proposal, made in the 
spirit of free trade and aspirations for the future of the financial 
sector in Quebec and Canada. He preferred to continue to 
discriminate against Quebec insurance companies.
<P>
<B>(1355)</B>
<P>
	Two questions arise: First, is this not a way of eliminating 
provincially chartered companies? Second, is this not a way for the 
federal government to say: ``It is true that insurance comes under 
the exclusive jurisdiction of the provinces, but we want to change 
that''.
<P>
	And the backhanded way to change things is perhaps to make it 
increasingly less profitable to have provincially chartered 
companies. Insurance companies will need federal charters in order 
to benefit from globalization, in order to achieve a more 
competitive position in the insurance market.
<P>
	Is that it? If so, let the federal government tell us they want to 
restrict us in a field that supposedly comes under our exclusive 
jurisdiction, according to the Canadian Constitution that the 
members opposite say they respect and that they ignore every day. 
If they want to take this field of jurisdiction away, let them come 
right out and say so, because that is what it looks like.
<P>
	But if that is not the case, what is behind this sullen attitude of 
the government and of the Minister of Finance toward an 
amendment that is and should have been logical, if the members 
opposite had indeed been logical?
<P>
	We think there is perhaps another explanation. I was speaking 
earlier about the four or five Toronto-based Canadian insurance 
companies that dominate the market. I would remind members that 
these companies all have federal charters. The top four companies 
are being left lots of room so that when another insurance company 
wants to cease operations they can buy up insurance policies and 
continue to grow, to make profits and to pay dividends to their 
shareholders, while our provincially chartered insurance 
companies in Quebec cannot do what they wish in their own market 
with respect to Quebec policy holders.
<P>
	We sometimes wonder if it is not these very companies, Canada 
Life, London Life, Sun Life Insurance Company of Canada and 
Manulife Financial, all great contributors to the coffers of your 
charming Liberal Party to the tune of $50,000-not bad as 
contributions go-that the government wants to help in future and 
for which it wishes to maintain privileges that  are unjustified and 
<P>

<B><A NAME="9737"> 9737 </A></B>
<P>
discriminate against Quebec's provincially chartered insurance 
companies.
<P>
	The opposition is sorely disappointed with the government's 
attitude on this matter, but is, in a way, pleased that the Minister of 
Finance has, at least, agreed to meet the key shareholder of 
L'Entraide, the official opposition critic-myself-and a 
representative of the Government of Quebec, next Thursday in his 
office for a discussion of this matter.
<P>
	It is most unfortunate, however, that our amendment, which 
would have settled this question for once and for all, has not been 
accepted. Our expectations of the meeting with the Minister of 
Finance this week, after the rejection of the official opposition 
amendment, encompass two possibilities.
<P>
	The first is that he will assure us that he will be prompt in 
introducing a private member's bill from his department to remedy 
the injustice and discrimination being experienced by Quebec 
insurance companies. The second is that he will announce that he 
will be shortly tabling a notice of a ways and means motion clearly 
setting out his intention to move quickly, when we are back after 
the coming election, to pass a bill amending Bill C-82, to ensure 
that this discrimination toward provincially chartered insurance 
companies no longer exists, as it does in the current legislation on 
insurance and the current bill.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My dear colleague, it being nearly 2 p.m., I 
wonder if you would consider resuming your speech after oral 
question period, when you would again have the floor.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> I was just winding up, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Very well. You have about 15 seconds.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier: </B>Mr. Speaker, I was saying that it is a sad thing to 
have to face the music, but I hope that the government will listen to 
common sense and that, starting Thursday, provincially chartered 
insurance companies will be allowed to do exactly the same as 
other insurance companies, that is to have a certain latitude in their 
areas of jurisdiction and to be able to hold their own in an 
increasingly competitive field.

April 9 marked the 80th anniversary of the battle of Vimy Ridge. 
Following extensive planning and training the Canadian corps 
achieved victory where other armies before it had failed, but did so 
at a cost of 10,000 casualties and 3,600 dead.
<P>
	The battle was a defining moment for the Canadian army but 
more particularly for Canada as a nation.
<P>
	This past weekend CFB Shilo opened a special Vimy exhibit at 
its Royal Canadian Artillery Museum. At this time I salute all 
veterns of World War I but in particular three western Manitobans

	<B>Mrs. Carolyn Parrish (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Canadians have been asked to present a paper to the North Atlantic 
Assembly this spring raising awareness of the worldwide problem 
of land mines. It will highlight the growing technological gap 
between land mines and the methods currently available for 
clearing them.
<P>
	With 119 million anti-personnel land mines in 71 countries all 
over the world, 20 are being put in place for every 1 removed. Land 
mines prevent the reconstruction of basic infrastructure, keeping 
these countries dependent on foreign aid.
<P>
	Canada has one of the most advanced technologies in mine 
detection and removal in the world and a foreign affairs minister 
who has been recognized with a Nobel Peace Prize nomination for 
his leadership in this area.
<P>
	I thank David Saint, Major Harry Burke and Lieutenant-Colonel 
Normand Levert at the Department of National Defence and John 
Evans at DRE Suffield for their enthusiastic assistance in the 
preparation of the report. I also thank Susan Howell and Eric Walsh 
in the Department of Foreign Affairs.
<P>
	Canada must continue to lead the way in this subject.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="THECONSTITUTION">THE CONSTITUTION</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday, in Toronto, Brian Mulroney was asking Canada 
to make new offers to Quebec to make up for the constitutional 
insult it suffered in 1982. According to the President of Treasury 
Board, however, Ottawa has kept its promises, there is no problem, 
everything is fine, Constitution-wise.
<P>
	Because it is totally incapable of any solution whatsoever, the 
Liberal government is quite simply denying persistently that a 
flagrant injustice was done to Quebec in 1982.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister agree with his Quebec lieutenant that 
everything is settled, that there is nothing serious about the fact that 
no Quebec government whatsoever, whether federalist or 
sovereignist, has agreed to sign the Canadian Constitution in the 
past 15 years?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the House of Commons has taken steps concerning this 
matter. We held a vote in this House in which we voted for distinct 
society.
<P>
	We passed legislation making it clear that there will be no 
constitutional change without Quebec's consent. We have made 
considerable progress in such areas as mining, forestry, tourism, 
spending powers and social housing. It would appear that we are on 
the verge of signing an agreement on manpower, an issue that has 
been around for a very long time. As we have said here in the 
House of Commons, changing the Constitution requires the consent 
of the Government of Quebec.
<P>
	If the hon. member wishes to have constitutional changes, let 
him tell his head office to vote in favour of distinct society and of a 
veto for Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, like the official opposition, the Government of Quebec 
does not consider that Quebec is a distinct society. We consider it to 
be a distinct nation.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> A people.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe: </B>The Minister of Immigration ought to realize 
that, if she sat in the National Assembly, perhaps that is because 
there is something called the Quebec nation. Otherwise we would 
have called it the ``Societal Assembly''.
<P>
	While the President of Treasury Board states that everything is 
settled, his colleague in Intergovernmental Affairs admits that 
nothing has been done by the Liberals on the constitutional issue, 
and that he accepts Canada as it is. He therefore admits that the 
promises made at Verdun have been trampled into the ground, that 
they were nothing but smoke and mirrors.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	I ask the Prime Minister how he can reconcile these two 
statements. Has everything been done, or nothing?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in October 1995 at Verdun, the Liberal Party and I made a 
promise, saying that we had been in favour of the distinct society in 
the past, and still are in the present, and we came to this House in 
December 1995 to vote in favour of distinct society, which the Bloc 
Quebecois voted against.
<P>
	We said at Verdun that we were in favour of giving Quebec and 
the other regions of Canada a veto. A bill was passed by the House 
of Commons, as well as by the Senate, but the Bloc Quebecois 
voted against a veto for Quebec.
<P>
	What happened, each time we tried to take to meet Quebec's 
traditional demands? We got blocked by the Bloc.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if we blocked them, it was because this government, and 
this Prime Minister in particular, has always had a block where 
Quebec is concerned.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> Mr. Speaker, we are not the only ones saying this; 
the federalists in the Quebec National Assembly are not in 
agreement with the Canadian government either.
<P>
	Yesterday, we saw this Prime Minister shaking hands with Guy 
Bertrand; a few months ago, it was Howard Galganov. We also 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9742"> 9742 </A></B>
<P>
remember the accolade to Clyde Wells after the failure of the 
Meech Lake accord.
<P>
	Every time anyone takes a stand against Quebec or the National 
Assembly, the Prime Minister allies with him.
<P>
	By denying the importance of the constitutional question, is the 
Prime Minister not in the process of admitting that he has nothing 
to offer Quebecers, whether they be sovereignists or federalists?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we have a great deal to offer to Quebecers. What we have 
to offer is the best country in the world: Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is directed to the Prime Minister.
<P>
	Former Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said yesterday that 
Canada would never have been able to patriate the Constitution 
without Ontario's agreement. This patriation, as we know, was 
carried out despite the opposition of all political parties in Quebec. 
And the 15th anniversary of this event next Thursday will be a dark 
day for Quebec.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister agree that, in the end, there is no 
difference between Pierre Elliott Trudeau himself and the Minister 
of Intergovernmental Affairs? That the Liberal Party has not 
altered its position on this issue one iota in 15 years?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am very surprised to hear that the official opposition 
would have liked us to remain a legal colony of Great Britain. We 
patriated the Canadian Constitution and, in so doing, gave all 
Canadians a Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and we included as 
part of the Constitution that Canada had two official languages, 
French and English.
<P>
	But the people who live in the past would like us to remain 
forever a colony of Great Britain.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, for the 
Prime Minister, it was the 1982 Constitution that was the future. 
We can see that.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister realize that there is a consensus in the 
rest of Canada regarding Quebec's status within Confederation, 
that Quebec was put in its place in 1982, and that there is no 
question of this changing?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in the House of Commons we voted in favour of distinct 
society. We gave a veto to all regions, including Quebec. We sorted 
out the problems of duplication with respect to the environment. 
We resolved the problems that existed concerning forestry, 
tourism, mining and social housing. One would have to be blind not 
to see the progress we have made.

	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, April is 
tax month and Canadians are getting a first hand look at what three 
and a half years of Liberal government have done to their pay 
cheques.
<P>
	Since the Liberals came to power in 1993, the average Canadian 
family has suffered a pay cut of $3,000, thanks to the government's 
high tax policies. We are getting letters from seniors on fixed 
incomes who are having to pay taxes for the first time in five years.
<P>
	How can the government claim that it has not raised taxes when 
older Canadians on fixed incomes are having to cut a cheque to the 
tax man for the first time in years?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
every time the Reform Party stands up and cites numbers, what it 
has to do, unfortunately for it, is to go back to the Tory regime. In 
order to compensate for the good numbers that the government has 
brought in, it has to bring in the bad numbers that the Tories had. It 
will not work.
<P>
	We are responsible for that which happened since we took office 
in 1993. Since that time, disposable income and family incomes 
have stabilized. For the three years prior to our taking office they 
had worsened. We have stabilized them. Virtually every economist 
in the country now projects that those numbers are going to get 
better.
<P>
	It is particularly ironic that the hon. member stands up and talks 
about seniors pensions, given the fact that her party in their original 
budget recommended that seniors pensions be cut, that they have 
fought protecting of the Canada pension plan, that they have fought 
every measure this government has brought in to take care of our 
senior citizens. The Canadian people are entitled to a little 
consistency.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Reform Party has said and always says that the Canadian pension 
plan as it is now is a farce. There is going to be nothing there for 
young people when they get to be seniors.
<P>
	The one pension plan that we did want to cut was the MP 
pension, yet the people across the way would have no part of that.
<P>
	High taxes mean high unemployment. The government is 
collecting more in taxes than any other government in the history 
of the country and it has the worst string of jobless numbers since 
the great depression. That is no coincidence and it is certainly 
nothing to brag about.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9743"> 9743 </A></B>
<P>
	If the Liberals were serious about dealing with the 1.4 million 
Canadians unemployed they would be offering Canadians a 
balanced budget soon and tax relief through smaller government.
<P>
	Since the Prime Minister has made it clear that he has absolutely 
no intention of giving Canadians tax relief, just where in the world 
are these real jobs going to come from?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member must understand that when she stands up and cites 
numbers in her preamble, she must be prepared to defend them.
<P>
	She talked about what the government has done in pensions. Let 
me quote: ``In the Reform Party's taxpayers budget it is projected 
that spending on seniors' benefits in 1997-1998 would be $17 
billion''. They have come in at $22.3 billion. The Reform Party has 
recommended a $5 billion cut in seniors old age pensions.
<P>
	Second, the hon. member has complained about the 9.9 per cent 
premium that has been arrived at by the federal government and the 
provinces, provinces representing every region of the country. The 
hon. member's numbers come out, by almost anybody's 
calculation, at 13 per cent. If those are not the right numbers, would 
she stand in the House now and tell us what her premiums will 
cost?
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
number in the taxpayers' budget that the finance minister refers to 
were 1994 numbers and a lot of projections have changed since 
then.
<P>
	The Prime Minister's idea of job creation is building canoe 
museums, hotels and now armouries in his riding. That might 
improve the Prime Minister's chance of re-election but it is not 
going to give real sustainable jobs to Canadians across the country.

	Mr. Speaker, 1.4 million people are unemployed, two to three 
million people are underemployed, 800,000 people are 
moonlighting to try to make ends meet and one in four Canadians 
are worried about losing their jobs.
<P>
	Members can cackle and crow all they like across the aisle, but 
that is such a poor record that the government ought to be ashamed 
of it. What it is trying to do is run away from that record in the next 
election.
<P>
	Instead of doling out patronage appointments and money in 
Shawinigan, why will the Prime Minister not just give all 
Canadians tax relief and help create some real jobs across the 
country?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
draw to the attention of the House that the hon. member was given 
an opportunity to say what her party's Canada pension plan 
premium or super RRSP premium would do. She did not take that 
opportunity.  Do I now understand that she accepts the number that 
most economists have said? In fact, it is 13 per cent, 4 per cent 
higher than what we and the provincial governments have arrived 
at.
<P>
	Let me go on. The hon. member wants to talk about tax cuts. She 
says that her party will bring in tax cuts. Let us take a look at the 
tax cuts that she would bring in.
<P>
	The Reform Party will bring in, for a single parent with two 
children earning $30,000 a tax cut of $175 per year. If people want 
to know where their constituency lies, under the same program, 
under the same budget, a one-earner couple earning $250,000 with 
two children will get a tax cut of $6,700. That is what they are 
trying to protect.

<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member has quite incorrectly interpreted the comments of 
the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Canada. The Chief 
Justice of the Supreme Court of Canada made a comment and an 
observation in terms of providing sufficient time for Justice Krever 
to make his report.
<P>
	It has been the position of the government, it has been the 
position of ministers of health across the country, that we would 
wait to hear the full report of Justice Krever before making final

buddies for patronage, MP junkets, gold plated MP pensions and 
even caviar receptions in the case of the heritage minister.
<P>
	Meanwhile, I just had a letter from a 74-year-old senior. She 
writes that for the first time she has to pay $1,100 in her year end 
income tax bill when her gross income was under $18,000. This is 
robbery of seniors and the poor.
<P>
	Can the government explain why this senior is having her pocket 
picked to fuel the wasteful habits of the heritage minister and her 
big spending colleagues?
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleagues, words like robbery and have their 
pockets picked are a little strong. I would ask hon. members to be 
very judicious in their choice of words.
<P>
<B>(1435)</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, yesterday the hon. 
member made certain claims about what he alleged to be a very 
exclusive reception.
<P>
	The reason I answered about the reception in the House is 
because the reception I attended was the same kind of reception 
that we have held for Olympic athletes ever since we have been a 
country and entered the Olympics.
<P>
	I have here a partial list of the over 600 Canadian athletes and 
their families who attended. From the province of New Brunswick 
selected by the provincial government, Lynsey Bartlett; from the 
province of Alberta, from Blairmore, Gail Bigcharles. We had 
14-year-old wheelchair basketball athletes. We also had a team 
from the city of Montreal. They are so committed to the Olympic 
process that to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Montreal 
Olympics they cycled from Montreal to Atlanta. Yes, they too were 
invited to this very exclusive reception.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, what we are 
concerned about is careers, not caviar. We are concerned about 
jobs.
<P>
	The government's spending problem has led to enormous tax 
rates that are killing jobs and destroying hope for unemployed 
young people. I have three  children, all of them university trained. 
All of them had to leave the country because of the government's 
record.
<P>
	Why is the government through its destructive tax policies 
giving our young people the choice between no hope for a job or 
reaching for their passports? Is that the Liberal solution for job 
unemployment for the young?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in the course of the show 
of appreciation by the country for our Olympic and Paralympic 
athletes we have had three receptions: one for the Olympic and 
Paralympic athletes here on the Hill, another one in Atlanta, and 
there is going to be a third reception next week to honour the 
athletes from the Special Olympics.
<P>
	I was thrilled that at the last event held on the floor of the House 
of Commons, all members from all sides of the House were thrilled 
to participate with Olympians. I happen to have a picture of the

not only to go to the reception but to have his picture taken with the

<P>
	Last Friday, the Minister of Foreign Affairs said, in response to a 
question from the deputy leader of the official opposition, that he 
was misinformed and that the government intended to co-sponsor 
the Danish resolution on human rights in China.
<P>

commission?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the decision we announced yesterday is part of an 
assessment we made. It was a tough judgment to make but it really 
came down to what we thought would be the most effective way of 
trying to broaden and pursue an agenda of human rights.
<P>
	We held discussions with Chinese authorities, enabling us to 
develop a new set of initiatives. We felt that because  the resolution 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9745"> 9745 </A></B>
<P>
of Geneva had already been substantially weakened by the 
withdrawal of support by a number of countries, the most effective 
way that we could advance the cause of human rights in China was 
to pursue this new agenda.
<P>
	I would be very glad to brief the hon. member on the kind of 
measure because I am sure the hon. premier of Quebec when he 
goes to China would like to support us in that initiative.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, this is a sad 
day indeed. The government has just abdicated its responsibility 
and betrayed the Pearson legacy which made human rights a 
priority at one of the world's most important political forums on 
human rights.
<P>
	Would the minister agree that his government should be 
ashamed of letting China pressure and blackmail us into let money 
prevail over human rights?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, the reverse is true. The history of Canada's legacy in this 
respect has been to pursue the most effective ways to develop 
respect for human rights throughout the world.
<P>
	In this case, we have developed a program of initiatives to 
promote rights in China, to guarantee the development of the 
civilian society and to engage the Chinese in a unique multilateral 
dialogue on human rights.
<P>
	I believe that in the circumstances, this will offer the most 
effective opportunities for developing a reaction. If there is no 
favourable reaction in the next few years, we will re-examine 
Canada's position and support the resolution in Geneva.

have watched the justice minister in effect deny Canadians a 
national victims bill of rights. I have watched the justice minister 
refuse to amend his conditional sentencing law that allows rapists 
to serve no time in jail. I have watched the justice minister use a 
letter solicited by him from a victims group to convince us that his 
position is a good thing for Canadians. Last week he categorically 
denied that he or his office solicited that letter.
<P>
	Is the justice minister prepared to apologize to Canadians for 
disregarding the needs of victims in using them in a letter solicited 
by his office?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General

without ideas, a party without policies, a party with nothing to 
offer, driven in  desperation to now a daily ritual of exploiting the 
pain of others in an effort to hang on to its few remaining points in 
the polls. It is a sad spectacle. It is difficult to watch and abide. It is 
hard to listen to.
<P>
	I offer the same answer as I have offered on days in the past. The 
hon. member knows nothing of what he speaks. He asked for a 
victims bill of rights without knowing that most of the provinces 
have already taken steps to do exactly what he is asking for.
<P>
	That party has been driven to a point where it is now exploiting 
crime to protect its impossible position.
<P>
<B>(1445 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
is really a disgusting spectacle from the justice minister. The 
justice minister is really the managing partner in the worst law firm 
in this country. That is what he is.
<P>
	I think he should check with Derek Kent of his office. He should 
check how he wrongfully solicits victims. If he has no idea what is 
going on in his own office, is it any wonder why he is out of touch 
with this country, out of touch with victims?
<P>
	Can the minister check with his office to determine if the 
bureaucrats will allow him to amend conditional sentencing to 
exclude violent offenders?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General

desperation but by now he must be feeling acute embarrassment. 
Here he has paraded himself on the national stage day after day, 
pretending to be the champion of victims, attacking this 
government for having done nothing, and yet to his acute 
embarrassment he must confront the letter from CAVEAT, a 
national organization of victims, signed by the president, Priscilla 
de Villiers.
<P>
	This is important. The hon. member may wish to listen: ``Three 
years ago CAVEAT presented a petition to Allan Rock on behalf of 
2.5 million Canadians. It called for far reaching measures to 
improve public safety and the treatment of victims. Since then 
significant steps have been taken to address some of these 
concerns. Although much still needs to be done, this government

in properties expropriated by other governments.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of International Trade. As the 
Liberals' record says that Canada was the force behind 
international opposition to the Helms-Burton law, could the 
minister explain how it is that Canada is not a signatory to the 
agreement reached last week by the European Union and the United 
States?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister for International Trade,

United States on this issue. The Americans know of our strong 
opposition to it and we will continue to have those consultations.
<P>
	The idea with the European Union was to get it into a new forum, 
away from the World Trade Organization, in which the U.S. said it 
would not participate, to the OECD where it will participate. I think 
that is a useful move because Canada has hit the table in those 
discussions on the multilateral agreement on investment. In fact, 
Canada first raised the issue with respect to extraterritoriality and 
the Helms-Burton law. We will continue to pursue it.
<P>
	In terms of the other measures with respect to Helms-Burton, 
nothing was really gained. The president had already indicated that 
he was deferring for six months at a time the title III provisions on 
lawsuits. On title IV we have been told that they are not looking at 
any other Canadians and that they would not make it retroactive 
with respect to those already on the list.
<P>
	Canada continues to present its case and will continue in 
consultations. I am delighted to know we will have an opportunity

extraterritoriality.

what is preventing him from filing a complaint under NAFTA?

do not think it is going to come in the short run. It will be sometime 
in 1998, but it is a matter that will get full discussion at that level.
<P>
	In terms of the NAFTA, we have the possibility of doing that. If 
the talks stall, if the U.S. refuses to talk about Helms-Burton and 
these kinds of unilateral measures, then we will use it.

this year but probably next year.
<P>
	There is no agreement. Proposals are on the table but no 
agreement has been reached on the issue. Canada's sovereignty will 
not be undermined. As in the case of NAFTA, we will look for 
exemptions for our cultural industries and the right to review 
sensitive foreign investments.
<P>
	Furthermore, Canada will not sign an agreement that inhibits its 
ability to link the granting of investment incentives to job creation. 
What we do see though as an advantage when eventually we do find 
the right terms is the greater access of investment for Canadians in 
foreign markets and a more appealing access into our market for 
foreign firms.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question 
is a supplementary to that issue. When the minister says that 
Canada's sovereignty will not be undermined that is exactly what 
the proponents of NAFTA told Canadians.
<P>
	Considering the implications of this proposal that are now being 
carried on in high level secret negotiations, is it not time that 
Canadians know what is being negotiated? Should they not know 
what some of the issues are before the election or at least promise 
to raise it during the election so Canadians can evaluate this and 
make a judgment call themselves?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister for International Trade,

what is already in the NAFTA agreement and that is very public 
information.
<P>
	It is at a very early stage in the discussions. Canada has not 
agreed to anything and Canada will not agree to anything that is not 
in its interest. If we can get further access to markets, fine. 
However, we want to make sure  that we can continue to create jobs 
in this country. That is what Canadians want and we are not going 
to give that away.

response I gave yesterday in question period.
<P>
	I was asked by the hon. member for Fraser Valley West whether I 
had solicited a letter from CAVEAT that has been referred to in the

behalf.
<P>
	I did undertake to check the facts. The hon. member or other 
members might have concluded from my response that the letter 
had not been solicited. Last night in discussion with my staff I 
learned that a member of my staff, in speaking with the president of 
CAVEAT last Thursday, had asked that the thoughts she had 
expressed be put in writing and that she communicate by letter. 
That was done. That is the letter that I read from, freely sent by 
CAVEAT.

<P>
	As you know, Mr. Speaker, Beauchesne requires that anyone 
who is asked to withdraw unparliamentary language do so without 
any conditions whatsoever. I would like to draw to your attention 
that the minister did attach conditions. I ask that the record be 
corrected by requesting her to make an unconditional withdrawal

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="ANACTTOAMENDCERTAINLAWSRELATINGTOFINANCIALINSTITUTIONS">AN ACT TO AMEND CERTAIN LAWS RELATING TO 
FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS</A></H3>
	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-82, 
an act to amend certain laws relating to financial institutions, be 
read the third time and passed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Okanagan Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it is with pleasure that I continue the debate on Bill C-82, an act to 
review the legislation regarding certain financial institutions.
<P>
	Before I get into the other part of my remarks, I wish to reply to 
certain statements that were made by the Parliamentary Secretary 
to the Minister of Finance. In particular, he said that the clauses 
dealing with tied selling would not be proclaimed until September 
1998. It was almost a sanctimonious kind of concession that 
suggested that this is such an important issue that it will be put into 
the legislation but the government will not proclaim it until 
September 1998.
<P>
	This was put under the rubric or in the context of saying that it is 
in the interests of the consumer and that the government is looking 
after the interests of the consumer.
<P>
	I wish to point out as I go through the various remarks that the 
very amendments dealing with tied selling in the proposed Bill 
C-82 are not in the interests of the consumer. I will move into that 
with some dispatch at this point.
<P>
	First of all, may I draw members attention to it not being in the 
interests of all categories of consumers. That is the individual 
consumer, that is the large business corporation, the small business 
corporation, the partnership, the medium sized corporation. All 
these people use in various shapes and forms and at various times, 
in larger or smaller amounts, with different degrees and conditions 
of repayment and rates of interest the function of the bank as it 
lends money to these various ventures.
<P>
	Every Canadian who borrows money is affected by the 
provisions in proposed Bill C-82. These are loans that can be of 
short term, of longer term, of flexible interest rates or of fixed 
interest rates. It has to deal with bridge financing, if that is the 
instance, or it may deal with lines of credit. It deals with first 
mortgages and second mortgages, whatever the case might be.
<P>
	What is the issue in this matter? The issue is that it will give to 
the banks increased power to do things that otherwise are not 
available to other financial institutions. How do I come to this 
conclusion? It comes from the two subclauses that are presented in 
clause 55 of Bill C-82. They refer to section 459.1 of the Bank Act.
<P>
	How does this affect the consumer? I wish to read the sections of 
the bill so that we are each clear on what exactly it is that we are 
talking about. I want to go on record with this because the day will 
come, I am convinced, when a lot of Canadians will ask themselves 
why the government passed this legislation.
<P>
	In order to put this into the appropriate context, we need to 
recognize that section 459.1 reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>459.1 (1) a bank shall not impose undue pressure on, or coerce, a person to obtain 
a product or service from a particular person, including the bank and any of its 
affiliates, as a condition for obtaining a loan from the bank.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1510 )</B>
<P>
	Every consumer listening to this would say that is good and I 
agree. However, the bill does not stop there. It goes on to subclause 
(2) and (3). It is in subclause (2) that we need to read as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>For greater certainty, a bank may offer to make a loan to a person on more 
favourable terms or conditions than the bank would otherwise offer to a borrower, 
where the more favourable terms and conditions are offered on the condition that the 
person obtain another product or service from any particular person.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It is very clear that a preferred rate may be given on the 
condition that the borrower obtain insurance from a particular 
person, which could be a subsidiary of the bank or any institution 
with which the bank has an agreement.
<P>
	Let us read subclause (3). It is in effect the mirror image of 
subclause (2) but written in a different way. It begins with the same 
words:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>For greater certainty, a bank or one of its affiliates may offer a product or service 
to a person on more favourable terms or conditions than the bank or affiliate would 
otherwise offer, where the more favourable terms and conditions are offered on the 
condition that the person obtain a loan from the bank.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	According to the amendments to Bill C-82, those two clauses are 
being used to replace the existing section 416 of the Bank Act. 
Section 416 reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(1) A bank shall not undertake the business of insurance except to the extent 
permitted by this act or the regulations.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(2) A bank shall not act in Canada as agent for any person in the placing of 
insurance and shall not lease or provide space at any branch in Canada of the bank to 
any person engaged in the placing of insurance-</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(4) Nothing in this section precludes the bank from</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a)requiring insurance to be placed by a borrower for the security of the bank; or</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9750"> 9750 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(b) obtaining group insurance for its employees or the employees of any bodies 
corporate in which it has a substantial investment pursuant to section 468.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(5) No bank shall exercise pressure on a borrower to place insurance for the 
security of the bank with any particular insurance company, but a bank may require 
that an insurance company chosen by a borrower meet with its approval, which shall 
not be unreasonably withheld.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is the part that works today and that is what Bill C-82 states 
shall not longer be the case.
<P>
	I submit that is operating not in the interest of the consumer but 
in the direct beneficiary interest of the bank itself.
<P>
	Having set the context, we need to ask ourselves how this can 
affect the consumer. First, we need to recognize that in 1992 the 
four pillars of the financial institutions were collapsed. They do not 
exist any more. Those four pillars constituted insurance companies, 
investment dealers, trust companies and banks. They are no longer 
in existence.
<P>
	With the destruction or the elimination of the barriers between 
these four pillars of finance went competition and came the 
exchange of information between these various aspects. What does 
this mean in practical terms? It means, and has in practice turned 
out that way, that banks today may own insurance companies. 
There is a whole variety of different kinds of insurance companies. 
They may own life insurance companies. They may own health 
insurance companies. They may own property and casualty 
insurance companies, automobile insurance companies or trust 
companies. The experience now is that 80 per cent of the 
investment dealer business is done by the banks through its 
subsidiaries.
<P>
	Under the umbrella of a single board are contained all four of 
these that were before distinct and separate financial functions.
<P>
<B>(1515)</B>
<P>
	Let us take a look at a couple of scenarios on how this would 
work in the individual case, how it can work and how it has 
worked. There has been the greater consolidation of information 
under one umbrella. There are instances where a bank can own a 
life insurance or a health insurance company. When a life insurance 
policy or a health policy is issued a lot of very personal information 
is collected.
<P>
	Let us take a person who owes $100,000 to the bank. The loan is 
there. Lo and behold the bank recognizes that a set of claims has 
been issued against its insurance company by the individual with 
the loan. The bank may now very easily project forward and ask 
under what conditions or how favourable is the repayment 
possibility of the loan.
<P>
	I presented this example to the finance committee when the bill 
was up for discussion. The president of the Canadian Bankers 
Association appeared before the  committee. This is not a 
recollection from my memory but an exact quotation of what Mr. 
Protti said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>First, our privacy codes do not permit the sharing of information on health issues 
across subsidiaries. It doesn't happen.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is very interesting. One bank, a member of the Canadian 
Bankers Association, sent a policy statement sent to clients of a 
subsidiary of the bank, an investment dealer subsidiary, which 
stated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Its officers and employees must scrupulously observe in letter and spirit all laws 
governing business and securities activities. Its officers and employees must deal 
fairly, honestly and in good faith with clients-The confidentiality of client 
information is a fundamental principle of our firm. No employee may release 
confidential client information unless required by law or with the client's consent.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I will refer to this point later when we go through the policy 
statement. It further stated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The misuse of confidential information or misuse of any inside information not 
generally disclosed for personal gain or for the benefit of anyone else is prohibited 
and grounds for immediate dismissal of an employee.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	What is the nature of the bank and its relationship with a 
subsidiary? The subsidiary is a wholly owned subsidiary of the 
bank and the bank guarantees all the liabilities of the subsidiary.
<P>
	What about the sharing of private information? The subsidiary 
may give confidential client information to the bank. This type of 
information includes a client's name, address, phone number, 
income, assets, debts, investment objectives and financial plans.
<P>
	The bank may use this information for the following purposes: to 
sell its services to the client; and to survey the relationship between 
its subsidiaries and their clients. It is the beginning of a sharing of 
information among subsidiaries. It may use it to determine the 
amount of debt one has outstanding to the subsidiary and to the 
bank. The comes the catch all phrase. It says:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This information may be used for any other purpose about which the subsidiary 
will inform you, the client, in writing.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Earlier it stated that the bank would not disclose the information 
unless it was required to be shared by law or without the consent of 
the client. Before an account is opened with the subsidiary there is 
a client consent statement which reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>By opening an account with this subsidiary you are consenting to the bank's use 
of this information.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It does not say how. There are no conditions placed on it. It is 
simply an agreement that the bank may use the information. If a 
client wants to end the consent written notice must be given to the 
subsidiary and addressed and delivered to the subsidiary's branch. 
Notice would be in effect when a written acknowledgement from 
the subsidiary is received. Should a client wish to close an  account, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9751"> 9751 </A></B>
<P>
the subsidiary would give at least 30 days written notice before 
doing so.
<P>
<B>(1520)</B>
<P>
	Who is closing the account? The client chooses to close the 
account. If the client does so or if the client will not give 
permission to send the information, the subsidiary may close the 
account without any further consultation with the client. The bank 
is virtually guaranteeing the information will be made available to 
other of its subsidiaries and that the client, in order to keep the 
account, must give consent to the sharing of that information with 
the various subsidiaries. It is not far fetched that the information 
could be used by the bank in its decision making process.
<P>
	Scenario No. 1 depicts a situation where a particular piece of 
personal information may be used to make a decision against 
clients or change their financial status.
<P>
	Let me move on to another scenario. This time it is implicit 
rather than explicit. We will consider the following. A business has 
a loan. The bank advises that it is a big loan and asks about it being 
paid back by the business going public.
<P>
	We all know what going public means. It means issuing shares 
which allows the public to buy parts of the business through the 
purchase of shares. Lo and behold the bank also has a subsidiary 
which deals in securities. One of the functions of a securities dealer 
is to underwrite new stock issues, which would be the case in this 
scenario.
<P>
	First we had a private company that went to the bank and, in 
order to pay its loan, went to the public market to sell equity shares. 
Now the bank suggests to the individual to keep a bit of the loan on 
which it will give a preferred rate on the condition, according to 
subsection (2), the underwriting service of its subsidiary is used. 
On the other hand it says the company can go all the way with the 
underwriting and will be given a preferred rate but the underwriting 
has to be done through our subsidiary. The rate will only be given 
on the condition that if in the future the company needs to borrow 
money it will borrow it from the bank in question.
<P>
	One could argue that is good business. However, when a person 
is in trouble it is tantamount to coercion. It is certainly tantamount 
to undue pressure. It is not good business. That scenario is not far 
fetched. It is a very real possibility.
<P>
	I will outline a third scenario. This one concerns a business 
which at this point in time is in serious trouble. Under the umbrella 
provision it has given the bank all its business. The company 
pension plan, mortgage, personal RRSPs and home mortgage are 
all with the bank, in one place. The bank has knowledge of the 
affairs of the business, its proprietor, its family and its members. It 
knows the business is in trouble and that even if the company 
pension, the group RRSPs, the individual  RRSPs, the house and 
the other mortgages were liquidated, there would not be enough 
money to cover the debt.
<P>
<B>(1525 )</B>
<P>
	By consolidating everything under one roof the bank has an 
unusual power and a coercion possibility that otherwise would not 
exist. That is dangerous and imprudent. It should not be considered 
prudent management of financial affairs if all products or services 
are subsumed under one bank or one financial institution.
<P>
	Who benefits from all this? It is the bank that benefits. If we take 
the first scenario, the information is given by the client to the bank 
and shared with the subsidiary to the advantage of the bank and not 
of the client.
<P>
	In the second case the banks underwrite through its subsidiary 
the share issue. The subsidiary gets the underwriting fees for 
writing the share issue. Its brokers collect the fees from the 
distribution of the shares to the general public. It also gets an 
overriding commission. Then there is the continued trading of that 
set of securities. The company, which was previously private, now 
has the additional difficulty of having to meet all obligations a 
public company has to meet. These are substantial. In all three 
instances the bank is favoured rather than to the individual.
<P>
	I will review exactly what we have done so far. Bundling it all 
together, as the hon. parliamentary secretary said, will somehow be 
to the benefit of the consumer. By bundling all these products and 
services we can offer either a preferred rate on the loan or a 
preferred rate on services or products being purchased.
<P>
	What is not in the act is important. The act does not require the 
bank to disclose the prices of these component parts or whether the 
specifications of the component parts would have been the same 
before they were bundled together.
<P>
	There is no protection. It may not even be the same set of 
products the customer thought he was buying. Tied selling is a very 
dangerous.
<P>
	What do other people have to say about this section of the act? 
Members have heard my interpretation. Let me read what Mr. 
Yakabuski, director of government relations of the Insurance 
Bureau of Canada, had to say in his brief to the committee:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>If there is an area where the committee may choose to make Bill C-82 an even 
better piece of legislation, it is with respect to the tied selling provisions proposed 
under section 459.1 of the Bank Act.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Our view is that subsections 2 and 3 have been worded too broadly and may in 
fact permit the bundling of certain bank products and other financial services in a 
way which may not be beneficial to the consumer.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9752"> 9752 </A></B>
<P>
	Mr. Yakabuski added to that section of his brief by saying:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>With respect to those proposed subsections it seems perfectly absurd to us that the 
government would decide to put into law definitions regarding some things that 
might be good for consumers and some things that might not be good for consumers 
when everyone knows that it is not an exhaustive list. That is precisely why you have 
proposed section 455.5, which we support, which gives the governor in council the 
ability to make regulations determining exactly what is and is not beneficial for 
consumers.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We recognize that some bundling of products can be good for consumers, but why 
should you want to restrict the regulation making power now?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is at the heart of the issue. That is what the insurance bureau 
had to say.
<P>
	What did insurance brokers have to say? A letter to Mr. Frank 
Swedlove of the Insurance Brokers of Canada stated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We believe that there is a cause for concern regarding the proposed amendments 
to the Bank Act and in particular section 459.1. In our opinion subsections 2 and 3 
may limit the regulation making power of the Bank Act. To remove this potential 
problem it may be preferable to delete subsections 2 and 3. This can be done, if you 
agree, during the parliamentary review of this legislation which is expected to 
resume as early as this week.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1530 )</B>
<P>
	That did happen but the government chose not to agree with that. 
Mr. Speaker, I submit to you and to this House that the day will 
come when we will ask ourselves, and the government will ask 
itself, why we did not do that? If the people of Canada elect a 
Reform government then that will be looked after and consumer 
interests will be preferred. They will be balanced off against the 
powers of the banking and financial institutions. That is what we 
need to do.
<P>
	This same Madam Brown who wrote the original letter that I just 
read also said this at the committee: ``There are other angles to tied 
selling that I think we overlooked. They are not just simple ones. 
We can tell you that favourable tied selling clauses that are in 
proposed subclauses 459.1(2) and (3) will be unenforceable''. 
What do you think of that, Mr. Speaker?
<P>
	The supervision of these activities will be almost impossible 
because we go through this ourselves now in the business of tied 
selling. This is not some amateur making this observation. This is 
someone who is in the business of insurance brokering. This is 
someone who understands property and casualty insurance in great 
depth. She says that it will be unenforceable to do something like 
this.
<P>
	Why then does the government insist that this legislation be 
passed? Last Thursday we presented amendments. This afternoon 
we voted on those amendments and the government voted them 
down.  What did those amendments say? They said to keep what 
exists in legislation now and make tied selling illegal.
<P>
	Why did the government not accept those amendments? Why did 
the government bring to this House legislation that it has stated will 
not be proclaimed until September 1998 until the committee has 
had a chance to study it?
<P>
	Let the committee study it. Let the issue come forward strongly 
and clearly and then make the appropriate changes to the 
legislation as necessary, but do not anticipate what the committee 
might find, or pass legislation which will not be promulgated until 
some time in the future. It is absurd.
<P>
	There is more. This point has to do with some very significant 
issues. So far we have seen that the proposed amendments invite 
imprudent consolidation of various aspects of a business. It makes 
possible the sharing of information that is personal and private. It 
does not deal with the conflicts of interest between a subsidiary and 
the lending institution, the bank. It is silent about complete 
disclosure on price and specifications of elements of products and 
services that may be bundled together.
<P>
	I cannot help but read into the record a case where the 
individuals in question were a hardworking couple in Ottawa. Over 
many years of hard work and perseverance they took themselves 
from the proverbial rags to riches. They were diligent about 
keeping their financial records in order. Their relationship with 
their bank was top-notch. So sound was their financial record and 
their relationship with their bank that written in their files were the 
words ``no collateral required''. No collateral was required by the 
bank whenever the couple needed to get a loan.
<P>
	In keeping with their practice of fiscal responsibility, the couple 
planned for their retirement by investing in gas and oil stocks, but 
somewhere along the way a substantial stock certificate went 
missing. This discovery was made just as the couple was getting 
ready to retire and turn their family business over to their son.
<P>
	The wife worried for months over the missing stock certificate 
she had so carefully placed in her safety deposit box. It was gone. 
The bank took no responsibility for it and insisted that the couple 
must have misplaced it. Only because of the diligence of a loyal 
daughter, often in the face of great adversity which included veiled 
threats from the bank, did the story begin to come together.
<P>
<B>(1535 )</B>
<P>
	The missing stock certificate was in the possession of the bank 
during the entire time. This stock certificate had been removed 
from the couple's safety deposit box without any authorization 
from the couple, an illegal manoeuvre by the bank.
<P>
	Despite reporting this to the bank manager, the bank president, 
the inspector general of banks which today is the of the Office of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9753"> 9753 </A></B>
<P>
the Superintendent of Financial Institutions and the Minister of 
Finance at the time, nothing was done.
<P>
	The bank refused to admit that it was at fault, claiming that the 
stocks had been taken as collateral for a $15,000 loan. These were 
customers where no collateral had been deemed necessary. They 
were stocks that the bank had no knowledge of unless it had 
illegally entered into the couple's safety deposit box.
<P>
	The result took a grave toll. The father died before the matter 
was ever resolved. The mutual fund froze the couple's investment, 
meaning that the mother never saw a dime before she passed away. 
Because of the bank's refusal to own up to a mistake, this hard 
working, honest family suffered.
<P>
	More important, the relationship between this family and the 
bank has been marred for good, which means that the relationship 
between the bank and all of us has suffered to some degree. The 
bank did not live up to its fiduciary responsibility.
<P>
	Despite an investigation that ruled in favour of the family, the 
bank has not compensated the family for the value of the stocks, the 
loss of the retirement funds and the time in personal sacrifice it 
cost.
<P>
	To this day, the bank in question refuses to accept full 
responsibility for its mistake. Small amounts of compensation have 
been offered which neither reflect the dollar value of the family's 
financial loss or the value or their personal loss. The amounts, in 
the form of cheques, are offered on the condition that the family 
speak not another word of the injustice levelled against them by the 
bank. Needless to say, the cheques have not been cashed because 
they refuse to allow themselves to be muzzled this way.
<P>
	I have been asked to tell this story to warn Canadians that it is 
unwise to fully trust an institution with such power to always act in 
their best interest. It is a warning, too, that legislative powers do 
not necessarily protect the consumer.
<P>
	In 1979, in 1980 and in 1982, this case was raised again and 
again in this House. Neither the then Minister of Finance nor the 
inspector general of banks, now the Superintendent of Financial 
Institutions, did anything to ensure that the bank took 
responsibility for its mistake.
<P>
	Banks in this country are powerful, indeed, more powerful than 
our elected government. That is precisely the reason why we 
should not allow clause 55, section 459.1(2) and (3) to stand as is.
<P>
	Can we be assured that the banks will not unduly pressure or 
coerce consumers? I submit no, we cannot. That is why we must be 
diligent in protecting the interests of the consumer and the small 
business person  against the ultimate power exercised by financial 
institutions. We can never take for granted that the consumer will 
be protected or the small business person treated fairly. We have 
heard too many cases where it has not happened.
<P>
	There is going to be, I am sure, some people saying: ``But Mr. 
Schmidt, that is one case''. Yes, that is one case but it is an example 
of many other cases.
<P>
	Does this mean that banks deal this way with most customers? 
Of course not. That is not the point I am making. We ought not to 
create a situation where it is always a predetermined condition 
where the bank may do this kind of thing with impunity. That is the 
issue.
<P>
	I remember one bank that is proud of itself. In fact, it had a 
national advertising campaign. One of the characteristics of that 
advertising campaign was that it said it had become the largest 
bank in Canada one customer at a time. It is one anecdote at a time 
that has brought this kind of thing to pass.
<P>
	As legislators we need to have the interests of the consumer at 
heart first and foremost. We need stable and solid financial 
institutions. Our banks are second to none in the world but that 
does not mean that we have to keep expanding their power. That is 
the issue.
<P>
	The point has come where we need to balance the power of all 
our financial institutions, not just banks. They are not the only 
institutions that do these kinds of things. There are other groups 
that do this. Credit unions do this kind of thing. Trust companies do 
this kind of thing. The insurance companies who are opposing this 
legislation do some of these kinds of things. The issue is one of 
fairness. The issue is one of adequacy. The issue is one of justice. 
That is what I am concerned about. That is what we should all be 
concerned about. It can be done.
<P>
<B>(1540)</B>
<P>
	I am sorry the amendments were not passed, but surely to 
goodness before this legislation is promulgated we will at that time 
come to a clear understanding that these kinds of provisions cannot 
be allowed to continue to stand in the Bank Act as it exists in our 
legislation today.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
your usual non-partisan manner you announced that very well. I 
always enjoy working with you in your new role. I am sorry to see 
you muzzled, of course, of your former ability to parry and thrust in 
the debate in the House. Still, you are doing a fine job there and we 
appreciate your work.
<P>
	I want to talk for a few minutes today about the financial 
institutions act, in particular because it is one of the areas that the 
Reform Party says that the federal government needs to be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9754"> 9754 </A></B>
<P>
involved in very aggressively if Canada is to have that common 
economic union that will strengthen the nation.
<P>
	We have suggested that in our vision of what Canada should look 
like. There are some areas from which the federal government 
should dissociate itself. For example, the federal government 
should not be involved in tourism. That should be a provincial 
jurisdiction. Manpower training should be a provincial jurisdiction 
and all provinces should have responsibility for that. Municipal 
affairs is something best left with the provinces and the 
municipalities. Things such as housing, language and culture 
should be left with the provinces. The provinces and the 
municipalities are much closer to the needs in their regions and 
they will do much better job of managing things than will the 
federal government.
<P>
	In our fresh start document we detail the areas that we think 
should be handed off to lower levels of government. It goes so far 
as to say that municipalities should be officially recognized as the 
level of government closest to the people and they should be 
included in federal-provincial arrangements such as the 
infrastructure programs that are being announced here on the cusp 
of the election. Once again, it is the municipalities that are going to 
have to contribute a third of the money in these infrastructure plans 
and they getting in on the deal after it is completed.
<P>
	I can say from the last infrastructure deal, where about 82 to 84 
per cent of the money went to ridings controlled by provincial 
MLAs in the NDP government of British Columbia, there was a lot 
of dissatisfaction with the fact that municipalities are treated as the 
weak sisters, or the poor brothers or whatever they can be called, 
but they do not have the influence on policy that they should have.
<P>
	All that said, one of the things that should not be weakened in the 
federal government is regulation of financial institutions. That 
forms one of the 10 main areas where the Government of Canada 
should concentrate its efforts.
<P>
	I should read those areas into the record. They include defence, 
foreign affairs, monetary policy, regulating financial institutions, 
the Criminal Code, facilitating national standards, equalization, 
international trade, domestic trade and reform of national 
institutions such as Parliament. On the last point I know, Mr. 
Speaker, as the co-author of a report that talks about reforming the 
national institution of Parliament, even going so far as 
recommending that the position that you now have be given to one 
of the opposition parties, for example, you would be, as many 
others are as well, in favour of reforming national institutions here 
in Parliament.
<P>
	The reason that these 10 areas need to be emphasized is because 
these are the 10 areas of commonality that I think all Canadians can 
agree to and that all provinces can agree to, that if we are going to 
have a nation we need to have these areas under the control of the 
federal government.
<P>
<B>(1545 )</B>
<P>
	There is no use in the power to regulate domestic trade disputes 
being held within a province. Obviously one province could say it 
is looking after its best interests so it will not give in or allow 
another province to buy supplies or whatever it might be. This 
cannot be and should not be.
<P>
	In recent times the Liberal government attempted to put together 
an internal trade agreement in Canada. Whole sections of the 
internal trade agreement were left blank, including the section on 
energy. It is a completely blank page because the provinces cannot 
agree among themselves.
<P>
	The federal government needs to step in more aggressively and 
take control of the 10 areas that I mentioned. The federal 
government should not acquiesce to any one province. It should 
aggressively use its constitutional right to regulate financial 
institutions and internal trade disputes and force them to a 
conclusion. If one province does not want to sign on, it will have to 
be pushed a little. One thing that makes a country is a common 
economic market. By extension we also need a common monetary 
policy. That is one thing a Reform government would stress. We 
need the regulation of financial institutions. We also need control 
of the Criminal Code and issues like international and domestic 
trade.
<P>
	It is important for people to realize that a decentralized 
government or a rebalancing of the powers of the federation does 
not mean the federal government will not have a lot to do. Our view 
of what will happen under a Reform Party government is that some 
$94 billion will be used on program spending. Those kinds of 
dollars in 10 areas will focus our energies, limit the influence of the 
federal government and allow it to have a substantial role so that 
people are competent and know the roles. The provinces including 
the province of Quebec will see where we are heading, what kind of 
vision we have and so on.
<P>
	Today in question period again I was a bit disappointed. The 
Bloc Quebecois raised the idea of where the country was heading. 
The Prime Minister was asked about a distinct society and what it 
means. His response was that Quebecers would stay because we 
have the best country in the world.
<P>
	That is what he said during the last referendum campaign. The 
gist of what he proposed was that no one would want to leave 
because it was the best country in the world. I agree it is the best 
country in the world, but it is not a vision for the country just to 
repeat that ad infinitum. We need something to communicate to the 
separatists in Quebec, to the federalists who are disenchanted with 
the status quo and to others indicating that we have something 
better, a third option.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9755"> 9755 </A></B>
<P>
	There is separatism, the status quo and a third option in the 
middle. Reformers want to tell Quebecers we want them to stay 
in Canada. They should know up front that the third option 
includes strengthening some provisions of the federal government 
to make them solid. It would also make many other things solidly 
provincial.
<P>
	When they are concerned about their culture, we could say that 
by all means culture should be handed off to the provincial 
governments, lower levels of government, private institutions, 
individuals, private organizations and so on. There is a lot of 
support for cultural activities in many provinces, regions, districts 
and whatnot.
<P>
	We want to make clear that we will give the provinces plenty of 
powers which I believe are theirs constitutionally. The federal 
government will hang on to certain powers. We are not prepared to 
sell the country by diluting those powers.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	The reason the previous speaker spoke about financial 
institutions in such detail is that a Reform government would 
continue to regulate financial institutions. That mandate will not 
reside with the provinces. The provinces need to know that. There 
would be discussions with finance ministers, interest groups and 
other parties, but the federal government, led by the Reform Party, 
would continue to hold the trump card. Financial institutions would 
not be given away to a lower level of government because they 
come knocking on the door asking for it. They need to be regulated 
by the federal government if a a common economic union is to be 
maintained. That is something we need from coast to coast and we 
want to emphasize.
<P>
	I believe the Liberal government would agree with me that it is 
obvious that a country must regulate the monetary policy of its 
financial institutions. We are asking the federal government, in the 
time remaining before the next referendum, not to play games like 
the Prime Minister did today in question period. He said that 
everything was good, that it was a wonderful country and that no 
one would leave.
<P>
	If we continue to use that argument heading into the next 
referendum, it will be like going into a battle of wits unarmed. 
When we say to people who are determined to leave that we know 
they will not leave because it is a great country, they will say that it 
is not working the way they want it to. They will ask: ``What is 
your vision of the country?'' If the attitude is to stand and say it is a 
great country and no one will leave, I am fearful we will lose the 
country.
<P>
	We need to indicate where we are, where we are going, a step by 
step plan to take us there, and a vision of the country we can grab 
hold of. If the Prime Minister could lay out the vision he holds for 
the country, where he would like to take Quebec and the rest of the 
country, what he is offering, the division of powers and his  
constitutional proposals, Quebecers might grab it. If he continues 
to keep the cards close to his chest, wait until a crisis and hope he 
has the right card to play at the right time, it is a poker game he will 
lose.
<P>
	The separatists know exactly what they want. I do not agree with 
them in any way, shape or form. The only thing they are countering 
is more of the same. Brian Mulroney in his speech last night said 
that we had to go back to offering them what he tried a couple of 
times. I do not agree. There must be something in the middle, a 
third option. The Reform Party has one. Maybe they do not like it 
but at least it is an option.
<P>
	The Liberals would be wise to come up with an option. They are 
playing a dangerous game. They are going to court. They are 
saying those people cannot leave, that it is the greatest country so 
no one will want to leave. If those are the two arguments they are 
using in the debate, I fear for the next referendum.
<P>
	On the other hand the Liberals should say that the regulation of 
financial institutions is a federal mandate and will remain a federal 
mandate, and that is the way it will be. Canadians and Quebecers 
want it that way. They want a common Criminal Code. They want 
federal control over monetary policy, defence, domestic trade and 
international trade. If a bunch of this other stuff is given in a third 
option because the provinces deserve it, they have a vision to sell. 
They have something to put out there. They cannot say that maybe 
financial institutions are on the table. They cannot say that maybe it 
is a provincial matter. Who knows? The liberals do not lay it out. 
They come to the table with an uncertain list of things they are 
dabbling with. The people who know what they want play them like 
a fiddler plays a fiddle. They just play them along and ask what else 
they will be given.
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	The end result, as I mentioned earlier, is that we came within a 
smidgen of going over the cliff in the last referendum. Mr. 
Bouchard is rubbing his hands in glee at the thought of facing a 
Prime Minister who does not know where he wants to take the 
country. Unless he gets out of the mindset he came here with 30 
years ago that playing along and hoping to get by will somehow get 
us through the next set of crises, all it will take is one wrong step or 
a misstatement at the wrong time and the 40,000 votes on the no 
side last time will be on the yes side. Then what? Then we will have 
a real battle on our hands, a real problem.
<P>
	I am pleased to reconfirm for Canadians that some things under 
the federal government need to be strengthened and maintained in a 
federal Parliament. We cannot have a country unless there is a 
strong central government on some issues.
<P>
	The people of Quebec need to know that on many other issues 
there is a party offering a third option. It  does not have to stay the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9756"> 9756 </A></B>
<P>
way it is. Quebec does not have to separate. The third option is a 
clear division of federal and provincial powers. They take what is 
constitutionally correct to take provincially and the federal 
government keeps control of the things it needs to control to 
maintain the country.
<P>
	If Quebecers hear that option they will embrace it. The federal 
government would be wise to put forward its vision of the country 
rather than just say: ``I am okay, you are okay, everything is good''. 
If the Liberals put forward their vision of the country maybe 
Quebecers and the rest of Canada will say in the next election they 
are willing to take a vote on it.
<P>
	That is what the Reform Party will be doing. I challenge the 
Liberals and any other party to come forward with a third option 
that makes sense for all Canadians and certainly for Quebecers.
<P>
	<B>Mr. George Proud (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Labour, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened to the hon. member over the 
last few minutes speak on many issues. Sometimes he mentioned 
the bill we were debating.
<P>
	However one part of his speech concerned centralization and 
decentralization. I understood the member to say there were things 
the federal government should be involved in and some it should 
not be involved in. We are talking about financial institutions in 
this debate.
<P>
	Could the member give his views on what the role the federal 
government should play when dealing with provinces? What other 
things should we give to the provinces? What areas should we deal 
with in the governance of financial and other institutions?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Mr. Speaker, I invite the member to check out the 
literature we will be campaigning on. We go into some detail in the 
document called ``The Fresh Start''.
<P>
	We categorized the items we think the federal government needs 
to strengthen and maintain. We will focus federal powers in the 
following areas: defence, foreign affairs, monetary policy, 
regulating financial institutions, the Criminal Code and facilitating 
national standards. We have a group of proposals for increased 
spending on health care, for targeting spending on advanced 
education and so on. We have a group of items in the national 
standards list such as equalization, international trade, domestic 
trade and reform of national institutions such as Parliament.
<P>
	In the 36th Parliament we will have plenty to do if we look after 
those 10 areas and if we make the changes I think are starting to be 
made now in this and in other bills. There is a lot of work to do in 
those 10 areas, especially when we get into the social policy side 
which I mentioned in those other areas.
<P>
	We will eliminate the duplication and jurisdictional overlap 
between different levels of government by giving those areas-

	<B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (on behalf of the Minister of Justice 
and Attorney General of Canada)</B> moved that Bill C-55, an act to 
amend the Criminal Code (high risk offenders), the Corrections and 
Conditional Release Act, the Criminal Records Act, the Prisons 
and Reformatories Act and the Department of the Solicitor General 
Act, be read the third time and passed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, first I 
want to thank the parliamentary secretary and member for Prince 
Albert-Churchill River for agreeing to reverse the order during 
the debate at third reading, since the subcommittee on national 
security will meet at 4.45 p.m.
<P>
	When Bill C-55, which amends the Criminal Code and several 
other acts, was first introduced, the official opposition expressed 
some reservations, particularly as regards new clause 810.2 of the 
Criminal Code, as proposed at the time, and the clause dealing with 
electronic surveillance.
<P>
	I will get back in a few moments to these two clauses, which 
seemed to present a problem at the time, to see how these issues 
were solved.
<P>
	Bill C-55 provides the Canadian justice system with the tools 
needed to deal with a new reality, with a new approach towards 
criminals and with changes to the criminals' behaviour, because the 
traditional notion of what constitutes a crime has evolved during 
the last few years and the last few decades in Canada.
<P>
	Since this bill aims at keeping a closer eye on dangerous 
criminals, at providing the justice system with the means to act in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9758"> 9758 </A></B>
<P>
order to prevent dangerous offenders from being released, it is a 
step in the right direction,  because it gives us tools we did not have 
before and without which we could not control, at the end of a 
sentence, the behaviour of an individual who obviously is going to 
reoffend.
<P>
	Bill C-55 allows the government, through the courts, to act in 
order to control dangerous offenders by giving indeterminate 
sentences. It also adds a new category of criminals who will be 
designated as long term offenders and it includes provisions that 
make the release of some inmates subject to certain conditions, 
where the inmates will have to report and guarantee that their 
release will represent the lowest possible risk for society. We can 
easily agree that we need to get involved in these matters, as we 
mentioned at second reading.
<P>
	That left us with the two obvious issues raised by section 810.2 
and the provisions concerning electronic monitoring, which were 
giving up some problems. By the way, these two clauses were 
considered in detail in committee.
<P>
	Section 810.2 as it was introduced in this House was totally 
unacceptable. It meant to give the attorney general the power to use 
an institution set up, according to our criminal law, to settle the 
relations between individuals, what is called a ``peace bond'' in 
English. This is a procedure created under British common law in 
which the state or the crown does not interfere. The classic example 
university students are given is that of a rejected lover who keeps 
pursuing his old flame, who in turns asks for a court order in order 
to get some peace, hence the term ``peace bond'', I guess.
<P>
<B>(1635)</B>
<P>
	In the original bill that was brought forward, section 810.2 
authorized the attorney general to request, on behalf of the state, 
the issuance of a peace bond requiring the person against whom the 
peace bond has been issued to comply with strict conditions.
<P>
	The state was interfering with private relationships in criminal or 
privacy matters, which seemed unacceptable to us when we studied 
the bill, and at the second reading stage.
<P>
	Things have evolved, and our position was strongly supported by 
most witnesses who addressed section 810.2 specifically before the 
justice and legal affairs committee. Almost all of them said that the 
attorney general should not have the authority to request the 
issuance of a peace bond against someone.
<P>
	And we can see where the problem lies because we can imagine 
a situation where a judge, having heard a criminal case, may very 
well decide to acquit the accused on the basis of reasonable doubt, 
but in the case of a request by the attorney general for the issuance 
of a peace bond, the same judge having heard the same evidence 
may say: ``I did acquit you on the basis of reasonable doubt, but on 
the basis of the preponderance of evidence, I come to the 
conclusion that you have  committed the offence and that measures 
must be taken to protect society against you''.
<P>
	So there was a risk of having a grey category of people in 
Canadian society. We would have had people who were guilty, 
people who were innocent, of course, which is the vast majority of 
Canadians, but also people against whom a peace bond had been 
issued at the request of the state and who, having not been 
convicted of any criminal offence, would have had to account for 
their time and whereabouts to a probation officer or to the court. 
We thought it was absolutely unacceptable.
<P>
	In a free society such as ours where criminal law principles are 
based on age old values, we cannot tolerate or accept a situation 
where a person is in legal limbo, not knowing what his or her rights 
are.
<P>
	There are innocent people, and every citizen is presumed 
innocent, and there are some who have been found guilty.
<P>
	The amendments to section 810.2 mean that, henceforth, under 
the wording as it now stands at third reading, following pressure 
from the official opposition, following pressure from witnesses 
who appeared before the Standing Committee on Justice and Legal 
Affairs, section 810.2 has a new wording. I thank those who paid 
attention to the representations made for having taken them into 
account and given us a wording that now means that the peace bond 
provided for in 810.2 again becomes an bond between two people, 
to be used by an ordinary citizen against another person disturbing 
his peace.
<P>
	The only requirement that will be made under section 810.2, 
which is certainly a rather special peace bond given the 
consequences for anyone who violates it, is that an individual who 
wishes to avail himself of these provisions must so inform the 
attorney general.
<P>
	I think it normal, in an orderly society, that the attorney general 
responsible for the administration of justice under the provisions of 
our constitutional laws be aware of what is happening before our 
courts.
<P>
	The amendment to 810.2 disposes of our first objection in a 
positive manner. There goes one obstacle to our supporting Bill 
C-55. The public's rights are protected, but so are the rights of 
individuals, primarily the fundamental rights that are the heritage 
of those who for decades, not to say centuries, helped construct our 
criminal law, whether in the United Kingdom or in Canada. The 
values passed down to us are the same.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	It would have been unfortunate if a section passed on the sly 
challenged the very basis of what makes our criminal justice 
system so rich, that is the presumption of innocence and the clear 
distinction between the rights of individuals.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9759"> 9759 </A></B>
<P>
	Our second concern was about electronic surveillance involving 
those famous wrist bands to monitor someone without having to 
put him in jail. Was this appliance appropriate? One can still have 
concerns about it.
<P>
	Of course, at present, there is a considerable number of inmates, 
probably even a critical mass, so to speak, who do not have to be 
physically detained to be monitored. Those people represent a low 
to moderate risk. Can we rely on a system whereby a person 
wearing a wrist band will stay in contact by telephone with a police 
station in order to allow it to monitor his presence inside a given 
perimeter?
<P>
	Our main objection concerned the effectiveness of such a system 
and our capacity to apply it everywhere in Canada. Such measures 
would probably be easy to apply in cities like Toronto, Montreal, 
Quebec or Vancouver. However, in vast areas where 
communications are uncertain, where distances are so great that 
police stations that could act as headquarters for the monitoring of 
a criminal wearing a wrist band are quite far apart, I suggest that it 
would be difficult to implement such a system. Will inmates have 
to move to be eligible to the electronic surveillance program? I do 
not know.
<P>
	I still have doubts, but some of my concerns were answered in 
committee by some of the studies. They were answered, but we 
should keep in mind that witnesses told us that in the United States, 
for instance, field trials have shown that should the authorities lose 
contact with an individual, the electronic bracelet could be 
used-this is not in the bill-to inject a toxic substance causing 
cramps, diarrhoea or other rather debilitating physical symptoms.
<P>
	The loss of contact with the monitoring centre might be 
accidental. One must realize that there are limits. Let us try out the 
electronic bracelet. This piece of legislation could be revisited in a 
few months or a few years if problems arise; however, we should be 
aware that well organised groups, mainly south of the border, 
especially in the United States, have done research, are ready and 
have a technology that would make it possible to go much further 
and take steps that are unacceptable in a free and democratic 
society.
<P>
	The reliability of an electronic bracelet system can also be 
questioned. Will people lose contact with their monitoring centre 
unexpectedly, by accident, through no fault of their own? False 
alarms are quite possible in this area. This is probably a chance we 
have to take, if we want to see how good the system is.
<P>
	Of course, it will alleviate the problem of overcrowded prisons 
by not incarcerating a number of people who should not be put in 
jail and who are a financial burden first for the government, but 
also in terms of human resources remaining inactive. One should 
not think that keeping track from afar, by means of an electronic 
bracelet, of an individual who should be monitored is a panacea, 
the solution to all that ails us.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	But since the evidence presented to the Standing Committee on 
Justice and Legal Affairs shows that the advantages are greater than 
the disadvantages, we are ready to give it a chance and support the 
present wording of Bill C-55, including the clause on electronic 
surveillance of prisoners, subject to the earliest possible 
reassessment.
<P>
	There were some other points, such as accelerating the 
rehabilitation of prisoners who do not belong in prison, or 
penitentiary in the case of federal jurisdiction. We can also support 
these measures.
<P>
	In the end, after the committee review, our position changed 
because the bill was amended. Clearly I always come back to 
section 810.2, which was the main hurdle. Since it has been 
amended, we no longer have any reason to object to the bill so we 
will support Bill C-55 at third reading.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am very pleased to address Bill C-55 as amended by the Standing 
Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs.
<P>
	I trust that all members have noted the significant amendment to 
the judicial restraint order provision, deleting references to 
electronic monitoring.
<P>
	I want to emphasize to members the crucial importance of this 
bill. The Canadian public has told us without equivocation that it 
wants the government to devote its attention to violent criminals, to 
spend the criminal justice dollar where it will do the most good.
<P>
	Bill C-55 responds to that demand by giving the police, 
prosecutors and judges new tools for controlling violent offenders. 
It might have been easier for the government to simply amend the 
Criminal Code so as to lengthen sentences for every kind of 
offence. For example, if we doubled prison terms for every offence 
or imposed mandatory minimum sentences for every crime, it 
undoubtedly would have an impact. Of course the courts would be 
clogged with trials, are penitentiaries would be bursting at the 
seams and federal spending on corrections would expand almost 
endlessly.
<P>
	I do not believe that Canadians want such sweeping, unselective 
measures. They have told us they want well targeted laws that get 
tough with violent offenders.
<P>
	The public response to Bill C-55 has been very positive. The 
government supports the new long term offender concept which, in 
combination with the existing dangerous offender law, gives 
prosecutors another way to achieve long sentences for sex 
offenders.
<P>
	I would like to briefly list the major innovations contained in 
Bill C-55. Each of these changes improves the criminal justice 
system's ability to target high risk  offenders. Along the way I will 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9760"> 9760 </A></B>
<P>
mention three of the amendments contained in the standing 
committee's report.
<P>
	Bill C-55 improves the dangerous offender procedure contained 
in part 24 of the Criminal Code by requiring that a judge impose an 
indeterminate sentence in each case where a dangerous offender 
finding is made.
<P>
	Previously it was possible in exceptional circumstances for the 
court to impose a limited period of incarceration, although such 
sentences were rare. In foreclosing that option we are not really 
limiting the alternatives available to the court. An indeterminate 
sentence is fully justified when we consider that the prosecution 
will have proven in a special hearing that the offender has shown a 
pattern of repetitive behaviour and the likelihood of causing death 
or injury to other persons or causing severe psychological damage 
on other persons through failure in the future to restrain his 
behaviour.
<P>
	Bill C-55 also changes the date of the initial parole review of a 
dangerous offender from the third year of incarceration to the 
seventh year. It is important that offenders be eventually 
considered for parole. The fact that we are locking these offenders 
up indefinitely does not remove the need from a legal perspective 
for having a review of their dangerousness, but there never was any 
magic in conducting the first parole review after only three years. 
In fact, experience has shown that dangerous offenders are never 
released after such a short time.
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	A review at the seven year point seems more reasonable and 
more in line with the parole eligibility of violent offenders who 
otherwise receive long sentences of fixed duration. By the way, Bill 
C-55 would continue the provision for subsequent parole reviews 
every two years.
<P>
	Another innovation created by this bill is the extension of the 
period during which the crown may bring a dangerous offender 
application. The proposed section 753(2) will allow the prosecutor 
to give notice to the offender of a possible intention to make a 
dangerous offender application within six months. It is quite 
possible that new victims or witnesses may come forward after trial 
who will show the true extent of the offender's criminality and 
whose evidence can fully establish the pattern of past brutality 
required to meet the dangerous offender standard. This new clause 
gives the crown the flexibility it needs to put together its case in the 
aftermath of a trial and sentencing.
<P>
	A balance has been struck by the drafters of this provision. We 
have heard proposals to amend the Criminal Code to allow the 
dangerous offender application at anytime during the sentence or 
perhaps during the last year of sentence. Quite simply these models 
would not survive a constitutional challenge, a charter challenge, 
but this new window of opportunity is  workable. It applies for six 
months beyond the conviction and sentencing.
<P>
	It is circumscribed by rules that respect the rights of the 
defendant. For example, the prosecution must show that the new 
evidence has emerged that was not reasonably available at the time 
of sentencing and thus the crown has to exercise due diligence in 
the first place in marshalling evidence. Only when new relevant 
evidence appears can the delayed dangerous offender application 
be launched.
<P>
	Bill C-55 also removes the requirement that two psychiatrists 
testify at every dangerous offender hearing. A few witnesses before 
the the standing committee criticized this change in the law as 
though it somehow impinged on the rights of the defendant or 
reduced his ability to defend himself. This change does not reduce 
the ability of the defendant to introduce expert evidence and call 
evidence. The Criminal Code and the Canada Evidence Act 
continue to apply. All this amendment does is avoid the 
requirements for two psychiatrists to appear at every hearing. 
Unfortunately there is a shortage of qualified available forensic 
psychiatrists in some parts of Canada. In fact, in many dangerous 
offender cases both sides end up agreeing that one psychiatrist 
should testify.
<P>
	The long term offender sentencing category is at the centre of 
Bill C-55. This is a new measure. It not only enables the 
prosecution to seek extended controls over various kinds of serious 
sex offenders, but the procedure set up by Bill C-55 is linked to the 
dangerous offender process so that in many cases a long term 
offender finding may result as an alternative when a dangerous 
offender application does not succeed. It is worth taking a moment 
to explain the interaction between the two procedures.
<P>
	Let us assume that we are dealing with a case of aggravated 
sexual assault involving an offender with a history of violent 
offending. Upon conviction for the individual offence of 
aggravated sexual assault the crown can seek from the court a 
remand for assessment by experts. This assessment with serve both 
purposes, either a dangerous offender application or a long term 
offender application. Hopefully the assessment will invoke the 
skills of psychiatrists, criminologists and others who can come up 
with a sophisticated assessment of the risk posed by the offender.
<P>
<B>(1655 )</B>
<P>
	Once the assessment report is filed the prosecution can then 
decide which kind of application to make, but the crown has 
flexibility. This is the important point. Even if a dangerous 
offender application fails, the court can still find the offender to be 
a long term offender, provided of course that the criteria are met. In 
effect the court can say that the threshold for a dangerous offender 
finding is not satisfied but the same evidence supports a long term 
offender finding.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9761"> 9761 </A></B>
<P>
	Alternatively, the court can move quickly to bring a second 
hearing on top of the long term offender issue and accept more 
evidence.
<P>
	I would like to highlight one of the amendments contained in the 
standing committee's report. The Criminal Code already provides 
for input by victims of crime in criminal proceedings, either by 
personal testimony or through victim impact statements. It will 
certainly be important to hear from victims during the dangerous 
offender hearing. However, as I mentioned, when a dangerous 
offender finding is not made the judge may proceed with a second 
hearing on the long term offender issue. This could impose a 
hardship on crime victims if they have to testify again at a second 
hearing. Therefore the amendment explicitly states that any 
evidence already given by a victim or a victim's family at a 
dangerous offender hearing is also deemed to have been received at 
the subsequent long term offender hearing.
<P>
	The long term offender idea has received broad support. During 
the standing committee hearings it was supported by the Canadian 
Police Association, the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police, 
the British Columbia Civil Liberties Association, the Canadian 
Resource Centre for Victims of Crime and the victims rights group 
CAVEAT, among others.
<P>
	It targets sex offenders. It essentially goes after that group of 
offenders just below the dangerous offender level. These are sex 
offenders who are likely to receive serious prison time but who 
perhaps do not warrant an indeterminate sentence.
<P>
	Under Bill C-55 proposals they will indeed get their usual 
sentence of incarceration but in addition, and when found to be 
long term offenders, the court will order up to ten years of 
additional supervision in the community. Only when the offender 
has completed his penitentiary sentence, including parole, will the 
long term supervision period begin.
<P>
	The long term offender criteria requires on the one hand that the 
court find that there is a substantial risk that the offender will 
reoffend, on the other that there is a reasonable possibility of 
eventual control of that risk in the community.
<P>
	Are we trying to be optimistic and pessimistic at the same time? 
Let me point out again that the offender will get the usual sentence 
for imprisonment for his crime. The additional long term 
supervision period allows the national parole board and the 
correctional service to control the offender's gradual transition 
back to community life. The provision is intensive and the long 
term offender who breaches any of the conditions of the court's 
order can be pulled back into custody, not to mention charged with 
the newly created offence of breach of a long term supervision 
order.
<P>
	The third pillar of Bill C-55, which is admittedly controversial, 
is the new judicial restraint order to be  added to the Criminal Code 
as section 810.2. I remind my colleagues of the purpose of this new 
measure. This restraining order is modelled on the existing section 
810.1 which was designed to prevent offences against children.
<P>
	This new order is designed, somewhat more generally, to prevent 
serious personal injury offences. Despite the controversy swirling 
around this measure, its underlying principle has been clear from 
the beginning. The goal has always been to prevent violent 
incidents, to establish in a court of law the risk presented by certain 
individuals and to command those individuals to keep the peace 
and be of good behaviour; in other words, to meet the standard of 
conduct that is expected of them as participants in society. 
Conditions may be attached to these orders in much the same way 
that conditions are attached to probation orders or to other peace 
bonds.
<P>
<B>(1700)</B>
<P>
	A lot of newsprint has been devoted to the question of electronic 
monitoring in section 810.2. The original bill envisioned electronic 
monitoring controls being imposed as a condition attached to the 
judicial restraint order but only where the court thought it would be 
appropriate and where such programs are available. In case some of 
my colleagues think that electronic monitoring is an abstract idea 
or science fiction I invite them to look at the facts. Several 
Canadian provinces use electronic monitoring in conjunction with 
supervision to manage probationers and other offenders.
<P>
	British Columbia, for example, has 350 offenders in its program 
at any one time. These programs are expanding. Call it what you 
want, a control mechanism, a monitoring device, a crime 
prevention tool, electronic monitoring programs have their place.
<P>
	However, concerns have been expressed about the capacity of 
the criminal justice system to use the technology appropriately and 
with sufficient moderation in the context of restraining orders. The 
most common use of technology has been to ensure that the 
offender remains in his or her home and only leaves the premises 
according to a set schedule.
<P>
	We are all familiar with the concept of electronic bracelets being 
applied to offenders. The standing committee, after hearing a 
number of witnesses, concluded that we should be cautious in the 
use of such technology in situations that are entirely preventive. In 
other words, electronic monitoring, as presently used by Canadian 
provinces, curtails liberty to some extent. We should be careful in 
applying it where the subject is not actually convicted of any 
offence.
<P>
	The reprinted bill deletes all explicit references to electronic 
monitoring in connection with the proposed judicial restraint order 
and I believe that this significant change should satisfy the critics 
of the legislation.
<P>
	To summarize, Bill C-55 as amended, delivers on the 
government's commitment to strengthen the law to  control sex 
offenders. It is solidly based on three years of work by the 
federal-provincial 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9762"> 9762 </A></B>
<P>
task force. It is supported by the provinces which ultimately have 
the responsibility of prosecuting these offenders.
<P>
	Police support this bill. The standing committee supports it and 
has introduced amendments to improve it. I commend this bill to 
my colleagues.
<P>
	I just want to add that the bill presents another significant step 
forward in the efforts of the government to make our streets and 
homes safer places to be. The Minister of Justice has introduced 
significant reforms to criminal justice. As well, the Solicitor 
General has introduced a number of reforms. More reforms have 
been introduced to the criminal justice system, more steps have 
been taken to toughen up the criminal justice system than have ever 
been taken by any single government in the history of our nation.
<P>
	This is something of which we can be very proud. This particular 
effort is the result of collaboration between the federal government, 
the provinces and hearing submissions from the many interested 
parties. I wish to thank all those who have been involved in the 
process.
<P>
	As a number of commentators have indicated, the bill is the most 
significant improvement and change in the Criminal Code in 
dealing with violent offenders that has been introduced in decades. 
Of that we can be very proud. I commend the Minister of Justice 
for his efforts, those on the standing committee who have put 
forward some intelligent, common sense amendments and for all 
the hard work that has been put into this bill, a lot of people deserve 
credit. We commend it to the Canadian people.
<P>
<B>(1705 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, if 
that is the best this government can do, no wonder the country is in 
trouble. If that is the best bill the justice minister can come up with 
to deal with violent offenders, no wonder there are so many victims 
out there. It is going to continue because the bottom line is that 
violent offenders will still be released back out into the community. 
The checks and balances are neutral when it comes to dealing with 
the most violent offenders in our society.
<P>
	Let us look at some statistics. These are from the parole board. 
This data from the board deals with violent and serious offenders. It 
states that only about one-half of a violent offender's sentence is 
served. I would assume that includes murderers. Attempted 
murderers, for example, serve an average of 48 months when the 
courts have really sentenced them to 94 months. That is only 
one-half of the sentence. The parole board is releasing violent 
criminals after they have served one-half of their sentence. In the 
cases of manslaughter, the actual time served by the offenders 
averaged 44 months when the original court sentence was 84 
months.
<P>
	Finally, with respect to people who have committee aggravated 
assault or rape, the average offender was released after having 
served 49 months, 4 years, of a sentence of 79 months. This bill 
does not address any of that other than the fact that the government 
insists on releasing the violent offenders back out into the 
community.
<P>
	What are the answers? I think there are answers. First, we have 
to start looking at what is happening in our courts. A sentence 
given is not served any more, as I have stated. Approximately 
one-half of the sentence is served. It is high time we went back to 
truth in sentencing. The rehabilitative model that is touted on the 
government side has been a dismal failure. Truth in sentencing 
laws would bring some sort of balance back into the system.
<P>
	If a rapist received a 10-year sentence, which it is unlikely, he 
would then serve that sentence. That is what we and the people of 
this country are looking for and want. People want to have a 
measure of safety in their communities. Unfortunately many 
people are not feeling that which will be very evident in the next 
election.
<P>
	Just going door to door in my riding I am picking that up at the 
door. I know that the members across the way are also picking that 
up. In fact, there are some people in the lobby right now visiting 
from British Columbia who are picking it up because they have 
been personally hit by crime as victims. Apart from that, the 
average person feels very uneasy and unsafe on our streets right 
now.
<P>
	We talk about truth in sentencing and about a sentence given 
should be a sentence served. In other words, life should mean life 
with no eligibility for parole. Why should a first degree murderer 
get out on the street at any time? There is no reason for it. Why 
should a man who has taken another man's or woman's life get out 
on the street?
<P>
	If we look at the statistics on first degree murderers we see that 
out of the 46 who applied for early release up to mid-1995, 11 
killed women: their wives, girlfriends or people they knew. They 
received early release. I would say that a murderer would definitely 
fall into the classification of a dangerous offender. Yet those who 
have been convicted of that heinous crime are being released on to 
the street.
<P>
<B>(1710)</B>
<P>
	Eight of those 46 killed policemen. That is a deliberate act. No 
mistake can be made that it was other than the intention of killing 
the police officer, the person in authority.
<P>
	Three of those murderers who obtained early release killed 
children. I am sorry but I do not see this bill addressing any of that. 
The sentence given by the courts is being chopped by the parole 
board and by applications for early release. Now other provisions 
under section 55 allegedly restrain them further but I do not see 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9763"> 9763 </A></B>
<P>
where the  restraint is. Violent offenders are still getting out on our 
streets. Bill C-55 does not stop it.
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary spoke of indeterminate sentencing, 
that a court will decide whether or not the offender will continue to 
serve his time. That may be well and good but it is also putting it on 
the shoulders of the courts. The court's dealings with those types of 
offenders has not been very good.
<P>
	I have an individual in my riding by the name of Tocher. I 
mentioned him the other day. Since 1982, he has been abusing kids. 
He abused three boys in the last set of offences. Now he is in court 
and has been given a short sentence again, something like 18 
months. He has been doing that since 1982. He has been in and out 
of the court system five times for similar types of offences. What 
good are the courts doing? He has never been declared a dangerous 
offender. That available to the courts at the time. What is going to 
change? It is just going to be business as usual.
<P>
	The answer to the alleged crowding problem in our prisons is to 
release him into the community. I do not see Bill C-55 changing a 
whole lot.
<P>
	How can we have a guarantee that the message is going to get to 
the criminal? What is the guarantee? The criminal has to 
understand that if he steps across the line that this will happen to 
him. The sentence, the incarceration and the place where he spends 
it will not be pleasant because he stepped over the line.
<P>
	We put an amendment forward on this bill. It was called a two 
strikes amendment. In other words, if someone commits a violent 
offence, and serves the majority of the time, the message would be 
sent to that offender that if he committed a second offence, he 
would go away for an indefinite period of time. The sentence will 
be a minimum of 15 years if he commits another violent offence, 
perhaps even longer, maybe even life.
<P>
	That message has to be sent to the offender. It is a revolving door 
in our prisons. It is a well known fact that 70 per cent of those 
serving time have served time before.
<P>
	There is no reason why the government could not send that 
message to a criminal. The criminals are getting arrogant because 
they know they can get away with too much. They are getting 
arrogant when they pick on our kids. They do it time and time again 
because nothing happens to them. They are not treated like 
criminals. Sure, they are restrained from moving around for a little 
while but everybody rushes to protect them and support them. 
Some say that it is society's fault. Unfortunately it is their fault 
because they are the ones who chose to commit the crime that put 
them in jail.
<P>
<B>(1715)</B>
<P>
	I have said these things in public before. There is no reason I 
should not have said them. I think the majority of people want to 
see stiffer penalties for prisoners.
<P>
	I paid a visit to the Bowden Institution, a prison in Alberta. The 
prisoners heard that I was coming and circulated a petition about 
my anticipated arrival. Many of those serving time look at me as a 
threat because I tell them that they should be working for a living. 
Even if they are behind bars they should be productive. The 
productivity rate inside our prisons is a dismal shame. If prisoners 
are not unemployed in prison, the majority of them are 
underemployed by far. Part of my theme was that they should be 
working for a living.
<P>
	Activist prisoners within the prison system circulated a poster 
that said: ``Art Hanger is coming to threaten the inmates of 
Bowden. Art Hanger wants you to have no temporary absences or 
parole''. They are absolutely right. I do not want them to have a lot 
of temporary absences or parole. Why should they have? They are 
serving time for committing the crimes that put them in there. They 
should be paying society back for their crimes. They should be 
doing something instead of being out on parole. The parole system 
is obviously not working.
<P>
	The poster also said: ``Art Hanger wants you to be involved in 
slave labour''. I do want them to work, absolutely. Why should 
they not work? They call that slave labour. They should be doing all 
kinds of things. Maybe they should even be earning a wage and a 
portion of it could go to support the victims they victimized. They 
could pay for their room and board. Then maybe they could keep 
some of the money left over as a stake for when they get out.
<P>
	There is another nonsensical part of the Correctional Service of 
Canada's policy. Inmates are only allowed to accumulate $80. 
When they walk out the door of the prison they have no money in 
their pockets. They have barely enough to survive for a night. They 
should at least be earning minimum wage but they should be 
productive. They should be doing something.
<P>
	The poster goes on to say that I want them to have no recreation. 
The riot in Millhaven was a result of change in routine. Inmates felt 
they should have more recreation time. To get their point across 
they killed a man. They wanted to tell management they were 
unhappy because they were not getting what they wanted, more 
recreational time or a return to the old routine. There is something 
wrong with that mentality.
<P>
	The poster goes on to indicate that I want them castrated and 
tortured. I do not want them castrated or tortured. Nor has Reform 
ever said that in any of its policies. This is their concern. I 
understand why they may have that concern in that 70 per cent of 
the inmates in the Bowden Institution are sex offenders.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9764"> 9764 </A></B>
<P>
	There is something wrong with the attitude of the offenders in 
our jails today. It has been nurtured by the corrections policy and 
supported by government sanctioned rights. There is something 
wrong.
<P>
	It went on to say that I wanted them locked up for 24 hours. I 
want them locked up for 24 hours. In fact I want them locked up 
until they serve their entire sentences, as do most people in the 
country do. The violent offender should not get out until he has 
served his sentence. The violent offender should stay in there and 
work to pay for his keep.
<P>
<B>(1720)</B>
<P>
	The poster summed up their list of complaints about me in the 
following statement: ``Art Hanger wants you dead''. I do not want 
them dead. I want them to correct their behaviour and I see that the 
present system is not helping them do that. It is creating arrogance 
among the prison population. They know they will not be punished 
for what they do. They will be detained for a while, but everybody 
rushes in to protect them, to help them and to counsel them. There 
is no punishment. from the viewpoint of those inside that is what 
our system is all about. I might add that is shared by prisoners in 
other prisons. I have talked to enough prisoners to know.
<P>
	There is also something wrong on the management side, the 
policy makers. Along with two other members I had an opportunity 
to go to Edmonton maximum security in December 1995. There 
was a lot of snow on the ground. It was much like northern 
Saskatchewan where the parliamentary secretary to the justice 
minister lives. The prison houses approximately 400 prisoners. The 
warden heard we were coming. He wanted to make sure the staff of 
the prison knew we were coming. He sent out a memo which 
happened to get into the hands of the press and of the Reform Party. 
This is what it stated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The members for Calgary Northwest, Fraser Valley West and the member for Wild 
Rose will be visiting us on December 1, 1995. These gentlemen are known to be 
ardent critics of CSC and are quite vocal in expressing their views.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I want to ensure that Edmonton Institution is at its best, giving very little reason 
for criticism. Therefore this institution will be spotless. Areas needing paint will be 
painted. Inmates will be visibly at work during their tour (as they should be anyway) 
and programs will be in full swing. This includes the protective custody unit.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I do not want to see inmates lying around doing nothing (not that this would 
happen anyway). I have not seen a lot of activity that involves inmates shovelling 
snow. The walks should not be cleared with snow-blowers. Push shovels are more 
appropriate. Buy them if you need them.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	For what? The message was just because we came to visit them. 
They wanted to have the appearance that everything was okay and 
that everyone in the prison was working. There is something wrong 
with a policy that allows things like that to happen in our prison 
system.
<P>
	As a result Bill C-55 is an attempt to sound like something is 
being done. What is being done? Nothing. There is no punishment 
in the present correctional system. There is no accountability as 
there should be. It is a revolving door.
<P>
	We would like to see accountability. We want to see sentences 
delivered by our courts fully served, especially those of violent 
offenders. We want to see two strikes legislation. Why should a 
person after being released once and committing another violent 
offence have the same opportunity to serve another short sentence 
and be back out on the streets to do it for a third time? Why should 
that happen? No wonder the list of victims and victims groups is 
growing. It will continue to grow because violent offenders are still 
being released into society. Their behaviour has not been corrected 
in spite of all the programs and the case management reports.
<P>
<B>(1725)</B>
<P>
	I thought of another case management report directed to the 
killer of a policeman. A fellow, Craig Munro, allowed a police 
officer to bleed to death after he shot him and held him hostage. 
Now he is applying for early release. He is a shooter. The man 
should not even have an opportunity to make application. Yet the 
government is insisting on leaving that provision in there. It is 
insisting on turning violent criminals back out on to the street 
under Bill C-55.
<P>
	I turn to one of the most significant devastating crimes in this 
decade and in the ones coming up. I am referring to the area of sex 
crimes, pedophilia, and crimes against children. It already is 
extensive. If we talk to the sex crimes and child abuse units in any 
police department, we find they cannot even handle the number of 
complaints they get. They have to refer them to social services. The 
cases they are referring are becoming more and more intense, 
difficult and substantive. The police cannot keep up.
<P>
	How will we handle pedophiles? Long term offenders provisions 
will not do it. The parliamentary secretary to the justice minister 
should explain how that will happen. It will not going to happen. It 
will be status quo court decisions and status quo incarceration for 
very short periods of time.
<P>
	I just finished relating the story of Mr. Tocher and the number of 
times he has been in and out of the prison system. He kept going 
back and forth over the last 15 years. He is victimizing our kids. Is 
it any wonder parents complain when they see somebody hanging 
around a playground zone such as happened in Calgary? Parents 
complained about a adult male hanging persistently around the 
playground zone. They were frightened and the police could not do 
anything about it. He had a record as a pedophile and the police 
could not do anything about it.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="9765"> 9765 </A></B>
<P>
	I said I would do something about it. They organized and 
protested in and around the park until the police went in there and 
laid some charge on him. It is awareness. Parents are concerned 
about their kids and the long term offender provisions in Bill C-55 
will not touch them. Most police officers, most prison staff and 
even psychiatrists say that pedophiles cannot be cured. What can 
we do? We should keep them in prison for a long, long time.
<P>
	It should be on the shoulders of the psychiatrist and whoever else 
signs the document that releases a pedophile to guarantee he will 
not reoffend. If he does they should pay the consequence. 
Somebody has to be held accountable and that is not happening in 
our present system.
<P>
	Many provisions in Bill C-55 sound like they are doing the right 
thing. Pedophilia is inadequately addressed. The Criminal Code 
should be expanded to address the impact which pedophilia has on 
kids.
<P>
	I have not addressed the judicial restraint provision which, as the 
parliamentary secretary stated, will be in section 810 of the 
Criminal Code. That provision will be extremely difficult to 
enforce.
<P>
	The Reform Party will vote against the bill, in part because the 
government did not accept the amendments put forward by 
Reform. Those amendments would have made the bill much 
stronger.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It is my duty, pursuant to Standing Order 
38, to inform the House that the questions to be raised tonight at the 
time of adjournment are as follows: the hon. member for 
Davenport-the environment; the hon. member for 
Chicoutimi-social housing.

	The House resumed from April 14 consideration of Bill C-44, an 
act for making the system of Canadian ports competitive, efficient 
and commercially oriented, providing for the establishing of port 
authorities and the divesting of certain harbours and ports, for the 
commercialization of the St. Lawrence Seaway and ferry services 
and other matters related to maritime trade and transport and 
amending the Pilotage Act and amending the repealing other acts 
as a consequence, as reported (with amendments) from the 
committee.
<P>

on Motion No. 1 applies to Motions Nos. 30, 50 to 57 inclusive, 60, 
63, 82 and 113.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kilger:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. If the House 
would agree, I would propose that you seek unanimous consent that 
members who voted on the previous motion be recorded as having 
voted on the motion now before the House, with Liberal members 
voting yea.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Does the House give its unanimous 
consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The problem is that everybody voted yes 
last time. Apparently we will need one more vote.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kilger:</B> Mr. Speaker, I understand that some members may 
not have voted on the previous motion. It might be worth our time 
to have one vote to identify the full participation of the members 
presently in the House. Then, hopefully we will have the 
co-operation required to apply the vote. I would suggest that we go 
ahead with the vote as you had planned.

	<B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should amend Section 108.1 of 
the Canada Labour Code to include a provision that would permit employees to vote 
on any restructuring offer put forward by their employer.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I would ask for the unanimous consent of 
the House to allow me to split my time with the hon. member for 
Prince George-Peace River.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is there consent for the member to split 
his time?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Johnston:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to move MotionNo. 308 today, which reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of the House, the government should amend Section 108.1 of 
the Canada Labour Code to include a provision that would permit employees to vote 
on any restructuring offer put forward by their employer.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This motion came about because of the Canadian Airlines crisis 
late last year. The House will recall that on November 1 the 
president of Canadian Airlines International announced that his 
company would run out of money by the beginning of the year. To 
save the company and the jobs of 16,000 employees, the company 
developed a last hope restructuring plan that required $70 million 
in wage rollbacks from the unions, as well as major concessions 
from creditors and the American parent, AMR Corporation.
<P>
	Before the November 26 deadline, four of the six unions agreed 
to participate in this plan. The holdouts, however, were the 
Canadian Auto Workers, which  represented 3,700 ticket agents, 
and the Canadian Union of Public Employees, which represented 
2,600 flight attendants. The CUPE representative was obviously 
swayed by CAW's attempt to negotiate a government bailout, so 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9785"> 9785 </A></B>
<P>
both refused to allow their membership to vote directly on 
Benson's plan.
<P>
	The union members held rallies demanding the right to vote, but 
their cries fell on the deaf ears of their union bosses, who held out, 
waiting for the government to come across with moneys and/or 
concessions.
<P>
	History has shown that in situations like this the federal 
government usually comes in like a white knight and offers a 
taxpayer-funded bailout. This time, having just awarded 
Bombardier a sweet $87 million interest free loan, the Liberals 
sensed, and quite rightly so, that there would be no public support 
for such a bailout.
<P>
	The president of the CAW and CUPE were not employees of 
Canadian Airlines so their jobs were not on the line. With no real 
personal stake in the fate of Canadian Airlines, they were willing to 
take the risk of the company's bankruptcy and the loss of 16,000 
jobs. If the airline collapsed, at least they had served notice to the 
government that they were ready to play hard ball and this would 
ultimately benefit future negotiations involving much larger 
companies in which they represent the unions.
<P>
	The employees had a democratic right to be heard. Throughout 
the crisis the Reform Party called on the government to ensure that 
the democratic rights of the workers were upheld. Time and again 
government ministers said: ``Yes, but the rules do not allow it''.
<P>
	The Reform Party opposes bailouts, but it also opposes inaction. 
The government did have an option which would not have cost the 
taxpayers a cent.
<P>
	The member for Calgary Southwest, the leader of the Reform 
Party, asked the Minister of Labour on November 28 if the 
government would ``be willing to introduce forthwith an 
amendment authorizing the Minister of Labour to direct an 
employee vote on restructuring offers such as that being put 
forward by Canadian Airlines to its own employees''. To this query 
the labour minister replied: ``It is up to management and the unions 
to decide and find the necessary procedure to have a vote on this 
matter''.
<P>
<B>(1855)</B>
<P>
	The human resources development committee was meeting that 
same day to review the government's proposed amendments to the 
Canada Labour Code known as Bill C-66. I moved a motion in that 
committee that read: ``Due to the critical situation at Canadian 
Airlines, this committee undertake to enter an immediate review of 
section 108.1 of the Canada Labour Code to permit employees to 
vote on any restructuring offer put forth by a company''. The 
motion was defeated by the government MPs on the committee and 
by their friends  in the official opposition. In fact, the parliamentary 
secretary went so far as to say that even considering giving 
employees the right to vote on any proposal was in his words ``a 
waste of the committee's time''.
<P>
	This was the opportune time to open the issue for discussion and 
come up with a permanent solution so that workers would never 
again find themselves in this predicament. By its actions the 
government told the 6,300 employees in those two unions, and 
unionized workers in all federally regulated industries, that their 
government was not prepared to waste its time ensuring that their 
democratic rights were upheld.
<P>
	I believe that there is a fundamental problem with the Canada 
Labour Code when employees are not given an opportunity to save 
their own company. Employees deserve that right and the Reform 
Party stands firmly behind their right to an open, democratic 
process. The government was not swayed by the Canadian 
Airlines' employees who pleaded for the right to vote because they 
needed those jobs and feared that prolonged uncertainty would 
irreparably damage the company. The government got lucky when 
the flight attendants came on side.
<P>
	Now with five of the six unions on side, Canadian Airlines' fate 
was in the hands of CAW President Buzz Hargrove who steadfastly 
refused to allow the 3,700 ticket agents to voice their opinion.
<P>
	Christmas was coming, a spring election was looming and 
Canadian Airlines was facing imminent disaster. The Government 
of Canada refused to act until the 11th hour. After telling Canadians 
for weeks that the rules did not permit government intervention, the 
Minister of Labour suddenly invoked an obscure clause in the 
Canada Labour Code to order a vote. This is not a new provision in 
the Canada Labour Code. It was there all along.
<P>
	I want to make it clear that what we are advocating is giving 
employees the right to vote on their futures. We would not want to 
be so presumptuous as to predict the outcome of such a vote. All 
Reform asked in this case, and similar situations that are bound to 
arise in the future, was the assurance that each employee be given 
the option of voting on restructuring proposals. Did the 
government initiate action that would benefit all workers? Not at 
all. It was too afraid to make any meaningful changes. This is yet 
another quick fix, another one time only solution, more crisis 
management.
<P>
	Once again the government proves it lacks vision. The changing 
workplace is more than just a name of another government task 
force. It is reality and it is time that the government shed its out of 
date approach to industrial relations. Workers, employers and 
union reps all need a level playing field. They all have the right to 
know where they stand and that they can rely on the Canada Labour 
Code to promote and protect their democratic rights.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9786"> 9786 </A></B>
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, you have often heard me say in the House that 
the Reform Party recognizes the rights of workers to organize 
democratically, to bargain collectively and to strike peacefully. We 
stand by that statement. But what we are also seeking for 
unionized workers is the right to be counted when there is a 
restructuring plan on the table that determines whether or not their 
company stays in business, and ultimately whether they would 
continue to be employed in that enterprise or seek jobs elsewhere.
<P>
<B>(1900 )</B>
<P>
	Some employees, when faced with the proposition of a company 
being on shaky financial ground, may say it is time to cut their 
losses and seek greener and more secure pastures. That should be 
their decision. It should not be part of a power struggle between 
union bosses who have little or no personal stake in the outcome.
<P>
	As it turned out in this case the 2,600 CUPE employees voted in 
favour of the proposal by 87 per cent. Some 81 per cent of the 3,700 
CAW workers voted to accept the company's restructuring plan. At 
least in the end the decision was the employees to make.
<P>
	As legislators it is our duty to ensure that all employees who fall 
under the jurisdiction of the Canada Labour Code are assured this 
democratic right.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to rise this evening to briefly 
address Motion No. 308 in the name of my hon. colleague from 
Wetaskiwin which states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should amend section 108.1 of 
the Canada Labour Code to include a provision that would permit employees to vote 
on any restructuring offer put forward by their employer.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This is a very worthwhile motion. If it leads to the necessary 
amendment and is passed, it would certainly be a step in the right 
direction of ensuring that democracy truly rules in all corporations 
that are restructuring.
<P>
	It is a privilege for me to set the record straight. One thing of 
concern to a number of Reform members and Reform supporters 
across the land was the virtual exclusion by the national media of 
Reform bringing forward the issue when the Canadian Airlines 
story was foremost in the media and in the minds of many people 
early in the winter.
<P>
	If we were to check <I>Hansard</I> we would see a series of questions, 
statements and speeches were made in this place on behalf of 
Canadian Airlines employees by Reform members of Parliament. 
We led the story in the House of Commons day after day. However, 
because the national media did not pick up on our involvement in 
the story, we were continuously asked why we were ignoring it 
when in fact we were not.
<P>
	I thank my hon. colleague from Wetaskiwin for putting forward 
the motion. It allows me to briefly set the record straight.
<P>
	As the member so eloquently outlined during his remarks, two 
primary issues prompted him to bring forward the motion. The first 
was the fundamental issue of a level playing field. We were the first 
voices to push for the removal of the federal fuel tax on aviation 
fuels. This would allow Canadian Airlines and all other Canadian 
air carriers to compete internationally on a level playing field with 
their foreign competitors. I certainly give credit to my hon. 
colleague from Kootenay West-Revelstoke for pushing that in the 
House of Commons before anyone else had brought the issue to the 
forefront.
<P>
<B>(1905 )</B>
<P>
	The primary focus of the motion is to ensure all Canadian 
employees of companies and corporations have the opportunity to 
vote when the future of the company and thus the existence of their 
jobs are at stake. As my hon. colleague from Wetaskiwin stated so 
well, we have to ensure that true democracy is paramount.
<P>
	That brings us to the whole issue of democratic reform. In the 
few minutes I have left I would like to speak to the need for 
democratic reform, a fundamental issue that attracted me to the 
Reform Party of Canada.
<P>
	If there is anyone who knows how badly we are in need of 
democratic reform, it is the MPs who speak on a daily basis, not 
just Reform ones. We hear cries for democratic reform and true 
free votes in the House of Commons from other political parties.
<P>
	I am reminded of what led us to this point. A couple of members 
of the Conservative Party were trying to accurately represent their 
constituents on an issue as important as the GST. They were thrown 
out of the Progressive Conservative Party.
<P>
	I well remember as a farmer watching the news on a farm outside 
Fort St. John and seeing the arrogance of then Prime Minister Brian 
Mulroney, a political leader whom we had the good fortune or 
otherwise to witness yesterday on national television. He was 
bragging to Canadian people that he had thrown those two 
backbench members out of his party because they dared to vote 
against his party. I thought there should have been a rising 
sentiment from the Canadian public expressing that it had simply 
had enough. Recently we saw the same thing happen with the 
Liberal Party when the member for York South-Weston voted 
against that party.
<P>
	There is a fundamental need for democratic reform, for true free 
votes in this place. There is a need for recall of members who do 
not accurately represent their constituents.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9787"> 9787 </A></B>
<P>
	Private member's Bill C-210 of my hon. colleague from Beaver 
River would accomplish that if it were supported by the 
government side of the House. The old parties are resistant to 
these types of democratic changes, although I hasten to add not 
all of their members are. Many members recognize a growing 
awareness among the public of a need for democratic reform of 
government institutions.
<P>
	The Reform Party and I have pushed for referendums on subjects 
such as capital punishment. We will continue to expound upon the 
use of referendums, national binding referendums for Canadian 
people to direct this place to enact laws supported by the majority.
<P>
	I would be remiss in the minute or so remaining if I did not speak 
about a certain democratic reform that has been part of the Reform 
Party's blue book of policies and principles from the very 
beginning, the support of Reformers of fixed election dates.
<P>
	The people of Canada will have the opportunity to voice their 
concern about that plank and a host of others as we move into the 
federal election that is expected to be called as early as 11 days 
from now. I suspect Canadians will be well aware of that plank in 
our platform. We believe there should be four-year terms so that 
everyone knows when an election will be called.
<P>
	Those are some of the democratic changes the Reform Party of 
Canada and I support. We are looking forward to the next 
campaign, as we have the last two campaigns, to present to 
Canadian voters a clear alternative for democratic renewal and 
democratic reform of government institutions.
<P>
<B>(1910)</B>
<P>
	I would be remiss if I did not mention the other place and the 
need for a triple E Senate. Unlike some parties we do not believe in 
the abolition of the upper chamber. We believe in reforming it to be 
a true triple E Senate: elected, equal and effective.
<P>
	I will close by saying that I support my hon. colleague for 
Wetaskiwin in bringing forward Motion No. 308. It gave me the 
opportunity to speak briefly about the need for democratic reforms 
not only of the Canada Labour Code but of many other things.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean):</B> Mr. Speaker, first of 
all, I would like to say that when I was nominated recently in my 
riding, between 130 and 135 people came to the meeting. I would 
like to start by thanking these people who may be listening at 
home. It was March 25, which happened to be the first anniversary 
of my election win last year.
<P>
	This year has been filled with a lot of emotion, a lot of 
experience and a lot of learning. As I look back, I think I can be 
satisfied with this first year. I think the record for the first year is 
positive. From the outset, learning the  ropes was not easy, but I 
managed to adjust. I even initiated a number of projects in my 
riding and I am pleased with the results. I hope I have a chance to 
keep working on these projects.
<P>
	As I said, since I entered politics, I often saw things that were 
rather extraordinary. This afternoon I was listening to the whip for 
the Reform Party who said that the third party option was probably 
the one with the best prospects, in that it was more attractive to the 
rest of Canada and Quebec.
<P>
	When I look at the motion presented by the Reform Party today, 
I am afraid I do not quite agree. Clearly, the Reform Party is on the 
far right, while we tend to be more to the left or the centre.
<P>
	In any case, let me explain this motion on labour disputes. We 
are of course against the motion, and I will tell you why. If I may 
summarize the motion, basically it concerns the unions, labour 
disputes and relations between employers and the unions.
<P>
	Unions were originally formed by groups of employees who got 
together to fight for better working conditions and to have more 
clout when facing their employer. That is pretty clear.
<P>
	The motion by the Reform Party suggests that in certain labour 
disputes the Minister of Labour would have his say, this in any 
dispute where we have the employer's position on one side and the 
employees' position on the other side, represented by the unions. In 
many cases these labour disputes can go on for some time. And that 
is because there is a disagreement.
<P>
	In this motion, the Reform Party suggests giving more power to 
the minister to intervene in any labour dispute across the country. 
He could come and give his opinion and tell the parties to stop. To 
the extent that employees would be able to vote in favour of an 
agreement without going through the unions.
<P>
<B>(1915)</B>
<P>
	We believe strongly that the minister's powers must not be 
increased, but rather decreased. The debate of a few years ago gave 
rise to the Sims' report. I will read a few extracts.
<P>
	On page 167, the Sims report discusses the administration of the 
Canada Labour Code. It provides, and I quote: ``Management and 
labour run labour relations, not government''.
<P>
	The authors of the report continue a few pages along with the 
recommendation that: ``The Minister's current powers under 
sections 57(5), 59, 71, 72 to 82, 105 and 108.1(1) should be vested 
with (or amenable to delegation to) the Head of the FMCS''. This is 
completely contrary to today's motion.
<P>
	Secondly, the report recommends: ``The section 97(3) 
requirement for Ministerial consent to file complaints to the Board 
should be repealed''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9788"> 9788 </A></B>
<P>
	We must remember that, after people were brought together to 
consider the situation, they concluded that the minister should 
have fewer powers. Today, however, the Reform motion is 
proposing to give the minister more power. It is like putting a 
bandaid on a sore. Could you listen, please.
<P>
	The Reform Party has a lot of supporters in western Canada. We 
will recall the recent labour dispute between the employees and 
management of Canadian airlines. There were a number of unions 
in Canadian, including one that turned a deaf ear to management 
proposals. That extended the dispute, because the unions 
representing the employees thought that was the best thing to do.
<P>
	So the Reform Party, a party of the right, hoping perhaps to come 
up with some votes, is proposing the motion we are considering 
this evening.
<P>
	Furthermore, this motion is pro-management, because the 
minister could always go over the heads of the unions to find out 
and interpret for himself the intent of a firm's employees.
<P>
	So the unions' powers are being cut, and, what is more, they are 
saying the minister should have the power to circumvent the 
powers of the union. Yet these unions were born of a need. Today 
they are saying there is no longer a need.
<P>
	So even though this motion is not votable, we oppose it, as the 
bias in favour of the employers is too strong. I have nothing against 
them and I also do not want to favour unions over management. I 
am trying to favour a good relationship between the parties, but this 
evening's motion smells too much like an election ploy. However, 
we will see what our colleagues have to say.
<P>
	That concludes my remarks on motion M-308.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. George Proud (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Labour, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to address the 
motion put forward by the member for Wetaskiwin.
<P>
	Canadians have many things of which to be proud and our labour 
relations history is just one of those things. In my short time as 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Labour I have seen 
many aspects of our labour relations that are truly quite impressive.
<P>
	We have achieved a system that balances the rights of workers 
and employers and that recognizes both the importance of labour 
and the right of management to conduct business.
<P>
<B>(1920 )</B>
<P>
	Keeping this balance takes adjustment as times and needs 
change. That is what the government is doing. Last week, with no 
thanks to the third party, of course, Bill C-66 passed third reading. 
The amendments contained in  Bill C-66 will improve the Canada 
Labour Code far more than what my colleague opposite is 
proposing in his motion.
<P>
	I will be talking about those shortly, but first I want to address 
Motion No. 308 and explain why something that sounds so sensible 
at face value in fact threatens the very delicate balance on which 
Canada's industrial stability is based. Motion No. 308 proposes 
that employees be permitted to vote on any restructuring offer put 
forward by the employer.
<P>
	Technically, of course, they already have that right. A union can 
always present a restructuring offer to its members. What the 
member for Wetaskiwin seems to find objectionable is that this 
vote is called by the union rather than by some other body.
<P>
	He may mean from the literal words of the motion, that even 
non-unionized employees will have the right to reject restructuring 
packages. We must presume that Motion No. 308 is meant to 
encourage governments to over-ride unions and bring restructuring 
packages to a vote no matter how much the union may object to the 
package.
<P>
	In last December's crisis at Canadian Airlines, this may have 
seemed like a power that government needs. However, as the 
minister showed, there already exists a similar power. Granted, it is 
not as high-handed as what we are presented with here today but in 
fact the Canada Labour Code has several provisions that already 
allow the Minister of Labour to intervene in exceptional 
circumstances. Under section 105, the minister can appoint a 
mediator. Under section 106, the minister can order an inquiry. 
Under section 107, the minister can secure industrial peace by 
referring a question to the Canada Labour Relations Board.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Last December, five of the six unions representing Canadian 
International employees decided to accept a restructuring offer put 
forward by the employer.
<P>
	The sixth union, the Canadian Auto Workers, was not in 
agreement and, for a few tense days, there was fear that their 
opposition would cost 16,000 workers their jobs.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Members of the House may remember that it was section 107 in 
Part I of the code that the Minister of Labour invoked but later 
withdrew when the Canadian Auto Workers and Canadian Airlines 
reached a deal. It just goes to show that even in those exceptional 
circumstances, dramatic measures like these may not be necessary.
<P>
	Muddying the collective bargaining waters with arbitrary 
government actions jeopardizes the very stability of the system we 
should prize. Used too often, it says that a collective agreement, a 
signed agreement  made by both sides in good faith, is worthless if 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9789"> 9789 </A></B>
<P>
a company can convince the Minister of Labour that it should be 
over-ridden.
<P>
	Such an atmosphere would certainly be corrosive for labour 
peace. If a company could freely ignore a union and, in effect, 
renegotiate terms with individual workers, then we have made a 
mockery of the collective bargaining system.
<P>
	We have created a situation where powerful companies can 
threaten workers with lay-offs, where they can scare workers into 
shredding the agreement their unions bargained very hard for. If the 
bargaining agent is no longer the exclusive bargaining authority, if 
the union duly elected by workers is no longer allowed to represent 
those workers, then we have put an end to a system that has worked 
so well for so long.
<P>
	I am sure that the hon. member across the way would not want to 
see that happen. Moreover, we have added the complication by 
mixing apples and oranges. Section 108(1) talks about unions being 
asked to take an employer's final offer back to union members. 
That is a powerful tool already, but today's motion would 
drastically increase that power by tossing in the unrelated question 
of restructuring packages. Surely it belongs in an act dealing with 
restructuring rather than in an act dealing with collective 
bargaining.
<P>
	Just how exactly does the hon. member propose to define 
restructuring proposals? Will it be a sincere attempt to reorganize 
the company's structure and function or is it simply a way to claw 
back wages and benefits gained through collective bargaining?
<P>
<B>(1925)</B>
<P>
	That is not to suggest in any way that the Canada Labour Code is 
perfect. Unfortunately, very few things in this world are so. 
However, Bill C-66 will improve and modernize the Canada 
Labour Code so that it continues to ensure stability, fairness and 
balance.
<P>
	Bill C-66 is heavily influenced, as was said earlier, by the Sims 
task force. The Sims task force travelled the country, listening to 
the best ideas from labour, business and other interested parties.
<P>
	When the subject of section 108.1 came up, all unions wanted it 
repealed. Employers wanted it modified to require a last offer vote 
on the employees' request. As the title of the Sims report says, it 
was seeking a balance. It saw no convincing evidence to change 
section 108.1 either way. What the task force did do was to suggest 
a broad range of amendments which would greatly improve and 
modernize the Canada Labour Code.
<P>
	Time does not allow me to go into Bill C-66 in any detail, so I 
will simply pick one aspect of it. Bill C-66 speeds up the 
bargaining cycle, improves flexibility and allows disputes to be 
settled more quickly. It does this by extending the notice to bargain 
period.
<P>
	Bill C-66 also replaces the two-stage conciliation process with a 
single 60-day stage.
<P>
	The code will now expressly recognize the right of parties to 
agree to submit collective bargaining disputes to any kind of 
binding settlement.
<P>
	There is much more to Bill C-66, but I have given the House a 
taste of how carefully considered amendments can do more good 
than the single heedless motion we have today.
<P>
	I urge the House to soundly reject Motion No. 308. The motion 
would tilt the balance of power too far toward one side of the 
collective bargaining equation. It would encourage the reckless use 
of a provision of the code that should be and has been rarely used. It 
is in sum a hasty reaction to a problem that Canada simply does not 
have.
<P>
	Just as the CAW and Canadian Airlines resolved their 
differences, a stable labour environment encourages even the 
bitterest of opponents to trust each other's word.
<P>
	Canada's labour relations environment is too valuable to toss 
away for the sake of a quick political point.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Johnston:</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened with extreme interest to 
my colleagues, and certainly to the member of the Bloc who alleges 
that the Reform Party is an extreme right wing party. That is 
laughable. These things have to be looked at in degrees. To my 
colleague from the Bloc, perhaps Karl Marx would be one of those 
extreme right wing people.
<P>
	I do not see that there is any conflict here as far as the operation 
of unions is concerned. What we are talking about are democratic 
rights. The rank and file members of both the CAW and CUPE 
wanted an opportunity to vote on their employer's restructuring 
proposal.
<P>
	Ultimately, it is in the best interests of Canadian travellers to 
have an option when they fly. There are beginning to be more 
competitors on the scene, but for a considerable length of time 
there have been two major air carriers in Canada, which is a 
situation that I want to continue. I would like there to be 
competition between the two airlines. I would not want to have the 
situation where we would not have a choice and would be 
compelled to run with one air carrier.
<P>
	My Bloc colleague talked about too much discretionary power 
being in the hands of the minister. I agree with him. He is right on.
<P>
<B>(1930)</B>
<P>
	However my motion does not put extra discretionary power into 
the hands of the minister. If he had been listening to what I had said 
during my opening remarks, he would have learned that I object to 
the way the minister handles or addresses these situations on a 
piecemeal basis.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="9790"> 9790 </A></B>
<P>
	We are asking for legislation that would actually put labour and 
management on an even footing so they would know what the 
rules are when entering the game. Management could put up a 
restructuring proposal and if there is nothing to compel the rank 
and file people from supporting the restructuring proposal they 
could vote against it.
<P>
	The way it is now they do not even have the option to reject the 
offer. The parliamentary secretary says we have to assume that it 
will be abused by management. We are talking about 700,000 
people in industry and services regulated by the federal 
government. It is not an across the country widespread labour 
management issue.
<P>
	We should not assume, as the parliamentary secretary seems to 
have done, that management will abuse it and every time it wants to 
roll back wages it will put a restructuring proposal to its 
membership. Let us for the briefest of moments go along with the 
parliamentary secretary and say some management people put 
forward a proposal like that, a proposal that was not a bona fide 
restructuring proposal. The membership would have the 
opportunity to vote against it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> And reject it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Johnston:</B> And reject it. The parliamentary secretary is 
assuming members would have to vote in favour of the 
restructuring proposal. That is nonsense.
<P>
	In summary, although the motion is not votable and therefore not 
binding, it seems rather fruitless to address the issue. On the other 
hand I appreciated the opportunity to bring these thoughts to the 
House of Commons. I thank the members, particularly my 
colleague for Prince George-Peace River, who joined in the 
debate on short notice.
<P>
	I think there is room for improvement in this area. Not only the 
travelling public but the 16,000 employees with Canadian Airlines 
will succeed and thrive. I very much hope they do. This would be of 
benefit not only to the users and the employees of the airline but to 
the Canadian economy in general.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> There being no further members rising 
for debate and the motion not being designated a votable item, the 
time provided for consideration of Private Members' Business has 
now expired and the order is dropped from the Order Paper.

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 deemed 
to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="SOCIALHOUSING">SOCIAL HOUSING</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
evening, I would like to come back to the question I asked recently 
concerning social housing.
<P>
	At that time, I asked the Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services about the progress of negotiations now under 
way between the federal government and the Government of 
Quebec concerning the role she had in mind for Quebec with 
respect to social housing.
<P>
	The presence of the federal government in housing, an area 
under provincial jurisdiction, means that for 30 years there have 
been two administrative structures, that of the federal government 
and that of the Province of Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1935)</B>
<P>
	This situation naturally leads to unnecessary and very costly 
overlap. We also note that, of the $2 billion spent annually by the 
federal government on housing, Quebec receives only 19 per cent, 
a percentage much lower than the percentage of households in need 
of social housing in Quebec and also very much lower than 
Quebec's demographic weight.
<P>
	This has been a matter of very great importance for Quebec since 
the federal government announced these negotiations. What is at 
stake in this transfer is the recovery of the responsibilities now 
assumed by the federal government over Quebec's territory. 
Overlapping jurisdictions and responsibilities would thus be 
eliminated and the effectiveness of government intervention in the 
housing sector would be improved.
<P>
	If I may, Mr. Speaker, I will tell you exactly what Quebec is 
asking for in these negotiations. The one thing Quebec does not 
want is to be reduced to dispensing services for the Canada 
Mortgage and Housing Corporation. Quebec wants to recover full 
responsibility for social housing, which is now assumed by the 
federal government.
<P>
	It also wants to obtain fair and equitable financial compensation 
that will cover the shortfall in federal spending in the social 
housing sector in Quebec over the past several years and that will 
ensure continuity of funding in the long term, in the form of the tax 
points that go with these transfers.
<P>
	In return, the Government of Quebec would be given 
responsibility, through a service agreement with the federal 
government, for managing the present activities of the Canada 
Mortgage and Housing Corporation, be they mortgage insurance, 
mortgage backed securities guarantees, social housing research or 
statistics.
<P>
	There could then be an agreement between the two levels of 
government, with the Government of Quebec, through the Société 
d'habitation du Québec, becoming the single service point and sole 
<P>

<B><A NAME="9791"> 9791 </A></B>
<P>
stakeholder for citizens  and partners with respect to all housing 
activities throughout Quebec.
<P>
	Quebec should therefore be made the sole point of service for 
social housing. Later on, with the help of people in the sector and 
through a partnership with the community, RCMs and community 
organizations, we could certainly provide better service to the 
people who must take advantage of these measures. The people 
who must take advantage of them are those in need, the 
disadvantaged. I therefore submit this point of view for your 
attention.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Harvard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to respond further to the question raised by my 
colleague regarding the important negotiations between the federal 
government and the provinces concerning housing.
<P>
<B>(1940 )</B>
<P>
	The federal government has offered to the provinces and 
territories the opportunity to take over the management of the 
existing federal social housing resources, with the exception of 
housing in Indian reserves, provided federal subsidies continue to 
be used for housing and are targeted to low income households.
<P>
	These negotiations are aimed at simplifying the administration 
of social housing by eliminating overlap and duplication and by 
providing clients one-stop shopping.
<P>
	We have already signed agreements with some provinces, 
including Saskatchewan and New Brunswick, and will be signing 
with other provinces shortly. Negotiations are continuing with the 
remaining provinces and territories.
<P>
	Let me assure my colleague that national principles and a 
rigorous accountability framework will govern the agreements and 
provinces and territories will have to agree and respect these 
agreements. The federal government is not withdrawing the 
financial support it provides to low income Canadians with housing 
needs. We will continue to meet our financial obligations related to 
the existing social housing portfolio which is currently about$1.9 billion a year.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Before the hon. member for Davenport 
begins his remarks, I understand that there has been some 
misunderstanding and the parliamentary secretary is not here. The 
hon. member has an option. He can either speak today or he may 
wish to arrange another time. If he prefers we can do the statement 
and possibly the parliamentary secretary could give a reply on 
another occasion. I would appreciate the advice of the hon. 
member.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Caccia:</B> Mr. Speaker, I certainly appreciate your offer. I 
would be glad to accept your option to proceed with the statement 
now if it is all right with you.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Very well.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="THEENVIRONMENT">THE ENVIRONMENT</A></H4>
	<B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
March 3 I asked the Minister of Natural Resources, in connection 
with the issue of climate change, what she plans to do to meet both 
our carbon dioxide reduction commitments under the climate 
change convention signed in Rio and the carbon dioxide reductions 
promised in the red book.
<P>
	It is acknowledged that voluntary efforts to control carbon 
dioxide emissions are insufficient and that Canada, unfortunately, 
will not stabilize emissions by the year 2000 or meet the red book 
commitment to reduce emissions 20 per cent by the year 2005.
<P>
	We have a long way to go and the climate change problem is 
getting more and more serious. For example, the Mackenzie valley 
impact study completed in 1996 measured the impact of climate 
change on that valley. It predicts lower water levels in northern 
lakes, increased thawing of the permafrost and the likelihood of 
increased forest fires.
<P>
	These changes have not gone unnoticed by Canadians. A recent 
poll by Inside Canada Research found the vast majority of 
Canadians surveyed were increasingly concerned about the 
government's inability to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and to 
meet its international commitments to stabilize greenhouse gases at 
1990 levels by the year 2000.
<P>
	Therefore, to resolve this problem, a growing international 
consensus seems to be emerging. It is felt that binding timelines are 
needed to ensure carbon dioxide emission reductions be achieved 
in future.
<P>
	Not only has the voluntary approach to carbon dioxide 
reductions proven to be insufficient, the Department of Natural 
Resources now estimates that we will be 9 per cent above 
stabilization by the year 2000. While emissions continue to grow, 
we make it more difficult to resolve them with new tax incentives 
for the production of oil from tar sands, an extraction, as members 
know, that produces 10 times more carbon dioxide per comparable 
unit of energy than crude oil from conventional light sources.
<P>
	What are the answers? They are not easy but they are necessary. 
First energy efficiency and conservation programs need to be 
implemented. Well researched programs were released last fall 
which outline the benefits gained through energy efficient 
retrofitting of commercial, institutional and residential buildings. 
Retrofitting is a labour intensive enterprise that pays good 
dividends by creating more jobs per dollar invested than 
conventional energy production. Consequently, this makes 
Canadian industries more competitive.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="9792"> 9792 </A></B>
<P>
	Second, our large reserves of natural gas allow Canada to shift 
gradually to natural gas which emits less carbon dioxide than 
petroleum.
<P>
	Finally, we have renewable sources of energy which are badly in 
need of being given a further boost by government. Over time 
renewable sources of energy and natural gas could become the 
backbone of the energy industry of the future.
<P>
	Against this background I ask the parliamentary secretary 
whether the minister intends to take new measures to reduce carbon 
dioxide emissions in Canada. If so, what will they be? On the 
international scene will Canada move to support the European 
Union's position, which now calls for a greenhouse gas reduction 
of 15 per cent by the year 2010?
<P>
	I appreciate the fact the parliamentary secretary might wish to 
reply tomorrow.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I understand the hon. Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Minister of Public Works and Government 
Services will give the reply.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Harvard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the hon. member for providing this opportunity to further 
explain the approach and actions the federal government is 
employing to achieve further CO2 reductions.
<P>
	First, with regard to approach the government is committed to 
working with provincial governments and major stakeholders to 
achieve these reductions.
<P>
	The government is also committed to employing those policy 
instruments that can offer the lowest cost and most flexible 
methods of achieving further reductions. This includes energy 
efficiency regulations, voluntary initiatives, technological support, 
public education and tax changes to encourage investments in 
energy efficiency and renewable energy.
<P>
	Actions to date under the national action program on climate 
change have helped to lower projected emissions from 13 per cent 
to 8 per cent above 1990 levels by the year 2000.
<P>
	With respect to specific actions the federal government 
announced 45 new or expanded initiatives in December 1996 to 
help lower emissions in most sectors in our society.
<P>
	Among other initiatives there is a strengthened focus on 
renewable energy and an increased support for green power pilot 
projects to supply electricity to federal departments.
<P>
	National climate change outreach initiatives seek to engage 
educators and different stakeholders to develop ways and means of 
better informing Canadians about climate change.
<P>
	In the residential sector the federal government will work to 
adopt and apply the national energy code for houses to federally 
owned and leased houses, as well as to produce a home energy 
efficiency rating system for homebuilders, renovators and buyers.
<P>
	There will also be an expansion of energy efficiency regulations 
to include a number of energy using products in the commercial, 
residential and industrial sectors.
<P>
	Further, the federal government in co-operation with provincial 
governments and the private sector will be strengthening the 
voluntary challenge and registry program, VCR.
<P>
	Meeting our country's commitment on schedule will not be easy. 
While we are achieving progress through improvements in energy 
efficiency and energy substitution, this progress is being offset by 
our increased population and strong economic growth.
<P>
	In spite of these challenges I emphasize that Canada has been 
making progress on reductions. Moreover, the new and expanded 
initiatives promise further carbon dioxide reductions. We have the 
initiatives and momentum in place for further progress.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The motion to adjourn the House is now 
deemed to have been adopted. The House is adjourned until 
tomorrow at 2 p.m.
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 7.47 p.m.)
