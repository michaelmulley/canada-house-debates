</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
pursuant to Standing Order 36(8), I have the honour to table, in

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>BILL C-3 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK6"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Andy Scott (Fredericton, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have 
the honour to present, in both official languages, the eighth 
report of the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pursuant to the order of reference of Tuesday, November 23, 
1999, your committee has considered Bill C-3, an act in respect 
of criminal justice for young persons and to amend and repeal 
other acts, and your committee has agreed to report it without 
amendments. 
<P><A NAME="LINK7"></A></P>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>BILL C-244 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK8"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Andy Scott (Fredericton, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I also have 
the honour to present, in both official languages, the seventh 
report of the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pursuant to the order of reference of Tuesday, March 21, your 
committee has begun consideration of Bill C-244, an act to 
provide for the taking of samples of blood for the benefit of 
persons administering and enforcing the law and good Samaritans, 
and to amend the criminal code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of the workload generated by other matters pending 
before the committee, it has not yet been able to complete its 
study of Bill C-244.  Therefore, in accordance with Standing 
Order 97(1), the committee requests an extension of 30 sitting 
days to allow it to complete its consideration of Bill C-244.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>ALL-NUMERIC DATES ACT

<A NAME="LINK10">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK11"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.)</B>  moved for leave to 
introduce Bill C-495, an act to establish a national standard for 
the representation of dates in all-numeric form. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  This is a simple, sensible bill to avoid confusion of 
dates in the computer age.  Its purpose is to promote the use of 
a national standard for all numeric dates.  It proposes the use 
of the date form developed by the International Organization for 
Standardization; that is to say year, month, day, going from the 
general to the specific, so that today the date is 2000 09 21.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A standard approach to dates will avoid the confusion that 
commonly arises today from the use of different conventions, 
especially in computer-generated material. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank Duncan Bath of Peterborough and others who have worked 
on this important matter for many years.  I urge all members of 
the House to support this progressive legislation.  I urge 
government departments to take note of it immediately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
There is a private member's bill already on the order paper in my 
name in exactly this form.  It would probably be out of order to 
accept another one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I will respond directly to the member from 
Elk Island.  We have had precedents where we have had two and 
three bills on the same topic, the same effect virtually.  If one 
were to be adopted then the other two would be withdrawn at that 
time.  I rule that it is in order to have these two bills on the 
order paper.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>HIGHWAYS 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK14"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, 
NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is an honour for me to have the 
opportunity to present a petition pursuant to Standing Order 36 
on behalf of, they say, 700,000 British Columbians.  This is a 
sample of the 700,000 who point out that insufficient funding for 
the national highway system has resulted in hundreds of lives 
lost and thousands more injuries because of structural 
deficiencies in the highway system.  They point out a whole 
number of reasons why national highway system funding as a 
priority would be a good idea for Canada.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>CRIMINAL CODE 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK16"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, 
NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, in the second petition the petitioners 
point out a number of concerns with the Criminal Code of Canada. 
They are asking the Government of Canada to amend the code to 
prevent persons convicted of serious crimes from being released 
from custody pending the hearing of their appeal except in very 
exceptional circumstances. 
<P><A NAME="LINK17"></A></P>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>HOMELESSNESS 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK18"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise 
to present another petition from people in the Peterborough area 
concerned with homelessness.  They point out that homelessness 
includes those who are visible on the streets or staying in 
shelters, those living in overcrowded, illegal, temporary or 
transient accommodation and those in imminent risk of losing 
their housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They point out that the Government of Canada has the ability and 
responsibility to affirm its national role in ensuring that all 
Canadians have access to decent housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These petitioners call upon parliament to make affordable 
housing and an end to homelessness an immediate priority by 
declaring that safe, affordable housing shall be a fundamental 
human right.  This is a very appropriate petition this week as 
the ministers of housing across Canada will be meeting on this 
very topic.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>KIDNEY DISEASE 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK20"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have 
another petition from many citizens in Peterborough and the 
greater region who are concerned about the development of the 
bio-artificial kidney as an alternative to dialysis and kidney 
transplantation for those suffering from terminal kidney disease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These petitioners call upon parliament to work and support the 
bio-artificial kidney which will eventually eliminate the need 
for both dialysis and transplantation.  This petition was 
developed by Ken Sharp of Peterborough.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib):</B> Mr. Speaker, I ask that

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>REQUEST FOR EMERGENCY DEBATE 
</H3><P align=left>
<P><A NAME="LINK24"></A></P>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>FISHERIES 
</H4><P align=left>

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I have received notice of an application for an 
emergency debate from the hon. member for South Shore.  I will 
hear a very succinct analysis of what he proposes for an 
emergency debate. 
<P><A NAME="LINK25"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as 
fisheries critic for the Progressive Conservative Party, I am 
proposing this motion for an emergency debate, seconded by the 
hon. member for Beauséjour—Petitcodiac. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tensions are heightening across the country as transportation is 
threatened and the potential for civil unrest is extremely real. 
I have a report this morning that as many as 850 boats in Nova 
Scotia are prepared to steam to Burnt Church, New Brunswick, and 
there is more talk of native roadblocks going up across the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A search for a solution appears to have collapsed.  The Minister 
of Fisheries and Oceans appears to be in conflict with the 
Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development.  The 
Government of Canada is not speaking with one voice on this issue 
and the House needs to hear from the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, there is a real danger of civil unrest if the people 
affected do not see that there is a possibility for future 
discussions.  A House debate would offer another opportunity for 
dialogue and movement on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House and the Speaker should give the government another 
opportunity to talk to the communities affected by ordering a 
special debate.  We have no other chance to raise this issue and 
a full airing must be presented to the House to avoid 
confrontation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We, the Parliament of Canada, must be the voice to raise this 
issue and, through our debate, get people talking again.  If we 
fail in this duty, it is my great fear that the people around 
Miramichi Bay, representing both natives and non-natives, will 
see this as an abdication of our duty and take matters into their 
own hands.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>SPEAKER'S RULING 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK27"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Of course the hon. member for South 
Shore raises a very important matter, not only for his area but 
for other areas of the country.  He was good enough to give me 
notice as early as last night at 10.30 p.m. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have had my officials monitor the matter throughout the night 
and early this morning and it is my opinion at this time that 
this request does not meet the criteria for an emergency debate.

Alliance)</B> moved: 
<A NAME="LINK32">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That given the record increases in the price of gasoline and 
home and diesel fuel, severely hurting Canadian consumers, truck 
drivers and businesses, and given the recent promise by the 
Minister of Finance to reduce taxes, this House call upon the 
government to give relief on fuel taxes, including repealing the 
increase in gasoline excise tax introduced as a temporary deficit 
elimination measure in 1995 and implementing the 1998 
recommendation of the Liberal Caucus committee on gasoline 
pricing in Canada to remove the double taxation of the GST. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, I will be splitting my time this morning 
with the hon. member for Calgary Southeast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to rise today to kick off this important debate in 
my new role as official opposition transportation critic.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to working with Canadians to address their needs 
in this important sector.  In my brief tenure I have already met 
with several groups and individuals whose businesses and 
livelihoods are either hampered or threatened by the government's 
policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I will focus my remarks on the financial and 
transportation priorities of the Liberal government, the effect 
of these priorities on Canadians, the effect of these priorities 
on Canada's competitiveness and, as always, what the Canadian 
Alliance would do to rectify the situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian taxpayer is being taken advantage of.  Canadians on 
the whole are law-abiding people who accept the fact that taxes 
must be paid to sustain a quality of life and to support the less 
fortunate.  However the amount of taxes paid and the expenditure 
of tax dollars is where I would like to focus my remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday the finance minister announced that the federal 
surplus for fiscal year 1999-2000 was $12 billion.  That means 
that the federal government overcollected $12,000 million from 
Canadians, or approximately $400 from every man, woman and child 
in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We just spent the summer in our ridings.  Many of us like our 
constituents took vacations with our families.  For the average 
Canadian it is a struggle to save up to take a break from work 
and spend some quality time together.  This year many Canadians 
had to cut back on their plans to compensate for the high cost of 
gasoline.  I am fully aware that gasoline is a commodity and is 
subject to variances in the marketplace.  We cannot control 
market prices, but we can control the level of taxation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the Canadian Taxpayers Federation, the federal 
government collected over $4.7 billion in gas taxes in fiscal 
1998-99 and returned a paltry 4.1%, or approximately $194 million 
back to provincial transfers for road and highway development. On 
average, Canadian motorists are paying between 36% and 45% in 
taxes with each fill up at the pumps depending on the province. 
For the current fiscal year 2000-01 the federal and provincial 
governments will collect over $13 billion in gas taxes from 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995 the finance minister increased the fuel excise tax by 
1.5 cents a litre to help eliminate the deficit.  The deficit is 
gone.  Canadians are experiencing record high gas prices and the 
federal government is experiencing record high surpluses.  One 
would think it is time the finance minister relaxed his 
stranglehold on Canadian wallets and reversed the tax hike.  The 
Liberals have made choices and set priorities, namely raising 
taxes to reduce the deficit and spending only on those projects 
that will garner political rewards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How do these policies affect Canadian families?  This winter 
many will have to scramble to decide whether to cut from their 
food budget or kids clothing budget to pay for the increase in 
heating fuel and gasoline.  What we are calling for today is a 
first step, a small step, in liberating Canadians from 
overtaxation.  We are looking for a little fairness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>World commodity markets have caused the price of petroleum 
products to skyrocket while the government is collecting record 
surpluses.  Removing the GST and a reduction of 1.5 cents per 
litre is the least the government can do.  It would be the most 
practical social spending endeavour of its mandate.  In fact the 
Liberal caucus endorsed it in its own report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With an election looming the only reason members of the cabinet 
are not interested in pursuing this responsible action is that 
the reward is not high enough.  It is not enough to loosen the 
burden on cash strapped households and small businesses.  It is 
not good enough to keep truckers on the roads and farmers in the 
fields.  They want a big political reward.

</I></B></P><P align=left>If he is about to commit the mortal Liberal sin and cut a tax, 
he wants the most political bang for it. The finance minister 
prides himself as a shrewd businessman.  Maybe it is time he used 
some of his corporate smarts for the benefit of Canadians.  On

make a dollar.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the government to make a break from raking in the cash and 
shovelling out the patronage dollars and listen to some common 
sense.  It is imperative to invest in our infrastructure, not 
only for the safety and well-being of our citizens but to 
strengthen and augment our ability to move goods and services 
both inside and outside our borders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has made a priority of investing billions of 
dollars in the information highway while all but ignoring our 
national highways.  The two are not mutually exclusive.  I ask 
the House not to take my word for it.  Terence Matthews, founder 
of Newbridge and Mitel, recently stated that Canada's “economic 
boom could be jeopardized if it does not invest in 
infrastructure”.  The Liberal government's priority has been to 
maintain high taxes and spend only on projects contingent on 
political reward.  These short-sighted priorities are threatening 
Canada's competitiveness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This realization has not been lost on our chief competitor and 
largest trading partner.  In 1998 the United States passed the 
transportation and equity act for the 21st century.  That bill 
invests $217.9 billion over six years into infrastructure, a 
large portion of which is roads connecting its borders to Canada 
and Mexico.  Legislatively the bill guarantees that a minimum of 
90.5% of the federal fuel tax receipts from each state is 
returned to that state. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Coalition to Renew Canada's Infrastructure has been 
advocating a national highway program and is calling on the 
government to dedicate one cent per litre of federal fuel tax, 
the equivalent of about $500 million annually, to highway 
renewal.  This is not a lot of money when we consider that after 
the water fountains, canoe museums, hotels and the rest of the 
shovelgate the Liberals still had $12 billion left over last 
year.  If viewers would like more information on the national 
highway initiative, they can go to www.highway1canada.com. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance and its predecessor, the Reform Party of 
Canada, have had a longstanding policy on dedicated revenues from 
fuel taxes.  They believe that the way to effectively maintain 
Canada's infrastructure is to reinvest the proceeds of fuel taxes 
back into the sector from which it is collected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is contrary to the Liberal government's record.  As I 
stated earlier, the federal government only invests about 4.1% of 
gas revenues back into the roads.  What is even more appalling is 
when we look at its record in the other transportation sectors. 
In 1995, under the leadership of then transport minister Doug 
Young, the federal government began a divestiture program of its 
ports and airports.  One by one the department handed over 
control and expense of these facilities to municipal boards 
across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These authorities work on skeleton budgets to try to maintain 
their infrastructure to provide essential economic lifelines to 
their rural communities.  In some cases, like the airport in my 
home town of Fort St. John, the authority is collecting an 
airport improvement fee from all travellers departing from Fort 
St. John.  These user pay initiatives are fair in that only those 
who use the service are required to pay for it.  However the 
revenues collected by the federal government for aviation fuel go 
into general revenues, with a pittance being returned to the 
airports through capital assistance programs.  The port 
authorities are experiencing much the same.  Where is the 
fairness in this taxation?  Where is the return on our tax 
dollars? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I will reiterate a few points.  The federal 
government increased fuel taxes by 1.5 cents a litre in 1995, 
five years ago, to fight the deficit.  The deficit is gone.  So 
should the tax hike be gone.  The federal government is 
collecting a tax on a tax by collecting GST on top of fuel excise 
taxes.  World fuel prices are at record highs and so too are 
government surpluses.  The only ethical thing to do is to lower 
taxes on fuel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's choices and priorities are clear and so too are 
the consequences.  The Liberals mount huge surpluses by 
overtaxing cash strapped Canadian families.  The Liberals collect 
billions of dollars in fuel tax revenues annually with little or 
no reinvestment in our infrastructure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are the consequences?  Canadians are put under undue 
financial strain so the government can turn around and try to buy 
their votes with their money.  Liberals have made a priority out 
of buying goodies for the Prime Minister's riding while ignoring 
our roads, ports and airports, thus jeopardizing road integrity, 
traveller safety and economic viability.

listened carefully to the words of the hon. member but I would 
like to know, having also carefully read the opposition motion, 
why he is attacking only the government.  I do not understand 
why he is not attacking the fuel companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the hon. member to tell us what, as of today's

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill:</B>  Mr. Speaker, approximately 40% of a litre 
of gasoline is made up of taxes.  That is pretty general.  It 
varies a bit from province to province across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member asks why we should not blame the oil companies. 
That is the government's way of handling situations.  It has been 
that way for the seven years it has been in power since 1993. 
Canadians are getting fed up with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is easy for a government to stand up and point the finger 
elsewhere.  Either it is the fault of the provinces because they 
are not willing to sign some joint declaration of tax reduction, 
or it is the fault of oil companies or maybe the way the sun came 
up this morning, instead of taking responsibility for what it can 
control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what the motion is all about.  Why do we not look at 
what we can do in the Chamber?  What we can do is offer Canadians 
some real tax relief, Canadians who are hard pressed at the 
moment every time they stop at the pumps.  Truckers are trying to 
do their jobs and make ends meet.  Farmers are out in the field 
trying to get their crops off and face these high input costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We as a group, when the motion comes to a vote on Tuesday, can 
vote for it to bring down taxes just a bit.  We are asking the 
federal government to give up just a bit.  It does not have to 
slash and burn its tax base.  Lord knows it would not be prepared 
to do that.  All it has to do is give up a bit so that Canadians 
have a better day tomorrow.

puzzled by my colleague's grandstanding on an issue that is so 
important to consumers across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What assurances could he give the House and Canadians, if any 
kind of a tax reduction is to take place on gasoline prices, that 
this money will go into the pockets of consumers rather than into 
the pockets of oil companies? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill:</B>  Mr. Speaker, perhaps that is the attitude 
of the government.  I think it is, by the way in which the 
finance minister has been addressing the questions many 
opposition parties and certainly our new leader have been putting 
to the government over the last few days.  If that is its 
attitude, that only through some ironclad guarantee will it 
reduce taxes, obviously it does not ever intend to reduce taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is so afraid if it gives up a bit of the money it 
has been raking in that perhaps somehow someone else will pick it 
up.  The fact of the matter is that the hon. member is quite 
right.  There are no ironclad assurances in life.  The reality is 
that if the government reduces taxes I believe that we will have 
to monitor to make sure that oil companies do not simply tack it 
on the next day.  That is the reality.

raising gas prices over long weekends, which has more of an

<P><A NAME="LINK36"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I commend my colleague for this thoughtful motion 
which draws on recommendations from government policy. I will 
read once again into the record the motion put by the member for 
Prince George—Peace River: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That given the record increases in the price of gasoline and home 
and diesel fuel, severely hurting Canadian consumers, truck 
drivers and businesses, and given the recent promise by the 
Minister of Finance to reduce taxes, this House call upon the 
government to give relief on fuel taxes, including repealing the 
increase in gasoline excise tax introduced as a temporary deficit 
elimination measure in 1995 and implementing the 1998 
recommendation of the Liberal caucus committee on gasoline 
pricing in Canada to remove the double taxation of the GST. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the motion.  We are asking the government to do two 
things that it has committed to doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first is to eliminate a temporary deficit reduction measure. 
When I last checked, the deficit was history two years ago 
thanks to the hard work of Canadian taxpayers.  Yesterday we 
booked a $12.3 billion tax overpayment for the last fiscal year. 
That is not a deficit. Let me explain the matter to my Liberal 
colleagues. That is a surplus. When we are in surplus territory, 
taxpayers should no longer be forced to pay deficit elimination 
taxes. That is simply a dishonest government policy, an approach 
to gouging people.  It is a policy set for a certain time which 
has now passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the first thing we are asking the government to do, 
namely to keep its word.  I know that is a high standard for the 
government to achieve given its failure to keep its word in so 
many matters:  the elimination of the GST; its promise not to cut 
health care transfers and its failure to do so; and its promise 
to not raise taxes on Canadians.  All of the basic Liberal 
electoral commitments from 1993 have not been kept.  It is not 
surprising to see that the government has failed to do so in this 
regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second thing we are proposing in the motion is that the 
government stop the double taxation of GST on the excise tax. 
Essentially the government now applies the 7% goods and services 
tax on top of not just the price of gas but also the excise tax 
on gas.  It is taxing tax. That is so manifestly unfair that even 
the Liberal government caucus task force on this matter 
recommended two years ago that the double taxation of GST on 
excise tax on fuels be eliminated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion simply asks the government to act on its own 
recommendations.  I cannot understand why we are already hearing 
the typical resistance for government to simply keep its 
commitments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are facing some of the highest fuel prices in our 
history when about 41% of fuel costs at the pumps for consumers 
is now federal and provincial taxes, excise taxes and sales 
taxes.  Forty cents on the dollar of what people pay for gas at 
the pump go into the public treasury. That is up from about 30% 
of taxes on fuel in the early 1980s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting, and I will add parenthetically, to hear our 
colleagues from the Progressive Conservative Party.  We welcome 
their support for the motion and we are glad to see that they are 
new converts to the idea of moderation on fuel taxes given that 
it was their leader who proposed the single largest increase in 
fuel taxes in Canadian history in this place in 1979. It was 
their previous government that actually raised the excise tax on 
fuels from 1.5 cents to 8.5 cents during its term of government 
from 1984 to 1993. 
Even though the Conservatives are the world champions in 
increasing gas taxes, we are pleased to see that they have seen 
the light of day in this regard.

<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have just seen some recent polling results which said that 85% 
of Canadians would like to see immediate reductions in the level 
of fuel taxes.  That is as close as it gets to unanimity on any 
issue.  Those Canadians know that we need to collect revenues to 
pay for our infrastructure, particularly our transportation 
infrastructure.  They also know intuitively that the government 
fails to direct even a reasonable fraction of the revenues it 
collects from fuel taxes to the necessary transportation 
infrastructure, as my colleague the transport critic has 
demonstrated.  Instead, the government takes those revenues and 
rather than direct them back to the roads used by those fuel 
consumers, it takes that money and adds it into its huge 
multibillion dollar taxpayer overpayment, an overpayment which in 
the first four months of this fiscal year already totals $11.4 
billion.  That, if extrapolated out to the balance for the fiscal 
year, implies a surplus of over $30 billion tax dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government at least so far has implied it cannot move on 
this because it needs the provinces to act first.  The finance 
minister told us yesterday that he was willing to exercise 
leadership but he needed the provinces to go first.  I took a 
first year logic course in college and that fails as a logical 
syllogism.  That is not leadership, it is followership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government is the national government and the 
government always talks about national leadership.  Maybe it 
should begin to exercise that because the very same finance 
minister certainly exercised leadership when it came to raising 
the excise tax on fuels in his 1995 budget by 1.5 cents a litre 
in his temporary deficit elimination tax.  He did not consult the 
provinces.  I rather suspect that none of the provincial finance 
ministers then had any shred of consultation about whether or not 
to raise the excise taxes yet he went ahead and did so.  That is 
the same finance minister who failed to consult with the 
provinces before he cut their health care transfers by one-third 
in his 1995 budget. That is clearly a bogus argument. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we hear the Liberals trying to pass the buck to the oil 
companies and retailers.  They shed crocodile tears in the fear 
that perhaps the corner gas station is not going to pass on the 
savings of a reduction in excise tax and GST to gas consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the same Liberal attitude that says when we give working 
families broad based tax relief they will waste it on frivolous 
expenditures.  Really what that says is the basic philosophy 
governing the Liberal Party—and I know as a recovering 
Liberal—is that government and politicians know better how to 
spend an extra buck or an extra 1.5 cents a litre than do the 
consumers.  I have every confidence that given the profile on 
this issue, consumers would expect and demand of their retailers 
to see the full tax break delivered to them at the pump.  There 
is no doubt in my mind whatsoever.  The official opposition would 
certainly add its voice to those of other Canadians in insisting 
that happen. That is a bogus argument. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Provincial co-operation is a bogus argument.  But lo and behold, 
today we see in the paper that the finance minister is 
considering a virage on this issue.  He is considering an 
about-face on the question.  Why?  No doubt because he is 
receiving enormous pressure from his backbench. Those members 
know what the right thing is in this respect. They recommended 
the right approach in their 1998 caucus task force led by the 
member for Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge, who continues to get credit 
from the finance minister for making recommendations the minister 
has failed to follow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have no doubt that the vast majority of Liberal backbenchers 
know what their constituents want and know what the right policy 
is and so they are trying to find a way to extricate themselves. 
We have presented that option in this motion.  Next Tuesday when 
the deferred vote on the motion is taken, they will have an 
opportunity to stand and vote to relieve their constituents and 
gas consumers of the huge, unreasonable burden of double taxation 
and deficit elimination tax as well as to give the trucking 
industry and the transportation industry generally a tax break by 
cutting in half the diesel fuel taxes as we recommend, for the 
excise tax thereon from four cents to two cents. 
That is the option they have.

has put forward the motion, does not regard it as a confidence

not be regarded by us as an indication of loss of confidence in 
the government or a need to call an election, as much as we would 
like to see one as soon as possible.

favour of their own recommendations and of their own government's 
policy and to do so freely.  The failure to do so will once again

Canadians who are paying outrageously high taxes under the

between lowering the tax rate for middle and low income Canadians 
in the tax forms and attempting to lower tax through the excise 
tax?  An oil company might well simply put it in its pocket or a 
local retailer might not reduce the price by the amount of the 
reduction that the federal government made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is the fallacy of 
changing the basis of division, the fact that there is no 
dichotomy between lowering taxes for lower and middle income 
taxpayers and cutting fuel taxes for all gas consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is possible to do both.  We proposed that through our 
proposal for broad based tax relief for all Canadians which would 
take 1.5 million lower income Canadian off the tax rolls 
altogether and save the average middle income families some 
$2,500 in taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of those things can be done within the fiscal room of the 
current surplus and at the same time furnish the sort of fuel tax 
relief recommended in the motion today.  All of those things can 
be achieved.  We do not need to make a choice.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The member for 
Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge is quite right.  That is why I made it 
very clear when the amendment was presented that it was not being

Calgary to respond. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the problems we have today in terms of the price of home 
heating fuel and the price of gasoline for automobiles and so on 
are the very high profits of the gas and oil companies and the 
tremendous rise in prices by the OPEC nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to be that in addition to a tax decrease, which I 
certainly support, on the other side of the line we have to make 
sure we have some energy review commission that would keep an eye 
on the oil industry to make sure that these price decreases are 
passed on to the consumer at the pumps or passed on to people in 
terms of home heating fuel cuts, rather than have the oil 
companies once again increase their prices to fill the vacuum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, the current Leader of the Opposition made a comment 
similar to what he said when he was a cabinet minister in the 
government of Alberta.  Premier Mike Harris was also concerned 
that with a tax cut the oil companies would increase the price 
and the consumers would receive no net benefit in terms of that 
tax cut. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would my friend from Calgary agree with the establishment of an 
energy review commission or some other commission that would keep 
an eye on the oil industry?  I realize that this would be keeping 
an eye on his friends, but whether or not he would agree with 
that is a very important part of this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, first, on the procedural 
point, when I rose on a point of order it was simply to point out 
to the Chair that I still had the floor and I then proceeded to 
complete putting my amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The pricing of the commodity of oil, which is done by the world 
markets, is entirely a function beyond the control of this 
parliament.  The question of supply by the OPEC nations, which is 
the principle determining factor in the price of oil, is beyond 
our control.  What we can control is the gas taxes, and that is 
what we propose to do through this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have no opposition to reasonable oversight on the part of 
government, the competition bureau and other regulatory agencies 
to ensure that oil firms are pricing the product fairly and that 
there are no monopoly type pricing practices.  We believe there 
are measures in place to ensure that is the case.  In principle I 
have no problem with the suggestion made by the hon. member. 
<P><A NAME="LINK40"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dan McTeague (Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I intend to give notice, and it is my sincere hope, that 
I, seconded by the member for Middlesex, would make the following 
amendment to the motion subject to further discussion with the 
Chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current motion reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That given the record increases in the price of gasoline and home 
and diesel fuel, severely hurting Canadian consumers— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With my amendment, the motion would then read “—especially 
for those with lower incomes, this House calls upon the 
government to assist Canadians in coping with the rising 
financial burden, and that this House strongly urges provincial 
and territorial governments to consider providing similar 
assistance”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, that is the amendment I wanted to provide to the 
House, and I may in fact have that opportunity.  However, it is 
clear that the new boss and the tactics of the Alliance are the 
same as the old boss and the old Reform Party.  On an issue so 
fundamental and important to the misfortune of Canadians, that 
party over there has decided to play politics, where this party, 
years in advance, decided to try to do something about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can tell the hon. member for Calgary Southeast that the reason 
the price of gasoline is what it is today has absolutely nothing 
to do with taxes and everything to do with distortions in the 
marketplace.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Alliance is very quick to point out a recommendation made by 
a Liberal committee on gasoline pricing two and a half years ago. 
I am really pleased that the hon. members across the way have 
finally discovered that fuel and high prices are an issue.  It 
must be close to an election.  Let me warn the hon. members that 
this is an issue on which this side of the House did its homework 
years ago, specifically with respect to this particular 
recommendation where it does indeed deal with a half 
recommendation of the Liberal committee on gasoline pricing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the purposes of enlightening the Chair, let me say what hon. 
members on the other side who proposed this motion are not 
prepared to say about the recommendations.  The recommendation 
says that if the GST is removed from other taxes, the federal 
government should undertake measures to ensure that the resulting 
savings are passed on to consumers and not merely absorbed by the 
oil industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that some members of the Conservative Party would prefer 
to jump on this because they think it is a new issue.  As I have 
already indicated, the report speaks for itself.  It was 
published some two and a half years ago and the hon. members 
across the way have never bothered to look at its implications, 
even now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will begin my speech by saying that imitation is the greatest 
form of flattery but the way in which they have dissected this 
document and narrowly picked up on only one issue leads the 
consumers in Canada to conclude that they are very narrow in 
their focus on the issue of fuel prices.  The public is not 
bought off and does not find very amusing the idea of these 
johnnies-come-lately suddenly picking up this issue that the 
Liberal Party has known about for years and is acting upon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member and his leader have for some time talked about 
the interests and concerns of truckers.  Indeed, myself and the 
hon. member for Oshawa were the only government members who took 
the time to actually be there back in February when the crisis 
arose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unlike the hon. Leader of the Opposition and his cohorts beside 
him, trucking and the issue of fuel taxes is totally irrelevant 
to the problem.  That may stun members of the Alliance because, 
of course, they do not understand that the excise tax of 1.5% was 
not raised on diesel.  Moreover, the GST is remittable through 
the input tax credit.  More importantly, and I think this will 
come as something as a shock to Alliance members, if the 
provincial governments, such as the government of Ontario which 
charges 14.7% on its side of the excise road allowance tax 
consumption, or the government of Alberta at 9%, were so 
interested in helping truckers, they would have acted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that the opposition in proposing this motion will 
not allow the facts to get in the way of a political opinion.  It 
is with that in mind that I would like to speak at some length 
about what this side of the House has done with respect to the 
issue of gasoline. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  Raise taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dan McTeague:</B>  It would appear that the hon. member 
believes it is rather cute to deal with taxes.  Let us talk about 
taxes.  Let us talk about the fact that his friends in the oil 
industry keep taxes for 45 and up to 90 days that could otherwise 
be remitted to the government.  Let us talk to this member about 
the devastation that taxes have wrought on independent mom and 
pop efficient retailers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not just happening in my riding or the ridings of those 
members, it is even happening in the riding of the hon. Leader of 
the Opposition where he goes jet boating on a little water ski. 
Does he not understand that last year and the year before ARCO 
came in with predatory prices below the cost of wholesale and 
knocked out a number of independents?  The people of British 
Columbia, many of them supporters of the Alliance Party I am 
sure, have now found out the real effect of predatory pricing. 
What happened?  Prices went from 30 cents to 80 cents a litre to 
the great shock of the good people of British Columbia, and of 
course the hon. member is correct in pointing out the tax 
component. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have addressed this and the province of British Columbia has 
addressed the reasons why this should be examined.  Unfortunately 
those hon. members never thought this was a problem.  Their 
single track, uni-minded view of always focusing on taxes allows 
them to look at something that is totally irrelevant to the 
actual problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I and every member of the House knows about the record profits 
being made by oil companies.  I have no difficulty with people 
making money.  In the free market that is exactly how business 
works.  However, if one is able to do it based on a vertical 
integration and a near monopoly, and one is able to take 
advantage of weaknesses in our laws, lack of oversight or 
apologists in the Alliance Party, is it any wonder that Canadians 
today from coast to coast are being hurt by high fuel prices that 
have nothing to do with taxes?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe we have an opportunity here.  If the Alliance is 
serious about dealing with this issue it will join with the 
government in not only reading a little more than four sentences 
out of a 69 page document, which I believe colleagues on my side 
of the House will know is very well written, but it will look at 
the other aspects of taxation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Alliance has accused the finance minister of saying that 
there should not be any co-operation. I know why it does not like 
that. It is because the finance minister listens to backbenchers, 
unlike certain leaderships in other parties who ignore or perhaps 
chastise backbenchers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee made recommendations on a couple of issues.  We 
have already dealt with the question of tax on tax.  Let me deal 
now with the six other recommendations with respect to taxes. 
Given the first speaker's view on this issue of transportation, 
he might be interested to read—although I have not heard him 
phrase this the right way—that provincial governments should 
refrain from using revenues generated by gasoline consumption 
taxes and vehicle fees for projects other than road repair and 
transportation infrastructure.  I do not see that recommendation 
on the floor today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The joint action between the federal and provincial governments 
aimed at restoring Canada's national highway system should be 
given a priority and an appropriate cost sharing formula in 
public-private partnerships should be established to undertake 
repairs at the earliest opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government should remove the requirement for a tax 
bond to be posted by independents who have sales indicating 
reasonable financial stability and extend the same tax collection 
authority that is granted and enjoyed by refiner marketers. 
Alternatively, wholesalers can be required to pay taxes on 
balances until they are remitted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Has it not dawned on the Alliance that if it wants to make 
inroads in Ontario it might follow the leadership of the Ontario 
provincial government which, ironically, last evening pretty well 
endorsed the very findings of the Liberal committee on gasoline 
pricing? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard from Ontario's minister of transport, the finance 
minister and the premier who have gone out of their way to 
compliment the work that we have done and to establish the single 
most important issue of taxation with respect to decline, which 
is that a mechanism needs to be put in place to ensure that the 
consumer receives the benefit, not the oil companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are the Alliance members talking through their hats?  Obviously 
they have forgotten the maritimes.  The motion does not say 
anything about rising home fuel, natural gas or the relevance of 
using diesel on which there is very little federal tax that 
cannot be remitted to the individual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the Alliance Party has problems with people in the 
maritimes from time to time, certainly some of its members do, 
but let me read from the New Brunswick select committee on 
gasoline pricing.  The committee noted that reducing taxes did 
not necessarily translate into lower prices at the pumps. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members know that New Brunswick has the second lowest tax regime 
for gas in Canada next to Alberta but it probably has the highest 
prices in Canada.  Why is this a phenomenon?  It is not because 
of me.  It is not because we are trying to play some kind of game 
over the question of taxation.  It is because the New Brunswick 
government was the first government in 1992 to implement a 2 cent 
a litre tax reduction.  According to it, as crude costs were 
comparable it was assumed that the refiner and retailer margins 
were also comparable to other Canadian cities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The select committee found that during the first six months of 
the tax decrease refiner and retailer margins were 3.7% higher in 
Saint John than the national average of other major cities.  This 
led the committee to conclude that over time the tax reduction 
was captured in large measure by the oil markets and that 
consumers had not received the full benefits.  In the committee's 
opinion, lowering the gas tax in that province did not produce 
corresponding lower gasoline prices to consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion proposed by the hon. member's party and the silly 
subamendment that prevents common sense to be put into this 
motion ignores the fact that consumers could be badly hurt and 
that the companies, unless we understand the market we are 
dealing with, will never see the benefit of a tax reduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to compliment the finance minister, the Prime Minister 
and our colleagues for having the wisdom and the foresight two 
years ago to say that when the country could afford these kinds 
of tax reductions they would be given directly to Canadians.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know the market functions in a supply and demand free market 
system.  Where it does not work there is danger, especially when 
governments simply co-operate with an industry that can 
arbitrarily pad the increase or the decrease to consumers to its 
bottom line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On that point let me make something very clear.  Right now we 
are dealing with an international situation, and particularly in 
the United States of America there are inventory shortages. 
Almost any disruption is used as an excuse in the marketplace to 
drive prices up.  The tragedy for Canadians is that we accept 
these things as inevitable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one here on this side is arguing for a world price.  No one 
here is looking to revisit 1980 with the national energy program. 
Rather, we want to make sure that competition is free and 
abundant in this industry.  To that end one has to ask the 
question, if there is a shortage in the United States and average 
refiner margins in that country posted in New York harbour are 
about six cents a litre in response to this tightening of supply, 
why is it that refiners in Canada in my area of Toronto can 
charge 11.5 cents a litre? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is because that six, seven or eight mystery cents that are 
being tacked onto the price are the result of a lack of 
competition which the Alliance members have consistently and from 
a determined point of view decided to ignore.  Not only have they 
ignored the wisdom of what is in this document, and they have 
thought enough of picking at least one of 29 recommendations, but 
they are ignoring the impact it is having on ordinary Canadians 
from coast to coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I plead with them to get off their hobby horses if they want to 
deal with this industry.  I understand that the oil patch is in 
the background.  There are refiners in Toronto; there is a 
nuclear reactor that leaks from time to time in my riding.  That 
does not prevent me from speaking out on those issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a place where for generations we have enjoyed the 
freedom to speak out on things we know are true.  We should not 
be confined to looking at only one issue that is totally 
irrelevant to the problem.  That is exactly what this resolution 
is.  It is irrelevant.  It is dangerous.  It is politically 
loaded.  It will harm consumers because not only will consumers 
not see the benefit of the redistributive effect of governments 
being able to pay for the very things the provinces are calling 
for, it will also mean that consumers will never see any relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More important, if the Alliance members claim to be the great 
knowledgeable marketeers that they are, would it not make sense 
for them to at least consider that given the distortions in the 
marketplace they would have an opportunity to see the price, or 
any decrease that is contemplated, passed on through the tax 
system? I too would like to see taxes passed on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on at great length, but I want to move my motion.  It 
is absolutely important that we put some balance in what is 
otherwise I am sure a well-intentioned idea to deal with high 
fuel prices, notwithstanding the fact that it does not deal with 
fuel prices but deals with taxation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, with your indulgence I will read once again the 
motion I wish to put before this House today. The motion by the 
opposition initially reads “That given the record increases in 
the price of gasoline and home and diesel fuel, severely hurting 
Canadian consumers”.  The amendment would be to replace the text 
after the word “consumers” with the following “, especially 
those with lower incomes, this House calls upon the government to 
assist Canadians in coping with the rising financial burden and 
that this House strongly urges provincial and territorial 
governments to consider providing similar assistance”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ask a few simple questions of my colleagues across the 
way before they ask me some.  I am sure they will know that after 
some four or five years I have not been a dilettante on this 
issue.  I have done many interviews in their ridings and I think 
there is some common ground that we can deal with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion the Alliance has provided does nothing to ameliorate 
or improve the condition or the misfortune of Canadians to deal 
with the underlying uncompetitiveness of an industry that is 
dominated by three or four players that control most of the 18 
refineries in this country and which cannot, for whatever reason 
and like any other industry, operate at the retail level without 
being a vertically integrated supplier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a fairly serious indictment about the state of oil and 
the cost of oil in this country.  It explains why 10 cents or 12 
cents a litre, not even dealing with the upstream, at the 
downstream, is consistently and routinely passed on to consumers 
without even the opportunity of oversight.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When hon. members quote they do so shamelessly 
by quoting from only one part of 
the document written by Liberal members. They should deal 
with the issues of temperature compensation; deal with the fact 
that independence has been wiped out of this industry;  try to 
reconcile the idea of environmental standards that are necessary 
for some people who cannot exit the industry; deal with the Come 
By Chance refinery which has had a restrictive covenant placed 
upon it; do not battle us when we are in the industry committee 
trying to propose new changes; and come one, two, three against 
good bills that might otherwise prove that parliament and 
backbenchers have a role. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally I urge hon. members not only to consider the ideology 
which underpins their views on taxation.  Think of the people who 
are going to have to put away what little money they have because 
of a marketplace somewhere else outside Canada, a country blessed 
with an abundance of energies, in which taxes have built the 
infrastructure to ensure that our oil companies are profitable 
and competitive, and now find themselves at mercy's end and may 
not be able to get sufficient fuel or sufficient resources to 
meet the basic necessities.  This has nothing to do with taxes 
and everything to do with the price of this commodity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call upon all members of the House to not just accept the 
amendment to the motion which would make the motion relevant and 
appropriate, but to have some compassion and put aside their tax 
battle until the election.  Let us fight for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  In the debate of the 
hon. member for Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge, the amendment proposed 
by the hon. member is a subamendment to the amendment.  As all 
hon. members know, a subamendment must relate specifically and 
directly to the amendment.  The amendment was the word 
“immediate”.  Therefore the subamendment as it was presented is 
not receivable. 
<P><A NAME="LINK41"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, while the member's presentation had 
some interesting points, and I am sure he is sincere, from this 
side of the House the member ruined the whole effect of his 
speech by making a completely outlandish statement at both the 
beginning and the end.  The statement was that the problem of 
high fuel prices had nothing to do with high taxes.  In other 
words, the government assumes no responsibility for its role in 
high gas prices when up to 40% of the price consists of tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member went on to blame the oil companies and the 
distributors, which is an old line from both the Liberals and the 
NDP.  Suppose we accept the proposition that back in the old days 
the big oil companies dictated the price of oil, what is the 
highest they ever got crude oil prices up to?  It was $3 a 
barrel.  When the governments got involved through the OPEC 
cartel and through the response of the western nations the 
price went up to $30 a barrel.  At least 40% of the problem is 
government intervention in that sector and government involvement 
through taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the hon. member not accept that 40% of the 
responsibility for the problem of high energy prices is the tax 
component and support the motion that is before the House? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dan McTeague:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a double honour that 
the former leader of the Reform Party is asking the question.  I 
am glad to see him in his place.  One of the first times I had an 
opportunity to debate in the House was with him.  We are coming 
full circle.  I also hope it is a new beginning for both of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member knows full well that this was a big issue.  He 
has had many days to argue this.  He has had many opposition days 
to bring this issue forward.  The reality is his party is only 
bringing it up today because of the high prices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The context in which he is issuing the edict on the question of 
taxes confuses Canadians.  Canadians are not fooled.  Most of 
them know that taxes do not go up on long weekends but prices do. 
The hon. member is obviously and skilfully avoiding that. 
I can assure the hon. member I have had that question put to me 
many times on the national media.  The hon. member knows my 
answer to that so I must wonder why the question was asked in the 
first place. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1110"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT14"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to take the hon. member at his word.  I think he 
believes quite frankly that anyone who questions the oil industry 
must be categorized as an ideologue.  I come from a hardworking 
community of consumers. The hon. member was in my riding several 
times before I won it back with an even bigger majority than last 
time on the issue of gasoline. In our neck of the woods in 
Toronto we are facing 78 cents a litre gasoline.  That is higher 
than what we see across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I might be able to enlighten the hon. member that all of this 
began in 1992 while he was on the campaign trail. In fact the now 
very famous document, Bloomberg Oil Buyer's Guide, pointed out 
that the independent gasoline sector was going to be the target 
of the oil companies and that there was going to be a 
disciplining by the major oil companies targeted at the profits 
of the independents which were too good for their own good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am asking for one thing.  Let retail mom and pop efficient 
competitors compete against their own supplier and not be outdone 
by weak laws and irrelevant comments and questions like the one I 
just received from the hon. former leader. 
<P><A NAME="LINK42"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the hon. member from Pickering for a very interesting 
speech.  It is clear that he is very knowledgeable on the 
subject. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think he will agree with me on one thing.  The thing that 
really irritates Canadians and really gets their goat and makes 
them angry about the rising cost of fuel prices is the seemingly 
arbitrary fluctuation in prices which they just cannot 
understand.  For instance on a long weekend as he mentioned the 
price will spike up and down.  Day to day they really do not know 
what the price of that important commodity is going to be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the hon. member agree with the concept raised by our party 
that there should be a national regulatory body that would 
oversee the pricing of gasoline?  The oil companies would come to 
that body and argue that they should have an increase, perhaps 
twice a year, like that which is done in Prince Edward Island 
which has actually served that province very well. Twice a year 
the oil companies come to a panel saying that they deserve an 
increase.  The rates are set and locked for that fixed period of 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would that not be some comfort to consumers?  Would he see the 
value in the creation of such a regulatory body? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dan McTeague:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the comments 
of the hon. member from Winnipeg, my hometown.  I was just there 
ironically about a week and a half ago with the public policy 
forum.  It is undertaking comprehensive reviews, compliments of 
the initiatives of the government along with the conference 
board, on the question of gasoline and other areas of 
competition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question of regulation is an interesting one.  Many 
provinces have backed away from it because it always preserved 
the artificial prices that might otherwise be forced down.  For 
many years Canadians have enjoyed gasoline prices that were far 
more competitive in the past.  Regulation in my view is probably 
the end of the line.  There may come a point where that is in 
fact what has to occur. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member knows that jurisdiction lies squarely within the 
ambit of the provincial governments.  With that in mind the 
federal government and some provinces have obviously talked about 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member who asked that question has a number of 
representations in provinces.  We can see it in this report. 
Provincial governments have looked at the idea of tackling 
predatory pricing, creating terminals which is exactly why I 
wrote a letter to the Competition Bureau chief two days ago to 
deal with the potential for closing these terminals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, we should not be relying on the oil industry's own 
people like M. J. Ervin and others to be the last word.  We do 
not need the fox monitoring the chicken coop. 
<P><A NAME="LINK43"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Canadian Alliance):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, just to recap a couple of facts, I simply want to point 
out again that it was the party across the way, the Liberal 
government, which raised taxes on gasoline in 1995 one and a half 
cents a litre, simply because in that case it said it wanted to 
get rid of the deficit.  The deficit is now gone.  Even in the 
wake of that somehow the government is saying it cannot cut 
excise taxes on gasoline.  We need to recap that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hypocrisy of the government is incredible on this issue. Our 
friend across the way is saying that it is the oil companies that 
should somehow cut prices while his government raises prices. 
We have other Liberals who say that gas prices should be higher 
because it is good for the environment.  The NDP says that 
constantly but now is trying to find a way to get out of that.

for oil companies to do their job, over which he is not directly

the prices on fuel, something over which he does have control and 
yet refuses to do anything about it.

the price of fuel and not do anything about it at the same time

says to see the truth you have written twisted by knaves to make 
a trap for consumers.  Surely the hon. member is not suggesting 
that the debate on this issue before us today is about gasoline. 
If so, obviously the member has not even read his party's own 
motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If members opposite wanted to be sincere about their attempt to 
address the rising price of fuel they would have done so two or 
three years ago on the question of taxes when it was 50 and 60 
cents a litre across the country.  However we heard nothing from 
those individuals on that side until such time as they could find 
a very relevant thin edge of the wedge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the recommendations in this document, and they 
are quite rightly consistent with the comments of the finance

The amendment which I was skilfully prevented from putting on the

calls for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There will be relief, but I think the government is more 
interested in giving it to the people who count, not lining the

have the opportunity today to debate, and eventually to express 
ourselves formally in a vote, on a matter of concern to many: 
the price of gasoline, which has reached a record high. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a crisis that has gone on for several months, and the 
federal government has still done nothing, hoping that time 
would be on its side and the crisis would eventually just 
evaporate.  The only action the federal government has taken so 
far, moreover, in connection with fuel prices, has been to 
commission a study from the Conference Board, the findings of 
which will be known early next year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know very well that when they want to do nothing, this is the 
best approach. They commission a study with findings to come out 
a long way into the future.  Until such time, the answer can be 
given “We are looking into the matter”.

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That given the record increases in the price of gasoline and 
home and diesel fuel, severely hurting Canadian consumers, truck 
drivers and businesses, and given the recent promise by the 
Minister of Finance to reduce taxes, this House call upon the 
government to give relief on fuel taxes, including repealing the 
increase in gasoline excise tax introduced as a temporary 
deficit elimination measure in 1995 and implementing the 1998 
recommendation of the Liberal Caucus committee on gasoline 
pricing in Canada to remove the double taxation of the GST.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to say immediately that we in the Bloc Quebecois 
will support this motion.  We will vote in favour of it.  It 
will give consumers a bit of a break.  However, we would like 
more than that.  I will indicate the action we want taken, but 
at least this is a step in the right direction.  This is why we 
will support the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would have liked the government to suspend the excise tax of 
ten cents a litre entirely because of the exceptional nature of 
the current crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposal on the table will permanently reduce the cost of 
gasoline by three or four cents, according to the cost of 
gasoline per barrel.  This is one of its strong points. 
We would like the cost to be reduced immediately by ten cents a 
litre to make it substantial and to enable consumers to say the 
next morning “Listen, we are paying ten cents less”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that the Liberals will hide behind another approach 
saying “We are not sure the consumers will really benefit” and 
the like.  If that is so, when they say they are not going to 
lower the tax by two or three cents because the consumer will 
not benefit, they are admitting that healthy competition does 
not exist in the industry.  If there were healthy competition, 
it would be advantageous for one of the competitors to lower his 
price right away in order to get part of the market. 
If that player and all the players do not do it collectively, if 
there is no collusion in that industry, there are at least 
serious flaws from in terms of competition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are saying that this is perhaps a possibility and we are 
convinced that there are flaws in terms of competition. This is 
why we want a more substantial reduction than 3 cents per litre. 
But the motion is all about a permanent measure. The motion of 
the Canadian Alliance Party reads “including”. That does not 
exclude other measures. We are still in favour of suspending the 
excise tax until the price of the barrel of oil gets back to a 
much more acceptable level, and until the price of gasoline gets 
back to a more affordable level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are we talking about a temporary reduction? It is of course 
because there are all sorts of issues related to this question, 
including environmental issues and, also, our taxation level 
compared to levels elsewhere. 
We are not ignoring that, but we want to send a clear message to 
consumers that we will help them, that it is not true that all 
the tax reductions granted to them in the last budgets will all 
be absorbed by the increase in energy prices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Gasoline is one thing. What is less obvious but even more 
dramatic is the situation of all those who use fuel to heat 
their homes. Last winter, heating bills doubled. This winter, 
things will not get any better. It is often low or middle income 
people who use such heating systems and they are hit hard. To 
have to pay twice as much in heating costs in January and 
February when one is already on a very tight budget is a real 
nightmare. It is definitely not easy. 
There should also be special measures to help these people out 
so that the present crisis does not hit them too hard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We on this side have four proposals.  Obviously, we want a 
temporary suspension of the 10 cent a litre excise tax 
immediately.  That is very important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, we want to talk about the industry's practices.  I will 
elaborate on this—I will come back to it and develop it further—to 
show that there should be special measures to improve 
competitive practices in this industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also want to see investment in alternative energies. 
We should not find ourselves with every successive crisis—this is 
not the first time there has been a fuel crisis, and at some 
point we will have to learn—back in the same situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are very dependent on petroleum products.  There are areas in 
which alternatives are emerging.  But the power of the petroleum 
industry, which has no interest in seeing alternatives 
developed, makes funding research difficult in these sectors. 
Without public funding to develop alternative energies, the 
obstacles to their becoming a reality and benefiting consumers 
are obviously considerable.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to come back to competition.  The federal 
government is responsible for this issue.  There is competition 
legislation.  It is in the government's court.  The government 
does not have to wait for Tom, Dick or Harry, the provinces, its 
neighbour or the international community.  It has responsibility 
for the competition laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have here a report produced in 1998 by a committee of the 
Liberal Party that looked at the gasoline issue.  We are not 
talking prehistory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This report pointed out repeatedly that there were many 
shortcomings in the competitive practices of this industry.  It 
even said at one point that the Canadian market is a bonanza for 
petroleum producers. 
A very well done study also showed that our average gas price 
before taxes is 4 or 5 cents higher than in comparable markets 
in the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it that we always pay more here for our petroleum 
products, yet the federal government does nothing but sit on its 
hands?  Competition issues were indeed looked at a little, but 
no measures with any clout have ever been forthcoming to remedy 
what is going on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How, for example, can it be possible for three companies, which 
are refiners, distributors and retailers all at the same time, 
to control 75% of wholesale sales?  The market is dominated by 
only a few players, who control the situation.  They have a huge 
ability to influence prices.  Successful operation is not easy 
when the station across the street buys its gas from the same 
supplier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To take an example, and I do not want to name anyone in 
particular, we have an independent right across the street from 
an Esso, and they both buy from the same refinery.  It is 
understandable that it is not easy to do business when you have 
the people who sell you your gas operating right across the 
street. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal's recommendations contained some very interesting 
points.  For example, might it not be worthwhile to separate 
refining and retail sales, so that one company could not do 
both? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing socialistic about this.  It is already in place 
in several of the American states.  It is designed to ensure 
competition at both levels: refinery and sales.  The best way to 
do so is to not allow companies to be so vertically integrated 
and to control virtually the entire market, including sales to 
their competitors, that such a situation can result. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This fascinates me.  I have studied economics and if I go back 
to school, I will study the oil companies.  Why is the price 
always the same at the retailers?  Why is the price always the 
same at Esso, Ultramar and Petro Canada?  Why does one of the 
businesses not take a little initiative and edge out the others 
by one or two cents for a few months as the result of 
discovering better technology or coming up with a better 
marketing strategy?  Why does no company ever stand out from the 
others? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a mystery to me.  Why, in a competitive market, does no 
company ever take the lead, other than temporarily?  Why does no 
company make the necessary adjustments and finally lower its 
price? This indicates clearly that there is no healthy 
competition in the industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a good thing to lower taxes, but it is a temporary and 
exceptional measure.  We must not, however, lose sight of the 
fact that there are problems in this industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that some members on the other side of the House agree 
with this.  I am looking forward to seeing how they will vote 
when the time comes.  I know that on the other side of the 
House, if they stick by their recommendations, there will have 
to be amendments so that a few players will no longer have such 
sway over the Canadian petroleum market.  This is an element of 
competition the government can work on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish we would act quickly, and not wait for the Conference 
Board study, but to have a very clear debate or have the 
minister refer the whole matter immediately to committee in 
order to consider the appropriateness of separating the 
activities of retailing and refining. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This does not mean that refiners could no longer retail their 
products, but they could have, for example, a limited percentage 
of shares. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Imperial Oil wants to retail its products, it could perhaps 
hold a certain percentage of shares, up to a limit of, say, 15%, 
20% or 25%. This is already done in other areas. It is done in 
the banking sector. It is done elsewhere to avoid having some 
people control the market. It could also be done in the gasoline 
industry.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A refiner marketer could be allowed to have a limited interest. 
It could also be prohibited from getting into the retail 
business. Other players would then take over, thus creating 
greater competition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to be clear. We are not saying that people who own or 
manage a gas station in their community are not doing their best 
to be competitive. However, given the price they pay refiners 
for gasoline, they have little leeway. Very often, they are told 
what price to sell their gasoline; they get a call, saying 
“Starting this morning, this is what the price will be”. This is 
how it works. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people are not very vocal, because they are in business. 
But when we talk to people who used to be in business but no 
longer are, we realize that some very dubious practices exist in 
some cases. These practices do not comply with the spirit of the 
Competition Act, which seeks to protect consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some interesting possibilities were raised by the Liberals 
themselves—again, and I am not afraid to say so—in a good report 
that was released. The problem is not the quality of the report, 
but the will to implement it. A lot of good work has gone into 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A large part of the study took place in Ontario. Not much time 
was spent in Quebec. It would have been nice if they had spent 
some time in Quebec, but the situation is very similar. The 
dynamics are the same. Now, the government's knee-jerk reaction 
is to say that this is an international issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not interested in demagoguery.  We know that the price of 
a barrel of oil dropped to $10 or $12 and has just soared to $35 
or $37, or thereabouts, in recent days.  We are all aware of 
this.  We know that this accounts for much of the price hike. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But I would like someone to explain something to me.  Normally, 
when you have a business and the price of whatever you sell 
keeps going up—as we have seen with gasoline—consumers try to cut 
back a bit, and the business is forced to lower its profits to 
protect its share of the market.  This is not the right context 
in which to go after greater profits.  How is it then that, at 
the same time as such a serious crisis, with consumers 
ultra-sensitive to prices, we see the oil companies making record 
profits?  This is very disturbing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I realize that some companies are involved in direct activities, 
meaning that they make more money if the price per barrel goes 
up, but I would like to know where this money comes from.  What 
were the retail profits compared to the preceding quarter or the 
last one or two years? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are comprehensive and very complex financial statements. 
It is not possible to determine how they made this money.  Is it 
just the increase in a barrel of oil?  Is it more than that? 
Are we not still paying a few cents a litre too many at the 
pump? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support the Canadian Alliance motion, with one exception:  it 
completely ignores the competition angle.  I agree that there 
should be temporary tax relief, but sight should not be lost of 
the fact that there are ongoing problems in the industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance's proposal is to permanently lower prices, 
in a competitive market, by about three cents a litre. 
Comparing the American market, healthy competition could have 
the same effect, and permanently.  A permanent combination of 
the two measures in a good competitive market could bring prices 
down by 7 or 8 cents a litre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This raises some questions.  Do we want to stimulate sales of a 
product we know has an environmental impact?  This raises 
another issue relating to what I was saying earlier: we must 
invest in alternative energies, because our dependency on 
petroleum products must be reduced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The omission, or what we would have liked to have seen from the 
Canadian Alliance as far as competition is concerned, is quite 
understandable.  We know where the oil patch is located. 
It does not take much scrutiny of a map of Canada to realize 
that Alberta does not have much to complain about as far as the 
price of a barrel of oil is concerned.  This is understandable, 
for it means money in the pockets of their fellow citizens. 
Human nature being what it is, we would probably have the same 
reflex, but a broader perspective is needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some Liberals, but I will not name names, will have to stand and 
be counted when this motion is put to a vote.  People cannot say 
they are going to vote it down because it is insufficient.  We 
have to start somewhere, and this is a step in the right 
direction.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One great advantage of lowering taxes will be the very strong 
pressure that doing so will exert on the government to improve 
the situation and perhaps recover this money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We wanted to give it a stronger and temporary character because 
the government would perhaps say “I suspended my ten cent excise 
tax. It brings in nearly $400 billion a month.  Perhaps if I 
were to make competition stronger it would be better to set 
profits at four or five cents a litre and for us to then take 
four or five cents in excise tax”.  That might be a good thing. 
It would be to the government's advantage in economic and 
financial terms if it considered this issue with a little 
greater urgency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In European countries, there has been much unrest.  We must not 
think the same thing will not happen here too.  The price per 
barrel of oil is very high despite the recent decision by the 
OPEC countries.  There is talk of a threatened traffic tie-up by 
the Ontario association of truckers tomorrow.  The economy is 
relatively strong.  The truckers were busy working this summer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the fall, the economy always slows down a bit.  When they 
have a little more time available and they let off a little 
steam and they try to make their truck payment and so on, some 
people will, when they are not carrying merchandise, make 
themselves heard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are others too.  I am thinking, for example, about farmers 
over the summer.  This is not the best time for demonstrations. 
The government should not be surprised, though, if the situation 
gets worse. 
One simply has to talk to people to realize that the public is 
greatly concerned by the price of gasoline. People are asking 
the government to take action at two levels: by lowering the tax 
and by making the oil industry accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it—there are a lot of unanswered questions but I raise 
them nevertheless—that last spring we had days where—the figures 
here are only indicative of the situation, but the differences 
reflect the facts—gasoline sold at 65.9 cents in the morning, at 
72.9 cents in the afternoon, and then at 68.9 cents the next 
morning? During that time, the price of the barrel of oil 
remained stable. Why is it that there were such strong 
fluctuations over such short periods? Why is it that, at a time 
when market conditions were stable, the price of gasoline 
sometimes fluctuated by as much as 10% in a single day? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Oil companies must be made accountable. 
I would like to see them come before us to explain in detail the 
profits they make at the retail level. They can tell us anything 
they want, because we cannot check the facts. That is the 
problem. We should pass a better Competition Act and set up a 
more effective competition bureau with a special mandate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also asked for such a mandate for the competition bureau, 
with regard to the oil industry. We should dangle a sword of 
Damocles over the head of the oil industry, we should make it 
feel some pressure and we should constantly monitor it to keep 
it in the straight and narrow. 
It takes exceptional measures to follow up on a regular basis, 
to examine the financial statements of oil companies, to make 
them accountable, to not always be the ones bearing the burden 
of proof but to make them accountable sometimes. I think such 
measures would help improve the situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, because my time is running out, we will support 
this motion which, I hope, will be agreed to. It would be better 
to suspend collection of the full excise tax, and we continue to 
ask for such a measure. But the motion of the Canadian Alliance 
does not exclude that and we will support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want the government to wake up and to assume its 
responsibilities. There are competition problems within the 
industry. 
There comes a time when the government must stop burying its 
head in the sand and must stop telling itself that all the 
decisions are made elsewhere, that the international situation 
is to be blamed or that it is the provinces' fault. The federal 
government has responsibilities and it has the financial means 
and the legal authority. Let us see it use them.

</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I am a little perplexed.  The member opposite insisted 
that we remove the federal excise tax totally but he failed to

the federal excise tax.  Additionally, there is a 7.5% sales tax 
in Quebec even on fuel oil.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for her 
question.  It will give me an opportunity to raise a point I did 
not cover in my speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that the provincial governments, and I am going to 
talk about Quebec, with which I am more familiar, tax gasoline, 
but they have responsibility for the roads.  I would point out 
that, when we add up the revenues from the two taxes mentioned, 
compared to what the Department of Transport contributes, it 
works out to about the same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ottawa is collecting close to $5 billion a year in excise tax 
alone. 
How much is Ottawa putting back into roads?  Very little.  Not 
even 20% of gasoline taxes is reinvested in transportation or in 
the environment, and I am talking about the entire Department of 
Transport budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must keep things in perspective.  Nor is it necessary to be a 
math wizard to see that the provincial coffers are not in the 
same shape as those of the federal government.  Here, only four 
months into the year, there is a $11.2 billion surplus, whereas 
a surplus of $1.5 billion or $2 billion would be exceptional for the 
government of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, there are provincial taxes on gasoline.  If the hon. member 
is interested in more information, she should know that there 
are regional rebates. 
The 15 cents a litre she is referring to is not the figure 
everywhere; it is 15.2 cents, but in certain regions with less 
tax it can be as low as 10.9 cents.  It is not 15 everywhere. 
Of course, if a person were to take the maximum and use it as a 
comparison, that does yield the figures we have just been given. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This does not mean that one day the provinces will not join in a 
movement, but it is not true to say that Ottawa is going to use 
the fact that the provinces do not initiate the offensive as 
an excuse not to do so itself.  Ottawa should set the tone.  If 
the provinces want to improve the process later, all the better. 
I am not excluding that possibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, the federal government has the capacity to take 
action, and the responsibility to do so, particularly since I 
would very much like to see reference in this debate to the 
profit the government makes from gas taxes, from its shares in 
Petro Canada, from its partnership as well in the Hibernia 
drilling rig.  The federal government rakes in a lot from all 
this but very little gets reinvested in transportation 
infrastructures, the road system or the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is material for a very worthwhile debate on this matter 
and I am ready any time to make a comparison with what Ottawa is 
doing.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton Centre-East, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for making 
several points on the issue but I want him to expand on the 
revenue that the federal government is receiving from this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my understanding that the federal government does collect 
some $5 billion in revenue from taxation and returns a paltry 
$200 million back to the provincial government in transfers for 
road and highway improvements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member not agree that the gas pump is actually being 
used as a cash cow for the finance minister and that consumers 
are being milked by a callous government with this overtaxation? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien:</B> Mr. Speaker, I totally agree with what my 
colleague has said.  The tax on gas is a cash cow for the 
government.  It is extremely profitable, and the government 
reinvests little of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is all very well to boast from time to time because there is 
an infrastructure program, even if the infrastructure 
megaprograms represent an investment of $2 billion over three 
years, which represents about $700 million a year for all of 
Canada.  Every year, the government collects $5 billion in 
taxes, excluding revenues from the GST.  With the excise tax, it 
is nearly $5 billion a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The total budget of the Department of Transport, including the 
rail, air, land and other sectors, amounts to no more than $1 
billion.  The same is true of the Department of the Environment. 
In social terms, the government could say that gasoline taxes 
fund the highways network and are reinvested in the environment, 
because there are alternatives to gasoline, which affects the 
environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would have no problem with closely examining the issue of 
dedicated taxes and having the excise tax go to funding them. 
The federal government would have to deal with the following 
problem: either it reinvests more in highways and the 
environment or it reduces its taxes, because they are not 
justified and it should not be taking this amount of taxes.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I totally agree with that and hope that the entire debate on the 
present matter will lead us to look at what is actually 
happening in the federal government, at how it profits hugely 
from the current situation and the high taxation, which is quite 
indecent, given how little of it is reinvested.  The comments by 
the Alliance member in this regard are absolutely right. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK47"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I observe that Quebec is the only province where the 
provincial tax on fuel exceeds the federal tax.  All other 
provinces have a provincial tax which is less than the federal 
tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Check again.  You are looking at diesel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  I am not looking at diesel.  I am looking at 
gasoline, which is what we are talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member comment on the role the gasoline tax plays in 
the province of Quebec vis-à-vis the provincial tax? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not have the exact figures 
with me, but I can assure the hon. member that it is not true 
that Quebec is the only place where the provincial tax is 
not lower than the excise tax. There are other provinces where 
that is also the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mac Harb:</B> In New Brunswick. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien:</B> The hon. member mentioned New Brunswick. I 
believe there are other maritime provinces where the situation 
is similar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, as regards the fuel tax in Quebec, which is 
15.2 cents per litre, there is a tax rebate in several regions 
and that rebate varies roughly between 10.5 and 15.2 cents per 
litre. So, in some cases, that tax is much closer to the level 
of the excise tax, while in other cases it is higher. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After this technical explanation I should add that, in my 
opinion, the justification is better when we consider what the 
government reinvested in the road network. In Quebec, the 
amounts collected in gas taxes and the amounts reinvested in the 
transportation budget are similar. The percentage is much closer 
than it is at the federal level. I believe that over 80% is 
reinvested. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, this is much closer to the principle of a dedicated tax. In 
Quebec, if we add the environment, we are almost there. I do not 
know the situation for every province, but I know that this is 
the case for Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why I think it is justified to have gasoline taxes. It 
is normal to apply the user pay principle. It is normal that the 
users of the road network make a greater financial contribution. 
This does not mean that other members of the public should not 
contribute, because everyone uses transportation infrastructures 
in some way.  But it is only normal that users should pay more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Except that right now we have reached the limits of what is 
tolerable.  Some help is needed on a number of fronts for 
consumers of gasoline and diesel fuel, for truckers and for 
those who are or will be using heating oil for their energy 
needs, especially this winter, because it is going to cost them 
quite a bit.  Action is needed on all fronts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is where I feel the Canadian Alliance motion has something 
of a flaw, and it concerns the GST rebate for truckers. Fuel may 
be seen by many as input; they have tax refunds.  For them, 
therefore, lowering the GST would not mean much of a change in 
their situation. 
That is why we are focusing more on the excise tax, because this 
can also help truckers, particularly the independents, facing 
tough situations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will therefore conclude by saying that we are going to support 
the motion.  Other things can be done as well to improve the 
situation and take things even further.  Let us not lose sight 
of the fact that what we have here is a Canadian industry with a 
competition problem and that that is what we must tackle, not 
just in 2001, after the Conference Board has pronounced, but 
sooner than that.  We can do it and we do not need to look very 
far; if we look across the border, a number of American states 
have laws that could quite easily be adapted to our situation 
here.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I too am 
pleased to take part in this important but I would suggest 
relatively simplistic debate today.  The motion before us talks 
about a portion of the oil profits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have a difficult time digesting the oil situation, the 
cost of gasoline at the pumps and the cost of home heating fuel. 
They know that taxes form a small component in this regard. 
However if we were to ask Canadians their concerns with regard to 
the reality of the prices, we would be told that they are 
twofold.  Well ahead of taxes is the oil cartel, the Organization 
of Petroleum Exporting Countries.  The second concern would be 
the high, obscene profits enjoyed by Canadian oil companies about 
which we will talk a bit later.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those numbers in any public domain polling are far higher than 
the component of gasoline but they are not mentioned.  Gasoline 
profits are not mentioned in the resolution before us this 
morning.  In fact the reform alliance party never mentions this 
topic, obviously because it does not want to offend its friends 
in the oil patch in Alberta when the newly crowned leader of the 
party is looking to sell tables at $25,000 a pop or when he is 
meeting or has met with the Conseil du patronat and he identifies 
himself with the business community.  I am splitting my time with 
the member for Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was looking back this morning in preparation for this speech 
and I noted that there were 75 sitting days between February and 
June in the House of Commons.  On any given day the reform 
alliance had an opportunity to ask about 19 questions.  If my 
math is correct, and it may be suspect, that is about 1,425 
opportunities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How many questions were there on gasoline pricing?  None, nada, 
zero, nothing, except to repeat the lines of the big oil 
companies.  If we are not prepared to talk about oil profits and 
we are not prepared to talk about OPEC, we are not really dealing 
with the heart of the matter.  I think Canadians understand that 
especially when they see that gas company profits for the last 
quarter have jumped by an average of $558 million or a percentage 
increase year over year for the second quarter of 2000 of over 
500%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Someone who has talked a lot about this topic in the House of 
Commons this year is my colleague, the member for 
Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre.  He has been indefatigable on the 
subject of fuel costs since arriving in the House some seven 
years ago.  In fact 10 times in the past year he has had specific 
questions for the Minister of Natural Resources and other 
ministers on the subject of gasoline pricing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He has warned the House that oil companies have driven down 
their inventories on home heating fuel by some 39% since last 
year and that the result inevitably will be sharply higher 
heating bills this fall.  He has asked the Minister of Natural 
Resources to organize or arrange a summit with the oil companies 
and to put a plan into place.  There is no hint of that in the 
motion before us today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre has private member's 
Bill C-488 calling for an energy prices commission, something 
that the member for Regina—Qu'Appelle was asking about earlier 
in this debate.  It is an energy summit to make the oil companies 
accountable for their actions.  Because energy is the 
underpinning of our economy it is vital in a geographically 
dispersed country such as ours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Energy price shocks have triggered rounds of inflation before 
that have ultimately put many Canadians out of work and have 
driven up the cost of living for everyone.  Surely, if we accept 
the regulation of freight rates, drug pricing, stamps and cable 
TV, it is not out of line to consider regulating the price of a 
key commodity and economic input like energy that is used by 
virtually every Canadian family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member's private member's bill seeks to avoid unreasonable 
increases.  On that topic, it was instructive for me, as my 
colleague from Winnipeg Centre mentioned earlier in the debate, 
that Prince Edward Island is one province that has some form of 
an energy review commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was there earlier this year I noticed that not only were 
prices lower in P.E.I. than they seemed to be in other parts of 
the country but what was even more interesting was that the 
spread between premium and regular gasoline was about 4 cents a 
litre as opposed to the 9 cents or 10 cents a litre that the rest 
of us pay.  When I asked an official at Petro-Canada about it 
some time ago he just dismissed it and said “That is our profit 
margin and we are not going to touch it”.

<A HREF="#LINKT23"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those of us who are old enough to remember when it was sold 
in gallons rather than litres, the price spread was not anything 
like a 40 or 50 cents a gallon difference between premium and 
regular fuel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Something else is noteworthy and could be done.  When the energy 
price shock first hit after the Arab-Israeli war in the early 
seventies many Canadian provinces, perhaps all of them, 
implemented a program whereby there was no price increase.  If 
the cost of a barrel of oil went up, they determined that there 
was a 60 day supply in the line and that no price increase could 
therefore take place at the pumps prior to 60 days.  It seems to 
me that would be useful and worth exploring by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an aside, I am sure I would have the support of the hon. 
member from Labrador opposite who I recall was most upset last 
year about a tanker on its way up to Labrador in September filled 
with home heating fuel.  The price was jumped while the tanker 
was in transit.  Even though they had paid one price, they were 
to reap a windfall profit from the good folks in Labrador when it 
got to port. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-488 would reduce the risk of collusion by involving the 
Competition Act.  We feel that the government has refused to take 
appropriate action and obviously the reform alliance has moved 
this motion on pricing— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  I 
decided to count them and after three times I would rise on a 
point of order.  The hon. member has now misnamed our party three 
times.  It is the Canadian Alliance.  The Speaker has previously 
ruled that is the name to be used in the House.  I would ask you 
to call him on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. member for 
Elk Island has made the point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor:</B>  Mr. Speaker, there is nothing here on 
the environment, something else that is very important to this 
party.  We need to see something in energy on supporting 
expansion and use of public transit.  As my colleague from 
Winnipeg Centre mentioned on countless occasions, we need to 
retrofit buildings to meet higher standards of energy efficiency 
and we need a green screen.  We need to encourage green 
industries and technologies, but we do not get very much, if 
anything, from the government opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Something potentially very interesting is happening on this 
front in the province of Saskatchewan.  One company is looking at 
building an ethanol plant in the prairie provinces that would use 
straw and other biomass which could produce up to nine billion 
litres of gasoline.  This holds some hope for the future but it 
is not clear to me what, if anything, the government is doing to 
assist that process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We seem to be stumbling toward Kyoto without our ducks being 
lined up, without knowing what it is that we will actually 
achieve on that front. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to promote fair fuel prices through an energy price 
commission and approve fuel price increases in the future in a 
transparent way.  We want to reduce gridlock.  We want greenhouse 
gases to be controlled, none of which is happening because of the 
higher prices that Canadians are paying at the moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, with the deficit eliminated finally there is 
certainly no rationale to keep the surtax on.  As far as it goes 
the motion is supportable by us, but we do so with the 
recognition and realization that it could have been so much 
better by way of a resolution to the House which would have 
included an energy price commission, a green screen and a 
rational way to absorb price hikes in the future. 
<P><A NAME="LINK49"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I listened carefully to the hon. member's speech and I appreciate 
his thoughtful presentation.  He talked a couple of times about a 
bad thing, the high prices that the oil companies are charging, 
whereas in fact roughly 50% of the value of the product is 
charged in taxes.  Taxes are a very large component of the price 
we pay at the pumps.

<A HREF="#LINKT24"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the profits the companies are making, it seems 
as if the prices have gone up primarily due to the change in the 
world supply as manipulated by the people in the near east.  When 
the world supply goes down the price seems to go up.  That seems 
to be one of the rules of economics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the member proposing that we have a two price system, that we 
sell domestically a product that is comparable to what we are 
willing to pay and with exports we go with the world price? Would 
he then extend that to farm product prices so that Canadian 
farmers would have one price for their product if it was sold 
domestically and another price on the international market?  I 
would like the member to expand on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is interesting that he 
said the taxes were approximately 50% of the total price at the 
pumps. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  No, I said of the product. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor:</B>  Oh, of the product.  The former leader 
of the Reform Party, when he was speaking earlier, said that it 
accounted for 40%, give or take 10%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The answer to the question on the two price system is, no, 
simply because under the North American Free Trade Agreement, as 
the member should know, it would be specifically prohibited to 
have a two price system for oil, natural gas or any farm 
commodity. 
<P><A NAME="LINK50"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague from 
Palliser for his presentation and his environmental concerns of 
fuel and taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all saw what happened in England when there was a truckers' 
blockage.  We saw shortages in the stores.  We saw hospitals open 
for emergencies only and selective surgery shut down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that petroleum from the North Sea will be completely 
gone by the year 2020.  With that in mind, knowing that time is 
catching up to us, can he recommend to Canada what we should be 
doing in terms of going beyond petroleum?  Like the commercial, 
BP now says that we are beyond petroleum.  If we could reduce 
taxes on petroleum that would be great, but the long term picture 
is what our grandchildren will do without petroleum products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can he elaborate a bit more on what Canada and governments 
should be doing to see that our children have renewable, 
sustainable energy for their products as well? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor:</B>  Madam Speaker, this is an extremely 
important question since the world supply of fossil fuel is 
finite.  There are varying debates as to how many years it will 
last but we simply have to get on top of this issue in terms of 
new products like ethanol and other products.  There has to be 
more use of battery operated vehicles.  Perhaps we need to 
encourage that direction by looking at additional costs for the 
price of the fancy, gas guzzling SUVs, which some people prefer 
to purchase, that clog the highways and do nothing for the 
greenhouse gas emissions that Canadians are facing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a range of answers that are available but what we need 
is a government that has the will to do the job. 
<P><A NAME="LINK51"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, 
NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, first, I want to say that the New 
Democratic Party will be supporting the motion when it is put 
later today in terms of what could be one small effort to deal 
with what has become a major issue, indeed a crisis in much of 
the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a lot of mystery, mythology and confusion surrounding 
this issue.  For example, I was trying to think the other day, 
when the Canadian Alliance holds its fundraiser in Toronto in a 
few days, and it is charging $25,000 a table— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Isn't it $2,500? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  No, it is $25,000 a table.  I just 
cannot imagine it. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1205"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT25"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I raised this with some of my Canadian Alliance friends in 
Kamloops, they said “Mr. Riis, you are wrong.  The Canadian 
Alliance would never have a fundraiser where the price is $25,000 
for a little table”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  Are they not the grassroots party? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  That is what they said, that they are 
the grassroots party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said “Listen, I will check”.  I came back and checked with 
some of my friends here and was told that it was $25,000 a table. 
I had to wonder who on earth had $25,000 to go to that lunch to 
help out the Canadian Alliance.  Well I noticed the other day 
that the hottest stocks on the market these days are the oil and 
gas stocks.  They are rocking and rolling in the oil patch.  This 
is looking very good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I then began to wonder about the profits of the big oil 
companies.  I will give a few examples.  Imperial Oil's profits 
from last June to this June only went up 120%, Shell's profits 
went up 155%, PanCanadian's profits went up 271%, Petro-Canada's 
profits actually went up 314%, Canadian Occidental's profits went 
up 429%, Canadian Natural Resources' profits went up 518%, 
Alberta Energy's profits went up 616%, and Husky Energy's profits 
went up 2000%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The oil companies are doing extremely well.  I guess that is why 
the oil and gas stocks on the exchange these days are just 
booming.  That is where people are putting their money these days 
to make some good income.  I guess the first mystery as to who 
will be able to afford the $25,000 tables has now been solved.  I 
suspect a lot of the oil company reps will be there but we will 
have a look at that when we find out who is attending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also another mystery.  I think all of us know that just 
before a holiday weekend, such as Christmas, Thanksgiving or May 
24, the prices go up all over the country.  The price will go up 
10 cents a litre overnight because they know that people are 
travelling and they have no choice but to buy gas.  There is a 
little spike of super profit before every holiday weekend.  The 
oil companies, when asked, say that is just the way the market 
is.  Well, fair enough, that is the way the market is for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other mysteries.  On one of the corners in Kamloops 
there are four gas stations.  When we checked last week, the 
price was 71.9 cents at every single gas station.  Where is the 
competition?   When we go into a 7-11 to get milk, it is always 
priced differently from one store to another.  Chocolate bars are 
different.  Everything is different, but when it comes to gas it 
is always the same.  That is a mystery of the marketplace that we 
hear of all the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a matter of fact, among those four gas stations, three are 
self-serve and one is full serve.  In other words, people are 
hired at the full serve station to clean our windows, check our 
oil and tires and yet it has the same price as the stations that 
have no people serving us, just a little machine.  This is a 
mystery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The biggest mystery is that we are having a debate today that 
was initiated by Canadian Alliance members.  I am trying to 
think, as my friend from Palliser said, when they have asked 
questions in the House of Commons about gas prices.  I think he 
said that out of the 1,400 questions asked recently there were 
virtually none asked by the Canadian Alliance members.  All of a 
sudden there is a reborn gas prices type of person who has seen 
the light and knows that gas prices are of concern to Canadians. 
However, to be fair, at least we are having this discussion 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Forty-two per cent of the price of gas at the pumps is a result 
of taxation.  We agree that the 1.5 cents a litre surtax put on 
to combat the deficit ought to be taken off.  We have also said 
that now that the deficit is under control there are all sorts of 
things we should be doing.  What about health care, education and 
all sorts of useful programs that have been cut over the last 
number of years? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other issue I have is double taxation.  I think anyone in 
the country who is honest and fair with themselves, as the 
Liberal task force actually was, would say that double taxation, 
taxes on taxes, is kind of nutty, inappropriate and just not 
right.  I think it was the Liberal task force that said it is a 
dumb thing to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Later today we will find out if the Liberals will actually 
follow their own advice and do what Liberals tell them to do.

</I></B></P><P align=left>What are some of the other solutions?  Let us face it, this is 
an interesting initiative put forward by the Canadian Alliance, 
but will it really solve the energy crisis in our country?  The 
answer is, no, much more is required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague already mentioned Bill C-384, an energy price 
commission, and said that we regulate all sorts of things. Canada 
is the second largest country in the world geographically where 
the price of fuels is factored into the cost of every single good 
and commodity in our country, everything from pantyhose to grain. 
One would think that if there was ever a country in the world 
that would be concerned that whatever the increases were that 
they would be reasonable, it would be Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre is suggesting 
that we put together an energy price commission as they do in 
P.E.I.  It works reasonably well in P.E.I.  It could even be 
doing more.  If we regulate stamps and all sorts of other things, 
why would we not regulate the one commodity that touches the cost 
of living of every single person?  It just makes nothing but 
sense.  That is one good idea we will put on the table for 
consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another good idea is the one suggested by my friend from Elk 
Island, which is the fact that oil companies pay world price for 
oil.  That is only partly true.  Who does the drilling?  Let us 
talk about Imperial Oil.  Imperial Oil explores for oil, drills 
for oil, transports oil, refines oil, trucks oil, wholesales oil 
and retails oil.  In other words, vertical integration.  It has 
the whole thing sewed up.  When we talk about the world price 
that the OPEC nations are influencing, Imperial Oil does the 
whole thing, from finding it, digging it out and pumping it into 
our tanks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing we could do is what some of the states do in the 
United States, which is to break up that retail sector so that we 
would actually have real independent retailers and the oil 
companies would actually have some competition in the 
marketplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now I think it is fair to say that we have four big oil 
companies virtually controlling the entire market. Is it 
collusion?  Is it price-fixing?  Is it a cartel operating? Is it 
a monopoly or an oligopoly?  It probably is but it is hard to 
prove, as my friend from Pickering knows.  However, we all know 
that is what takes place, a sort of informal form of 
price-fixing, which is why we need a regulator.  We need to break 
up the oil companies so that the retail sector is an independent 
sector with some real competition in the marketplace as we see 
even in that bastion of capitalism, the United States of America. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More important, if we are looking at the future, all of us will 
have to acknowledge that fossil fuel is not and cannot be the 
future because one day it will simply cost too much to develop, 
it will be too remote, too difficult and too environmentally 
unsound. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend mentioned Kyoto and what we have to do about that.  We 
have to start putting more of an effort into the development of 
alternate forms of energy.  Alberta is doing that now and is 
leading the way in wind technology.  It is looking at geothermal 
technology and the big cell development like Ballard's fuel cells 
and so on.  Canada is actually leading the way in terms of 
developing those technologies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could be doing all sorts of things but we seem to be fixated 
on the oil companies, who, I hate to say, will probably be buying 
most of the seats at the Canadian Alliance fundraiser at $25,000 
a table, where they may have undue influence in terms of public 
policy development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to acknowledge that we have to develop alternative forms 
of energy at a much greater rate than we are doing today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some other alternatives on the table.  This is a very 
small step toward a resolution but the New Democratic Party will 
be supporting this initiative when it comes up for a vote later 
today.

<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to point out to the hon. member, who has looked at the 
the Liberal caucus committee report on gasoline pricing, that he 
should not fall into the trap of the Alliance and only read the 
first recommendation.  He should also read the next 
recommendation which is contingent on the first occurring.  I 
will read it for him: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee further recommends that if the GST is removed from 
other taxes, the federal government should undertake measures to 
ensure the resulting savings are passed on to consumers, and not 
merely absorbed by the oil industry.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since there has been sudden newfound wisdom by some in the House 
on this very question, I ask the hon. member a question. 
Considering what ARCO did in terms of its activities over the 
past year by driving the price of retail below the cost of even 
taxation let alone wholesale, and the resulting damage of higher 
prices in British Columbia, would he not see wisdom that it can 
also be found on page 34 of this report with respect to the 
concerns that the British Columbia government has already brought 
forth in its inquiry and more important, ensure that he does not 
vote in favour of this motion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>   Madam Speaker, I will agree with half 
of the point my hon. friend from Pickering makes.  That is, I 
will follow the suggestion of the present leader of the Canadian 
Alliance.  When he was treasurer of Alberta he was concerned 
about the same thing, that having a small tax reduction without 
any controls on it would likely result in the oil companies 
making even greater profits.  They would take advantage of the 
confusion in the marketplace and do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, if my recollection is clear, Premier Harris was also 
warning us of this possibility, that removing a point or two of 
taxation simply means that the oil companies would probably make 
even more profits than they are today.  That is not the point of 
this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point on page 34 is well taken, that simply to take this 
initiative and result in greater oil company profits is obviously 
not what is intended.  To be fair, I do not think that is what is 
intended by the motion before us.  It is a concern that we would 
have to find some way to monitor it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think it would warrant voting against the motion simply 
because the follow-up is yet to be determined or arranged or some 
policy put into place to ensure the benefit is passed along to 
the Canadian consumer. 
<P><A NAME="LINK53"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Madam Speaker, it is often difficult to sit here 
and have one's position twisted and made to appear very different 
than it is.  I was listening to the NDP members talk about how 
many questions we have asked in the House of Commons.  They did 
not do their math right.  Somebody in their research department 
really could not count.  I would ask them to go back and maybe 
withdraw the numbers they have there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They try to indicate that we have not raised this issue in the 
House of Commons previously, but nothing could be further from 
the truth.  In fact, the member for Palliser, who said that we 
have not done anything in this regard, and the member who just 
spoke have not done their research.  I personally have been 
raising this issue for more than three years.  I have talked 
about it in speeches.  In agriculture I have called upon the 
federal government to reduce the tax burden on fuel.  I have said 
that this is an unfair burden that cannot be passed along. We 
have talked about the price of fuel for a long time.  For them to 
indicate otherwise is totally false.  I think the public ought to 
know that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>   Madam Speaker, my friend from the 
Canadian Alliance indicates that somehow we were attempting to 
distort the situation.  To be fair, he has done exactly that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point made by my friend from Palliser and reiterated by me 
was that when we looked at the record for question period, the 
number of questions asked by the Canadian Alliance over the last 
number of months, there were no questions we could identify which 
related to oil prices or gasoline prices. We stand to be 
corrected.  My challenge would be to correct that, but that is 
what our research indicated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I looked at it.  My friend looked at it.  Our researchers looked 
at it.  During question period, which is the time when we focus 
the concern of a political party as opposed to speeches generally 
and so on, there did not seem to be any record of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I stand corrected, but looking at the results, of the hundreds 
and hundreds of questions posed by the Canadian Alliance in 
question period, to our knowledge not a single one was calling 
for the government to take action on gasoline prices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  The hon. member asked that I correct that and I would 
like to correct it. I personally have included it in the 
questions.  It may not have that title in question period and 
also, that is not the only time.

<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debate today is not really about tax policy; it is about the 
response of the government to a growing crisis that is facing 
many Canadians and which is going without response right now.  In 
fact, this crisis could affect the very lives of men and women 
across our country.  It is not something to be casually put 
aside. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Monday my colleagues and I took the initiative to raise this 
issue.  We are pleased that there has been a follow through by 
the party formerly known as Reform.  It is our intention to 
support the motion when it comes forward to a vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues and I had the opportunity through the last several 
weeks to meet with representatives of trucking associations, 
among others.  Last night we met with the Greater Ottawa Trucking 
Association.  I want to express my appreciation to that 
association for its decision not to resort to any kind of public 
protest.  That is the appropriate way to deal with these issues 
at this time and is in stark contrast to some of the threats that 
were raised by the new gunslinger who hides out in the basement 
of the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two realities we have to face in this debate. The 
first is that Canadian citizens are facing fuel price increases 
which many of them simply cannot afford to pay and which are a 
very real risk to the health and to the lives of Canadians who 
are older or who are on low incomes.  That is one reality.  The 
second reality is that we have a federal government today that 
has billions of dollars of surplus money which is earning money 
from this crisis through the taxes that it collects.  It refuses 
to take any leadership on behalf of the citizens of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us deal with the first reality.  Let us deal with the 
question of the Canadians who are at risk right now.  We need 
only go anywhere in the country and look at the gas prices at the 
pumps.  They are rising regularly.  More seriously, look at the 
person who is a trucker in an industry upon which the country 
counts.  We see increases in diesel prices at the pumps from 
Corner Brook to Halifax to Yarmouth to Saint John to Quebec to 
Montreal to London to Red Deer to Vancouver to Whitehorse to 
every community in the country.  The trucking industry is being 
driven steadily toward bankruptcy by these increases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Trucking Alliance has said that fuel prices rose 
about 40% over the summer. In Ontario alone the average price of 
diesel fuel this year is 75% above what it was a year ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the opportunity on Saturday to meet Paul Easson of 
Easson's Transport of Berwick, Nova Scotia and a former president 
of the Atlantic Provinces Trucking Association.  He confirmed 
that increase causes as much difficulty for truckers in Atlantic 
Canada as it does anywhere else in the country.  The reality is 
clear.  No business can operate with increases like that as its 
biggest single expense.  That is the crisis the Canadian trucking 
industry is facing today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cruelest impact of these changes falls upon senior citizens, 
children and people on low incomes.  The Consumers' Association 
of Canada has said “Low income families and the elderly could 
face winter without heating and car fuel as our oil prices 
skyrocket”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Steve McIntosh, speaking on behalf of the Canadian Oil Heat 
Association said “We have already in Canada exceeded the price 
hikes that were experienced during the gulf war”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The National Pensioners' and Senior Citizens' Federation said 
yesterday “Many pensioners cannot afford to heat their homes 
properly”.  Obviously, living in the cold has very serious 
health implications.  Senior citizens are being put at risk by 
the government's indifference to this issue. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ones hardest hit by the far higher fuel oil and gasoline 
prices are older and low-income Canadians.  They are getting 
ready for a long hard winter.  Given their fixed incomes, these 
are the people least able to absorb sudden dramatic price jumps. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to Statistics Canada figures for 1998, there were an 
estimated 752,000 low-income families here in Canada, that is 
households with an income below the poverty line for a family of 
their size in their community.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Households headed by seniors have not seen any increase in their 
net incomes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government must take steps to assist these people.  Canada's 
northern climate requires people to heat their homes.  On the 
average, heating and hot water costs are going to be $1,450. 
This is $950 more than last year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government must show some leadership and not leave 
people to struggle on their own. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>General tax cuts do not help people who do not pay income tax. 
Yet these people pay the GST.  With respect to home heating 
fuels, the most direct way to help them is to take the GST off 
home heating fuels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second reality has been the surprising but consistent 
refusal of the federal government to lead on this issue.  It is 
an old story.  The Liberals' habit is to duck tough issues. They 
ducked on free trade.  They ducked on the Marshall decision. They 
ducked on the question of health care until the provinces forced 
them into an agreement.  They ducked on the question of refugees. 
Their answer on the issue of refugees was to wait for the 
weather to change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot have a government that leads by waiting in this 
country.  The Liberals' first excuse was that we have to wait for 
the world.  The Minister of Finance said “Canada cannot act 
until Belgium does.  Canada cannot act until Luxembourg does. 
Canada is waiting for Gabon”.  That is entirely inconsistent 
with the traditions of this country.  We are not some other 
country.  We are a geographic giant. We are a strong economy.  We 
are a winter country. We are a country with a huge surplus.  We 
are a country with an obligation to our citizens who are facing a 
crisis right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I make the point that on other major issues that involved 
international co-operation Canada did not wait.  We did not wait 
on acid rain.  We did not wait on free trade.  It is possible for 
this country to show leadership both to move the country forward 
and to help individuals who are struck now and are caught now in 
deep and serious personal difficulties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's excuse is that we have to wait for the 
provinces.  That is not leadership in a country like Canada. What 
the Government of Canada should be doing is causing the provinces 
to act.  Give them reason to act.  If the government will not 
give them reason, at least give them a telephone call. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday in question period the Minister of Finance had not 
even begun the consultations that might lead to a concerted 
action on taxes by the provinces and territories.  This country 
has a health accord only because the provinces forced the 
Government of Canada to act.  There is a clear duty of this 
parliament to force the government to act on this issue and there 
will be an opportunity in the vote on today's motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to refer briefly to the final excuse, that it is all the 
energy companies' fault.  If the Liberals are concerned that the 
benefits of a tax cut would not be passed on, let them deal with 
that question.  Let them act on this issue but do not hide behind 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The present Prime Minister, in an earlier capacity as long ago 
as 1978 said to the Windsor <I>Star</I>, one of the bastions of 
the Liberal Party “We will be in touch with the oil companies 
and tell them we want the money passed on”.  He was prepared to 
do that in 1976.  What has happened to his resolve now? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the Prime Minister hiding out behind the energy companies 
instead of calling them in, using all of the power of the office 
of the Prime Minister and saying that lives are at risk in Canada 
because of these high prices and it would not be acceptable for 
tax cuts not to be passed on to consumers?  Why is he not using 
the moral suasion that sits in the office of the Prime Minister 
of Canada to get some action? 
Canadians are at risk.  Truckers risk bankruptcy.  Senior 
citizens and people on low incomes risk having a winter that will 
not only be cold, but could be fatal.  This is the place from 
which action must come.  Now is the time for action.  Voting for 
this motion is a way in which the Parliament of Canada can force 
the Government of Canada to serve the people of Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dan McTeague (Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there is no doubt that the Right hon. Leader of the 
Conservative Party speaks from his heart on a question which this 
side of the House has for many times decided that this was to be 
an important issue.  It is only today with higher prices that the 
very things we were warned of in this document, which was very 
well written by my colleagues, have now come to bear fruition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not doubt the party's concern.  Yesterday, in most of the 
papers in their provinces another dimension of concentration in 
their neck of the woods is about to unfold with respect to the 
disruption of supply.  The right hon. member will also know about 
my recent letter with respect to the Energy Supplies Emergency 
Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the New Brunswick select committee's background and 
knowledge about what happens when taxes are reduced in the best 
intention of helping Canadian people, can the right hon. member 
tell me, given the motion that I read this morning about helping 
those with lower incomes with an immediate rebate, if this is not 
something he would agree with and by implication vote against the 
odious resolution motion by the Alliance Party?  Which is it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Joe Clark:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we have before the 
House a motion that would have the effect of causing the 
government to act.  It is not a wish by a private member.  I 
regret that the government's treatment of its private members has 
been by and large to ignore their initiatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliament has an opportunity to act.  The member asked me if I 
would make a choice.  Yes, I would make a choice.  My choice 
today would be to vote for this motion so there is increasing 
pressure upon the Government of Canada to stop ignoring the 
truckers, stop ignoring the poor and stop ignoring people who 
need help right now.  The only obstacle to that help sits in the 
front benches of the Liberal Party of Canada.  That is the issue. 
That is the choice of the opposition of the House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK56"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the Right hon. Leader of the 
Progressive Conservative Party talked about the need for the 
government to take action and that it should not wait.  When the 
Progressive Conservatives were in power they did not wait.  They 
invented the tax on diesel fuel and increased it twice to its 
current rate of 4 cents a litre.  In addition, with regard to the 
tax on gasoline, it increased the tax on gasoline six times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the Leader of the Progressive Conservative 
Party if he supports the comments of the premier of Ontario who 
said that if the government lowered its 14.7% flat tax on fuel 
the oil companies would just raise their prices in kind.   Mr. 
Palladini, the development minister of Ontario, said that 
whenever the government has cut fuel taxes it has not been 
reflected at the pumps and that international supply and demand 
and huge profits in the oil industry were definitely at the root 
of this problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does he support those statements by Tories in Ontario? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Joe Clark:</B>  Mr. Speaker, this normally would 
not be a history lesson except the hon. member obviously needs 
one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I became prime minister in 1979 and was introducing a 
budget, the deficit that we had inherited from previous Liberal 
governments was larger than the entire budget of the Government 
of Canada in 1967. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Revisionist history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Joe Clark:</B>  This is not revisionist history. 
These are absolute facts verifiable by anyone who is interested 
in looking them up.  The point is that those were actions that 
were taken to bring down cumulative deficits.  We are talking 
about now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member asked whether or not it would be possible to get 
agreement from the premiers given the fact that one of them has 
expressed reservations about proceeding.  Of course it is.  Are 
we going to give the premier of Ontario a veto over the fiscal 
policy of the Government of Canada because the premier of Ontario 
does not want to do something?  Is the Minister of Finance going 
to run away and say he cannot do anything because he is not the 
Minister of Finance anymore?  Is he going to say that he will 
just sit there and have his strings pulled by various provinces?

order.  Just so that we are clear, I can understand that when we 
are having exchanges during the question and comment period, we 
are trying to find out and clarify positions of different 
parties.  I think it is important that when someone speaks from 
one particular party that they do not also ask questions of their 
own member, at least not at first.  The prerogative should be for 
others to have an opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that on occasion it is important for parties on 
all sides of the House to flesh out ideas, concepts.  It gives us 
the chance to find out what the positions are.  It is not just an 
opposition-government thing at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Let us give it a 
break.  I raised the issue as an explanation.  It does not change 
the fact that I still use the prerogative to go from the 
different side of the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there were more time for questions and comments, there is no 
doubt that more people would have a chance, even those on the 
same side of the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I beg the indulgence of the House to seek unanimous 
consent for an additional five minutes of questions and comments 
for the right hon. former prime minister so that each party can 
ask one question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Is there unanimous 
consent of the House to extend questions and comments by five 
minutes? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Joe Clark:</B>  It is a related subject, Mr. 
Speaker.  It is simply to say that I would never ask for special 
consideration in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  But there may be others 
prepared to extend that special consideration.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
take this opportunity to congratulate the Leader of the 
Progressive Conservative Party on his maiden speech of this 36th 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very intimidating for me to follow such a statesman who 
has just had the opportunity to address this House.  I am sure 
that there are many in the House who will be able to learn from 
his experience and statesmanship, as I wish to and hope to over 
the next numbers of years in this particular party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very happy to stand and speak to this motion from the 
Canadian Reform Alliance.  I am especially happy to speak to this 
motion because it embraces basically every one of the issues that 
I, the leader and other members of this party had an opportunity 
to speak to on Monday morning at 10 a.m., substantially before—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  On a point of order, 
the hon. member for Athabasca. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Chatters:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have listened to this 
debate all morning.  At least three times, members have stood and 
reminded the Speaker that the name of this party is the Canadian 
Alliance.  That party has been deliberately misusing the name and 
you have not said a word.  I would urge you to correct them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I understand the 
point that the hon. member for Athabasca is making.  When a 
member rises on a point of order, the point has been made.  If 
the Chair occupant reinforces that point it contraindicates what 
it was about.  However, I will repeat it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Brandon—Souris referred to the now Canadian 
Alliance Party by its previous name, the Reform Party.  I would 
ask that the member refer to the Canadian Alliance Party as the 
Canadian Alliance Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik:</B>  Mr. Speaker, if you check 
<I>Hansard</I>, my reference was to the Canadian reform alliance. 
For clarification, I am under the impression that the actual name 
is the Canadian Conservative Reform Alliance.  Is that not 
correct?  I would like clarification on that point.  Or, is it 
the Canadian reform conservative alliance?  Could you please 
confirm that because I would like to have the opportunity to 
speak to them in their true form. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The Speaker has 
previously ruled on this.  I would prefer not to go down that 
road any further.   We are wasting important debate time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik:</B>  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, but I still 
would like to have clarification because I do believe that the 
official name is the Canadian reform conservative alliance.  I 
will refer— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  With respect, the 
Chair is not the Brandon—Souris research department. 
Brandon—Souris has ample opportunity to determine that on its 
own.  We are in debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am at a loss.  I do not 
understand why there is such an embarrassment of that particular 
party with respect to its previous roots and previous name and 
its raison d'être for being back before the metamorphoses of 
whatever this new party is.  However, I will get back to the 
debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very happy to speak to our issues and our points which were 
brought forward.  Last Monday I was very proud to stand shoulder 
to shoulder with the Right Hon. Leader of the Conservative Party 
and with other members of the party to put forward to Canadians a 
blueprint, a road map, a strategy that would help Canadians 
overcome a crisis, the crisis being a terrible increase in gas 
prices which most Canadians cannot incorporate into their lives 
right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will speak to those issues.  First, when we brought these 
issues forward, the finance minister rather than saying yes, that 
they had the ability to help those people out, he said that they 
had to bring all of the provinces together before they could make 
any decisions.  That is a political cop-out.  That same finance 
minister came forward two days later and said we had a surplus of 
$12.3 billion in the fiscal year 1999-2000.  For the first 
quarter of the fiscal year 2000-01 there is now an anticipated 
$13 billion surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister should thank the member for Kings—Hants 
and the previous government for putting in the policies that 
allowed the finance minister to accumulate those surpluses. 
Those policies were free trade, the GST and an inflation rate 
that took interest rates to the point where we did not have to 
spend the majority of Canadian taxpayer dollars on the service 
and debt.  Thankfully, the interest rates are low enough because 
of a policy that was put in by a previous government. 
I have not heard the finance minister thank us yet but I am sure 
it is on his agenda. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1245"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also heard the finance minister make comparisons to liquor 
taxes, cigarette taxes and gasoline taxes.  That is terrible.  It 
is nonsense and it is ludicrous.  Gasoline tax is not a luxury. 
Gasoline is the engine by which our economy is driven. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had opportunity last night to speak to and meet with some 
truckers.  Truckers drive our economy.  Canada is a huge country 
with small populations over huge areas.  It costs an awful lot of 
money to deliver goods and services across the country.  Truckers 
are the lifeblood of our economy.  Gasoline is not a luxury.  It 
is what we depend on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also a misconception was raised yesterday during a telephone 
program in which I took part.  One individual on that program 
said that there is and must be a risk management opportunity for 
truckers to put a gasoline surcharge into their contracts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the misconception out there in the public.  In the 
majority of contracts signed by the trucking industry, by 
independent truckers particularly, there is no ability to include 
a gasoline surcharge clause.  If an independent trucker tried to 
include that in a contract, the contract would not be accepted 
and the trucker would not have a job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government today does not allow gasoline surcharges 
in its contracts.  People in my constituency office have signed 
contracts with Canada Post, a crown corporation.  Those contracts 
do not have a built in gas surcharge.  When they sign a contract 
to move mail hundreds and hundreds of miles on a daily basis for 
Canada Post, they do so based on a contract price. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The unfortunate part is when the gas prices go up, as we have 
seen them go up in the past number of months, those costs are 
borne specifically by truckers.  They are now doing the job for 
nothing.  When they approached Canada Post to have a change in 
that contract they were told they had to live by the contract. 
There were, in fairness, some changes made and some dollars 
returned to the truckers but on a totally ad hoc basis with no 
logic associated to it at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point I am trying to make is that there are no risk 
management tools of which truckers can take advantage.  We would 
like to see the government show some leadership.  It should stand 
and say that it respects the trucking industry, the agricultural 
industry, the mining industry, natural resources, and those 
people who are doing jobs for Canadians.  It should try to do 
something to allay all the problems they are now facing with gas 
prices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some 1.5 cents per litre of gasoline is not the be-all and 
end-all, but it shows there is a government that cares and 
understands there is a problem.  Truckers will not be made rich 
by a 2 cent diesel tax reduction, but it will make them feel that 
someone cares, someone is listening, and there is someone who can 
do something for them to show respect for what they are doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no such respect right now.  All I have heard from the 
finance minister is that they cannot do it until the provinces 
come along or until the oil companies promise they will pass it 
on to consumers.  That is a political cop-out, a pure political 
cop-out.  We would like to see some leadership and some action 
taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do we not think the provinces will follow suit?  Do we not think 
the provinces will say that the federal government has finally 
done something to show it cares and that they will do that as 
well?  There is political pressure within the provinces.  Are 
there not enough smart people on that side of the House to make 
sure the gas companies pass that on to consumers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Gas companies are not that stupid.  They know that has to be 
passed on to consumers.  We have said unequivocally as a party 
that we need action and we need action now.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will support the motion that has been put forward simply 
because this is our motion.  We would also like to say that there 
is one other very important component.  That is taking the 7% GST 
off heating fuels, including natural gas and heating oils. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As was mentioned earlier in the discussions by the leader of 
this party, that would go directly to consumers.  We know that. 
That cannot be attached in any way, shape or form by oil 
companies.  It will specifically go to the people who need it 
going into this winter.  It is September 21 today.  It starts 
getting cold very soon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the governing party need some direction so that there 
is an opportunity to reduce those costs going into the winter 
months.  I thank the House for the opportunity to speak to this 
very important and very valid issue.  I wish they would also look 
at it as being a valid opportunity to put forward a request for 
the government to show leadership and to start going in the right 
direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge said that this was not 
something new.   He is absolutely correct that they have been 
working on it.  The report was tabled in 1998 and contained some 
excellent recommendations.  This is now September 2000 and none 
of those recommendations have been acted on.  I wish they had 
been.  When they come forward we will look at them and we will 
support them as well. 
<P><A NAME="LINK58"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dan McTeague (Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the hon. member for the last part of his 
comments.  It is clear that document was written two years ago, 
but it is important for the hon. member to understand what has 
happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most of the recommendations in the report have already begun 
their very long and torturous road toward finalization with both 
the Conference Board of Canada and the public policy forum, not 
to mention the fact that there have been several bills.  Some of 
them are close to becoming law, no thanks to the former member of 
his party who sat on the industry committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Notwithstanding the relative low profile the fuel issue has 
received until now, suddenly the Johnnies-come-lately in the 
Alliance discovered this was an issue.  Given what happened in 
New Brunswick with the first and only example of a tax decrease, 
would the hon. member agree that the precedent set and agreed to 
by all parties, including the Conservatives along with the 
Liberal government of Frank McKenna of the day, concluded that 
there was some difficulty in ensuring that tax decreases would be 
passed on to consumers who so desperately needed them? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The resolution I have provided is tantamount to basically a 
rebate directly to people.  Would it not be better than simply 
relying on the oil industry?  As a consequence, would the hon. 
member not feel that what he is doing is nothing more than 
operating on the belief that oil companies would be honest enough 
to pass it on? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I feel sorry for the hon. 
member, I really do.  He is so cynical as to suspect that the 
removal of a 1.5 cent per litre excise tax, which was put in 
place initially to resolve the deficit issue, would automatically 
be taken up by gas companies and not passed on to consumers. That 
is true cynicism on behalf of that member.  If we do not attempt 
to do that, it simply means that they are not prepared to try 
anything.  Would it mean that the tax remains forever, that the 
1.5 cents a litre has to remain forever? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government could never get rid of it and, if it did, it 
would automatically go to the profits and bottom lines of oil 
companies.  We as Canadians suspect that every tax placed on 
cigarettes, on liquor, on gas and on everything we do will never 
be changed because the government cannot do it in that the 
companies will take advantage of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member also said that a lot of these recommendations were 
being implemented.  That is cold comfort for the people who have 
not been benefactors of any of the tax reductions that should be 
taking place right now.  Saying simply that we will look at and 
implement tax legislation is cold comfort for the people who will 
not be able to pay their heating fuel bills this coming winter.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have a question for the member of the Conservative 
Party.  Before I ask it, I congratulate the leader of the 
Conservative Party on his maiden speech in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I notice in the motion before us today by the Canadian Alliance 
that there is no reference to the very excessive profits of oil 
companies.  Would the member for Brandon—Souris agree that maybe 
there is a relationship between this oversight and the fact that 
Alliance members are having a fundraising dinner in Toronto where 
they are charging $25,000 a table?  Of course they will be sold 
to the corporate elite.  That is different from the grassroots 
approach of the former leader of the Reform Party, who would not 
dream of having such a dinner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member agree that maybe it is just a coincidence or 
indicate whether or not there is a relationship between this 
$25,000 a table dinner where grassroots Canadians will not be 
found, except those serving the dinner, and the fact that they 
make no reference whatsoever to profit in the motion before us 
today? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik:</B>  Mr. Speaker, to be perfectly honest I 
cannot speak to the fundraising tactics of members of the 
Canadian reform conservative alliance party.  If they want to 
associate or involve themselves with a certain sector of 
industry, that is fair ball for them.  I do not have the privy or 
the insight as to their connections with that sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do realize, however, a substantial number of their members 
come from Alberta.  I suspect they have an awful lot of ties with 
the oil industry.  That is to be expected.  I also suspect that 
their fundraiser will be attended by any number of people.  I 
expect a lot of grassroots populists will probably also be in 
attendance. 
<P><A NAME="LINK60"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is an honour for me to rise today 
to address an issue of prime importance to all Canadians.  It is 
especially an honour for me to do this in what is known as my 
maiden speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just bypassing any references or reflections to that, I do know 
that walking down this aisle the other day felt somewhat 
matrimonial.  I found only seconds after that sense of great 
bonding among the people here.  It did seem as if the honeymoon 
was over in a matter of seconds, so I will approach this speech 
in a similar manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I dearly and deeply thank the constituents of 
Okanagan—Coquihalla who have allowed me this opportunity, with a 
great demonstration of support, to be here to address an issue 
which actually I heard much about while I was campaigning in that 
riding in the byelection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also say a word of thanks to the voters of Red Deer, a 
previous constituency of mine, who over the years continued to 
support me and allowed me to work with others and find and 
discover in reality outside the theoretical laboratory that the 
principles we will discuss today in fact do work, not just in 
theory but in practicality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The situation we are discussing today in terms of the 
possibility of seeing our gas taxes lowered is of very 
significant importance. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that today there is an opportunity, for the federal 
government in particular, to show the public that we have 
members of parliament and a government that respect the 
taxpayer.  It is an opportunity to provide our support in 
principle and to plan for the day we will be able to reduce the 
tax rate, not just on gasoline, but on other products as well. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a great opportunity to demonstrate to Canadians that not 
just the members of parliament here but the government itself 
respects hard work and understands the implications of high 
policies of taxation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be very clear about this, that just as ideas have 
consequences policies have consequences. 
Tax policies have consequences that are immediate and future and 
far reaching.  As we look at the base of these discussions and 
the effect of gas taxes, we need to consider the broader base of 
taxation and build a platform of discussion so that we can see 
the importance of zeroing in on some taxes, whether it is a few 
at a time or in a broad measure.  This is what the Canadian 
Alliance proposes to do.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think anybody in this Chamber is standing and 
exclaiming that there should be no taxes anywhere. As a former 
minister of finance I would be grieved in my heart if I thought 
there would be no ability to get dollars from the taxpayers, but 
it has to be done in a way that is not just fair but seen to be 
fair.  We recognize the need for taxes, but we also recognize 
that there is a point in time where the level of taxation 
actually becomes a disincentive and a discouragement to people. 
We need to be aware of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a matter of fact, it was in this Chamber in 1917, during the 
first world war, that the concept of a tax on income was first 
discussed for the war effort.  Canadians rallied to that.  The 
original suggestion was that taxes would be implemented on income 
at a level of 2%.  In the ensuing debate one of the hon. members 
commented that if we were to allow governments to begin to tax 
people at a rate of 2%, he said “Mark my words, the day will 
come when governments will tax people's income at maybe 3% or 
4%”.  Just as we are laughing now at where that has gone, that 
was the reaction of the day.  We have gone far beyond that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We recognize that taxes are necessary, but we have to be careful 
about the level. It was Jean Baptiste Colbert, the fine minister 
of finance for King Louis XIV who described taxation by saying 
that the art of taxation consists in plucking the goose in such a 
manner as to get the most amount of feathers with the least 
amount of hissing.  He was being a very honest finance minister. 
I would never have suggested anything like that in my days as 
finance minister.  I hope we will never see that from our federal 
minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  We already have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we already have.  I would 
say that the hissing has been going on for some time.  We need to 
be careful about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Something we should know in terms of general principles related 
to taxation is that any jurisdiction which lowers its taxes will 
always experience a stimulus effect in the economy.  It will 
always experience growth in the economy, more jobs, more 
opportunities, more businesses, businesses arriving in that 
jurisdiction and businesses deciding to stay and invest more. An 
increase in revenues will be seen going into that jurisdiction. 
Sometimes, as history notes, it is in the first or second year. 
Sometimes the revenues are forgone for more than a year, but the 
jurisdictions with lower taxes will always increase in terms of 
their revenues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let that be a dispelling of the myth which unfortunately some 
Liberals and others are trying to propagate, that lowering taxes 
means a weakening of our social structure and our social 
programs.  It does not.  It will bring more revenue to government 
for protection of social programs. If we truly believe in social 
security, we will be aggressive about lowering taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can look at history and we can make this non-partisan because 
I strive daily to make this a non-partisan Chamber and always 
think of the good of the country.  We can talk about JFK, a 
Democrat, significantly lowering income taxes, and gas taxes 
would have the same effect, and we can see and track the revenue 
increase to the government coffers of that day.  We can talk 
about Ronald Reagan, a Republican, so this is non-partisan, and a 
reduction in taxes and an increase in revenues.  There was a 
corresponding increase in spending, and some say unfortunately 
especially on the defence side.  But definitely and clearly there 
was an increase in revenues which many economists are now 
pointing to being the single greatest factor in what appears to 
be an unbroken approach in the business cycle and a great 
opportunity that we have seen in North America, unlike at any 
other time in history.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moving to Canada, we can talk about Ontario.  There is an 
amazing coincidence between reducing taxes and increased revenues 
to the government.  We can talk about Alberta, which I will be 
happy to do in some detail in a moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can talk about Ireland which is an Atlantic jurisdiction. For 
decades it has been very low in terms of productivity, income 
growth and opportunity.  It has taken a very significant approach 
to the reduction of taxes.  Yes, there was some subsidy input at 
the beginning but it has moved away from that.  That gives great 
hope and opportunity to Atlantic Canada having seen other 
jurisdictions experience long term growth because of this 
particular approach.  It will always work to lower taxes, 
increase opportunity and increase revenues to government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If people do not mind, I will use the Alberta experience.  In 
1986 to 1993 there was an increase in taxes and a lack of 
corresponding response in the economy.  From 1993 on there was a 
very significant reduction in taxes and an expansion not just of 
revenues but of the base economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will tell the House how significant that was.  In 1986 the 
total amount of income from corporate revenue coming from oil and 
gas in Alberta was 59%, a pretty significant portion of that 
corporate base.  After six years of lowering taxes, from 1993 
onward, there was a significant broadening of the base of the 
economy. New businesses such as high tech businesses came in. We 
looked at the 1998 results.  In terms of reliance on one single 
resource area, only 21% of revenue from the corporate sector was 
from oil and gas.  The economy was vastly expanded.  It happened 
in Alberta and it is happening in Ontario.  It happened in 
Ireland. It will continue to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People have talked about advantages across the country.  Do we 
not think it is time that we had the Canada advantage?  As we 
look at the possibility of lowering these fuel prices, we are at 
an all-time high in history of revenues going to the government 
through various taxes.  For the last seven years, over $1 
trillion in revenues has gone to the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to look at some of the comparisons, especially 
with G-7 and the OECD countries, groups of which we are members. 
I say this very dubiously but in the G-7 alone we have the proud 
distinction of having the greatest increase in taxes compared to 
economic growth of any of those countries.  It is 14%.  Fourteen 
per cent is not the amount of taxes individuals pay.  As we know, 
depending on where we live it can be over 50% of our income. 
Canada has the greatest tax increase versus GDP increase, at 14%. 
That is not something to be proud of.  The United States was 
only 11.6%, the U.K. was 8.8% and Japan was only 5.9%.  These are 
not things of which we can be proud. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has had the greatest increase in terms of the marginal 
rates for people moving from low income to middle income.  We try 
to encourage people to move up that scale.  However, there is a 
14% increase in the marginal rate when they move from low income 
to middle income.  That is disrespect for middle income earners 
and a significant disincentive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we do a comparison of 25 countries in the OECD, which nation 
had the greatest growth in GDP, the greatest expansion of the 
economy over the last 10 years?  It was Ireland which had a 92% 
increase in its GDP over 10 years.  Where is Canada in GDP 
growth?  Out of the 25 nations, we proudly stand at number 24. 
We only had a 5% increase in our GDP growth because of taxation 
policies that are repressive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we want to measure in terms of labour productivity which is a 
very key indicator, one of the nations that leads in labour 
productivity is the United States.  We are at only half of its 
rate in terms of increase of labour productivity.  We are at the 
bottom of the list of OECD nations in terms of labour 
productivity.  This is a very significant disincentive for our 
citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this reality in place, we need to look at where we can 
begin to send a signal to Canadians that this is a country in 
which they can work and be proud and labour and receive the 
rewards of their labours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at gasoline taxes and a variety of approaches that 
we can take.  We can look at lowering that excise tax 1.5 cents.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Just today it was recorded in a national newspaper.  I do not 
want to advertise which one it was, but it was posted today in 
one of those national newspapers that the federal Minister of 
Finance said that the government has a moral obligation to lower 
that 1.5 cents off the excise tax, as we have suggested, because 
in 1995 it was put in place to reduce the deficit.  The deficit 
is gone and the finance minister to his credit said there was a 
moral obligation to reduce that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am glad the Prime Minister wants to talk about values because 
his finance minister is saying it is a moral obligation, that it 
needs to be put back. I congratulate members who have talked 
about doing that and who have recommended doing that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the issue of the GST.  This is so insidious.  With all 
the costs that are already on fuels, add on to that provincial 
taxes, add on to that the excise tax, and then insidiously put on 
top of that the GST, a tax on a tax on a tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was at the University of Manitoba that Professor Nicolaou did 
the study in terms of pricing of gasoline.  He said that the 
cascading effect of the GST, the tax upon tax upon tax alone 
would save Canadians 1.7 cents a litre if the GST was moved down 
just to below where other taxes are put on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not even going after the Liberals for totally not 
acknowledging their promise to kill, scrap and abolish the GST. 
We are saying if they are not going to do that, could they at 
least move it down so that they are not punching people out at 
these different levels.  We are asking for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are truckers with long term contracts who face the 
inevitability of losing their businesses and their livelihoods. 
Let me make it very clear.  We are suggesting this change not in 
the threat of a truckers strike.  We talked about this before 
there was that threat.  We are talking about this because it is 
the right thing to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A happy coincidence of moving in this area would be to alleviate 
the possibility of a truckers strike or slowdown, and also to see 
families and individuals with a great increase in confidence in 
their government because it was responding.  We need to move that 
diesel tax downward also. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is significant to note that small things can lead to great 
things happening.  It was Demosthenes who said that by taking 
small opportunities one can lead to great enterprises.  What 
greater enterprise than to send a signal of hope from coast to 
coast to coast? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who would be affected by that signal of hope?  The person who 
sent me an e-mail from Saudi Arabia who said there are many 
Canadians over there who consider themselves tax refugees because 
of the high levels of taxation in this country.  It would send a 
message of hope to people whom I talked to throughout the summer 
across the country who said because of the Canadian Alliance 
position on taxes, they were going to delay their decision to 
move out of the country, or to move their business out of the 
country in the hopes that we would be elected and form the next 
federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us turn the hissing of Canadians to cheering. Let them cheer 
the fact and let me invite members of the Liberal government to 
vote with us on this great motion, to say that they acknowledge 
that the government has huge surpluses and it is partly as a 
result of taxing people at too high a rate.  The other reason the 
surplus is there is because of what has happened in a number of 
provinces that have their fiscal houses in order. They have 
reduced taxes, have rejuvenated economies and have created 
surpluses which then of course quite properly are shared with the 
nation.  It is time for great enterprise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the members who are already indicating they will join in 
this great enterprise.  I invite our Liberal counterparts to join 
also and send a message of hope and opportunity across this great 
nation of ours.

most sincerely like to welcome the new Leader of the Opposition 
to the House, a fellow northern Albertan.  The new leader does 
not consider himself to be a southern Albertan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He mentioned Ireland at least twice in his talk.  Does he not 
think that the free post-secondary education in Ireland has had a 
significant part in the Irish success story? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would say that its 
emphasis on education has had a significant effect.  In fact I am 
surprised to hear the member for Edmonton Southeast say that it 
is free.  We know that there is no free lunch and there is no 
free education.  That cost is being picked up somewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I certainly would agree with him in terms of saying 
that everything we can do to maintain high education levels and 
research and development is something that should be followed. He 
is right from the point of view that Ireland's emphasis is on 
education but it is not free.  The taxpayers pick up the cost. 
<P><A NAME="LINK62"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dan McTeague (Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I want to commend the hon. Leader of the Opposition for 
his statements.  I also want to commend him for his insight on an 
issue that we on this side have been working on for some years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish, however, that the hon. member would perhaps take the 
time to read the rest of the document which has inspired his 
first foray into the question of taxes, that all ills can be 
resolved by dealing with gas taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given that the price of gasoline is rising as a result of the 
commodity, and given Dr. Nicolaou's views that the Canadian 
gasoline market is sheltered from competition and that this 
market disease is a profit boon to oil majors, would he not agree 
that it is better for the Government of Canada and the opposition 
to accept the motion that the member put forth this morning which 
tactically they denied through unanimous consent, and allow 
Canadians to receive the rebate, not the oil companies as a third 
party? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I first want to 
congratulate the hon. member for his work in this particular 
area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rebating is a legitimate form of returning to taxpayers that 
which has been taken from them in an excessive amount, as the 
federal Liberal government has been doing.  I have even 
recommended that at various times in the past.  As a matter of 
fact there is one government in the country which is now doing 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of the tax is the quickest, easiest and least 
administrative in terms of that particular reduction.  I sense 
and share some of the concern that if the taxes are lowered, how 
do we keep the oil companies in line from, as I have been quite 
properly quoted as saying, filling in that particular ditch. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would say that the federal government has the clout to sit 
down with oil companies, and far from presuming that that would 
happen, give those companies the benefit of the doubt, tell them 
there will be a very close monitoring and allow that to happen. 
However, administratively the signals could be sent out 
immediately through the tax process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I again commend the member for continuing to advocate this.  I 
am not sure how he will be voting.  I am sure the history of a 
previous member on his side, who raised the concern about taxes, 
haunts him somewhat considering where that member is not today. 
However, sir, I commend you for your courage and insights on this 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I would remind all hon. members to please 
remember the Chair when they are answering. 
<P><A NAME="LINK63"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Janko Peric (Cambridge, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, could 
the hon. Leader of the Opposition tell us how many times he 
reduced the provincial tax on gas in the province of Alberta 
while he was the minister of finance? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I, honestly, have lost 
track of the number of taxes, fees and costs that I specifically 
reduced in Alberta.  I will produce a definite list for the 
member because it is quite exciting that my colleagues and I were 
able to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of the gas tax itself, when that question came up 
as the price of oil started to move up over the last year, my 
proposal clearly was that it should be for a rebate rather than 
the tax because of the lack of ability of a province to harness 
those national companies around a table and tell them they would 
be monitoring it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The consideration at that time was not to go the tax route but 
to send out to all consumers, to everyone in the province, a 
rebate.  That took place about three or four weeks ago.  I was 
gone by then so I cannot claim the full credit for it, but that 
was my approach and that is what has taken place.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron (Fundy—Royal, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
compliment the Leader of the Opposition on a number of his

economy.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to clear up something that happened yesterday.  When the 
Prime Minister referred to the fact that he was the Minister of 
Finance at the time that gas taxes were increased 9 cents per 
litre, was he or was he not a member of that government and did 
he support the budget that actually increased gas taxes during 
the Getty regime? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day:</B>  Mr. Speaker, clearly, as a newly 
elected MLA, yes, I was a member of that government and that was 
when that tax was put in.  It was not put in while I was finance 
minister, as some have unfortunately tried to indicate.  It was 
about a year after I was elected when that tax went in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will admit my deficiency.  I was not able to stand as a lone 
member and turn the tide of that particular request.  I was 
deficient in not being able to hold off the horde of others who 
wanted to see that go forward.  I apologize for that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK65"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
listened very intently to the Leader of the Opposition's speech. 
I think he would agree that taxation is all about choice.  What 
he is asking us to do today is to make a choice on $700 million 
worth of revenue coming into the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has made a commitment to reduce debt.  For every 
$10 of debt we reduce we also reduce $1 forever because it is a 
debt off our shoulders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, we also note that fossil fuel is creating more 
air pollutant problems.  Five thousand people died last year just 
because of airborne pollutants.  As a societal good, is it really 
the duty of governments to be reducing consumption?  When the 
cost of fossil fuel went up during the Reagan administration in 
the mid-eighties consumption went down.  We should be promoting 
the use of alternative fuels and the reduction of fossil fuel not 
in fact celebrating them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the member's knowledge as a treasurer, how much of that 
barrel of oil goes into the provincial royalty payments? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day:</B>   Mr. Speaker, I will keep all those 
questions in mind.  First, on the issue of the environmental 
effects, we are talking about people who have to drive to work 
every day.  We are talking about truckers.  We are talking about 
people whose livelihood and transportation needs depend on 
gasoline. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If nothing had happened at all over the last decade or so in 
terms of a reduction in pollutants, then I think the point would 
be stronger.  The fact is that just with the elimination of lead 
in gasoline alone, 85% of particulate has been removed from the 
atmosphere.  There is clearly more to do.  A number of provinces 
are allowing electricity and other forms of energy to be plugged 
into the power grid system which people can then order. Wind 
power, for instance, is already being plugged into the power grid 
in some jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many things are going on for the good and proper pursuit of the 
reduction of particulate in the atmosphere.  This, however, 
should not be used as an excuse by the government to be taking in 
more money than it should be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the overall amount going into the treasury, and I 
obviously cannot quote the figures of the last month or two, but 
there has been quite a shift not just in the corporate percentage 
of revenue coming in but in the overall revenue.  As a matter of 
fact, about two years ago in Alberta, as I recall the figures, 
the resource royalty amount coming from crude oil alone had 
dropped from just below $2 billion to about $545 million. So 
there has been a very significant reduction in terms of the 
overall royalty, but again an increase in the economy. 
<P><A NAME="LINK66"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I too congratulate the Leader of the Official Opposition on his 
maiden speech.  However, I am a little curious and wonder if he 
might be able to respond to a question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will go back to November 29, 1999 when that member was the 
finance minister in Alberta.  In his second quarter fiscal update 
he went to great pains to celebrate increased revenue in the 
province of Alberta, which he clearly said resulted from what 
were stronger energy prices.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder how he reconciled his position to the people of 
Alberta, when he was known as the shah of Alberta, of celebrating 
oil prices in those days and then stand here today and take the 
position that he is taking when Alberta's surplus of $5 billion 
results directly from $4 billion in energy— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Our time has virtually expired.  I will 
permit the hon. Leader of the Opposition to respond and then I 
will listen to a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am humbled by the 
amount of fascination with my previous history.  As an elected 
person, as we all are, with virtually no ego at all, I hate 
talking about myself but when I have an opportunity like this I 
find it irresistible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The $5 billion surplus figure that he just quoted is of course 
now.  I was not there enjoying that type of surplus.  What he 
left out of the figures that he was also quoting for 1999 was 
that 1999, closing out the year for 1998, was a phenomenal year 
of expansion and growth in the economy in Alberta.  There was 
about $1 billion less in terms of resource revenue that year. 
There was $1 billion less in 1998 than in 1997 and yet the 
economy continued to expand, which continues to make my very 
precise point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dan McTeague:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  In the interest of ensuring that we achieve goals for 
Canadians in common, and with the Leader of the Opposition here, 
I ask for unanimous consent to amend the motion by deleting 
everything after the word “consumers” and replacing it with the 
following, “especially those with low incomes.  This House calls 
upon the government to assist Canadians in coping with the rising 
financial burden and that this House strongly urges provincial 
and territorial governments to consider providing similar 
assistance”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Does the hon. member have permission to put 
the motion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  As a member of the government, I would encourage the 
member to put that on the order paper for tomorrow and we would 
be happy to debate it at that time. 
<P><A NAME="LINK67"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will be 
sharing my time with the hon. parliamentary secretary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I would first like to look at is who the real culprit is 
when it comes to Canadian taxes on fuel versus the oil producers 
and the cost of oil.  The simple fact is that two days ago the 
benchmark October contract for West Texas intermediate crude was 
$36.51 U.S. a barrel.  A year and a half earlier in 1998 it was 
less than $11 U.S.  Obviously the price of crude is the real 
culprit.  This is why the finance minister will be taking very 
constructive steps, I hope, with his G-7 counterparts in Prague 
this weekend, to try to deal with the very serious impact on the 
economies of all the countries in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second point I want to talk about is the impact on truckers. 
To the extent government taxes add to the cost of diesel fuel, 
are these taxes mainly provincial or federal?  Let us look at the 
federal taxes. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1330"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT42"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a GST of 7% but it is fully refundable to truckers. They 
do not pay it so it cannot be the GST. Is it the excise tax?  The 
excise tax federally is four cents.  It does not fluctuate with 
the price; it is constant.  This is the lowest excise tax in the 
G-7 and it is fully deductible for tax purposes.  Four cents, 
yes.  It is deductible and it costs less for the trucker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the provincial taxes.  In Alberta truckers pay a 
nine cent excise tax on their diesel fuel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to look at this issue raised in the House today through 
the motion.  It was the member for Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge who 
first raised the issue of fuel tax prices in the country.  Now we 
see very quickly, for the first time in history and never talked 
about before, that members of the official opposition are running 
after the parade, trying to catch up to it and get in front of 
it, but they are stumbling all over themselves in so doing. 
Nothing could be greater evidence of their craven efforts to grab 
headlines and of their abject incompetence in coming to grips 
with this particular issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the motion before us.  It talks about the severe 
hurt to Canadian truckers and homeowners.  Then what does it 
propose as the antidote to this harm?  Two things:  cut the 
federal excise tax by 1.5 cents per litre and eliminate the tax 
on the tax for gasoline.  That is what those members are 
proposing in this opposition day measure to deal with this huge 
issue we face in terms of the cost of fuels.  How will these two 
little tax measures they propose help truckers and homeowners? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, truckers.  Let us look at the 1.5 cents per litre cut 
that has been proposed.  It never applied to diesel fuel and it 
does not today so it cannot be that.  Since the GST does not hit 
the truckers, there is no tax on the tax.  So the measures have 
absolutely no impact on truckers.  How will they help truckers? 
Not one nano-cent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How about the homeowners the opposition talks about?  Since 
there is no federal excise tax on heating fuel, their proposed 
1.5 cent tax cut will not help them.  And obviously there is no 
tax on tax. How will these proposed measures, the opening salvo 
of the official opposition, help homeowners?  Not one nano-cent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, these proposed measures if enacted would have 
zero impact in helping homeowners and truckers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us say the 1.5 cent tax cut went through.  Even if it did, 
would car owners ever see it or would it just be swallowed up by 
the producers?  These are very real concerns. In rejecting a fuel 
tax cut less than a year ago for Alberta, the present Leader of 
the Opposition said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will it flow through to the people?  Will it be reflected at the 
pump?  What kind of guarantees have we got that gas retailers are 
also going to drop the price? 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are no guarantees in this motion reflecting these very 
real concerns expressed by the Leader of the Opposition.  I just 
listened to him a few minutes ago.  In response to questions 
dealing with this issue, he said that he really does not favour 
tax cuts, that he prefers tax rebates.  Then why did he not bring 
forth tax rebates in the motion?  Even the Leader of the 
Opposition is admitting that it is a flawed motion. Is there a 
guarantee in the motion that a cut would be passed on to the 
consumers?  Not one nano-cent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is either very cheap politics or it is total legislative 
incompetence on behalf of the official opposition.  Canadians 
will not buy into this phoney motion because it will do nothing 
to help the homeowners, the truckers, or the people buying gas at 
the gas pump and they are not going to be hoodwinked by this type 
of flim-flam.

perfectly understandable how the junior minister would state that 
it is total legislative incompetence for us to put forward a 
motion to reduce taxes.  I know that to reduce taxes is 
completely against anything a Liberal has ever stood for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The big issue here is how the cut to fuel taxes would be 
guaranteed, I think is the word the hon. member used, to be 
passed on to the consumer, to the gasoline purchaser.  If the 
federal government is waiting for the provinces to come on board 
so that they can jointly reduce fuel taxes, how would that ensure 
that the joint cuts would be passed on to the consumer? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is a very good 
question.  The Leader of the Opposition has adumbrated that this 
is indeed a very important question.  He has suggested rather 
than just have a tax cut that we have a rebate.  That could be a 
very real possibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish that whoever drafted the motion had talked to the Leader 
of the Opposition first, because he might have indicated that 
maybe just cutting gas prices will not be passed on.  When there 
are fluctuations at the pump of five or six cents a day, a one 
and a half cent cut, even if there were goodwill to try to pass 
it on, would not even be noticed by the people.  This is why the 
government is looking very seriously at the issue and is looking 
at other mechanisms for ensuring that a reduction of these very 
onerous fuel prices for all Canadians will have the best impact 
in terms of where they are most needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill:</B>  The hon. member did not answer my question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson:</B>  Of course I did not answer the hon. 
member's question because I said we are looking at mechanisms for 
passing it on.  The hon. member's leader has suggested that it is 
not tax cuts but rebates.  I am saying that this is at least 
slightly more thoughtful.  I wish that the motion you brought 
forward had reflected the latest thinking and maybe it is just 
today— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I must interrupt.  I 
do want to remind members to address each other through the Chair 
as we indicated earlier. 
<P><A NAME="LINK69"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, earlier this morning I made a phone call to my riding 
and talked to a friend of mine, a farmer.  He informed me that 
his crop which is not harvested is now covered with about three 
inches of snow.  It does not look very promising for farmers to 
get their crops off.  He also knows about the debate today.  He 
realizes that farmers surrounding him are in a bad position not 
only because of the failure of the government's AIDA program, 
which has just not been successful at all, but also because 
farmers realize once more that they will have no say on how they 
will be able to market any crop of wheat and barley they do get 
off. He is saying to fight tooth and nail on behalf of farmers to 
see that at least we can get this much relief.  We need help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am surprised the agriculture minister is not in here demanding 
his government help the farmers to what little extent it can. The 
farmers are major consumers and it could amount to significant 
dollars that could save farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, farmers do not pay tax on 
coloured diesel.  It is very simple. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Simple. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson:</B>  Farmers get a rebate for the GST and 
they do not pay the tax on the coloured diesel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson:</B>  Everybody should be a farmer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I suspect that the hon. 
member does not know what the facts are concerning farmers.  It 
takes a city boy from Toronto to tell him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, the party opposite has twice rejected a motion 
that would allow those hit hardest by these high fuel prices to 
be compensated through assistance.  That might be one of the ways 
in which the compensation goes back to those who need it most.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to be involved in 
this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Leader of the Official Opposition gave his maiden 
speech he said initially that we should remove the partisanship in this 
debate and let us work in the interests of all Canadians.  I 
almost fell for it until all his colleagues burst into laughter. 
I should have known that nothing has changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague the member for Pickering—Uxbridge—Ajax tried to 
introduce an amendment to the motion and members of the Alliance 
used the trick that they have used ever since they came here. 
They used a procedural ploy.  Canadians who are watching the 
debate may not fully comprehend the subtlety of it; it is 
procedural gobbledegook frankly.  They denied Canadians the 
opportunity to see a real debate and denied members of the House 
an opportunity to choose either their motion or an amendment to 
the motion proposed by my colleague. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nothing has changed. They talk about a new way of doing 
parliament.  They talk about how their name is different but I 
look across the Chamber and the people are the same, except 
perhaps for one, and the policies and philosophies are exactly 
the same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to talk about fuel costs.  Of course rising fuel 
costs are a concern to all Canadians.  We need to understand what 
is driving the increase in energy costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last 12 months the price of crude and the price of fuel 
at the gas pump has about doubled but surprise, surprise, the 
federal taxes have not changed.  The excise tax on gasoline and 
diesel is on a per litre basis.  It does not change when the 
price goes up or down.  If the government reacted to the concerns 
of Canadians and who knows, maybe it will, but it would not be 
because we are the culprits.  It would be because we would be 
concerned about the plight of a number of Canadians and the 
amount they have to pay at the gas pump and the concern about the 
heating fuel costs for the upcoming winter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to put the whole debate into another context as well. If 
we compare the taxes on gasoline in Canada with the 
industrialized world, our taxes as a component of the total pump 
price are actually relatively low at around 42% on average.  In 
many of the OECD countries they are 70% to 75%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Gasoline taxes in Canada comprise about 42% of the price at the 
pump and are very low by international standards.  All we have to 
do is travel to see the price of gasoline at the pump in places 
like the United Kingdom and other parts of Europe.  I am not 
trying to trivialize the problem but we need to understand that 
our gas taxes here in Canada are really low in comparison to the 
other countries of the industrialized world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When was the last time that the taxes went up over a long 
weekend?  It does not happen. The taxes have not changed for many 
years.  We are talking about a situation of pricing policies of 
oil companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge and I have been working 
on this issue for some time.  Through his leadership our caucus 
has been concerned about energy costs for some time.  The caucus 
made a number of recommendations which have led to action on the 
part of the government by the industry minister with reviews of 
the Competition Act.  That is an area where we have jurisdiction. 
It is an area where the government might act to put more teeth in 
the Competition Act.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In talking about fuel costs, we are obviously looking forward, 
but we have to be concerned about the context of the debate.  As 
I pointed out earlier in rebutting the leader of the Progressive 
Conservative Party, it was during the tenure of the Tory 
government that diesel excise taxes were invented and the excise 
tax on gasoline was increased six times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Likewise, we can look across the floor to the Leader of the 
Opposition.  When he was in the legislature in the province of 
Alberta fuel taxes went up six times.  In the province of Alberta 
they now sit at nine cents a litre.  Our excise tax on diesel 
fuel is four cents a litre compared to the Alberta government's 
fuel tax of nine cents a litre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people say that the federal government should just act 
unilaterally.  I was on a talk show last night in Edmonton.  I 
was reminded many times that these were not government tax 
dollars but the tax dollars of Canadians.  If we are trying to 
alleviate the concerns of Canadians, why would we not be 
concerned about the question of whether any reductions in excise 
tax will flow through to consumers?  Are we saying that we would 
reduce excise taxes?  If they did or did not get into the hands 
of consumers is an irrelevant question.  Let us do it.  Let us 
show leadership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Minister of Finance has said, if we are to provide real 
relief for Canadians we have to work in concert with the 
provinces.  Unlike what some members have proposed in the House, 
the provincial taxes on fuel are in general higher than the 
federal excise taxes on gasoline and on diesel, for sure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is that the motion before the House seems to have 
been crafted in a very hasty fashion.  If one were a cynic, one 
would say it is based on political opportunism.  It talks about 
heating oil, consumers and truckers.  As my colleague earlier 
pointed out, the motion fails miserably in trying to address 
these questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, there is no federal excise tax on heating oil. That 
is the first problem.  The second problem is that they talk about 
alleviating the problems of truckers.  I have great sympathy for 
truckers.  I have a lot of trucking companies in my riding.  When 
truckers pay the GST they receive a GST input credit when they 
pass it on to their customers.  The GST they pay is a 
flow-through.  All of us in the House understand that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  On this side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen:</B>  Yes, on this side we certainly understand 
that.  The excise tax on diesel fuel is four cents.  In Ontario 
the tax on diesel fuel is about 13.5 cents a litre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How could we realistically come to the Chamber and put before us 
a motion that does not address the issues they are proposing to 
address?  At the same time they ask, if we did something on 
excise taxes and it did not flow through to consumers, would it 
be such a big deal? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are managing the tax dollars of Canadians.  If we are to do 
anything we want to make sure it gets to consumers.  The NDP has 
proposed some regulatory mechanism to try to ensure that would 
happen.  I personally do not support it because it would be far 
too regulatory and cumbersome. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members on the benches opposite know, the reality is that it 
would be virtually impossible to determine if a reduction in the 
excise tax made its way to consumers.  There are many different 
variables.  The oil companies will say that they were planning to 
do it but forgot it because their other costs went up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion is horribly flawed.  I am very disappointed that we 
did not have an opportunity to vote on an amendment so the House 
and Canadians would have an opportunity to see the two sides of 
the coin.  I certainly will not be supporting the motion put 
forward by the Alliance Party.  I would encourage everybody in 
the House to do the same.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo—Chilcotin, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I take exception to some of the 
comments that were made on flow-through costs.  Part of the 
difficulty is that truckers cannot pass their costs on because of 
long term contracts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue is like a nutcracker.  High fuel costs are part of it. 
The other side of the nutcracker is that truckers and the people 
of Canada are caught in low economic conditions like in British 
Columbia where logging trucks are facing markets that are 
non-existent.  I talked to a mill lumber manufacturer who said 
that he was trying to do business where there were no markets for 
his product.  The difficulty is the federal government is 
responsible for softwood quota agreements that have deprived the 
industry of the profits it needs to pay the high taxes demanded 
by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can truckers pass the costs on through long term contracts 
which do not allow for this pass through?  What recognition has 
the government taken of the difficulties it has placed on 
industry through faulty international trade agreements like the 
softwood quota agreement? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen:</B>  Mr. Speaker, having lived in British 
Columbia for 13 years I am quite sympathetic to the forest 
industry.  What will happen after the softwood agreement is 
somewhat extraneous to the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect, I think the member is confusing two issues.  I 
came from the private sector.  It is a very competitive market 
and sometimes one is quoting on a fixed price.  It seems to me 
that if truckers have learned anything, they should probably 
include in the next go-around some escalators when talking about 
a major component of their cost base. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is the member is right that there are some truckers 
in this predicament.  That is why the government is seized with 
the question.  However, if we look at the GST, it has nothing to 
do with the contracts with their customers or clients.  It is an 
input tax credit.  They pay the GST, fill in the forms and get it 
back. 
<P><A NAME="LINK72"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is a brave man to be 
speaking to this issue.  I respect him for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I fill up my gas tank in my province I pay 15 cents a litre 
provincial tax.  I also pay 10 cents a litre federal tax.  Would 
the member mind telling the House what percentage of that tax per 
litre, which was a designated tax because I was grabbed at the 
pump, went back to the province of Saskatchewan for the purpose 
for which it was taken? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen:</B>  Mr. Speaker, if we look at the province 
of Saskatchewan, the provincial tax on gasoline and diesel is 15 
cents.  Our diesel tax is four cents and our excise tax on 
gasoline is 10 cents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point is that excise tax on gasoline like the tobacco tax 
and a whole range of other taxes go into the consolidated revenue 
fund of the government.  They are used to serve the needs of all 
Canadians, including relief for farmers on the prairies which was 
between $1 billion and $2 billion in the last budget alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The revenues from excise taxes flow through to the consolidated 
revenue fund.  They fund, for example, the $23.5 billion the 
Prime Minister recently concluded with the provinces and 
territories to invest in health care and education.  They are not 
a dedicated tax.  They were never intended to be and never will 
be.

</I></B></P><P align=left>For the past number of months the justice committee has heard 
witnesses from across Canada on Bill C-3, the youth criminal 
justice act.  These folks have tried to convince the committee to 
change the bill.  I thought they were successful.  The committee 
ended up with approximately 260 amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, through the ineptitude of the rules, coupled with the 
government majority on the committee allowing one individual to 
prevent any discussion on these amendments, months of committee 
time has been wasted.  The bill is to be reported back to the 
House in exactly the form it left over a year and a half ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those who testified cannot be impressed that the justice 
committee was unable to make the changes.  Canadians cannot be 
impressed that the committee has done nothing with this

</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member of parliament I am most disappointed that when we 
send a bill to committee for review and potential improvement it 
is not done.  We have a problem when an individual who has not 
seen fit to present any amendments of any real substance to the 
legislation is able to prevent all other parties of the committee 
from doing their jobs for Canadians.  I am outraged and Canadians 
should be outraged.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Sergeant John, a World War II veteran returned home in 1944 from 
the battlefields of Europe.  He married his high school 
sweetheart Sylvia in 1945.  For the past 10 years John and Sylvia 
have received veterans independence payments from veterans 
affairs to help them live in their own home rather than be put 
into institutional case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>John passed away a few months ago and now a severe injustice has 
occurred.  Sylvia, his wife, is denied by legislation the VIP 
monthly allowance that her husband was eligible.  That was to 
help her to continue life in her own home.  If the couple needed 
help keeping their own home when John was living, is it not 
obvious that his wife will need even more help now that he has 
passed away?

Mr. Speaker, while gas prices continue to go through the roof, 
the Canadian loonie remains locked in the basement.  It is now

guess that is the new Liberal math. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Canadian dollar continues to be weak against the U.S.

Mr. Speaker, Canadians, or anyone for that matter, just do not

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the minister of fisheries has no 
credibility when he talks about closing the lobster fishery in 
Miramichi.  The fisheries department's own estimates show that 
the Burnt Church lobster catch is already over four times what 
was approved.  The minister's regional director general has said, 
and I quote, “Continued fishing will have a serious detrimental 
effect on the stocks”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister must uphold his oath of office.  He must enforce 
the law.  When will he pull all the traps? 
<P><A NAME="LINK176"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of Fisheries and 
Oceans, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as I said earlier today, due to 
conservation concerns we have closed the lobster fishery at 
Miramichi.  I would urge the community of Burnt Church to abide 
fully with that because I know they believe in protecting the 
stock for their future generations and I know they want to abide 
by the law.  If they do that it will be the right thing. All 
members of the House should urge them to fully abide by the law 
and protect the resource because the rule of law is important to 
Canadians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK177"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, despite the minister's assurances, 
there are more traps in the water today than there were 
yesterday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday the minister wrote to the chief at Burnt Church and 
said “The fishing activity to date is detrimental to 
conservation.  The current situation cannot continue if 
conservation and an orderly fishery are to be insured”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no orderly fishery and no law and order.  The illegal 
fishing at Miramichi must stop.  When will the minister pull not 
just some but all the traps?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of Fisheries and 
Oceans, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is right in that 
I have written to the chief.  There has been ongoing 
communication for a very long time urging a negotiated agreement 
just as 29 other first nations have done where we have an orderly 
transition program for them to fully participate in the 
commercial fishery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The variation order to close the lobster fishery has been issued 
and I know that they will want to fully comply with the law.  I 
would urge them once again to pull all the traps in the Miramichi 
so that we can go on to the more constructive things we can do.

spring the minister of agriculture guaranteed that all western 
grain and oilseed farmers would enjoy a $5.92 reduction in their 
freight rate bill this year but that is not what farmers are 
telling us.  They are saying that they are getting nowhere near 
that kind of savings.  Some are getting as little as 22 cents, 
some zero and, in a few cases, because of a lack of real 
competition amongst the railways, they are actually paying higher 
costs than they were absorbing last year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having guaranteed $5.92 this past May, will the government be 
making up any shortfall to the farmers who fall far short of this 
$5.92?

Mr. Speaker, I remind the hon. member that we talked about $178 
million legislated by this parliament that will flow to the 
pockets of producers right across the board.  That works out to 
the per capital tonnage amount that he mentioned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers will receive the benefit of this legislation.  It is 
forward looking.  It is legislation that has had, by and large, 
the support of all members of the House and the Senate.  I do not 
think the hon. member should start quibbling at this stage when 
we have provided $178 million for western producers. 
<P><A NAME="LINK182"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, some 
quibble, 22 cents versus $5.92.  He is still on numbers that do 
not add up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister indicated recently that to put us on parity with 
U.S. support payments would require some $18 billion to $20 
billion.  Farm groups are saying that they do not need that much 
of a commitment.  In fact, $4 billion has been suggested by at 
least one major organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the minister tell the House how he arrived at this large 
figure because it is much higher than what he had said in the 
past?  I hope by inflating this number it is not an excuse to 
ignore the plight of Canadian farmers in a desperate situation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food,

that if we compare what the United States is doing, based on the 
size of its industry and the size of our industry, that would be 
the requirement here in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recognize the fact that the industry and the producers have 
said that is not the amount of money they desire and that they 
understand the resource constraints that we have in this country. 
I have said to them that we will continue, as we have shown in 
the past, to do all we can to level the playing field between 
Canada and the United States and that there is also a necessity 
to level the playing field among provinces within Canada.

imagine that anybody here would not agree.  After speaking with

Burnt Church and it is clear that he has failed.

has tried everything possible to negotiate a peaceful resolution. 
As there is no possibility to accommodate the situation at this 
time, the minister was absolutely right to close the fishery in 
Miramichi Bay.  He is also absolutely right to make sure that 
every fisherman in that area respects the law of Canada.

Speaker, during question period the hon. member for Delta—South 
Richmond made the point that the government, through its 
mediator, had offered fishermen $12,000 to turn a blind eye to 
the illegal fishing in Miramichi Bay.  Then he used words which 
you called unparliamentary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to bring attention to the Chair ruling of May 1, 
1980 by Madam Sauvé when she was asked the question “If words 
are directed toward the government and not toward an individual, 
can he use words such as dishonest and shabbily?”  She ruled in 
that context that, yes, such words were parliamentary because it 
was directed toward the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Delta—South Richmond accused the government 
of this $12,000 payment or offer to fishermen in Miramichi Bay 
was a bribe from the government.  It is the government we accuse 
of using a very poor and very— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I thank the hon. member for his

was used, in my interpretation at the time, was directed to the 
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.  I will review the blues. If I 
was wrong, I was wrong.  I have about two seconds to make a 
decision up here.

with our very vast vocabulary we can use other words to bring 
about our ideas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The crisis at Burnt Church is requiring immediate focus from the

</I></B></P><P align=left>I am asking for unanimous consent to put a motion to the House 
that at 6.30 p.m. the House will proceed to a debate of which the 
following motion would be presented by the hon. member for South 
Shore.  It would read: That this House urge the Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans to personally engage in immediate 
negotiations at Burnt Church, New Brunswick with both native and 
non-native fishermen; and that at 11.57 p.m., or earlier if there 
was no debate, that the question then be put without further 
debate or amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that this not be put forward as a way to circumvent 
an earlier ruling, but there is further evidence to suggest that 
tensions are escalating in that part of the country and that the 
House, of all places, should be engaged in the active discussion 
and debate to look for a resolution and a way to de-escalate and 
take away the chance of violence or bloodshed in Burnt Church, 
New Brunswick.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to rise today on the opposition supply day motion. 
I am going to read the motion so that everybody is absolutely 
clear about what we are debating today.  This motion was brought 
forward by the member for Prince George—Peace River of the 
Canadian Alliance.  It states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That given the record increases in the price of gasoline and home 
and diesel fuel, severely hurting Canadian consumers, truck 
drivers and businesses, and given the recent promise by the 
Minister of Finance to reduce taxes, this House call upon the 
government to give relief on fuel taxes, including repealing the 
increase in gasoline excise tax introduced as a temporary deficit 
elimination measure in 1995 and implementing the 1998 
recommendation of the Liberal Caucus committee on gasoline 
pricing in Canada to remove the double taxation of the GST. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I felt it important that we read this into the record again as 
we start the afternoon session of this debate to ensure that 
everybody knows what we are talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to focus right now on the comments that are coming from 
the Liberal government members.  I am quite amazed with the 
excuses they are coming up with.  There are two that stand out 
and I have heard them over and over again as I have followed this 
debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason they are saying they are opposed to this is that they 
are waiting for the provinces.  That is the indication we are 
getting right now and hopefully we can change their minds.  The 
other excuse is they cannot do anything with the taxes on 
gasoline because the fuel companies would then gobble up that 
difference by increasing the price and no savings would be passed 
to the consumer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to question who is running this country.  Is it the 
provinces and the oil companies or is it the government?  That is 
a very feeble excuse.  Are they leaders or are they followers?  I 
am absolutely amazed that they say we have to take our cues from 
the provinces.  When it comes to anything else, like the cut in 
transfers to the provinces of billions of dollars for health 
care, there is no consultation with the provinces.  The Liberals 
run this country sometimes with an iron fist with zero 
consultation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to putting taxes up, they claim to want to have a 
consultation process.  What they really do is show up and tell us 
what they are about to do.  Now when there is an absolute cry, an 
absolute need to do something on these fuel taxes, the government 
wants to wash its hands of it and do absolutely nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is ironic that in this year alone the government is going to 
collect some $13 billion in fuel taxes.  When we look at its 
record on what it has put into the highway infrastructure in this 
country, last year I believe it was mere 4.1%.  It was in the 
millions when they are collecting billions and it goes right into 
government revenues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had a call from a person last night.  He has been following 
this discussion in the media.  He made a very interesting point. 
It is widely known across the country that when we go to the 
pumps to purchase gasoline, anywhere from 36% to 45% of that 
price is taxes.  In fact, members of the Canadian Taxpayers 
Federation have been advocating two prices at the pumps, the 
actual price of the gasoline and the actual tax, so people get to 
see what they are paying in taxes.  On average about 41% of the 
price of gasoline is taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The gentleman I spoke to made a very interesting comment.  He 
said that on every dollar he earned, he paid at least 40 cents in 
income tax and probably a lot more.  Let us be conservative and 
40 cents in tax.  That would leave him 60 cents.  Before he even 
gets to the pumps he only has 60 cents of that dollar he earned. 
When he gets to the pumps of that 60 cents about 25 cents of that 
is taxes. 
From that dollar he ends up paying 65 cents in taxes.  For every 
dollar earned by that working Canadian he is paying 65 cents in 
taxes. At least 40 cents in income taxes are taken off before he 
even gets to take what is left to the pumps, which would be 60 
cents, and of that another 25 cents goes in taxes.  Clearly there 
is a problem with taxes.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ironically the Liberal caucus had a committee that looked into 
this issue in 1998.  It made a number of recommendations to the 
government.  Was it listened to?   No.  Its recommendations fell 
upon deaf ears, as have so many reports by members on all sides 
including those on the backbenches of the government across from 
me.  They put work into these reports and they are absolutely 
ignored.  They are thrown on shelves to collect dust. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's own backbenchers agreed with the Canadian 
Alliance that it was absolutely wrong and unacceptable for the 
government to charge a tax on a tax.  That is what the government 
is doing.  The federal government charges GST on its own excise 
tax.  Liberal backbenchers said that was wrong, with which we 
agree 100%.  In our supply day motion we give them credit for 
coming forward to their government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We included in the supply day motion the recommendation by the 
Liberal caucus committee on gasoline pricing to remove the GST on 
the excise tax.  We give that committee credit for coming forward 
in 1998.  Yet will the government listen to the committee now? It 
did not listen in 1998.  From the debate I have heard so far 
today there does not appear to be any interest in listening now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it absolutely unbelievable when we look at the taxes the 
government is collecting.  We watched the Minister of Finance 
announce a $12 billion surplus.  Can we wrap our minds around $12 
billion?  Is it easy to say what $12 billion mean?  That is $400 
for every man, woman and child in the country.  For a family of 
four that is $1,600 the government has collected in excess taxes. 
Even in the first quarter of this year alone the surplus is $11.4 
billion.  It is out of control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have put forward with respect to gasoline taxes is a 
start.  Let us not make it too onerous.  Let us eliminate the tax 
on the tax.  Let us get rid of that GST on the excise tax because 
we all know it is wrong.  It is not acceptable to start taxing 
tax.  That is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us eliminate the l.5 cent increase which the government put 
on the excise tax specifically to reduce the deficit.  We all 
know the deficit is gone.  When it put that tax increase on the 
excise tax the government said it was specifically for that.  It 
is still there.  There is no interest in removing these tax 
increases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to summarize.  In the interest of the Canadian people we 
have to look at what is best for the country.  We are asking the 
government to follow through.  In the wording of the motion it 
only has to do two things.  There are many other things we could 
look at down the road, but the first one would be not to tax a 
tax.  It should eliminate the GST on the excise tax and eliminate 
the 1.5 cent increase on fuel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the other taxes as well.  The government can do 
that by responding to the motion, voting in favour of it and 
bringing forward legislation.  I know it talked about a motion. 
It could include that discussion in the legislation it brings 
forward and we could discuss it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government members should support this motion to show Canadians 
that they are actually concerned.  Then they would support not 
only the Canadian Alliance but their own backbenchers.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I listened carefully to the hon. member's comment about 
a customer who bought gasoline at a gas station, and I have a 
question for the hon. member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In British Columbia, oil companies do not just indicate the 
price of gas before taxes. Taxes are always included in the 
price, as they are almost everywhere in Canada. But it would be 
important to see the net price of a litre of gas, before taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member mentioned taxes in Vancouver. Could he tell us 
what these taxes are? Are there two, three or four taxes? What 
are the taxes you were referring to and how many cents do they 
amount to on a litre of gas? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, in the Abitibi region, a litre of regular gas retails for 
81.9 cents, with 30.6 cents being taxes and 51 cents going to oil 
companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know the member's response to my question about 
the taxes charged on a litre of gas in British Columbia. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn:</B>  Madam Speaker, back on Vancouver Island 
the price of gasoline is in the high 70s and approaching 80 cents 
per litre.  Depending on where one goes it fluctuates a few 
cents, but it is in the 78 to 79 cents per litre range.  Around 
35 cents of that amount is taxes:  provincial taxes, the GST, the 
GST on the excise tax, and the federal government excise tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member said that he would like consumers to see that 
the price at the pumps is 45 cents and 35 cents is in taxes. That 
would be a good thing. 
<P><A NAME="LINK219"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, from time to time the hon. 
member for Saanich—Gulf Islands can be a reasonable person, but 
most reasonable people would agree that if the federal government 
were to make any moves on excise taxes the provinces would be 
expected to do something as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at British Columbia, the gasoline tax is 11 cents a 
litre.  That compares with our 10 cent excise tax.  The diesel is 
11.5 cents and our diesel is 4 cents a litre.  In addition there 
is another 1.5 cents a litre that is applicable for transit in 
the Victoria area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the federal government moved on excise taxes, realizing that 
the provincial taxes should come down as well, would the hon. 
member support a cut in the ferry services that serve the Gulf 
Islands, his constituents, and the transit systems within 
Victoria that his constituents use as well? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn:</B>  Madam Speaker, again I find it ironic that 
the government has suggested to cut services.  It is an area of 
provincial jurisdiction.  I would not support decreasing services 
when it is sitting on a $12 billion surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is absolutely shameful that the member would actually suggest 
cutting bus service in Victoria and the ferry service to Gulf 
Islands.  That is absolutely ridiculous.  I cannot believe that 
he would suggest it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the provincial taxes, I think they should come 
down.  Am I proud of the NDP Government of British Columbia? 
Absolutely not.  We have some of the highest provincial taxes 
placed on fuels in the country.  They need to come down.  I would 
like to see a new provincial government, but waiting for another 
provincial government is absolutely wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member should show some leadership and not be a 
follower.  If he wants to follow the NDP in British Columbia I am 
afraid it would probably not be a very good route and he would be 
very sorry that he did. 
<P><A NAME="LINK220"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay—Boundary—Okanagan, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Madam Speaker, I would like to address two issues 
today.  One of them is a four year old commitment by the Liberal 
government across the way.  The other is the question raised in 
rhetoric by many Liberals also across the way of oil companies 
versus the government.  If time permits, I would also like to 
address the question of provincial cuts versus federal cuts.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will read into the record a portion of a transcript of 
committee evidence from the Standing Committee on Transport 
hearing on December 4, 1996.  Appearing before the committee was 
the finance minister of the day who coincidentally is still 
finance minister.  The transcript starts with my portion where I 
stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to highways, one concern I always have at any 
committee is that if you hold hearings and almost everybody says 
the same thing, then, at least as a committee, we have an 
obligation to report that and to focus some of our 
recommendations based on that.  The dedication of fuel tax is 
just one of those things. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addressing the Minister of Finance, I said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>You yourself said today that the federal government spends about 
$300 million a year on highway infrastructure, but takes from my 
province of British Columbia alone you take almost three times 
that in federal fuel taxes.  The provincial governments have a 
role to play in that, but the role we have to look at is ours. 
Now, I believe what you have said is correct.  We can't just 
suddenly say sorry, we're going to dump that, about $5 billion 
altogether, into a dedicated fund.  But we have to start.  I 
think it is the right way to go.  If the economy were better, 
then I would say yes, we have to transition fast.  You're 
correct, the economy is very fragile, so we have to transition 
slow, but I still think it's the right way to go and we should 
try to start something along that line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would you agree we should at least examine the possibilities of 
starting something on that concept, even if out of the 10¢ it's 
1¢ or 2¢? 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister replied: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must say I have probably a lot more difficulty with the concept 
of dedicated taxes having been the Minister of Finance for three 
years than I did when I was in opposition, because there is no 
doubt a certain warping of the mind occurs when you get this job. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I responded by saying: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I always wondered what happened. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister continued: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—I think your question is a very valid one, and the way you put 
it is very good.  The fact is it is really not something we could 
contemplate doing now, simply because I think the most important 
thing, and I know you agree, is to solve our fundamental 
financial problem and we really should not limit our flexibility 
at this time. 
</UL></UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, you're suggesting that what we might do, given that 
problem, is to start very small and build on it, if I understand 
what you have just said...I guess my answer to you...would be 
that you put the question well.  There will come a time when we 
will have more flexibility and your suggestion is one we could 
perhaps consider.  But I must say we would have to be generating, 
from my point of view, reasonably substantial surpluses before I 
would want to entertain the concept.  Let me be very clear to 
you, because I think you've put the question in the proper tone, 
and that's the way in which I would want to respond. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will move ahead a little to where the finance minister said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason my original answer to your question was that we might 
be in a position—we're not in a position to examine it now, but 
we might be in a position—to examine it at a time when we're 
generating substantial surpluses is simply that you're not wrong 
when you say, look, if you spend a dollar now you might well save 
yourself $5 down the road.  It's not that you're wrong in that at 
all.  It's just that this applies not only to highways; it 
applies to a vast range of projects governments should really be 
involved in.  I would say to you that if you're going to adopt 
that concept, we're going to get into a long line of priorities, 
and we do not have the money at the present time to go that way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I would really say to you, however—and I think this is 
going to be very important—is that there is going to be a second 
stage of the financial debate in this country when we go beyond 
the deficit to start talking about the debt-to-GDP ratio, the 
debt as a percentage of our gross domestic product.  At that 
point the argument you're bringing forth is going to become very 
important. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He ended by saying: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I'm sorry to take so long, Chairman, but I think (the hon. 
member's) questions are very good. I guess it's a function of 
timing. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was 1996.  We now have a huge surplus.  I think that 
function of timing has come.  It is time for the government to 
start considering removing some of that tax and dedicating a 
portion of it to fix the highway infrastructure so that Canadians 
will know that they are getting value for the money that is being 
taken from them.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to read from a recent report by Statistics 
Canada that suggests the sole reason for gas price increases in 
real dollars is a change in tax levels.  The Statistics Canada 
report adjusted 1957 gas prices to 1995 dollars which worked out 
to 56.6 cents per litre, broken down as 39.9 cents for the gas 
itself and 16.7 cents for taxes.  That was in 1957. In 1995 the 
actual non-adjusted cost of gas was 56.1 cents which broke down 
as 29.8 cents for the gas and 26.3 cents for taxes.  During the 
period of the report, the gasoline price alone dropped by 25% 
when the cost of taxes alone jumped by 57%. In 1957 the pump 
price of gasoline included 29% in various taxes. By 1995 the pump 
price of gasoline included 47% in taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is easy to blame the oil companies for the current price 
increases.  Big corporations in general and the oil companies in 
particular are not very popular these days. The culprit in our 
current price jump is a combination of international crude oil 
prices and government taxes.  Of those two, the one we can 
attempt to do something about is taxes. We should not let the 
government off the hook by laying the blame in the wrong place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One hon. member across the way when questioning my colleague who 
spoke just before me brought up the question of whether the 
federal government should be dropping the price of its excise tax unless 
the provinces agreed to do the same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Might I point out that my province of British Columbia has some 
pretty trying conditions to maintain our highways through the 
mountains and all the valleys, across rivers and the many bridges 
that we have.  My province spends a substantial amount of that 
highway tax on highways. The federal government spends $300 
million nationally but it takes $1 billion from my province 
alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To put out a suggestion that the federal government will only 
cut its excise tax if our province also matches it is completely 
out of line.  Our province is already using that money for its 
original intended purpose.  The federal government is spending 
less than 5% of its take on that same purpose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of environment versus conservation, there are those who 
suggest that if we drop the price of gas, then the use of gas is 
going to go up.  In fact the Liberal government in response to 
the Kyoto convention has floated out the notion of a 38 cent per 
litre increase in the excise tax over a nine year period in order 
to force people to conserve gasoline. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the thinking of someone from a high density urban centre 
where there is all kinds of public transportation and different 
means for people to get around.  It is incredibly punitive on 
people in rural areas from British Columbia to Newfoundland and 
everywhere in between.  It also shows very narrow thinking. It 
totally ignores the problems of things that have been brought up 
extensively today such as heating oil. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government collects what was termed when it began a highway 
tax.  Then it put it on everything. Right now the government is 
taxing low income people using heating fuel. More often than not 
it is low income people who use that particular type of source, 
not high income people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government would start with getting rid of the special 
excise tax that it put on to deal with the deficit we no longer 
have and stop this insane nonsense of taxing its own tax, maybe 
Canadian taxpayers would see a little relief at the pumps.  The 
hon. member for Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge said in the past that 
there is price fixing between the gas companies yet the 
government wants to put out a requirement that those prices be 
fixed before it acts. 
<P><A NAME="LINK221"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, 
NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I listened to my hon. friend and as 
always, I found his comments to be interesting.  I actually do 
not have a question for him.  It is more of statement.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier today I inadvertently made the comment that in spite of 
the hundreds of questions the Canadian Alliance and previously 
the Reform Party had asked over the last year, I was not aware 
that there was a single question asked in question period about 
gas prices.  I have to say I was incorrect.  The research I have 
gone through would indicate that there were two questions asked 
over the last year out of almost 1,000.  Just to make it 
perfectly clear, there were two questions on gas prices out of 
1,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Gouk:</B>  Madam Speaker, I listened with interest to 
the response from the hon. member for Kamloops, Thompson and 
Highland Valleys.  I am always amused to hear his comments in the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I find interesting is the facade he is putting out that 
there is more relevance in the actions of any party and any 
member in question period than there is in committee work.  Most 
people who have studied anything about politics know there is far 
more done in committee.  That is where most of the work of this 
place is done.  I have just finished reading a long portion of 
one of many actions that we have taken in committee, yet he 
queries why it was not raised in the circus called question 
period. 
<P><A NAME="LINK222"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
cannot believe what I have been hearing from my colleagues. One 
member after another has been saying that the government is 
collecting taxes from gasoline so it should spend that money on 
roads. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has a general revenue fund. The government collects 
revenues through taxation of different things in society and 
eventually it makes an assessment in terms of need.  The money is 
then spent accordingly.  Is the member not aware of this? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the member suggesting that the Government of Canada should 
introduce user fees and abolish all of the social programs?  Can 
he suggest how we would be able to support the health care 
program or the education program or all of the other issues in 
our society?  Where would we get the money from?  Can the member 
tell us? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Gouk:</B>  Madam Speaker, I really fear for the hon. 
member who just spoke when he gets back to his caucus meeting and 
points out to the finance minister that he did not understand 
that there was a surplus in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where is the government going to get the money?  It just 
finished acknowledging that for last year there is a $12 billion 
surplus.  It actually thought it would be $3 billion.  The 
government has ripped people off so much that it does not have $3 
billion, it has $12 billion.  What is more, the government has 
collected more than half of that amount already just a short way 
into this fiscal year.  Where is the government going to get the 
money? The government will get the money out of the pockets of 
the taxpayer. It will get it out of the bank accounts of low 
income people who use heating fuel in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my province we pay a marginal rate of taxes of 54.4 cents. 
That means when we get to the gas pumps we have 45 cents left out 
of $1 and we get almost 50% of what we pay for gas with that 45 
cent dollar taxed by the government.  We are going to get to the 
point where we will have to get money from some other source just 
to pay our tax bill. If the government keeps going the way it is, 
we are going to find situations where there will be more than 
100% tax on some objects.

Speaker, I notice there was no reference to the profits made by 
oil companies in the motion tabled by the Alliance party.  I also 
notice that the Alliance is having a fundraiser in Toronto where 
it is charging $25,000 a table.  I assume some of the oil 
companies will buy tables at that particular fundraiser. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member was talking about grassroots Canadians and ordinary 
people.  I want to know how many ordinary people will buy these 
tables at $25,000 a hit.  That party does not represent ordinary 
people.  It represents the rich and wealthy and the privileged in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Gouk:</B>  Madam Speaker, I know that party cannot 
relate to people with incomes at all, but I will have the hon. 
member know that I have 24 no cost public meetings in my riding 
every year.  I would like to know how many public meetings he 
holds in his.

Speaker, today's debate represents somewhat of a defining moment 
in this parliament because something unique has happened here.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to go back to two months ago when the newly elected 
leader of the Canadian Alliance was at a press conference across 
the street.  One journalist asked him what his number one 
priority would be when parliament returned. The leader of the 
Canadian Alliance said that the number one issue for him would be 
parliamentary reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The very first motion that the Canadian Alliance put on the 
floor of the House after the summer recess deals with a very 
important issue, the reduction of fuel prices.  As members of 
parliament, all of us are seized with this issue and we are 
looking at it in its complexity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Something unique happened on our side of the House.  The 
backbench member of parliament for Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge and 
many of his colleagues spent the last two years of their 
parliamentary lives going across the country listening to 
Canadians, to mom and pop gas station operators and the operators 
of oil companies.  They studied the issue, what is the problem 
and how could we fix it.  A report was produced.  That report, as 
most members in the House would admit, is one of the finest 
pieces of work ever put out by a backbench team. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened in the House today is something I have never seen 
in 12 years.  It was not a minister of the Government of Canada 
who led off with the government position today; it was the member 
of parliament for Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge who said “This is 
our position”.  Why I think this is somewhat of a defining 
moment is that the member for Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge, who has 
strong views on the issue, and I think few would challenge his 
understanding of its complexity, put forward a constructive 
amendment to the Canadian Alliance motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what the member for Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge tried to 
get accepted by the Canadian Alliance:  “That given the record 
increases in the price of gasoline, home and diesel fuel severely 
hurting Canadian consumers, especially those with lower incomes, 
this House calls upon the government to assist Canadians in 
coping with the rising financial burden and this House strongly 
urges provincial and territorial governments to consider 
providing similar assistance”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance rejected to allow that motion to come to 
the floor.  It rejected to allow members of parliament from all 
parties to consider that.  This is significant to me because I am 
as passionately committed as anyone in the House to making the 
roles of members of parliament more meaningful and I was hopeful 
when the new leader of the Canadian Alliance said that his number 
one priority was going to be parliamentary reform.  Today we had 
an example where parliamentary reform could have been dealt with 
in a constructive way for all Canadians, especially lower income 
Canadians and the Canadian Alliance walked away from it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Madam Speaker, I am splitting my time with my dear friend and 
colleague from Ottawa Centre so please warn me when I have a 
minute left.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appeal to the members of the Canadian Alliance that when their 
leader states that his number one priority is parliamentary 
reform and a government backbench team, led by the member for 
Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge, puts forward a constructive amendment 
on behalf of all Canadians, to take that as an opportunity to 
constructively work together on a complex issue that every single 
member of parliament believes must be dealt with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The single most important point that my colleague from 
Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge made today was that we should design a 
plan where the altered formula of incomes or revenue streams do 
not go into the treasuries of the oil companies but into the 
pockets of consumers, especially low income consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That amendment was repeatedly put on the floor today. In fact, 
today during question period the Minister of Finance challenged 
the Canadian Alliance to work with the government and accept the 
member's amendment.  He did not say that we would do it tomorrow 
or next week. The Minister of Finance said that we would vote 
today and that we would make it happen today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians listening to the debate today will judge fairly that 
over the last two years it was not a minister or a big department 
of government but a member of parliament with his colleagues who 
developed knowledge, listened and put a report forward.  The 
government gave members of the Canadian Alliance an opportunity 
today to come on board and work together on behalf of all 
Canadians with lower incomes and they walked away from it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance missed a great opportunity to follow 
through on their so-called commitment to parliamentary reform. 
<P><A NAME="LINK225"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, first, I want to point out that the Speaker ruled 
that the amendment put forward by the member was inadmissible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the House leader of the Canadian Alliance through the 
Speaker told the member that we would be prepared to waive the 
period that was necessary before debating this sort of thing. We 
also said that we would be happy if the member from Ajax would 
talk to his own House leader and put it on the order paper for 
tomorrow.  We would be happy to do that.  Let us do that.  That 
is the offer we are making to the member across the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely the member who just spoke has to acknowledge that is 
exactly what happened and is happening.  In fact, his whole 
speech ignored that fact and he has misled Canadians about what 
the Canadian Alliance was and is prepared to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills:</B>  Madam Speaker, I want you to ignore 
the fact that the member for Medicine Hat just said that I misled 
Canadians.  I was in the House today sitting next to my 
colleague, the member for Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge, and I can 
tell you, Madam Speaker, that the motion was put on the floor 
twice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Three times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills:</B>  Well I saw it twice with my own eyes 
and twice it was rejected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us forget about the incident this morning. 
What is more important is that the Minister of Finance for Canada 
during question period today asked the leader of the Canadian 
Alliance to come on board and accept this amendment and he did 
not act.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquière, BQ): </B>Madam Speaker, I 
listened very carefully to the member for Toronto—Danforth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, we can see once again that Liberal members are living in 
the past. They talk about what they should have done or about 
what they did. But what are they doing right now about helping 
Canadians cope with the gasoline prices they are now facing and 
will continue to face? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year, in my region of Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean, the 
Canadian government collected close to $52 million from 
taxpayers, through its excise tax and GST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did the government do with that money? I was told by the 
office of the Minister of Finance that the money was distributed 
to the various departments. Today, through the Canadian Alliance 
motion before us, we are asking this government to act and 
actually do something for those people who are faced with a 
serious problem that will get even worse. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills:</B>  Madam Speaker, I will say this 
humbly, but the government of Quebec does not support the oil 
companies. In fact, my understanding is that most of the members 
of the Bloc Quebecois support the report.  I just do not 
understand why the hon. member is at odds with her own community. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold: </B>Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order. In his response, the member for Toronto—Danforth involved the 
provincial governments.  The question— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> This is not a point of 
order.  It is a point of debate. The hon. member for 
Toronto—Danforth. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills:</B>  Madam Speaker, I think I have really 
said it all but I will say one more thing to all the members of 
the opposition parties.  The member of parliament for 
Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge put an amendment on the floor today and 
hopefully before the end of the day something miraculous will 
happen and all members will come on side and the amendment will 
be accepted, as the Minister of Finance has suggested. 
<P><A NAME="LINK227"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am 
fairly disappointed by what I have heard today.  I have been here 
since 10 o'clock trying to hear a substantial debate about how we 
are going to resolve this whole crisis of high gasoline prices in 
Canada but all I have heard from the opposition throughout the 
whole day is how we are going to solve this problem through a tax 
reduction of 1.5 cents a litre.  I must submit that is not the 
answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My constituents are telling me that even if we reduced the tax 
on gas by 1.5 cents a litre that they would still be paying 74 
cents or 75 cents a litre, which is way too high.  In that sense, 
I have not heard one tangible proposal that would deal with that 
specific problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second problem is that the opposition wants the government 
to reduce the tax when in fact if the government were to reduce 
the tax there would be absolutely no guarantee whatsoever that 
this tax reduction on gasoline would go into the pockets of 
consumers, simply because history tells us otherwise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take the example of New Brunswick.  Hon. members will be 
both happy and disappointed to know that in New Brunswick, which 
has the fourth lowest tax on gasoline anywhere in Canada at 
approximately 10.7 cents per litre, the people pay the fourth 
highest price for gasoline per litre across Canada. 
The government of New Brunswick decided to reduce taxes in the 
hope that it would benefit the consumers of New Brunswick but the 
oil companies sucked up that reduction and pocketed it.

<A HREF="#LINKT71"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reducing taxes without talking to the consumers will not solve 
the problem.  So much for the theory of reducing the tax on 
gasoline hoping that the consumer will get the benefit at the 
mercy of the oil companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been involved with this case, like many of my colleagues 
on this side of the House, for over 14 years, when gasoline 
prices were not fashionable to talk about, and nothing has 
changed. We still hear the same lines from the same players on 
the international market, the major international oil producers. 
When we ask them why we are paying so much for gasoline or why 
gasoline prices are moving up and down, they give us three 
arguments, the first being supply and demand.  They tell us that 
when there is a shortage of supply on the international market we 
have a higher crude oil price and, as a result, we pay more at 
the pump. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did some research through my office and through the Library of 
Parliament.  We looked at the International Energy Agency, a very 
respected international agency located in Europe that monitors 
supply and demand internationally.  What we found out was quite 
interesting.  The average supply of oil in 1997 was 74.4 million 
barrels per day.  The demand for oil was 73.4 million barrels per 
day.  To that extent, we had approximately one million barrels 
per day more supply than demand.  The average cost per barrel at 
the time was $18.98.  In Ontario we were paying 57.2 cents per 
litre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will jump one year to give the House better statistics. In 
1999 the international supply of oil was 74 million barrels per 
day and demand was 75.2 million.  Therefore we had more demand 
than we had supply.  Guess what?  The price of oil per barrel on 
the international scene was $17.79.  Hey, the price per litre in 
Ontario was still at 57.8 cents per litre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that is the case, could someone somewhere explain to me why 
it is that in the second half of the year 2000, when the total 
supply of oil on the international scene is greater than the 
demand, in excess of approximately 2.1 million barrels a day, 
that we are still crying wolf and saying there is a shortage of 
supply when in fact we have a surplus in supply?  There is a huge 
supply of oil on the international scene and the oil producers 
are part of an international conspiracy to shaft consumers not 
only here in Canada but in North America, in Europe and all 
around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The gentleman who said it best is the president of OPEC. 
Yesterday in one of the national papers he was reported as saying 
“Rocketing world oil prices are being fueled by speculation and 
are out of the oil cartel's control”. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1600"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT72"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He is absolutely right. Simply put, if we were to look at the 
oil cartels, OPEC has been pumping more oil on the international 
scene than there is demand.  There is enough oil in the 
international market to flood rivers all over the world. There is 
huge racketeering out there and a huge amount of speculation that 
many of the international players are involved in it.  It has 
nothing to do with supply and demand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second one is the market forces.  When asked why we are 
paying so much for gasoline, they tell us it is because of market 
forces, that if the market can take 80 cents per litre, they are 
going to charge 80 cents per litre. How can they say it is about 
market forces when everyone is charging the same?  How can the 
consumer have any choice whatsoever? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about the poor little independent retailers in our 
neighbourhoods, like in Quebec a few months ago, where the major 
players move in and clean the butts of individuals so much so 
that they sell below cost?  How can that be market forces?  Oh, 
no.  That is not market forces.  The players who control the 
market wanted to pump out, not in, the independents who are a lot 
more efficient than the fat elephants that are trying to do 
everything to stick it to the consumer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We move on to the next one, the so-called players on the 
international scene telling us that taxes are a problem here in 
Canada.  My colleagues have fallen into their trap.  It reminds 
me of a French story. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am referring to the fable of the crow and the fox.  I am sure 
my colleagues know this story.  The crow had a piece of cheese in 
its beak.  The fox regarded it and said “Ah, how beautiful you 
are, such lovely eyes”.  Suddenly, the crow opened its beak and 
dropped the cheese into the mouth of the fox, which ate it. A 
fine story. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues in the opposition are falling into the trap. It is 
a problem that can only be resolved through co-operation between 
the provincial governments and the federal government. This is 
not a federal problem alone.  It is a provincial responsibility. 
Pricing is the responsibility of the provincial governments. They 
have to show leadership.  They have to respond to the call of the 
federal government, the Minister of Finance, the Minister of 
Industry and the Minister of Natural Resources.  They have to 
come to the table in order to talk about solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They cannot sell us peanuts thinking that is going to fill up 
our tummies.  They are starving us.  They have to move together 
in order to respond to the needs of the consumers.  Seniors, men 
and women on fixed incomes will be more responsive to the 
initiative of my colleague from Pickering who put a very 
reasonable motion before parliament, and that is to put the money 
in the pockets of the people rather than give it back to the oil 
companies. 
<P><A NAME="LINK228"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I find this quite interesting.  We have put forward a 
motion today to simply stop collecting a tax which was intended 
to be collected while we had a deficit. All we are doing is 
saying to the government that it should now stop collecting that 
tax and it should stop collecting GST on taxes on fuel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That little simple request is being countered by all sorts of 
high powered arguments by the other side.  They say no, they will 
not do that.  It is as if a youngster came to my house and said 
“I want a bowl of soup because I am hungry” and I said “Well, 
because you did not ask for the whole kettle, I am not going to 
give you the bowl”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think the government recognizes what is happening here. 
It talks about the hon. member from Pickering who has worked on 
this problem for so many years.  How ineffective.  He has worked 
for two years and the government has not listened.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now the government is blaming us because we are not allowing a 
motion which simply says that the Minister of Finance should talk 
to the provinces.  Frankly there is not a thing we can do to 
prevent the Minister of Finance from talking to the provinces. 
Let him do it.  He does not need our approval.  He does not need 
the approval of this parliament.  The government has thrown in a 
red herring in order not to deal with the real issue, which is 
simply to vote in favour of stopping collecting the 1.5 cent per 
litre surtax that the government imposed on us along with the 
GST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mac Harb:</B>  Madam Speaker, I must admit I came to this 
issue with an open mind.  I wanted to be able to vote for the 
motion but when I read it, one thing came to my mind:  either 
naivety or stupidity is involved.  I think both of them were when 
this motion was put before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance is trying to get Canadians to believe that 
by reducing the surtax by 1.5 cents a litre we are going to solve 
the gasoline price crisis in Canada.  This is misleading, nothing 
more, nothing less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was interested in seeing the opposition come forward with 
proposals, such as how the provincial government should set up 
some mechanism.  A good idea would be an ombudsman at the 
provincial level to monitor the price of gasoline. Has that party 
proposed it?  Some sort of mechanism should be set up at the 
provincial level so whenever there is an increase by 10% the oil 
companies have to notify consumers. This is a provincial 
responsibility. Has that party proposed this?  No, none of that. 
All that party has come forward with is rhetoric all day.  It is 
terrible.  I wasted part of my day listening to nonsense.

of the fable of the fox and the crow.  I would like to speak of 
this fable using another image. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1998, a Liberal committee was established with 47 Liberal 
members.  They behaved like the fox and wanted public opinion on 
their side. They said, in a report, things such as “There is an 
unreasonable industry concentration”.  They also said that it 
meant a saving for the major oil companies with the way the 
competition was organized.  Further on they said “The federal 
Competition Act has no teeth and the Competition Bureau is 
unlikely to uncover the practices”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, the situation facing us is a short term one.  There is 
the problem of overpriced gasoline and there is pressure on 
governments to lower taxes.  There is also a long term problem in 
this situation.  The government in office was not elected 
yesterday.  It set up a committee that made recommendations in 
1998. At that point, all the fox wanted from the crow, which 
represented public opinion, was satisfaction, to try to put an 
end to the story. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Was there no way to come up with real solutions and to implement 
the recommendations of the committee without denigrating today 
those trying to find solutions? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mac Harb:</B> Madam Speaker, I will simply reply that the 
government has responded very positively to the recommendations 
of the Liberal committee.  It is in the process of a complete 
review of the Competition Act.  The Conference Board of Canada is 
looking at these issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for prices, I would simply say that they come under 
provincial, not federal, jurisdiction.  Unfortunately, a number 
of members have failed to make the distinction between prices and 
competition.  Competition comes under federal jurisdiction, while 
prices come under provincial jurisdiction.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Looking back at the history of crude oil prices, in 1991 as a 
result of the gulf war crisis crude oil prices spiked to a record 
$41 a barrel.  At that time the pre-tax cost of a litre of 
gasoline was only 42 cents when crude oil hit $41 a barrel. Today 
in 2000 with crude oil hitting $37 plus a barrel, gasoline prices 
have gone through the roof but the pre-tax price of gasoline is 
only 44 cents a litre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one can tell me that the gouging that is going on is by the 
oil companies.  The pre-tax price of oil indicates that it is not 
the oil companies.  It is the provincial and federal governments 
and their taxes that are gouging the Canadian people on this 
issue.  There is no question about it.  The information is there. 
The facts are there.  A good part of the problem— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen:</B>  How about the fact that the federal tax 
has not changed in the last four years? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Chatters:</B>  Madam Speaker, the member said “What 
about the fact that the federal taxes have not changed in four 
years”.  That is absolute rubbish.  He knows better than that. 
He knows that the GST on gasoline increases every time the price 
of gasoline increases so the federal portion of the tax on 
gasoline goes up every time the price of gasoline goes up.  It 
has done that all along. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The miserable failure of the government's economic policies and 
the supported weakness in the Canadian dollar are creating a huge 
problem in the energy industry that is yet to come home to roost. 
Sooner or later it will do that simply because refineries in this 
country have to buy their crude oil in American dollars and sell 
their product in Canadian dollars. With the Canadian dollar 
situated where it is, the margins in the refining industry are so 
fine that there has not been an oil refinery built in this 
country in 30 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part of the problem that is driving the high price of oil, as 
the member we heard earlier suggested, is that while actual 
production is outstripping demand, the price of gasoline is not 
dropping because the lack of profitability in the refining 
industry has meant that there have been no new refineries built 
in 30 years and we do not have the refining capacity to catch up 
with demand.  That is a fact.  It is as clear as can be if 
anybody wants to look at it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier an NDP member suggested that energy is the lifeblood of 
Canada's economy and I certainly would agree with that.  How in 
the world could we expect to have enough of this energy to 
sustain the lifeblood of the economy if we refused to allow the 
industry to be profitable, to expand and to build refineries and 
to find more oil and invest in the industry as they are doing?

</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding alone the private sector has announced $35 billion 
of investment in the industry to ensure that the lifeblood of the 
Canadian economy is there 10 or 15 years down the road.  I do not 
think that is a bad thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think of the Liberal government and the division within the 
caucus with small groups of backbenchers running off with the 
minister's blessing to hold up a strawman to show consumers that 
they are really concerned about prices at the pump.  I think of 
them making recommendations and the minister not having any 
intention of following up on them.  I think of the socialist part 
of the caucus, or the environmental extremist part of the caucus, 
demanding higher prices at the pumps in the interest of reducing 
consumption, conserving energy and saving the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question in my mind that the price of energy will 
continue to rise.  It is a finite resource and as the resource 
becomes scarcer and the demand becomes greater the price will 
rise.  It is unavoidable.  I will be splitting my time with my 
colleague from Calgary—Nose Hill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal caucus is not telling consumers what is the real 
agenda.  I am looking forward to going out and fighting the next 
election based on the government's plan to implement the Kyoto 
protocol.  The Liberals are not saying it, but the David Suzuki 
Foundation, Greenpeace and the Pembina Institute are all telling 
us that it will not be that bad, that it will only mean a 3% to 
5% reduction in GDP if we implement the Kyoto protocol. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am looking forward to going out and fighting an election on 
the government's promise not of zero growth in the economy or 
zero growth in the GDP but a 3% to 5% drop in the country's GDP. 
That will be a lot of fun. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The public should know that.  The determination of the 
environment minister to implement sulphur levels in gasoline is 
totally out of sync in Canada with the United States agenda. Here 
in Canada we will be creating a speciality market that will 
cost consumers dearly at the pumps, simply because of the 
minister's decision not to follow the timetable of the Americans 
in reducing sulphur in gasoline. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is certainly nothing wrong with the proposal to reduce 
sulphur.  It is commendable, but if we do not stay in sync with 
the United States we will be a speciality market in Canada.  One 
only has to look at what happened in the United States when 
California implemented stringent environmental regulations on 
gasoline compared to the rest of the country and created a 
specialty market in one state.  Its price skyrocketed above those 
in the rest of the United States.  The same will happen when the 
government implements its sulphur levels in gasoline, but it is 
not telling consumers that.  It is telling them that it is very 
concerned with the price of gasoline at the pumps and that it 
will step forward and save the consumer in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is not being open and honest with Canadian 
consumers.  It is throwing up strawmen to deflect its real 
position on energy prices and where it is going.  I think it is 
time it came clean with Canadians.  I am looking forward to the 
election campaign so that we might be able to do that.

the member spent most of his speech shamelessly shilling for the 
corporations.  He tried to convince Canadians that the 
corporations get by on a razor thin profit margin and struggle 
along with their oil and gas industry.  I guess if one is trying 
to sell tickets to dinners at $25,000 per table one would pretty 
well have to butter up the executives of the oil companies.  Who 
else would spend $25,000 to attend a Reform Party dinner?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the actual facts.  Let us look at some of the 
profits of these major oil companies, many of which I am sure are 
in the riding the member represents.  Husky Energy in the last 
quarter made profits of $198 million, an increase of 2,302% over 
the previous year, and the hon. member is telling us they are not 
making a profit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at Petro-Canada with $439 million in the last 
quarter with an increase over the previous year of 314%.  Suncor 
Energy made a $619 million profit in a quarter, not per year, 
which is an increase of 156% over one year previously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member is telling us that they are not gouging us at 
the pumps with profit margins like that.  It is beyond 
credibility.  Canadians do not believe it.  Nobody buys it except 
for the guy wearing rose coloured glasses who is speaking for the 
corporations and trying to be a champion and an apologist to the 
oil companies.  It is really grating for me to sit here and 
listen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Chatters:</B>  Madam Speaker, I am glad it is 
grating on this member because his comments have been grating on 
me all day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not ashamed to stand and defend a corporation making a 
profit.  A year and a half ago the price of crude oil was $10.50, 
which was below the cost of production.  Today the oil companies 
are making a healthy profit.  I do not think that is immoral. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those profits are driven by the marketplace.  If consumers were 
not demanding that volume of energy, the energy prices would not 
be there.  The price of crude oil is set on the open market 
through a bidding process.  If the demand is there the price will 
be there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly, when the Liberals talk about a made in Canada energy 
program, that old chestnut will not sell in Canada anywhere. They 
tried that under the Trudeau regime and it did not work. Those 
members rave about the evil, gouging oil companies and today the 
government announces a stamp honouring Petro-Canada. The 
hypocrisy around here just staggers me.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquière, BQ): </B>Madam Speaker, I 
am extremely disappointed in the performance of the Canadian 
Alliance member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thought that the motion introduced in the House this afternoon 
was so that taxpayers would benefit from what reformers were 
proposing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I note that the member, in his speech, says that it is the oil 
companies that should have all this money and then make even 
bigger profits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am truly disappointed and I would like the Canadian Alliance 
member to tell me what place there is for consumers in all this. 
Where do they come in, the people who are paying 79.9 cents a 
litre for gasoline, the people who are going to be paying 
astronomical amounts for heating oil next fall?  Is he there to 
defend ordinary folks or the oil companies?  I am extremely 
disappointed. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Chatters:</B>  Madam Speaker, there has not been one 
shred of evidence presented here all day to indicate that the 
benefit would not be passed along to the consumer if the 
government followed our proposal and reduced the tax on gasoline 
by some $1.5 billion and therefore challenged the provinces to do 
the same, amounting to between a six and seven cent reduction in 
the cost of gasoline at the pump.  Historically and every shred 
of evidence out there shows that it would and that consumers 
would benefit by the government reducing those taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Governments traditionally have taxed gasoline as a luxury.  For 
40 years governments at all levels have had a need for income so 
they raised the taxes on cigarettes, booze and gasoline.  They 
have done it over and over again.  It is time to recognize what 
gasoline and energy are, to drop the tax and to pass the savings 
on to the people at the pumps.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am pleased to speak to our supply 
day motion today which reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That given the record increases in the price of gasoline and home 
and diesel fuel, severely hurting Canadian consumers, truck 
drivers and businesses, and given the recent promise by the 
Minister of Finance to reduce taxes, this House call upon the 
government to give immediate relief on fuel taxes, including 
repealing the increase in gasoline excise tax introduced as a 
temporary deficit elimination measure in 1995 and implementing 
the 1998 recommendation of the Liberal Caucus committee on 
gasoline pricing in Canada to remove the double taxation of the 
GST. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot for the life of me figure out why government members 
who made these recommendations only two short years ago are 
bleating about their opposition to this motion.  We are simply 
giving the House a chance to implement what the Liberal committee 
recommended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact the Liberal committee consisted of 47 Liberal MPs.  That 
is about a third of the Liberal caucus.  They did not even have 
to worry about any opposition or any other input from other 
parties because they did not let other parties on their Liberal 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In spite of that, 47 Liberal MPs who heard over 1,000 people in 
their committee work two years ago recommended very clearly that 
the double taxation be removed from the price of gasoline, that 
is the GST duplication, and that the 1.5 cents per litre put on 
in 1995 to reduce the deficit be eliminated because it has worked 
and reduced the deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals proposed this motion two years ago.  Now we have 
the bizarre spectacle of those same individuals who loudly 
recommended that the motion be passed opposing it in the House. 
Why?  We are not sure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it a bad motion because the Alliance has put it forward?  Was 
it a good recommendation when 47 Liberal MPs brought it forward 
in 1998?  Today, when the Alliance is agreeing that it should be 
done because consumers are hurting, the Liberals will not agree 
to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who is serving the interest of Canadians in the House?  Is the 
interest of Canadians even uppermost in the minds of those 
members of the House?  Is it sheer partisanship?  Canadians are 
hurting and worried about how they will fill their home fuel oil 
tanks this winter.  That does not matter to them.  What matters 
is that they do not want to get together with the opposition.  I 
would tell Liberal members opposite to grow up.  We are here to 
serve Canadians.  We are not here to serve just partisan 
interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have brought forward a motion which is exactly the same as 
the one that 47 Liberal members travelling across the country 
came back with and recommended to their government.  We are 
recommending the same thing.  We are agreeing with the Liberals. 
We are saying that it should be implemented today.  Let us vote 
for this motion.  Let us get on with it.  Let us help Canadians. 
Let us ease some of the burden.  Yet we find somehow that 
ridiculous and specious reasons are put forward as to why all of 
a sudden their own recommendation does not have any merit.  That 
is simply ridiculous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard the most bizarre reasons in the debate, one of them 
being that if we lower taxes it will not help consumers because 
the people who supply the product will simply raise the cost of 
the product.  By that logic, we should raise taxes sky high to 
make sure that government gets all the money from products.  By 
that logic the higher the taxes, the lower the actual price and 
profit to the producer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>NDP members are saying “God forbid that producers should get 
any money.  Let us tax higher.  Let us not cut taxes”.  By that 
logic, why do we not add a 10 cents per gallon tax on fuel? 
Anyone can see that is an illogical position to take.  Let us not 
go there. 
Let us go where Canadian people want us to go.  That is to give 
them some hope, some relief and some means of paying the price of 
fuel that they desperately need.  Canadians need fuel to heat 
their homes.  This is not a luxury.  This is a cold country. We 
need to tell Canadians that we will do what we can to make sure 
they have a reasonable chance of meeting the necessary costs.

</I></B></P><P align=left>People need fuel for transportation, whether it is for their own 
transportation or for car pooling or for taking the bus or for 
sending their goods by truck or for any kind of transportation 
that takes fuel.  This is not rocket science.  We are glad we do 
not have the horse and buggy economy anymore. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fuel must be paid.  If the government is taking the lion's share 
of the cost of this commodity, then ordinary regular Canadians 
trying to live their lives, heat their homes and carry on the 
ordinary commerce of their society are going to suffer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I quote from an editorial from the Calgary <I>Herald</I> on June 
13 which says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Between 1996 and 1999, even before adjusting for inflation, the 
base price of gas declined from 30.2 to 28.6 cents per litre.  By 
contrast, the government take in fuel taxes almost doubled—from 
17.6 to 29 cents per litre. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who is hurting Canadians?  The government has imposed tax after 
tax on Canadians.  The error of its ways has been recognized. A 
recommendation has been brought forward that that be reversed, 
that there be no tax on tax and that the temporary tax to 
eliminate the deficit be eliminated.  Now we find that these 
common sense measures, these measures that would bring relief to 
every Canadian in this country cannot be supported. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would say to every Canadian watching this debate who has a 
Liberal member of parliament representing them—and I use that 
term very loosely—to phone their member of parliament and ask 
them why they want to keep a temporary tax when the purpose of 
the tax has been fulfilled.  Ask them why they would have a tax 
on top of tax.  Ask them why they will not follow the 
recommendation of 47 of their own MPs and give Canadians the 
relief they want and need for peace of mind as winter approaches. 
Ask them if there will be some help from the people being paid to 
represent them.  I ask Canadians to put these questions to their 
Liberal members of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If an election is called, I ask that someone get up at every 
single forum and take their Liberal candidate to task.  Ask them 
why they want to keep a tax that they themselves said was 
temporary and now ought to be eliminated.  Canadians should ask 
Liberal candidates about double taxing them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to all members of the House that we put partisanship 
aside.  Let us put our pet projects aside, our pet peeves against 
big corporations and all the things that have muddied the waters 
of this debate.  Let us simply stand in our place when the time 
comes to vote on this motion and say to Canadians that yes, we 
will eliminate a temporary tax which is no longer necessary and 
whose purpose has been served and that we will no longer tax 
Canadians on tax.  Canadians might actually applaud that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I certainly hope that Canadians who see their member of 
parliament vote against such a common sense, reasonable, 
rational, helpful measure will punish those representatives who 
have kicked them in the teeth once again when it was totally 
unnecessary.

Speaker, I cannot speak right now about what the punishment is 
going to be for various members of parliament, but I can assure 
Canadians this evening that when it comes to this issue, this 
party, unlike that party, knows it implicitly.  More importantly, 
it does not play the kind of hair splitting recommendations where 
members selectively pick certain parts of this wonderful 
document.  They have given credit to one simple area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the question of the resolution, the member across has 
conspicuously forgotten that as part of the condition of that 
recommendation, it recommended that if the GST was removed from 
other taxes, the federal government should undertake measures to 
ensure the resulting savings were passed on to consumers and not 
merely absorbed by the oil industry.  They cannot talk out of 
both sides of their mouth.  On the one hand they want the 
resolution.  On the other hand they do not want to accept the 
mechanism, which is to give it directly to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That member, her party and her leader today had an opportunity 
to give the tax back to Canadians, assuming of course it was 
going to bring down the level of gasoline and somehow remove the 
hardship on Canadians.  I know Canadians understand this, that 
they are johnnies-come-lately on that side.  They are shamelessly 
sitting here and trying to pass off their defence of an industry 
that for the past three years has been making excessive profits, 
cutting back production and creating all sorts of disruptions in 
a country where we have paid through our taxes to make sure that 
industry received more benefits than others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest they start talking about the oil patch, the difficulty 
Canadians are facing and understand how dangerous the resolution 
is without the amendment and give Canadians an opportunity to 
receive those taxes, not the oil industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy:</B>  Madam Speaker, I feel sincere pity 
for this member who chaired a committee of 47 of his colleagues 
unsullied by any common sense from the opposition.  Now he has to 
twist himself inside out to oppose recommendations which he 
himself brought forth.  Surely that is a sad indictment of 
Liberal politics when a fine member of parliament has to twist 
and turn to repudiate his own findings.  This is sad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am glad that my appeal to Canadians to take their Liberal 
members of parliament to task on this issue has struck a nerve. 
The only thing that will bring sanity back to the policies of the 
government is if they feel some electoral heat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is simply ridiculous to suggest that somebody who made a 
recommendation to repeal a tax, which was temporary and whose 
purpose has been served, and who spoke out against tax on tax 
should now speak out of both sides of his mouth and oppose the 
very measure that would have brought that forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If anything is more dangerous than a member of parliament doing 
that I would like to know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dan McTeague:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  This hon. member has in some respects attempted to try to 
put words in my mouth in terms of what I have said.  For the 
record, this is clearly— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I am afraid this is a 
point of debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy:</B>  Madam Speaker, I would just say 
this.  I know sometimes in the heat of debate and totally 
appalled at the hypocrisy of other members sometimes we get 
carried away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, we need to focus on what is right and best for Canadians. 
What is right and best for Canadians is that we do what we can to 
alleviate the stress and the hardship that they are not only 
feeling now but will increasingly feel as winter continues and as 
their fuel costs rise.  Let us put all of this aside and simply 
help Canadians.  That is why we are here.

Speaker, I will be splitting my time with the hon. member for 
Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to offer my comments on the motion before us today. 
I, too, am very concerned by the increase in price for gasoline, 
diesel and home heating fuel.  This affects all of us as 
individuals, as businesses and as consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the hon. member for Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge has outlined so 
very well, our fellow government caucus members saw a need to 
study the whole issue of gasoline pricing and this included 
taxation.  We issued a report in June 1998.  As one of the 
co-chairs of that committee, I was and am certainly proud of our 
report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was a group of MPs who were concerned enough to go out and 
gather material that may have helped explain price fluctuations 
in Canada.  We travelled to dozens of communities, speaking not 
only with members of the gas-buying public, but with 
representatives of the oil companies, independent retailers and 
trucking firms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of our committee's recommendations stated that double 
taxation, with GST on top of the retail price before and after 
provincial and federal excise taxes, must end, conditional on a 
guarantee that the tax decrease would be passed on to consumers 
and not absorbed by oil companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1.5 cents per litre deficit cutting tax we suggested also 
must be removed.  These are but two of the Liberal committee's 29 
recommendations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion specifically refers to taxation and that, I agree, 
is an important element, but not the only one when it comes to 
price.  There are other issues at play here that must also be 
addressed, such as competition in the industry, appropriate laws 
that prevent predatory pricing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the general mandate of the Liberal committee on 
gasoline pricing was to examine all aspects of the oil industry 
that had a direct impact on the pricing of gasoline in Canada. 
We examined such issues as operations and procedures in the oil 
industry, wholesale and retail selling, refining, gasoline 
exports, federal-provincial legislation and consumer protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As hon. members know, the Conference Board of Canada is 
currently undertaking a study of the pricing situation as well to 
give Canadians a solid and forthright accounting of the 
situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to a tax cut on gasoline, we must ensure it is done 
in concert with the provinces.  We must also guarantee that the 
price will not be taken up by the large oil companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I note that the official opposition is not calling for an 
inquiry into the domination of 85% of the gasoline market by only 
four refiner-marketers.  It is not calling for a study of the 
fact that all wholesale prices are identical or that 
refiner-marketers' domination allows control of retail and 
wholesale pricing or that there have been no new entrants into 
the market, while independents are going out of business and the 
retail margins are uneconomic for even the most efficient 
independent operator. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today's motion emphasizes the tax portion only.  Perhaps this 
provides good optics, but we in government are responsible for 
good public policy.  I want to emphasize, however, that I support 
the elimination of the 1.5 cent per litre excise tax that was 
added in 1995 as a deficit cutting measure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at some measures of how to help low income people 
buy home heating oil this winter.  I believe we must be creative 
and help where we can in the days ahead.  The Minister of 
Finance, it is rumoured, may move in the weeks ahead on this 
aspect.  As well, the minister has stated that the issue of the 
GST being charged both on the wholesale price and retail price is 
eminently worthy of further examination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard from my constituents in the trucking industry about 
the rise in diesel fuel costs.  I recognize that truckers are an 
important part of our economy.  I know the trucking industry is 
aware that the rack price for diesel is up about 105% from a year 
ago.  The rack price is the wholesale price a refiner charges for 
fuel sold directly to trucking companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the same time period, the rack price of gasoline is up 65%. 
This will impact not only on truckers' wallets, but also on those 
of all consumers.

</I></B></P><P align=left>School bus fleet owners have contracts in my riding of 
Lambton—Kent—Middlesex.  Based on a 50 cents per litre gasoline 
cost, they are losing money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers are also being hit by higher prices. It is costing them 
$20 an acre more to put in a crop of corn because fuel costs 
increased by 97% between May 1999 and March 2000.  In good 
farming years that $20 an acre was often all that was left over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Predictions of a colder winter than usual will certainly 
increase the use of home heating oil and natural gas.  This past 
February the sudden cold snap along the eastern shores of Canada 
meant that the demand for middle distillates increased.  Home 
heating oil was one.  As people turn up the heat in their homes, 
some of the crude that would go to diesel is diverted to heating 
oil.  Gas retailers will tell us that there is less profit and 
volume in diesel and that the only significant user of diesel is 
the trucking industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time it should be understood that the increase in 
the price of diesel fuel in Canada is almost totally attributable 
to the rise in the world crude oil price, which has more than 
doubled over the past.  Of all the increases in the pump price of 
diesel, only about a half cent per litre is related to federal 
taxes, namely the GST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, GST revenues have not increased dramatically because 
most diesel is used by businesses that recover their GST through 
the input tax credit mechanism.  For example, in January the GST 
input tax credit effectively offset the pump price for diesel. 
The same applies for businesses using gasoline where the GST has 
resulted in a one cent per litre increase at the pumps. Again, 
most commercial users recover the GST they pay through the input 
tax credit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has the lowest excise tax on diesel fuel in the G-7 at 4 
cents per litre and the second lowest excise tax on gasoline at 
10 cents per litre.  The federal excise taxes on gas and diesel 
fuels are fixed.  They do not fluctuate with price changes.  That 
is important to note.  Even when the excise tax is combined with 
the GST, total federal taxes on diesel are par with the United 
States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must address the issue of competitiveness at the federal 
level.  This motion disregards and overlooks the larger 
perspective.  Taxation on gasoline is but one element of a much 
greater examination of public policy.  Governments have a 
responsibility to use the means at their disposal to ensure that 
consumers are protected and true competition exists.  Our caucus 
committee firmly recommended that the preservation of true 
competition is the most important aspect in the protection of the 
interests of the Canadian consumer. 
<P><A NAME="LINK236"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay—Boundary—Okanagan, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Madam Speaker, in listening to the hon. member, I 
could not help but note that she said “We in government are 
responsible”.  Never have truer words been spoken.  From what we 
have heard, the government's big concern, if there is a tax 
reduction, is where it will go, to the consumer or to the rich oil 
companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to remind the government of the figures that I used in my 
speech earlier on.  These are the facts.  Over an 18 year period 
the price of the gas component of gas taxes has gone down 25% in 
real dollars.  The price of the excise tax component, or the 
total tax component of the price of gas, not just federal but all 
governments, has gone up 57%.  These are not Canadian Alliance 
facts, they are Statistics Canada facts.  When the member says 
“We in government are responsible”, those facts certainly 
support what she says. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like the member to comment on the fact that not 
only has the hon. member for Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge, who is 
sitting beside her, been on a task force, but so has the hon. 
member for Ottawa Centre, who spoke earlier.  He was on a 1990 
all-Liberal task force while in opposition studying municipal 
infrastructure.  That task force recommended that there be a 
dedicated commitment of fuel tax revenues to highway 
infrastructure, a commitment that suddenly slipped out of the 
Liberals' minds when they became the government.

companies but whether we can trust the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur:</B>  Madam Speaker, it is interesting that 
in the debate today we are debating whether the taxes have gone 
up or whether the cost of crude oil has gone up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member mentioned the taxes and whether governments will 
follow through, provincial or federal.  I would like to share an 
example with my hon. colleague.  Not too long ago we had the AIDA 
program.  The federal government reviewed the criteria and felt 
that additional dollars were available and that a negative margin 
should be covered.  It moved unilaterally in Ontario because 
Ontario was not fixed to go ahead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the kind of rhetoric we hear when the national 
government wishes to move ahead and the provincial government 
does not follow. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK237"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, the hon. member 
has given us an argument in explanation of the government's 
refusal to lower the excise tax by 10 cents a litre.  We are 
told “The government is prepared to do this, but only if the 
provinces are also prepared to discuss doing so, and to do it”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot see how this argument, which strikes me as more of a 
pretext, relating to the absence or presence of provincial 
co-operation would ensure that this tax would no longer serve to 
add to the profit margin of the companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government says “If we proceed unilaterally, we fear 
the benefits will end up in the companies' coffers”.  But is 
there not the same risk if it is done along with the provinces? 
In my opinion, it is not because the provinces are involved that 
this obstacle, the risk that the profits will end up in the 
companies' coffers, will be avoided. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the hon. member explain this logic?  It strikes me as 
more of a pretext used by a government that is actually thinking 
“If I am going to go short of revenue, the provinces have to as 
well”.  This is bad logic. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur:</B>  Madam Speaker, I guess my response 
will go back in the form of a question.  Is this hon. member 
really saying or can he suggest to us that the province of Quebec 
will be there for the consumers like the Liberal Government of 
Canada?

<P><A NAME="LINK238"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
it is an honour for me to speak on this issue.  I have discussed 
the cost of gasoline in my region, a vast region in Quebec, on a 
number of occasions over the past few months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find the opposition motion rather timid.  The Canadian 
Alliance is saying that taxes should be cut by 50%.  We all 
agree that taxes should be lowered.  It is important to lower 
taxes in order to help families, especially in vast regions such 
as that of Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They forgot to do one thing that I have been doing for several 
months, and that is to speak about it in the House of Commons, 
to table bills and motions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On February 29, I tabled a motion—it will not happen every four 
years because it was on February 29, it will happen every year—in 
which I said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should make 
sure that all service stations display the base price per litre 
of gasoline or diesel at the pump, free of the federal and 
provincial taxes. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On February 16, I gave a speech on the price of gasoline. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On April 12, I tabled Bill C-476, an act respecting the posting 
of fuel prices by retailers, without taxes.  What counts is the 
consumer filling up at the station.  One day, Camil Aubé of 
Val-d'Or said to me “Guy, that costs too much.  Lower the 
taxes”. 
He was right, and what counts is for consumers to have their 
say.  It is the most important point in today's debate.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I rise today in the House, there are people who are at home, 
listening to us. What is the price of a litre of gas? The 
government is being criticized because of the taxes, but not the 
oil companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give you an idea of what makes up the price of a litre of 
gas in Val-d'Or, in the Sullivan area, and explain how things 
work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the consumer filling up this evening in Val-d'Or, Sullivan 
or Dubuisson will pay 81.9 cents a litre. The federal excise tax 
is 10 cents, and the provincial road tax 10.55 cents. Back home, 
we do not have to pay the Montreal tax, which is 1.5 cents. We 
do not have that tax. 
There is also the GST, which is 4.8 cents, 5.33 cents. This 
means that, out of the 81.9 cents, there is 30.68 cents for 
taxes and 51.22 cents for fuel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do we not post a price of 51.22 cents on the signs? Prince 
Edward Island lowered its taxes, but the very next day the oil 
companies raised the price of oil. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should post the gross price, because when consumers walk into 
a store, they know that, if an item costs $17, it means $17 plus 
taxes. Why not do the same thing with oil companies and majors? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give another example using this price of 81.9 cents a 
litre. Let me tell you how much retailers operating in Abitibi, 
where gasoline sells for 81.9 cents a litre, pay for each litre 
of the gasoline delivered to them. 
It costs 67.22 cents, including 10 cents for excise tax and 
10.55 cents for Quebec's road tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the Canadian Alliance not know that every year the oil 
companies give bonuses to all gas stations: Petro Canada, Esso, 
Ultramar or Shell?  If a retailer sells 1.5 million litres of 
gasoline at his station, he will have a nice little Christmas 
present of 1.2 cents for every litre sold over 1.5 million.  If 
he does not sell 1.5 million, he will receive 1 cent for what he 
sold during the whole year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, I have here a confidential invoice from a retailer 
in my region. It shows that Petro Canada charges an amount for 
participating in the RRP.  It comes to 14 cents and something, 
fourteen tenths of a cent, but RRP.  Is this Shell's or Petro 
Canada's “régime de retraite des patrons” or employers' pension 
fund?  We do not know.  I am keen to find out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nunavik is a large area of Canada. 
It is the only riding in Canada with villages and communities 
above the 60th parallel.  This evening, as we speak, a litre of 
gas costs $1.10.  Of that, 30.4 cents is for taxes and the oil 
companies get 79.6 cents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spoke about the oil companies this afternoon, with Charlie 
Alaku from Kangiqsujuag, Adamie Alayco from Akulivik, Magie 
Emudluk from George River, and Pita Aatami.  This is what is too 
bad and what the Alliance does not mention in its motion.  The 
oil companies have to be put on the spot.  We have to tell them: 
“Wake up.  Advertise exactly what you are charging for a litre 
of gasoline”.  We will look after the taxes.  Quebec, Ontario 
the provinces or the government will look after the taxes.  But 
we have to wake the oil companies up.  They are ashamed to 
advertise the real price of gasoline. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any event, I received many letters. 
I have one from the Minister of Finance in which he writes “I 
would like to begin by pointing out that there is no federal 
excise tax on fuel oil for home heating”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do people realize how much profit the provinces are making at 
this time on oil, gas and fuel?  Fifteen billion dollars.  How 
much for Canada? Perhaps $4 or $5 billion.  I have a precise 
figure here, which I will give.  In 1998-99, Canada made 
$4.267 billion on gas, and $437 million on diesel fuel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Looking at the 2000-01 budget for the province of Quebec, last 
year it got $1.559 billion in fuel tax.

<A HREF="#LINKT84"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is important, at any rate, is that the federal government 
made $4.5 billion and the provinces $15 billion.  I am not 
complaining about the provinces, but I am saying that we pay one 
way or the other. We pay for gas, and we pay taxes as well.  Yet 
why do the damned oil companies not display the price without 
tax?  They are afraid to.  The chairmen of their boards are 
afraid to tell people what the price of a litre of gas is, and I 
cannot understand this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have letters here from Petro-Canada, stating that the price is 
confidential.  I have one from the Office de la protection du 
consommateur du Québec.  I have filed a complaint against 
Petro-Canada in fact. 
It rejected my complaint in February saying “No, we will send 
you to Revenu Québec”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Revenue Québec wrote me, and this is 
what is interesting, that “We know that this business practice 
is common among retailers selling gasoline in Quebec and that 
they do not indicate the gasoline tax separately on any document 
of sale.  In this regard, the Quebec department of revenue is 
flexible and does not require retailers to comply with the 
provisions of section 12 if they wish to sell gasoline”.  Take 
note: governments give orders but do not apply them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come back to the oil companies.  They are listening to us 
today.  Their political attachés are sitting and listening to 
us.  They are right to listen, because I am angry with them, I 
am hopping mad and consumers are too.  Every president of every 
company is listening, their political attachés and their 
secretaries. 
I say to them “Wake up.  Display the price per litre of gasoline 
before taxes”.  That way, we will have respect for the companies 
and we will know how much money they make.  But they better wake 
up.  This is important.  They better wake up for consumers. 
This is not the fault of governments.  Government deserves 
respect, but I oppose oil companies that do not display the 
before tax price per litre of gasoline. 
<P><A NAME="LINK239"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquière, BQ): </B>Mr. Speaker, I 
listened carefully to the Liberal Party member.  I think he has 
just given us all the solutions his government ought to put 
forward but fails to put forward. It has the power to take 
action but does not.  Why?  The member has said that the 
government has powers it is not using. I have a question for 
him.  I belong to a coalition which is defending consumers 
against gasoline price increases.  We have been bringing 
pressure to bear for a year and a half now.  We have boycotted 
Petro-Canada and now it is Ultramar.  People in my riding no 
longer go to Ultramar and they did the same with Petro-Canada.  I 
ask my colleague this:  If tomorrow morning we were to tell the 
Canadian government to suspend its excise tax and its GST and to 
tax the oil companies' profits, would he agree? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy St-Julien:</B> Mr. Speaker, the member has made a very 
interesting comment.  We are here to find solutions.  Today I 
looked at the price of gas at the Canadian Tire on Talbot.  It 
is 79.4 cents a litre.  It is important to talk about the oil 
companies.  Petro-Canada has a sign posted near one of its pumps 
pointing out that taxes account for 51%, but does not indicate 
whether this 51% is being levied by the provinces or the 
Canadian government.  This is misleading advertising on 
Petro-Canada's part. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come back to the hon. member's question.  It is a very good 
one and it is together that we are going to find solutions.  We 
must.  Right now, Canada's Minister of Finance is trying to find 
solutions.  It is also important that they come not just from 
him but from all provincial finance ministers as well as those 
in the territories and Nunavut. 
<P><A NAME="LINK240"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Serge Cardin (Sherbrooke, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
carefully to the speech by the Liberal member for 
Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik, in which he referred to a notice of 
motion that he presented to the Standing Committee on Natural 
Resources, on February 29, 2000.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That motion was relatively timid, particularly since I had 
tabled one on February 10, 2000, which went a lot further. That 
motion read in part: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—to identify and recommend, as soon as possible, concrete means 
to fight the abusive increase of petroleum product prices and to 
regulate petroleum product prices on a permanent basis. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That document was tabled on February 10. It listed very specific 
measures, but the Liberal majority rejected it. Today, the 
member said that the Canadian Alliance motion was timid. It is 
timid, but it is based on important values. 
Some people pledged to increase the tax to fight the deficit. 
There is no longer any deficit. We have a surplus. Now, we must 
remove that tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there is the issue of double taxation. This is also an 
important principle. Even if the Canadian Alliance motion is 
timid, the fact is that it is a wake up call for the government. 
The motion of the member for Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik is a big 
to-do about nothing. It is like the elephant labouring to bring 
forth a mouse. 
<P><A NAME="LINK241"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
believe the hon. member for Sherbrooke did not understand.  We 
have no elephants in my riding of Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik, just 
caribou and moose, and that is important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one thing the hon. member has not understood.  At 
present, the price of gas in Sherbrooke is 83.9 cents a liter. 
It is 81.9 cents in Abitibi.  This evening I am addressing the 
truckers in Montreal, those who are at home tonight.  In 
Montreal, Lucien Bouchard's provincial tax is 15.2 cents.  How 
can it be that diesel is 16.2 cents, or one cent more, whereas 
we are collecting 10 cents everywhere on gas and 4 cents on 
diesel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a cent more for truckers on Montreal Island, who pay more 
than all others.  I agree, we must find solutions together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is how we are going to work.  One day we will win out, and 
we will be winning for the consumer, ourselves included. 
I have appreciated their speeches.  They have put as much effort 
into it as we, and sometimes the message does not get across. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The important thing, it is true, is that we work together as a 
family, but one day the government is going to have to get our 
message, and the provinces as well.

every other day of the year, but on this day let us have ours. To 
try to confuse the issue by doing what it did today is not being 
straightforward with Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people who have been phoning my office complaining about the 
price of gas and the tax on gas are farmers, people on fixed 
incomes, seniors, single parents and families struggling to get 
by.  They are looking for a break from government and members of 
parliament and here we are going around and around over some 
foolish issue that is not getting to the gist of the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People have been watching this debate today hoping something 
will come out of it to help them out at the end of the month. 
What have they learned?  What have they seen?  I do not think 
they appreciate very much what they have seen here today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our party is asking for two simple things.  One is to take off a 
temporary tax that was put on to eliminate the deficit.  Thanks 
to the same hardworking Canadians who phone my office asking for 
a tax break, that deficit has been eliminated.  Why is the tax 
still there when there is a $12 billion surplus?  Why is the tax 
there when the revenue from tax on gasoline this year is going to 
be $13 billion?  We are talking about billions of dollars flowing 
around and we cannot give hardworking Canadians a 1.5 cent per 
litre tax break on a tax that when implemented was to be 
temporary. This I am sure does not add up in their minds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other thing we are asking to be done today is that the 
compounding tax on a tax on a tax, the GST on the tax portion of 
gas, be moved down so it is only put on the portion of the gas 
from supply and production.  Do not be compounding tax. In the 
early days when the government tried to sell us the GST back in 
our other world, we said no. The government said it would not be 
compounded and here it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are the two things we are asking for today.  I have no 
idea where all this other stuff came into the debate today. That 
is the gist of our motion.  We were hoping for support from all 
sides of the House for Canadians who get up every day and wonder 
where the heck they are going to get an extra $10 a month to fill 
their tanks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to gasoline, we are talking about diesel fuel that 
truckers use to haul the supplies around the country, the 
supplies that feed us, clothe us and house us. Every time the 
price of fuel goes up, every commodity that travels on a train, 
in an airplane or on anything that burns fuel goes up in price. 
Would it not be nice if we could take the temporary tax off and 
give consumers a break, but here we go around and around in some 
wrangling way to try to confuse the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I give full credit to the member for Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge. 
He is a member of the House for whom I have a lot of respect. A 
lot of people on all sides of the House have a lot of respect for 
him because of the stance he is taking.  He has taken on a lot of 
issues. This is a real good piece of work that he and his 
colleagues have done.  After what I have seen today I am starting 
to question that kind of action on a simple straightforward 
motion such as we brought forward today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A year ago in a minority report that we attached to the report 
on the safety net programs for farmers that the agriculture 
committee was looking at, we asked the government to lower the 
input cost to farmers because again there is a compounding 
effect.  It raised the price of all the products produced.  It 
raised the price of shipping grain, shipping the products to 
market, the retail aspect of it and moving them around the 
country.  We asked if the government could do that to help lower 
fuel costs to help reduce farmers' cost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday I read an article that was in the <I>Western 
Producer</I>.  Statistics Canada said that in total 26,200 fewer 
people are working in the agricultural industry in western Canada 
on the prairies this fall than there were last fall.  Why is 
that? That should be of no surprise to anybody. The farm 
community is hurting and it is not only the farmers.  I am 
talking about the farm community and the industries in the cities 
that support the agriculture industry.  For that to get shovelled 
by is wrong.

agricultural community that it has to address.  It has to lower 
the input cost to producers.  This is just one example of what 
the fuel tax is doing.  The government has not done that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some 26,200 fewer people are involved in farming this fall than 
last fall.  That is a crime.  I am a little embarrassed to say 
today that I was involved in the House when all this wrangling 
was going on, when Canadians were looking for a solution and did 
not get one.

<A NAME="LINK252">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK253"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.)</B> moved that Bill 
C-318, an act to require the establishment of national training 
and certification standards for trades that receive 
apprenticeship training, be read the second time and referred to 
a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, it has been a long road to get to the 
point where we could bring this issue to the floor of the House 
of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a nutshell, let me just explain the principle.  We have a 
situation in the country where apprenticeship training does not 
rise to the same standards that we see in other countries around 
the world.  I will go into some details to give a comparison, for 
example with Germany. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet we have young people right across Canada who are looking for 
opportunities that may not follow in what is perhaps some of the 
more popular areas today such as IT, high technology or something 
of that nature. 
They are interested in working in construction, in building 
trades, at being plumbers and at being carpenters.  They are 
working with their hands.  They also require a great deal of 
technological training today, unlike our forefathers from several 
years ago when the latest technology was not available.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think there is a fundamental problem in our society that led 
me some three and a half years ago when I arrived on Parliament 
Hill to draft a private member's bill.  It was not easy, I might 
add, to get the bureaucracy in Ottawa to even agree to draft it. 
I will go into the reasons for that in a moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wanted to draft a private member's bill telling young people 
that if they became apprentices, if they received a ticket for 
whatever trade they wished to pursue in the province of Ontario, 
and if they received an opportunity to work in that trade in the 
provinces of Manitoba, British Columbia, Alberta or Newfoundland, 
they would be able to do that.  Their apprenticeship ticket or 
licence would be recognized equally in every province, territory, 
region, municipality, village and community in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sadly that is not the case today.  It came as a great surprise 
to me to find out that we did not have the necessary procedures 
in place to allow for the mobility of our young people to ply 
their given trade across the country.  I did some research.  I 
met with people in the trade labour movement, particularly in the 
building and construction trades, to find out why this was. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was informed that we have a system called the red seal system 
for registering trades.  There is a copy of it here.  It is 
fairly extensive.  It covers 44 trades across the country.  The 
principle is that if one receives a red seal designation it 
should therefore qualify one as an apprentice anywhere in Canada. 
One of the fundamental problems, and I think this goes to the 
heart of our constitution, is that not all provinces and 
territories recognize all 44 of these trades with the red seal 
designation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly some of the more obvious ones, mechanics and cooks or 
jobs of that nature, are recognized in most of the provinces but 
many are not.  I would also submit to the House that there could 
be more than 44 trades involved in apprenticeship training across 
the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was surprised when I arrived here to see the resistance from 
the bureaucracy.  I asked what the problem was and was told that 
it was not federal jurisdiction.  I asked the bureaucracy to help 
me understand.  I argued about it.  I understood that we had 
entered into training agreements and labour agreements with 
provinces and were at that time currently negotiating with the 
province of Ontario.  We had agreements on the table with other 
provinces, but I am not talking about delivering the service of 
apprenticeship training.  I am not talking about the actual 
physical educational process that might take place in a 
combination of learning on the job in the workplace and then 
attending a community college in my province or some other 
learning institution in other provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to interfere in that.  I happen to believe that 
the delivery of education is better handled by the provincial 
governments in co-operation with the school boards and with other 
training associations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We may get involved, and do indeed with HRDC funding, in many of 
these areas where we will provide some money for these training 
institutions and directly channel that money to the young people 
who are taking the training.  We do that all the time.  In fact, 
we have seen hysteria in this place by members opposite about 
some of the funding from HRDC that has gone out to help these 
young people.  That hysteria has caused a great deal of 
difficulty for those young people.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to interfere in provincial jurisdiction.  There 
are those who support my bill, and I am going to share with the 
House who some of those people are.  In addition to some members 
here, the critic from the NDP party from Winnipeg has been a 
great supporter and a believer in it.  It is supported by other 
people in most of the provinces, if not all, in many of the 
ridings and communities represented by members on both sides of 
the House.  I normally get a little partisan, but this is not a 
partisan issue.  This is about our young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot for the life of me understand why my own government, if 
it is opposed to, or the people opposite would be opposed to 
putting in place national standards for a young person who 
registers for a program or gets a job.  My own son is 25 years 
old.  He is a bright young guy.  He takes after his mother 
obviously.  He decided he wanted to be an apprentice electrician. 
He obtained a job.  He enrolled at community college for the 
educational portion of it.  Should he be able to work anywhere in 
the country?  He is a Canadian citizen born in this country, 
educated in this country.  He received an apprenticeship licence 
in this country but he cannot go to Quebec or he cannot go to 
Newfoundland because his ticket does not allow him that mobility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Frankly, not allowing that runs contrary to the social union 
contract which was signed by every province save the province of 
Quebec.  Let us think about that.  The social union contract 
called for mobility in educational activities across Canada.  It 
was signed by all the provinces except the province of Quebec. We 
understand the reluctance of Quebec to sign on to anything that 
would promote national unity or any kind of national activity. 
That is no surprise.  I am not surprised that the Bloc Quebecois 
would be opposed to this initiative in this private bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At first I was a little surprised to learn that Canadian 
Alliance members were opposed to it, but then I guess I 
understand that their vision of this country is to devolve all 
authority and all responsibility down to the provincial level. To 
use the term used by our Prime Minister, he said that they wanted 
to be a head waiter for the provinces, that that is the role the 
federal government would fulfil. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the Canadian Alliance would oppose this kind of 
national initiative because it runs contrary to their support for 
devolution of authority and power and the absolute dismantlement 
of the federal government because of their provincial views, very 
narrow views I might add. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask members to think about who has supported this bill.  This 
bill has changed titles because of the recess of this place, but 
it is the same bill with a different number.  It received support 
from business, received support from organized labour, received 
support from the educational community, and received support from 
numerous colleagues in this place.  It is a bill that has a 
vision attached to it that would benefit all young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Too often in our generation, those of us in this place, we think 
in terms of our sons and daughters becoming doctors and lawyers, 
becoming experts in certain fields of technology.  What will 
happen when the day comes when we can no longer get the workers 
we need to build the infrastructure, the workers we need to build 
the communities, the roads, the highways, the sewers, the 
waterpipes, the bricklayers?  In fact I have had an experience 
where a constituent of mine was attempting to get some 
bricklayers and he could not get them.  The union could not 
provide them.  Do members know where he had to go to find them? 
It was not to Newfoundland, not to Nova Scotia.  He had to go to 
Portugal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does it make sense if we have an opportunity to provide training 
and apprenticeships for our young people in Canada to learn how 
to become bricklayers, to make the kind of wonderful living that 
a good quality, well trained bricklayer can make, for us to be 
looking to Portugal to import workers?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously there are situations, and the trade labour movement 
will support this, where one-off projects require us to use our 
immigration system to go out around the world to find particular 
workers so that we can build a particular project that will 
indeed save, keep and create jobs for Canadians.  These are 
temporary worker permits and they are issued all the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would not happen overnight, but one of the ways we could 
solve these shortages would be to encourage our young people to 
become apprentices, to make them proud to become bricklayers, 
carpenters, electricians and plumbers.  Why should they not be? 
What honourable professions those are.  This place should reflect 
society and frankly, society has lost sight of the true honour of 
working in those professions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me share with hon. members a letter from the Canadian Labour 
Force Development Board supporting the original bill.  This is 
from Brian Skrogs, business co-chair, and Joe Maloney, labour 
co-chair.  This is a business-labour coalition, both sides of the 
spectrum.  In a letter to me they said “It is our pleasure to 
inform you that at our meeting of June 10, 1998 there was 
unanimous support for supporting the bill”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is bipartisan unanimous support from business and labour. 
That is a national organization.  It understands.  It does not 
have parochial views.  It is not concerned about constitutional 
matters.  It does not care about jurisdiction and who does what. 
It cares about having good quality opportunities available that 
will create the mobility right across the land of having young 
Canadians do apprenticeship work in every community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another letter is from the Building and Construction Trades 
Department, affiliated with the AFL-CIO which is a huge 
organization.  In a letter that went out to all members of 
parliament, it stated “We would urge the government to adopt 
this bill as government legislation.  Further we would ask all 
members to support this bill, either as a private members' bill 
or as a government bill”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Building and Construction Trades Department has offices here 
in Ottawa and it represents people right across the country. 
Once again it is not concerned about jurisdiction. What it wants 
to see is some national standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me add that what is most interesting is that we agreed in 
negotiations on the bill that we would adopt the highest 
standards in the land which I believe are from Alberta.  We would 
adopt the Alberta standards as national standards.  I am not 
being parochial and saying that it has to be Ontario's way. I 
want the best.  I want the best standards that are available to 
help our young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a letter urging that the government and all members 
support the bill from the Bridge Structural Ornamental and 
Reinforcing Ironworkers.  It is an international union.  This 
letter is to the federal minister of labour at the time from its 
international headquarters in New York City. It states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Approximately three years ago at the first ministers meeting it 
was agreed that they would relax certain interprovincial trade 
barriers, one of which was the mobility of labour.  However we 
now find ourselves in a virtual gridlock relevant to labour 
mobility due to the fact that certain provinces have red seal 
standards while others do not.  Therefore, I would once again 
respectfully request that you endorse the bill. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have dozens of letters from unions and business groups in 
every province right across Canada.  I have letters from 
Newfoundland, New Brunswick and from Ontario in abundance. One is 
from the United Transportation Union and states “I am pleased 
that somebody has finally found the wherewithal to introduce a 
bill that makes such plain sense”. And it does make plain common 
sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know there is opposition to the bill.  I am pleading with 
those who have decided not to support the bill to reconsider 
that. 
I appreciate those who are supporting it.  This is not 
partisanship.  This is not about nation building.  This is not 
about separatism or a national debate on Quebec. This is about 
our young people, about their future and their opportunities to 
pursue apprenticeship programs that will be recognized and 
effective from sea to sea to sea.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo—Alberni, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to rise and respond to the member 
opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First I would like to back up and describe what apprenticeship 
really means.  Actually there is some interesting history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The apprenticeship system for training trades workers is 
historic.  For centuries skilled trades people had an obligation 
to teach their craft to the young.  After an apprentice had 
satisfactorily completed the full term of training and had 
demonstrated his ability, he became a journeyman.  A journeyman 
means he could travel around from one job to another; hence the 
journeyman trade. This is what we are talking about here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My background is somewhat interesting. I went to Vancouver 
technical school.  I am disappointed that they have moved away 
from this but in those days, most of the school was trades. Heavy 
duty mechanics, auto mechanics, printing, sheet metal, carpentry 
were all started in grade eight.  In grade eight students made a 
decision.  They could go through a university course which was 
fine, but many of the students did not want to do that and they 
went into the trades. When they came out of grade 12, they were 
well on their way to being journeymen. They substantially 
shortened the timeframe and the young men and women were well 
trained and well on their way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am really disappointed that our education system has gone away 
from that.  I think we are missing a fair bit of the boat by 
trying to push everyone into the same mould and send everyone off 
to university when in fact we need plumbers, we need people to 
build our houses, we need skilled operators of various equipment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my background in forestry, I spent 25 years in the woods with 
large logging equipment.  A grapple yarder can cost over $1 
million alone.  An off-highway truck carries 100 tonnes of logs. 
One can understand the size of this equipment. We had an 
excellent apprentice training system in our heavy duty shop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not unfamiliar with the apprenticeship programs, but that 
is straying from the bill a bit.  We are not talking about 
apprenticeships because we all recognize that a good 
apprenticeship program is valuable.  What we are talking about is 
certification and who is going to run the boat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand why the member was having some difficulty 
introducing the bill.  Clearly it is provincial jurisdiction. 
That is where we are having some difficulty with it.  It is an 
overlap that is already covered by the provinces.  It is not only 
trades, it is doctors and dentists.  I am a professional 
forester.  It is foresters.  Provinces cover education. 
Provinces cover certification.  Why would we need a national 
standards program when we already have in place provincial laws 
that deal with apprenticeships? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree that there needs to be more interaction between industry 
and the provinces.  The red seal where people can travel from one 
province to another needs to be improved.  I recognize that. 
However I and my party do not think the answer is a national 
standards program for apprentices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On that basis we reject the provisions in the bill because it is 
clearly duplication.  In effect it is almost another way of the 
big federal government wanting to edge in on the provinces' 
authorities.  That is the reason we have some difficulty with the 
bill.  It is not apprenticeship at all.  That is not the issue. 
The issue is certification and who is going to run it. Therefore 
we will not be supporting the bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les 
Basques, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I somewhat have the impression that 
I am repeating myself by speaking to this bill, Bill C-318, the 
purpose of which is to establish apprentice training and 
certification standards that will be recognized Canada-wide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must remember there was an epic battle in Quebec in order to 
reach an agreement on manpower, so that Quebec, and not the 
separatists or the sovereignists, but all of Quebec in total 
agreement including the provincial Liberals, the Action 
démocratique du Québec and, obviously, the Parti Quebecois, 
which forms the government of Quebec, along with all the social 
stakeholders, to enable Quebec to recover jurisdiction over it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, with respect to Bill C-318, I am a bit surprised that we 
have to have this debate once again. 
We must remember—and this is the same example we had in health 
care—that the government of Quebec had to fight for more than a 
year to obtain recognition of the jurisdictions in health care 
so that, in the end, with the support of Ontario, the federal 
government would agree to sign an agreement respecting their 
jurisdiction over health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, on the subject of manpower training, recognition of 
training, this looks like a repeat to us, as if the Liberals are 
afflicted with the malady of always wanting to meddle in 
provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the member says that it is not a national issue, I say to 
him that it is at least a jurisdictional issue and a matter of 
efficiency. 
The provinces already have responsibilities in the area of 
training.  In Quebec we have already come a long way on this. 
When the bill speaks of setting up a national apprenticeship 
organization with a mandate to set training and qualification 
standards for the trades they apply to, it is clear that this is 
duplication of the work that can be done in the individual 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this regard, additional bureaucracy will be created.  Just 
imagine.  We all know about the efficiency of government 
bureaucracy. 
In the area of human resources development, we saw how effective 
the federal government could be. We saw how, when it comes to 
taking concrete and day to day measures, this government could 
end up making a mess, being terribly inefficient and totally 
missing the mark. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why should we add another area where federal public servants 
would evaluate how apprenticeship training is carried out in a 
province, and end up before the courts seeking legal opinions on 
jurisdictional issues, when everything is clear? As the member 
pointed out, already, in some areas, the provinces can 
voluntarily adhere to standards that are recognized from province 
to province. So why add an area in which the federal government 
has no expertise, no jurisdiction and no knowledge? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the member feels that it is absolutely necessary for the 
federal government to be responsible for these things, he should 
seek a constitutional change so that the whole issue of manpower 
training and education would fall under federal jurisdiction. But 
Quebec would never agree to that of course. The jurisdiction over 
education is one of the main reasons why Quebec entered the 
Canadian confederation in 1867. It was a sine qua non condition 
to going ahead and signing that pact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since then, we have realized that this jurisdiction over 
education should be extended, to allow us to take effective 
action in the whole area of manpower. 
There is absolutely no question of backtracking now.  Three years 
after Quebec took over manpower training, after a more difficult 
beginning but where there is now practical, functional 
interaction between the parties to the satisfaction of local 
communities, it would be very inappropriate to now go back to a 
system where the federal government decides on the relevance of 
training given in Quebec or Manitoba. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member seems to be confusing “national” with “federal”. 
The federal parliament is not the boss. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Oh, oh.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude by saying that this bill, which came about 
because of the goodwill of a member who thought that there must 
be a simpler way to do things, has not taken into account the 
context of jurisdiction, of how things operate in Canada, and 
still seems to view the provinces as branch offices of the 
federal government.  This they are not—they are their own 
entities, with jurisdictions that must be respected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Canadian government does indeed have major problems in 
this area, if it needs major structural changes in order to be 
able to fulfill its international role as a federal government 
when signing international agreements, then I have one that can 
be concluded rapidly: that the federal government, Canada and any 
provinces prepared to do so conclude an agreement, while Quebec 
as a sovereign country may assume its full responsibilities and 
be a presence on the international scene like the Canadian 
government, for those agreements desired by the people of English 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As long as we are living in the Canadian system as it exists at 
present, with responsibilities given to each province, it would 
be totally inappropriate, insufficient and the source of major 
duplication, to be putting money into such a duplicated system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is certain that there is a huge surplus on the federal level, 
and perhaps they are looking for ways to use it without having to 
give it back to the taxpayers.  There is nothing better for 
raising a government's profile than having money available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the present case, however, it would be doing a disservice to both 
Quebecers and Canadians to impose such a double structure on 
them.  I hope this idea will die on the order paper today and 
that we will have the assurance in future that such backward 
thinking will be not repeated, with its reference to a philosophy 
far different than the one that has guided manpower agreements, 
that is devolution.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
there is not much in this world that I know a lot about, frankly, 
but this is one subject on which I actually do have great 
personal knowledge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a journeyman carpenter myself and for many years I 
represented carpenters as a union leader and I did get to deal 
with the issue of labour market training a great deal.  I can 
honestly say that the very worthwhile bill put forward by the 
member for Mississauga West absolutely meets a need in industry 
that was plain and obvious to me, and to anyone who has ever 
actually had experience in the industry that I represented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the members from the Alliance said that apprenticeship 
was an ancient tradition, and he is right, but it goes back even 
farther than he said.  It can be traced back to the ancient 
Babylonian code of Hanurabi, which was the first written 
reference of a need or an obligation for skilled workers to pass 
on their skills to the next generation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think anybody who I have heard speak so far has any 
problem with the model of apprenticeship.  In fact, most people 
spoke glowingly about what a suitable method it was for the 
communication of craft trade skills and what a necessary aspect 
it was of any human resources or labour market strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where we find faults and what the industry has been telling us 
for years is that labour market training and the apprenticeship 
systems in this country are like a patchwork quilt.  Virtually 
every province has its own way of doing things, its own 
curriculum, its own entrance requirements and its own 
certification methodology.  As a result, as the member for 
Mississauga pointed out, mobility has really been threatened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A carpenter who took his or her apprenticeship training in Nova 
Scotia cannot just move to Alberta when there is a boom and work 
there because it is a different set of skills.  The employers do 
not know what they are getting as there is no standardized 
curriculum.  Even more important, the customers of the 
construction industry service do not know what kind of a quality 
job they will get because there is no standardization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For years now within the building trade but also beyond, for 
instance, in the auto industry, the piping trades, any place that 
has apprenticeship training as an aspect of the work environment, 
there has been a call for national standards, to somehow pull all 
these diverse groups working in isolation across the country 
together under one kind of central committee, a central umbrella. 
We can call it what we want.  I see that the hon. member, in his 
bill, calls it NATO,  national apprenticeship and training 
organization.  We used to throw around the term NATAC, national 
apprenticeship and training advisory committee.  Whatever we want 
to call it, it should be a forum where business, labour and 
government could sit down, compare notes, develop standardized 
curricula and a standardized set of rules for the delivery of 
training without interfering in the provincial jurisdiction.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been aware that this would be a sore point, especially 
with the province of Quebec.  We knew that we would meet 
resistance there, but no one is talking about the federal 
government or any national agency interfering with the delivery 
of the service.  All we are asking for is a consultation forum 
where a group in the province of Quebec, for instance the CCQ, 
the Commission de la construction de Québec, would be represented 
on this national organization.  They would say “In our province, 
our entrance requirement is that one has to have grade 10.  It is 
a four year program and the curriculum looks like this.  How does 
that compare with your program in Manitoba?”.  If there are any 
problems then those two would have to be aligned to guarantee the 
ease of mobility so that Canadian workers could work anywhere in 
Canada and Canadian industry could be assured that they were 
getting a known commodity when they hire, and I will use the 
example of a carpenter because that is my trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Apprenticeship as an education model is so well-suited for even 
today's new industries, even the high tech field, because the 
people who are involved are not really students.  They have an 
attachment to the workforce.  They actually have a job so they 
are earning while they learn.  It is a model that we believe 
should be expanded far beyond the 44 current trades in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One hon. member mentioned Germany.  The country of Germany has 
440 apprenticeable trades.  People can apprentice in almost any 
discipline they can think of.  The regimen is outlined in a clear 
way.  They would get a certification so that they could actually 
call themselves a skilled <I>x</I>, <I>y</I>, or <I>z</I>, whatever 
occupation they happen to apprentice in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that having these national apprenticeship and 
training advisory committees, or NATO committees, in each of the 
apprenticeable trades would not only serve the needs of industry 
in providing highly skilled workers of a predictable known 
quantifiable level of training, but it would also help to promote 
and expand the whole concept of apprenticeship in a much wider 
way than currently is enjoyed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am terribly disappointed that the government has not seen fit 
to adopt this idea.  We have a minister of human resources but we 
really do not have a national human resources strategy because we 
have offloaded that to the provinces.  Some people say that is a 
good thing and some people are not as pleased with that, but at 
least the federal government should still see that it has a role 
in ensuring that the delivery of training, which has been signed 
over to the provinces through various labour training agreements, 
is at least being taught with a certain set of standards so that 
they would know they are getting proper value for their 
investment into labour market training if for no other reason. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the government has missed the boat.  I believe it is 
not only not listening to the member who put the bill forward, it 
is not listening to industry.  It is not listening to key 
industrial sectors that very much want this.  This idea did not 
just come out the blue.  The member did not just wake up one 
morning and say “I think we should do this”.  We are making an 
effort to meet a demand by the building trades industry, which is 
the largest single employer in the country.  The construction 
industry and certainly the auto industry, any of the industries 
that have sectoral councils or are dealing with labour market 
training other than post-secondary education, are very interested 
in this model. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I raise the sectoral council, I believe there is a 
precedent for the federal government to have a role in setting 
national standards and that is the model right there.  In the 
auto industry, for instance, there is CARS, which is a tripartite 
group made up of labour, business and management.  They get 
together and not only set curriculum, they can talk about other 
things.  They can talk about forecasting the labour market needs 
in that sector and what the intake should be of new people into 
those skilled trades to meet their anticipated needs. It brings 
together the actual stakeholders in the training around one 
central table.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would not be a costly factor either.  In our dialogue with 
industry most industries have pretty much accepted that they will 
have to dig into their pockets to fund this sort of thing sooner 
or later.  There was not much opposition to some kind of a 
training levy being put forward to actually run the nuts and 
bolts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the federal government would really have to do is create the 
environment.  The funding source could be some kind of a joint 
labour-management contribution in some models.  That is what we 
did in our union.  Every hour that a carpenter worked he paid 10 
cents into a labour market training fund which was matched by the 
employer.  We would then use that money for the training of our 
members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the province of Quebec they have things figured out in a 
better way with their 1 per cent training levy which employers 
willingly pay so that they can count on a high level of labour 
market training for the workers they very much need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a precedent for this type of thing with the sectoral 
council.  There is a need and a demand, as clearly articulated by 
industry sectors.  The government has missed the boat in choosing 
not to support this very worthwhile bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we did have the type of national standards that we are 
talking about, perhaps more young people would be motivated to go 
into the skilled trades, the apprenticeship trades.  As was 
pointed out, there can be very high paying, satisfying careers in 
the skilled trades. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We often get this blue collar stigma where people are not 
willing or this kind of a feeling that one only goes into the 
trades if one drops out of mainstream education.  There are 
satisfying careers, highly skilled workers in these fields and 
great entrepreneurial opportunities that come out of the skilled 
trades.  Once one achieves a certain level of proficiency as a 
bricklayer or as a carpenter one can hang out a shingle and hire 
two or three friends, and all of a sudden we have another small 
business starting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For these and all the other good reasons this bill should have 
been deemed votable.  It should have been passed and in fact it 
should have been picked up by the government and introduced as a 
government side bill.  My compliments to the member for 
Mississauga West for bringing forth this important issue for 
debate, if for nothing else. 
<P><A NAME="LINK257"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, it is certainly a pleasure to speak to this bill today. 
It is always enlightening to sit in the House and hear the 
different points of view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Actually the hon. member for Mississauga West has almost started 
a mini constitutional debate here with this issue.  We can see 
from the philosophical positions of the speakers how they accept 
or reject this approach.  In general, if one agrees with a strong 
central government with national standards for everything like 
health care, education and training, then one would support this 
bill.  Personally I do not see how we cannot support the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, if one does not agree with a strong central government 
and believes that we should have a country with an array of 
strong provincial governments, with no real strong central 
government, I suppose one could oppose it.  I would certainly 
support it and I admire the energy and initiative of the hon. 
member in bringing it forth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I happen to live at the intersection of three provinces: Prince 
Edward Island, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick.  I have always been 
involved with the trades one way or another.  I will list some of 
them:  plumbing, electrical, welders, carpenters, mechanics, body 
shop repair and parts.  These are all trades that require 
apprenticeships or some form of training.  The standards for 
these three provinces change so that there is no mobility from 
one province to another in a very small area.  We are talking of 
the radius of maybe 100 kilometres at the most where the three 
provinces intersect and the rules change.  The rules are 
different for each trade.  A set of national standards as 
proposed by this bill makes imminent sense to me.  It would 
certainly help in my specific area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If one wants to employ or train someone in the trades, the 
present system is to begin most likely through the community 
college in a town called Springhill, Nova Scotia, or there is 
another community college in New Brunswick, the Moncton Community 
College.  Again, two provinces, two sets of standards and a 
different level of education from both of them.  The trades 
people graduate.  They have their diploma, but still they are 
trained in different ways with different standards.  Again this 
bill would address that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I personally believe that a bill such as this one would help in 
a lot more ways than just uniform standards.  As the last speaker 
mentioned, he said it would motivate other standards in these 
fields.  I think that is true.  If these trades had national 
standards they would achieve a better level of recognition and 
legitimacy for a lot of people who might not think it is a good 
place to go or might not be inclined to go in the direction of a 
trade when all the pressure is on to go into high tech, IT 
technology training and things like that, or to go on to 
university. 
Maybe they would rather do a trade but because of the image it 
has or may have in their own mind they may not want to do it. 
However, if it has national recognition and national standards 
they would be more inclined to do it.

<A HREF="#LINKT96"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such a program would enhance the community college system.  This 
is a very important and is a critical element of the educational 
process.  Not everybody will be a computer whiz or go into the 
high tech industry.  The community college systems, in my 
opinion, have always been deprived of the recognition they 
deserve and the money they deserve.  All the focus has been on 
university and other high tech forms of education.  Community 
colleges really play a key role.  They are the forum of education 
that best trains people for a specific job.  I have often felt 
they are underutilized and under recognized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, such a set of standards would raise the level of standards 
itself.  As the member said, they would accept the highest 
standard in the land for each trade.  How could we go wrong with 
that?  There has to be good positive results from this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly, just the fact that we could have uniform standards 
across the country is good.  We are famous in  Atlantic Canada 
for exporting our most valuable asset.  Atlantic Canadians are 
going to other parts of the country because job opportunities in 
Atlantic Canada are not like they are in some other areas. 
National standards would expedite that process but it would also 
expedite the process for them coming back at a later date, which 
is what we all want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In general, this is a very practical and good bill.  I totally 
support the bill because of my personal hands-on experience in 
everything the bill stands for.  I believe the bill should 
receive approval and I am sorry it is not votable.  If it was I 
would be voting for it and I am sure my party would be as well.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Raymonde Folco (Laval West, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, allow me 
first to praise the work of the hon. member for Mississauga West 
on the subject of apprenticeship and training, because his 
efforts were motivated entirely by his interest in ensuring the 
preparation of qualified workers and an effective apprenticeship 
system established for industry workers and the economy of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Skilled workers are in demand.  Canadian workers must be able to 
take advantage of these opportunities.  We cannot ignore that. In 
addition, workers must have access to these jobs, regardless of 
where they are located in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada on the other hand has a responsibility 
to contribute to the supply and the mobility of skilled workers 
so that Canadians may play their part in a growing economy. This 
must not, however, prevent us from taking into account the 
political realities of our federal system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Allow me to reiterate the remarks recently made by the Prime 
Minister in Berlin.  He said that the Canadian model is based on 
the recognition of diversity, on a mix of cultures, on a 
partnership of people and government, and that the system creates 
a balance between individual freedoms and economic prosperity and 
shared risks and benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This balance must not be forgotten in the consideration of this 
bill and more particularly in the search for a better way to 
achieve the objective of this bill, namely the ongoing training 
of Canadian workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This explains our discussions with our provincial and 
territorial counterparts and consultation of employers, union 
groups, educators and community organizations.

force mobility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our unique federal system, apprenticeship has developed under 
conditions specific to each province or territory, reflecting 
our major geographical and climatic differences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians should in fact be able to take advantage of all 
opportunities offered, regardless of where they live.  The most 
indicative measure in this regard was the establishment, 
recently, of the Canadian Apprenticeship Forum, which brings 
together the principle spokespersons of the training community in 
the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The primary objective of the forum is to promote cohesion and 
co-operation among the interested parties.  It includes 
representatives from business, manpower, the teaching and 
training sector, organizations promoting equal opportunity on the 
labour market, the Canadian Council of Directors of 
Apprenticeship, the Interprovincial Alliance of Apprenticeship 
Board Chairs and, obviously, Human Resources Development Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The general mission of the forum is to set out the bases of an 
apprenticeship training system in order to establish a skilled 
and mobile workforce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This group represents a new stage in the evolution of 
apprenticeship.  In fact, provincial and territorial 
jurisdictions over apprenticeship are not only respected, but 
extended to the benefit of all Canadians, and especially young 
people looking for a profession. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am happy to add that Human Resources Development Canada is 
providing a three year budget of $1.9 million to this group to 
defray operating costs.  This, in my opinion, is a valuable 
investment in our future labour force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other quality forums continue to receive funds from us, for 
example the Canadian Council of Directors of Apprenticeship, 
which manages the red seal program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The interprovincial red seal program defines national 
performance standards for 44 trades in Canada and interprovincial 
certification. The term “interprovincial” is important, because it 
means that these workers will be able to practice their trade anywhere in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada is also working closely with employer 
groups and sector councils to identify labour force shortages 
and find ways to remedy them.  In Canada, some 20 sector 
councils are continuing their efforts with a view to training 
the current labour force and preparing future workers in their 
particular sectors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are very confident about the upcoming announcement of the 
creation of a national council in the construction sector, which 
should be a strong motivation for people in the industry.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that the hon. member wishes to contribute to an 
inclusive and prosperous Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, as I have shown, there is a strong risk that the 
wording of this bill would lead to duplication of existing 
measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The best approach is to work with the provinces and territories 
to achieve the goal we all share, which is to do what is 
necessary to make Canada's labour force the best in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that the member will join with us in these efforts.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I recognize the hon. 
member for Mississauga West for his right of reply. 
<P><A NAME="LINK266"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, let me say first a profound thank you to all the members 
from all parties who stayed here late, through the royal assent 
journey down the hall and then back here, to discuss what I think 
we all agree is an extremely important issue.  We may not agree 
on how we are going to implement apprenticeship training across 
the country, who is going to do it or what the standards will be, 
but certainly I did not hear anyone from any party stand up and 
make derogatory comments toward apprenticeship training programs. 
We know there is tremendous benefit to be had for our young 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also recognize that with my private members' bill having been 
deemed non-votable at committee some months ago, there is a 
tendency to assume that this is a bit of a waste of time. I do 
not think it is because it is important that members in this 
place put forward their views and their parties' views. I heard 
three truly national parties, the New Democrats, the Progressive 
Conservatives and of course my party talking about national 
programs.  I heard what I would call two regional or provincial 
parties, the Bloc Quebecois and the CA talking about protecting 
the interests of the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not against protecting the interests of the provinces and 
working with the provinces, as the parliamentary secretary has 
called for, to deliver training programs.  I just fail to 
understand, and will look for other ways to skin the cat if you 
will, why anyone who has any kind of a national vision would 
object to providing standards that are accepted right across the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would recognize high school diplomas across Canada.  We 
certainly recognize university degrees across Canada.  We 
certainly recognize skilled medical trainees across Canada.  Why 
we would not recognize apprenticeship in the same way as we 
recognize those perhaps sends a message as to how our society 
feels, tragically and unfortunately, toward those particular 
trades.  I hope that is not true, because we should value those 
trades and the young people who make decisions to build careers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to finish by touching on one aspect which my hon. friend 
from Winnipeg mentioned and that is the entrepreneurial 
opportunities that are failing to be recognized.  I have worked 
with young entrepreneurs for the past year and a half in 
developing a task force report to implement programs within our 
government that will help young people build their own careers 
and businesses.  As my hon. friend pointed out, what better way 
to create new businesses and new opportunities than to help 
people get the technological skills needed to build the 
infrastructure, the buildings and roads, the cities and 
communities, the community centres and everything else to help 
people build careers for themselves.  They will create jobs. They 
will build families and generate children within those families 
who will go on in careers and apprenticeship training as well in 
the building trades. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I still believe, notwithstanding that my bill is not votable and 
that it effectively dies on the order paper, it is an extremely 
important debate that we have had here. I thank all members who 
participated for putting forward their vision on this very 
important issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  The time provided for 
the consideration of private members' business has now expired. 
As the bill has not been designated as a votable item, the order 
is dropped from the order paper. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It being 6.30 p.m., the House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 
10 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
