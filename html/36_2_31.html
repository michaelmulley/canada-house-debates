<A NAME="LINK13">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House instruct the Standing Committee on Justice and 
Human Rights to conduct a study of organized crime, to analyse 
the options available to Parliament to combat the activities of 
criminal groups and to report to the House no later than October 31, 2000. 
</UL>
<P><A NAME="LINK14"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères—Les-Patriotes, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
on a point of order. I would simply like to draw to your 
attention that my hon. colleague from Berthier—Montcalm will be 
sharing his time with our colleague from Saint-Bruno—Saint-Hubert, 
and thereafter all members of the Bloc Quebecois will be doing 
the same, for the rest of the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> Is that agreed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B> Mr. Speaker, the debate we are going to 
have in this House today is an extremely important one.  Members 
will agree that on an opposition day the matter debated is 
usually the one the opposition feels is most important at that 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could easily have discussed the constitution today, with all 
the things that are going on across the floor of this House and 
with the Prime Minister's desire to pass legislation that will 
provide a framework for Quebec, a framework for certain things 
that fall under its exclusive jurisdiction, and which the people 
of Quebec alone can decide in connection with its future.  We 
could have discussed the constitution, but the Bloc Quebecois 
preferred to address another matter which is, without a doubt, 
the most important one, not only today but probably in the next 
century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is truly important that today people become aware of the 
existence of a major problem in Canada and in Quebec: organized 
crime.

<A HREF="#LINKT1"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our motion is one of open-mindedness. With this motion, the Bloc 
Quebecois is reaching out not just to the government opposite, 
but to all parties in this House. We are asking all the parties 
in this House to conduct a serious and non-partisan study, as we 
are capable of doing and as we have done in the past, of 
important issues such as organized crime, with the sole 
objective of finding a solution to a serious problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the problem? Why does the Bloc Quebecois think the 
problem is important enough to take a day in the business of the 
House? Why does it want to try to convince the government and 
the other opposition parties to join it and adopt a motion 
asking this House to instruct the Standing Committee on Justice 
and Human Rights to conduct a study of organized crime and to 
make proposals, if necessary, after listening to witnesses? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why? Because in recent years, and particularly since 1995, a 
number of events show the magnitude of the problem and the 
urgent need to take action. Since I only have 10 minutes, let me 
briefly remind the House that in 1995 young Daniel Desrochers 
died following the explosion of a bomb. I am sure the hon. 
member for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve will talk about that incident, 
because it happened in his riding. The explosion was related to 
a biker gang war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997, two prison guards were gunned down in cold blood.  It 
would appear from the information we have that the shooting was 
related directly to organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Very recently, as if that were not enough, colleagues in this 
House have received death threats.  The member for 
Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot is one, because he dared to criticize the 
growing of marijuana among corn plants, a practice going on in 
his riding, and to defend the farmers in his riding.  He 
strongly criticized unacceptable activities and received death 
threats. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was looking at statistics before coming here.  Between 1994 
and 1998, there were 79 murders and 89 attempted murders 
connected with battles among biker gangs in Quebec alone. 
However, this problem is not unique to Quebec.  It occurs in all 
the other provinces as well, but I did not have statistics for 
them this morning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talk of murder and attempted murder, but there are also arson 
and bombings.  Over the same period, there were 129 cases of 
arson and 82 bombings.  This is from RCMP sources, which are no 
doubt reliable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of drugs, what is the value of the illegal drug trade 
at the moment in Canada?  This is a little more difficult, 
because the calculation is based on drug seizures.  Naturally, 
seizures account for only a part, and we have to extrapolate to 
get a total value.  They say illicit drugs in Canada are worth 
between $200 billion U.S. and $500 billion U.S.  That is a bit of 
money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why I am saying the subject is very important. 
Probably the most important issue in the next millennium will be 
an effective response to organized crime, because at the rate of 
$200 to $500 billion U.S. annually, it will not be long before it 
controls almost everything in Canada.  We must therefore give 
thought to whether the legislation before us will do the job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois began a broad consultation in June, which it 
stepped up in September.  We have met with many stakeholders: 
police officers, judges and law enforcement officials. 
It is clear that our present tools may not be up to the task.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the motion we are introducing this morning is to 
ensure that all parties become aware of how extensive a problem 
organized crime is and of the shortcomings of our current 
legislative tools, as we have come to realize. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The police will say they need bigger budgets.  And in fact, when 
we look at the last few years, we see that, despite its protests 
to the contrary, the government has cut, or is getting ready to 
cut, police budgets and the budgets of certain RCMP offices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> Even in Saint-Hyacinthe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B> My colleague from Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot 
will certainly talk about it in his speech. There may a lack of 
funds, but the issue goes beyond that and we must take a serious 
look at all the legislative tools available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking of legislative tools, the issue of witness and jury 
protection immediately comes to mind. Are jury members 
adequately protected , since they must decide whether an accused 
is guilty or not while all his friends are sitting in the front 
rows, staring at them throughout the trial? This is very 
intimidating. It is not surprising that we have difficulties 
finding people willing to sit on a jury and follow the rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there are the witnesses. 
Do we provide adequate protection to witnesses? We should check 
to see if we do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Building a case is one of the major problems faced by police 
officers. They have techniques to infiltrate crime gangs, but 
is it enough? Should we not review certain provisions in the 
Criminal Code to allow undercover officers, as they are commonly 
called, to commit criminal acts to be on the criminals' good 
books and eventually be in a position to testify? This is an 
extremely complex area, but we must take a look at the whole 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must improve the exchange of information between the RCMP, 
the Sûreté du Québec and various departments, because police 
forces complain that communications are very bad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could spend another hour discussing this issue, but my time is 
almost up, so I know I have to wrap up. 
I will conclude by urging all members of this House to forget 
about the fact that this is a motion from the opposition, from 
the sovereignists in this House, because we are simply asking 
that the committee conduct a serious study of the whole issue of 
organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am asking members to overlook that fact and to vote with the 
Bloc Quebecois so that a serious, non-partisan study of the whole 
issue of organized crime can take place, and that a report be 
submitted to the House no later than October 31, 2000. This 
would allow us to begin the new millennium with good tools to 
fight organized crime effectively.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to start by congratulating the hon. Bloc 
Quebecois member on this motion.  It is very important for 
Quebec, for the country, and for each and every Canadian.

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member has identified many of the problems we are 
facing.  He has laid out quite accurately the level at which 
organized crime has crept into many Canadian communities and many 
different levels of society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The threat is so real for our law enforcement agents. They are 
particularly vulnerable because of the cutbacks they have 
undergone.  Their salaries are not on par with some other sectors 
of society and they themselves in essence can be bought.  The 
member talked about how law enforcement agents themselves may be 
infiltrated.  Could the member expand on that element of his 
remarks? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He quite rightly says this is a non-partisan issue. I certainly 
assure him he will get the support from the Conservative Party of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What particular elements of funding does he see as being the way 
to address the issue?  What elements will help bolster our law 
enforcement agents and help address the problem of infiltration 
by organized crime which is buying off our officers, or at least 
posing that threat to officers in Canada today? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
thank my colleague from the Progressive Conservative Party for 
his question and take note of the fact that it will probably 
support this morning's motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His question is an extremely complex one and a response would 
take more than the time available to me this morning.  As far as 
infiltration is concerned, with $200 billion to $500 billion 
U.S. yearly, organized crime can certainly buy people off, 
including members of parliament and ministers, not just police 
officers.  I do not think that any individual or group is 
protected from organized crime trying to buy them off at some 
point in time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have as much confidence in the political system as I do in the 
justice and law enforcement system. 
Both Quebecers and Canadians have certain values, and cannot be 
bought off as easily as that.  It must be realized, however, 
that this is a risk in Quebec and Canada at this time, and we 
need to see whether the legislation is sufficient protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I spoke of infiltration, one of the useful tools in law 
enforcement is infiltration of criminal groups.  At present, 
with the legislation available to us, it is extremely 
complicated and difficult for police officers to infiltrate such 
groups.  For one thing, they need years to move up in the ranks 
of organized crime until they reach the decision makers, the 
kingpins. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am saying this morning I hope that, if the Standing Committee 
on Justice and Human Rights considers this question, it will 
look very carefully at legislation enabling the police to 
infiltrate criminal groups in order to discover whether there is 
a way to help them do so.  In this case, would society agree to 
an amendment of the Criminal Code to enable those infiltrating, 
the undercover officers, to commit acts that are illegal under 
the Criminal Code so criminal groups will consider them 
criminals? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The police tell me they have “officer-sources” within certain 
criminal groups.  When a gang leader has doubts about the 
loyalty of one member, do members know what this person is asked 
to do?  He asks them to go and kill someone.  Under the Criminal 
Code, this person is a criminal, at the moment.  There is no way 
this person can be exempted from the application of the Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, this person is in a tough position.  If he does not 
kill anyone, his days are likely numbered.  If he does, his days 
are likely numbered as well, because he will be treated as a 
criminal under the Criminal Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Has society reached a point where we will authorize an 
undercover officer, with all the proper authority, to go so far 
as to commit a crime, to go so far as to commit murder in an 
effort to protect society and save tens or hundreds of people, 
perhaps?  I think we have reached this point, and we must 
examine the issue in committee.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Bruno—Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to speak to this motion by the Bloc Quebecois to the 
effect that the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights 
should study organized crime in Canada, an issue I am deeply 
interested in, and which the Bloc Quebecois has entrusted to my 
colleague from Berthier—Montcalm and myself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems obvious to us that organized crime is on the rise in 
Canada and the rest of the world. These organizations are said 
to be octopus-like for good reason. With tentacles extending into 
all segments of society, they have no problem finding people to 
carry out their dirty jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that many are lured into crime by the temptation of easy 
money. To maximize their efficiency, criminal organizations 
impose the law of silence, and any transgression means death, 
immediately and unconditionally, for the informers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should acknowledge that the various levels of government have 
taken steps to deal with organized crime. The Carcajou squad in 
Quebec comes to mind, as well as the new sections in our 
criminal law that make it illegal for five people and more to 
associate when two of them have already been convicted for 
crimes that are punishable by five years in prison or more. 
These initiatives have some merit, but the question that begged 
to be asked when they were taken and still today is whether they 
are enough. The only possible answer is no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problems remain, and I will mention some hurdles that still 
exist: gang leaders often have only minor offences on their 
record. The judge has then to be convinced of the danger that 
these people represent for society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The effectiveness of orders issued under Bill C-95 to prevent a 
gang member from associating with other gang members is 
questionable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Belonging to a bikers group is not a criminal offence per se. 
Also, it is not easy to prove beyond any reasonable doubt that 
the accused has accumulated his fortune through a series of very 
specific and identified criminal offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also the law of silence governing all relationships in 
the underworld; search warrants that are restrictive because of 
the courts interpretation of the provisions of the Canadian 
Charter of Rights; small police budgets compared to resources 
available to criminal groups; the difficulty to assert that, 
simply by associating with them, a person is really involved 
with other individuals for a criminal purpose, since organized 
crime is not considered a crime, and only individual actions 
are; the banking secret of tax havens, which protects against 
the laundering of proceeds of crime. All in all, organized crime 
does not know any boundaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The necessary measures should be taken by our economic and 
commercial partners, otherwise all attempts made to solve the 
organized crime problem will fail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, all legislative or other measures should have an 
impact on every organized crime group, from the Russian mafia to 
the Chinese triads, the Italian mafia and biker gangs. All 
measures taken against any of these groups would only create a 
vacuum that would immediately be filled by the other 
criminalized groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why our recommendations must take into account what is 
done outside Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Generally, anti-gang laws seek to improve the tools law 
enforcement and judicial authorities are provided with to fight 
organized crime. I will give a few examples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Hong Kong and Russia, access to proof is made easier. 
In the United States, laws were enacted on specific infractions 
committed by organized crime. It should be noted that, in the 
case of the recycling of products of crime, the Canadian law is 
more efficient than the American law since it allows 
confiscation after the first designated offence instead of two, 
as is the case in the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important, in comparing Canadians laws to those of other 
countries, to remember that Canada draws inspiration largely 
from the British common law, which makes its judiciary system 
quite different from those of other countries.

<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can question the effectiveness of the legislation passed by 
all these countries in light of the fact that organized crime 
continues to operate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Little data is available on the actual impact of such 
legislation on organized crime. In any event, I want to talk 
briefly about a legislation whose effectiveness and limits have 
been demonstrated, namely the “Racketeer Influences and Corrupt 
Act”, also called RICO, which was passed in 1970 and which 
creates four offences covered under two definitions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first offence, called “racketeering activity”, is a criminal 
offence that covers 50 crimes, such as extortion, robbery, 
arson, kidnapping, fraud, counterfeiting, and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second one is the “pattern of racketeering activity”, which 
consists of at least two of the criminal offences covered, one 
having been committed after the enactment of the RICO, and the 
other one over the preceding 10 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is a short description of the four offences I previously 
mentioned and whose purpose is to prevent the infiltration of 
companies by criminal groups. It has to do with the investment 
or the acquisition of an interest in a company that is doing 
business in another country or another American state, through 
capital derived directly or indirectly from criminal activities 
or from the collection of an illegal debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It could also be the participation in or the management of, 
through a series of criminal activities or the collection of an 
illegal debt, of a company doing business overseas or in more 
than one American state by an individual who is either employed 
by or associated with the company, or a conspiracy to commit one 
or the other of these offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The maximum jail sentence for these offences is from 20 years to 
life and there are also monetary fines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no need for a criminal conviction to launch legal 
proceedings under RICO. The state needs only prove that crimes 
were committed. Once the suspect has been convicted, he or she 
can be sued under RICO's provisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>RICO allows for the confiscation of goods obtained through the 
illegal activity and of all interests in the business concerned. 
There is also a protection and redress mechanism for third 
parties affected by the confiscation of goods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>RICO also allows for two types of civil remedy: one for the 
government and the other for individuals. It enables the US 
District Courts to issue orders at the request of the Attorney 
General. For the government, these remedies are: dispossession 
of all direct or indirect interests of the individual in a 
business; restriction of future activities or investments by the 
individual; dissolution or reorganization of the business, 
except that in that case, the court must take into account the 
interests of third parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Racketeer Influences and Corrupt Act provides individuals 
with the following redresses: damages amounting to three times 
the victim's loss and the right to be reimbursed for all the 
court and lawyers' fees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In spite of its huge shortcomings and of the fact that it is far 
from perfect, the RICO Act is an illustration of a jurisdiction 
that used exceptional means to achieve its aims. The committee 
members could build on the positives results of the RICO Act and 
avoid its drawbacks and shortcomings to give Canada the 
appropriate legal instruments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To conclude, I want to mention that it is important to make the 
public in Quebec and Canada, the lobbies and the government 
aware of this problem so that nobody can slip through the 
dragnet and the fight against organised crime can be effective. 
This is why I ask all members of this House to support this 
motion today so that the Standing Committee on Justice and Human 
Rights and parliament can contribute in a constructive way to 
the debate and give the government a clear indication of the way 
to fight this scourge in our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally I move:

debating in the House.  My party will be supporting the motion 
tonight when the vote is held. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have travelled around the country as the chief justice critic 
for the Reform Party.  I have talked to municipal police, the 
RCMP, provincial police forces and people in our armed forces. 
One of the great concerns they have is that we do not have a 
national police force dedicated to organized crime.  Would the 
Bloc support looking at setting up a national force dedicated 
only to organized crime?  It would work at the municipal level, 
the provincial level and the federal level to get to the bottom 
of what is happening in the country on this very serious problem 
of organized crime. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am glad to hear that the 
Reform Party will be supporting our motion this evening.  The 
way things are going, I have the feeling that a vote will not 
even be necessary, given that the entire House seems to agree 
with us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As to whether we would support a national force dedicated 
exclusively to organized crime, here again, it all depends on 
our understanding of the word national, and on whether national 
standards would be imposed on police forces across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that there are differences throughout the country, even 
in organized crime. 
There are differences in each province, each region.  I also 
think that, so far, police forces have helped each other out. 
We saw this in Quebec with the marijuana raids.  RCMP and Sûreté 
officers have worked together to eradicate marijuana.  This 
co-operation is of several years' standing and should be 
continued.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, could the 
member from the Bloc talk a little more on the effects of 
organized crime on women?  It is an aspect that is often 
overlooked. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne:</B> Mr. Speaker, if I understood correctly, 
the hon. member is wondering about the effects of organized 
crime on women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that most, if not all, pimps are part of organized 
crime.  It is therefore directly related to prostitution, of 
course.  I think that all of Canadian society suffers the 
effects of this scourge, which unfortunately keeps on growing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, there are side effects.  Women are affected by organized 
crime.  Families are destroyed, couples break up because one has 
to put up with what the other is doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Something must be done and today gives us an opportunity to 
debate the issue and to decide that we, as parliamentarians, 
will make it our business to do that something, and instruct the 
Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights to examine the 
problem and to submit a report with effective and timely 
recommendations.

Mr. Speaker, I congratulate my colleague, who is also a member of 
the justice committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She has made several remarks about information sharing, or 
perhaps in some instances the lack of information that sometimes 
is shared between law enforcement agencies.  Would she agree that 
what is needed most at this time is some leadership within the 
solicitor general's department to get these two agencies working 
closer together, that is, CSIS and the RCMP? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne:</B> Mr. Speaker, my hon. colleague from the 
Progressive Conservative Party is absolutely right, since 
members of these two organizations have already said themselves 
that they were competing with each other. Surely they were often 
asked for a much closer involvement and co-operation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the solicitor general, who is here at present, will 
certainly be able to approve what we are asking for and what I 
believe he himself supports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I once again thank our Progressive Conservative colleague, who 
also mentioned that he would be voting for this motion tonight.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I wish to inform you that I also intend 
to share my time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion before the House today is one of great importance. It 
touches each and every Canadian, in fact it involves everyone 
around the world.  The problem of organized crime is one that has 
no borders.  Organized criminal groups do not even have to 
operate in Canada to have victims here.  Simply put, organized 
crime is a global problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has made great strides in the fight against 
organized crime.  We recognize it as the government's number one 
law enforcement priority.  We have worked with other 
jurisdictions to provide enforcement agencies with more and 
better tools to fight organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the recent Speech from the Throne the government repeated its 
commitment to fighting organized crime to make our communities 
safer places to live.  The RCMP plays a key role in the fight 
against organized crime.  In fact, for the first time ever, the 
RCMP recently created the new position of deputy commissioner in 
charge of organized crime investigations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government also recognizes that in the war on organized 
crime no level of government can act alone.  Many levels of law 
enforcement and government are involved in protecting public 
safety.  That is why fighting organized crime in a co-ordinated 
way is the key priority, indeed it is essential.  In recent years 
the federal government has taken many steps in partnership with 
the provinces and territories to help the police in its fight 
against organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians know that this government has a longstanding 
commitment to provide safe communities.  Our efforts to fight 
organized crime have been and continue to be comprehensive and 
wide ranging. I would like to outline some of the examples of the 
initiatives we have taken since 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The anti-smuggling initiative introduced in 1994 provides 
resources for the RCMP, Justice Canada and Revenue Canada.  It 
targets smuggling and distribution networks at the border, in our 
ports and across the country. This initiative has led to 17,000 
smuggling related charges and fines totalling over $113 million. 
This year the federal government injected another $78 million 
over four years to fight smuggling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Money laundering is another major part of organized crime.  That 
is why we created 13 integrated proceeds of crime units in 1997. 
These units bring together police, government and outside experts 
to target organized criminal groups and seize their ill-gotten 
gains.  Over $110 million has been collected so far.  Simply put, 
these units are designed to take the profit out of organized 
crime.

<A HREF="#LINKT8"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In April 1997 the government put forward a strong anti-gang 
bill.  These changes to the criminal code make participating in 
criminal organizations an indictable offence punishable by up to 
14 years in prison.  Also, amendments made to the Corrections and 
Conditional Release Act prevent people convicted of organized 
crime offences from getting accelerated parole review. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In May 1997 this government passed legislation to control 
illicit drugs.  We modernized our approach to drug control with 
innovative police techniques for money laundering and drug 
investigations.  These developments toughened Canada's 
enforcement efforts and in particular, undercover investigations 
directed at high level drug traffickers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Criminal Law Improvement Act adopted in 1997 established new 
provisions in the criminal code to allow police to conduct 
undercover anti money laundering operations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>New telemarketing fraud offences were created by the amendments 
to the Competition Act last March.  These offences are now 
considered enterprise crimes.  This means that they are within 
the scope of the criminal code scheme for seizure and forfeiture 
of proceeds of crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the House will recall, DNA data bank legislation was given 
royal assent last December.  Since then the RCMP, working with 
partners, has been busy setting up the system.  They expect to 
have it up and running by June 2000.  Canada is breaking new 
ground in establishing this national data bank.  It will have 
great implications for law enforcement in the new millennium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The national DNA data bank will help to identify suspects more 
quickly and speed up criminal investigations.  It will shorten 
trials and lead to more guilty pleas.  One important application 
of this technology is to clear innocent people who have been 
wrongly convicted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last April I announced $115 million to rebuild the Canadian 
Police Information Centre, known as CPIC, with modern computer 
technology.  A crucial improvement will be in the ability to 
share information more widely in a more timely manner among 
police, prosecutors, courts, corrections and parole.  It 
complements the work of the provinces and territories which are 
themselves investing in improved information sharing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>CPIC will be replaced with a modern computer system for 
improving information sharing with other law enforcement 
agencies, provincial and federal databases.  This translates into 
more crime prevented or solved, or a better co-ordination of 
action against organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Five months ago I announced approximately $15 million for the 
RCMP to fight organized crime at Canada's three largest airports, 
Vancouver, Montreal and Toronto.  As a result, there are now 100 
more RCMP members to increase federal policing pressure to target 
organized criminals who use these airports to get into Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In September 1996 the Solicitor General and the Minister of 
Justice hosted a national forum on organized crime that brought 
together the police, federal and provincial governments, the 
private sector, the legal community and academics.  At that time 
it was clear that Canada needed a more co-ordinated approach to 
fight organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is precisely with this in mind that this week in Vancouver 
the Minister of Justice and I will meet with our provincial and 
territorial colleagues.  We will be discussing the challenges 
posed by organized crime and what more we can do collectively to 
deal with the problem.  It is only by continuing to work 
effectively in partnership with other levels of government, the 
law enforcement community and others that we can put in place the 
arrangement needed to protect Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no easy solution to this problem.  That is why I am 
pleased to support this motion before the House.  As I have said, 
this government has identified organized crime as its top law 
enforcement priority.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have brought together provincial and municipal governments. 
We have discussed possible solutions with our international 
partners.  We have sought the views of those in the law 
enforcement community across Canada and around the world.  We 
recognize that in the fight against organized crime we must 
gather our forces and involve as many people as possible to find 
the solution. That includes bringing the matter before the 
Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Organized criminals target the most vulnerable in our society 
and they make victims of us all. We owe it to Canadians to bring 
our resources together to fight organized crime. 
<P><A NAME="LINK22"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate that the government supports this 
motion.  I look forward to getting it to committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The solicitor general covered a lot of things the government is 
doing including the new organized crime directorate.  One of the 
problems is that the directorate is sitting there with no staff 
and bodies.  As the solicitor general knows, the RCMP is not 
meeting its par levels in most of the major detachments in 
Canada, which is a serious problem.  Where is he going to get the 
money to put the bodies in charge to work with this organized 
crime directorate to alleviate that situation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will mention one case from the early nineties.  There was a 
great operation called Green Ice which was a co-operation of 
eight countries around the world on drug enforcement.  It 
targeted the Columbian cartel and it was very successful.  It 
seized $47 million U.S., 140 bank accounts and a lot of arrests 
were made. There was a lot of publicity about how good that was. 
The Columbian cartel's profits are estimated at $30 billion U.S. 
a year.  That whole operation got two-tenths of 1% of what the 
Columbian cartel does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was one good operation but it only touched two-tenths.  To 
solve this problem we not only need the organized crime 
directorate but we need a national police force dedicated to 
organized crime.  Would the solicitor general be prepared to talk 
with the provincial premiers, justice ministers and solicitors 
general across the country to put together a national police 
force on organized crime?  It would be dedicated to this one 
issue and would work with municipalities, provinces, all police 
forces and the armed forces to get to the bottom of the organized 
crime problem in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lawrence MacAulay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the 
concern of my hon. colleague from Vancouver. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The deputy commissioner in charge of organized crime and 
investigation is an important initiative to co-ordinate our 
efforts.  My hon. colleague is also aware there is a review 
before treasury board and the RCMP to evaluate all the resources 
for the RCMP. That will be dealt with in co-operation with the 
RCMP, treasury board and my department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. colleague is also well aware that the Speech from the 
Throne indicated that this government is certainly aware and has 
indicated it is a priority to support the RCMP more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I indicated, we have made many moves to put many initiatives 
in place.  The 13 proceeds of crime units are so important 
because they take the profits out of organized crime. My hon. 
colleague is right that we do not get it all, but we are 
organizing in a proper fashion to make sure we have a 
co-ordinated effort in order to fight organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is fully aware that we do not fight organized 
crime just with this government.  We must fight organized crime 
with provincial and municipal governments.  That is why I will be 
meeting with people in Vancouver. I will have the input of 
provincial and municipal leaders from across the country which is 
very important. 
<P><A NAME="LINK23"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby—Douglas, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the solicitor general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He is going to Vancouver.  I want to appeal to the minister not 
just to go to Vancouver but to go to Burnaby as well. I represent 
a group of constituents in the Metrotown area of Burnaby who are 
absolutely fed up with the failure of this government to respond 
seriously to a very significant problem, a crisis in that 
community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Drug dealers are openly defying the law in the Metrotown 
Skytrain area. 
People are abusing immigration laws and the criminal code.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister says he is studying the situation, that he is 
looking into it, that he is going to treasury board.  This is not 
good enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Kamloops previously pointed out that an 
organized crime investigation was shut down because a couple in 
his constituency were told that the RCMP did not have the 
resources to deal with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the minister goes to Vancouver, will he meet with people 
from Burnaby?  The Burnaby RCMP have identified this as a very 
serious problem.  There is a total lack of resources.  Will the 
minister take his responsibility seriously and respond to this 
crisis? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lawrence MacAulay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, my hon. colleague is 
wrong.  I did not say we were just studying this.  In fact, if he 
had listened to what I had to say, I indicated a large number of 
initiatives that the government has taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I did indicate on the resource review was that my 
department, along with the RCMP and treasury board, conducted a 
study to make sure that the dollars that will be spent, our tax 
dollars, British Columbia tax dollars, Canadian tax dollars are 
spent in a co-ordinated fashion.  This will enable us to fight 
organized crime in the most efficient manner possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why the proceeds of crime unit, the DNA data bank, the 
$115 million for CPIC were established, so that we would have in 
place the best technology possible enabling us to share 
information with police forces across the country.  These are 
very important initiatives which have been taken by the 
government.  We are not just studying; we are taking action and 
have taken action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Before we resume 
debate, I want to make an explanation on questions and comments. 
I can see there is a lot of interest and there is some 
consternation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a Bloc supply motion.  If there are members of the Bloc 
who wish to ask other members questions, the Speaker would 
normally see the party whose motion is on the floor more often. 
If there are members who have been in the Chamber all day wishing 
to ask a question, the Speaker will very often see those members. 
I will ask for the questions and responses to be short because 
there is a lot of interest.  Very often the Speaker will see 
critics or people whose portfolios are specific to this issue. 
<P><A NAME="LINK24"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Aileen Carroll (Barrie—Simcoe—Bradford, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I too would like to congratulate my colleague on the 
justice committee, the member from the Bloc who has brought 
forward this excellent motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion we are discussing this morning is one that deserves 
all of our attention. Organized crime is not a new problem in 
Canada but has been recognized as a growing one. It affects 
Canadians from coast to coast and it affects people in countries 
throughout the world. Whether it is a fraudulent telemarketing 
scheme preying on seniors in Montreal or a large shipment of 
narcotics through the port of Vancouver, organized crime 
manifests itself in many ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The word globalization has been used more and more frequently as 
the millennium draws to a close.  The development of computers 
and network technologies is creating a global revolution in human 
communication and commerce, but it is also creating new 
opportunities for crime that we must now address. In Canada, 
developing effective measures to deal with computer related crime 
has raised numerous challenges. It has required us to meet these 
challenges in ways that previous generations could never have 
imagined possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More and more we find ourselves looking outward to the 
international community in our search for solutions.  We look to 
our neighbours because we can learn from their ideas, from their 
successes and from their failures.  But there is more to it than 
that.  In a new environment of high speed low cost 
communications, we need policies and legislation and practical 
solutions that are compatible with those of our neighbours.  In 
the high tech environment, the list of neighbours with whom we 
must co-operate is much longer than it ever was in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We share crime control problems, not just with those countries 
with whom we share physical borders and trade links and with whom 
we share political and social beliefs, but also with those who 
are distant from us geographically and philosophically.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any country in the world with an airport, telephones, fax 
machines or Internet access may be a base for offenders targeting 
Canadians or a source of victims for Canadian offenders.  They 
could also serve as a haven for the concealment of evidence or 
illegally gained proceeds of crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Developments in the world of high technology create many 
challenges that we must now address if we are to maximize the 
benefits of globalization for our citizens, but at the same time 
protecting them from these risks that we are discussing here in 
the House today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will discuss four specific challenges facing Canada and its 
international partners in this area of high tech crime. First, 
the challenge that arises from the time pressures imposed by the 
rapid and highly volatile nature of computer communication. 
Those who investigate cases of high tech crime must be able to 
successfully locate the source of attacks and seize electronic 
evidence or proceeds of crime in an environment where these can 
be erased completely at the touch of a finger or moved cross 
national borders without detection or scrutiny. The challenges of 
law enforcement is to ensure that they are technically able and 
sufficiently resourced to locate criminals and preserve that 
data. The government has made it perfectly clear that we intend 
to provide the RCMP with the tools it needs to do the job in the 
fight against organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our challenge as legislators is more difficult.  It is the 
problem of creating laws that will ensure that national borders 
do not provide offenders with increased opportunities to hide 
their identity or location, or to conceal or destroy evidence so 
as to evade detection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another challenge relates to the creation of new rules. 
Traditionally the development of policy in the international 
community has taken place incrementally at a slow pace as 
measures are thoroughly examined and discussed until consensus is 
reached.  Consensus of course is still an essential ingredient in 
our approach, but we will find ourselves faced with a need to 
achieve it more quickly than ever before as we are able to 
successfully keep up with the rapidly changing technology while 
protecting our citizens and fostering a healthy climate for the 
traffic of information and commerce into the next millennium 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third challenge that I will discuss arises from the costs 
associated with law enforcement in this new global electronic 
environment.  Many of the obvious costs in detecting and 
investigating transnational crime are currently borne by national 
governments and agencies.  The governments' challenge, one which 
we share with industries and the private sector, is that of 
creating rules and practices which address all of the challenges 
that I have mentioned, but which also minimize the cost that 
governments must bear and maximize the degree of crime control 
that we can hope to achieve with our limited resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are further cost factors to be considered.  Many of the 
options open to us, such as requiring service providers to use 
particular types of technology or retain data for extended 
periods of time, offer effective law enforcement but at 
significant cost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Until relatively recently, cost implications would have been 
purely domestic policy questions, but in the present era of 
globalization it has become one of international trade as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must establish rules and practices to fight transnational 
crime that are economically fair and maintain a level playing 
field for communication industries that now operate already in a 
very competitive global milieu.  Imposing undue burdens on 
certain industries may well result in their relocating outside of 
our country and by so doing they will create safe havens for 
criminals who wish to abuse new communication and information 
networks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have undertaken a dialogue here in Canada with the private 
sector and we find it very willing to co-operate in preventing 
criminal abuse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are engaged, we are committed and we welcome the opportunity 
that this motion has brought to have this matter brought before 
the House Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights, of 
which I am a member.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I too agree with the Bloc motion.  It is way overdue. It 
is 1999 and the government came to office over six years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member opposite, more or less, talked about the issue of 
dialogue, consensus and going to committees about it.  Where I 
live, we are sick and tired of politicians saying that we need 
consensus, dialogue, studies and committees to review this issue. 
It is upon us and has been for well over a decade.  My community, 
which was a little farming community, now has prostitution and 
drugs like cocaine, heroine and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am curious as to what length of time the member opposite feels 
is appropriate to have dialogue, consensus, committee meetings 
and so on.  There are people on the streets today, I can assure 
her because I have been there many times, who are hurting and 
have been hurting for years.  They are sick and tired of this 
House saying that we need consensus, time and dialogue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Aileen Carroll:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not think we ought 
to interpret from my explanation of the need for consensus that 
this necessarily entails a slowing of a process.  It does not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my view, and I very strongly believe this, we create the very 
best laws for this country by thoroughly vetting the issues that 
have brought us to the process of wanting to create a new law. 
Consensus building is rooted in common law and common law is the 
tradition of the country.  It is not the tradition of the country 
to go shooting out with little study, little analysis and little 
comprehension of the essential issues with a response that 
creates a weak law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about an information era that we are only 
beginning to grasp on many fronts.  As it impacts on the issue of 
organized crime, we too in this area have to make sure that we 
have all of the information that is requisite in order to 
effectively defeat the very problems and the crimes that the hon. 
member from across the House wishes us to address.  We will do an 
excellent job.  We have an excellent justice committee.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
tell the hon. member who just spoke that the purpose of the 
motion put forward by the Bloc this morning is specifically to 
ask that a committee look into the matter so that all her 
concerns and fears can be discussed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not understand her point. I would like her to be more 
explicit, because what we are proposing this morning is that, 
all partisanship set aside, we meet in committee and consider 
the issue. We have proposed a deadline of the end of October 
2000, next year, one year from now, to do it. I wonder what part 
of the motion disturbs the hon. member. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Aileen Carroll:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am not disturbed.  I 
have no difficulties at all.  I did not want to imply a sense of 
being worried. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not disturbed. I am happy that we have time enough to 
address this issue and the other issues we mentioned this 
morning. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a justice committee at this time.  Having completed 
second reading in the House of the young offenders legislation, I 
know that on all sides of the House there is considerable concern 
that we take our time and adequately address those issues.  I 
know this is a major issue to the Bloc.  I would be most 
surprised to hear that the Bloc would wish us to drop that from 
the agenda in order to move on to another important matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of these things must be considered.  All of these issues and 
laws impact very much on our communities. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left> There are impacts on communities in Quebec and in Ontario. 
However it is necessary to address those issues step by step. We 
have to think and we have to consider. Of course, I am not 
disturbed, I am delighted.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to support the motion before the House today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do want to clarify a couple of things.  I find it interesting 
that the member opposite says that we do not want to go ahead 
with too little study on this issue.  I can assure her that this 
issue has been studied and studied to death.  I have reams of 
information if she would like to have it on drugs in this 
country, on trafficking, on organized crime and on the effects of 
heroin and cocaine on our lives and on our people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what is so disappointing about the House of Commons. We 
get into this place and someone says that we have to do a study, 
we have to take our time, we have to look at it and we have too 
little information.  The fact is, we have an abundance of 
information.  It is a matter for all parties in the House to act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see it from two different levels.  I wish the hon. solicitor 
general could hear some of these things.  He mentioned $50 
million to fight organized crime in airports.  At the same time, 
this is the government that disbanded the ports police.  Just 
exactly where does the government think drugs come into Canada on 
the west coast?   They come in through our ports.  Since the 
ports police have been disbanded the situation has become much 
worse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to fix the problem, the reaction by the government is 
to say, “We'll throw $50 million into fighting organized crime 
at airports”.  On the other hand, it disbands the ports police. 
That is not consistent at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is $78 million to fight smuggling.  That is nice, but on 
the lower mainland between Vancouver and Hope there are numerous 
open trails.  One in particular is called the Ho Chi Minh trail 
which I was on the week before last.  It is a smuggling trail. 
The police know about it.  I was with the police when we were on 
it.  I have been on it a number of times.  There are a number of 
trails, beaten down and four feet wide between Canada and the 
United States on which illegals come across, guns come across, 
money is laundered across, marijuana goes south and heroin and 
cocaine come north.  Seventy-eight million dollars would not even 
touch that area because we have a maximum of six RCMP officers, 
and one is an administrator, working on it.  It is just not 
enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister talked about proceeds from crime legislation. 
However, the proceeds from crime are not effective.  The 
solicitor general talked about how effective anti-gang 
legislation is but has refused to acknowledge, because I have 
talked to his people and the solicitor general himself, the drug 
cartels in prison.  The commissioner of corrections refused to 
even acknowledge it, but it exists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the national drug strategy that was put out by the 
PCs in the eighties, not too much was done as a result of that. 
Then we look at the national drug strategy that was developed 
last year by the Liberals and compare them, which I have.  They 
are virtually an overlay of one over the other.  Nothing has 
changed in their opinion. The problem is that a great deal has 
changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In one outlet alone in downtown eastside Vancouver last year, 
1.5 million needles were issued to over 6,000 addicted people. 
Yet we are still talking in the House of Commons about a 
committee, about talking and about researching.  No damn wonder 
it is so frustrating in this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday I asked the solicitor general why he was building a 
research facility in his riding for $2.5 million to study drugs 
in prison. 
He said “You can study it anywhere”.  But he missed the point. 
That $2.5 million building has a life expectancy of 25 to 50 
years.  Will he study the issue for 25 to 50 years?  If he has to 
study the thing, which has been studied so often, why can it not 
be done in one of the many government buildings that have been 
vacated?  Chilliwack, British Columbia, has a whole military base 
right smack dab in the middle of all the prison problems, drugs, 
cartels and organized crime.  He could use the Aldergrove base, 
which has been closed.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what tells me the government is not sincere about the 
issue.  One of its ministers says that he is building a building 
in his riding to study it, when we know darned well that it is 
basically patronage.  There is more interest in looking after the 
riding than in solving the drug problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opinion across the country is that not enough is being done. 
An article in the Ottawa <I>Citizen</I> stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Organized crime in Canada is now so pervasive that police have 
been reduced to putting out isolated fires in a blazing 
underworld economy. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is true and the government knows it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An opposition party raised the issue and said it should go to 
committee.  The government thought that was a good idea.  Another 
government member said that we should study it and that we need 
dialogue and consensus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want leadership, and I want it now, not later.  The problem is 
here.  I have dealt with enough people who are addicted to know 
they have all but given up hope of getting anything from the 
federal government.  Those people who are working with young 
teenagers who are addicted have all but given up hope of this 
place doing anything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A government minister, the solicitor general in particular, said 
that the government gave $78 million or $50 million to fight 
organized crime.  Is he kidding?  That is petty cash in 
Vancouver.  Lots of dealers have $50 million.  Lots of them in my 
community have that much in assets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am splitting my time and I note that I have two minutes left. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members might sense that I am a bit frustrated with the 
government on this issue.  I worked with an organization that is 
trying to get a rehabilitation centre for young teenage girls who 
are addicted.  I went to the Minister of Health to tell him they 
need some help.  I was put off to a bureaucrat in Vancouver who 
did absolutely nothing, and yet we have more teenage girls who 
are addicted in our little community than we can handle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I dare say that Vancouver, Burnaby, Coquitlam and all of these 
other places have more than we do in the Fraser Valley, and yet 
an opposition party has to tell the government to get off its 
butt, take this issue to committee and do something about it.  It 
is terrible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All I can say is that I do not believe the government is 
sincere.  If it was sincere something would be done.  While I 
applaud the Bloc for bringing this up, I equally say to the 
Liberals, shame.  There are a lot of people across the country 
who are depending on 300 members of the House to take some 
action, to stand together and deal with this issue.  It is lack 
of leadership that is the problem. 
If the government said “We will go to committee and we will come 
up with a national drug strategy that will really work at the 
street level”, I would be the first one applauding it.  I have 
taken the government's national drug strategy, and everywhere 
from Sydney, Nova Scotia, right through to Vancouver, British 
Columbia, when people looked at it they said “This is 
meaningless.  This is not helping us here.  We are issuing 
needles.  We see drug addicts every day.  Take your document and 
go away”.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney—Victoria, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is not often that the previous speaker and I agree on many 
things, but he raised some interesting points today and I applaud 
some of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am particularly interested in his discussion about the 
building of a new facility in Prince Edward Island to study the 
effects of drugs in jails.  He said that there are existing 
facilities that might be used.  I think of that because my own 
riding, and he mentioned Sydney in his comments, has a severe 
unemployment crisis because of the closure of some of the 
traditional industries.  I am wondering if he would like to take 
that a little further and support the establishment of that kind 
of centre in areas in the country which suffer a high 
unemployment rate.  If the government is going to establish this 
kind of facility and there is no need to build a new building and 
spend government revenue—and I will not confine it to my 
riding—would that not be a more sensible kind of 
decentralization of government offices that would enhance those 
communities and provide some revenue generation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, quite frankly, I am not 
very interested in creating employment through researching the 
issue of drugs in prisons.  This issue has been researched time 
and time again.  What is lacking in the system is the will of the 
correctional service to implement its own procedures.  The 
commissioner's directives state that there is zero tolerance in 
prisons, and yet they issue bleach to sterilize cocaine needles. 
What kind of contradiction is that?  The problem is not the 
research.  The difficulty is in the implementation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am just sick about the solicitor general wanting to build a 
building with a 50 year lifespan to study something that should 
not be studied but acted upon.  If they are going to do some work 
on drugs, it should be in a prison or close to a prison, in a 
post-secondary institution where research takes place, anything 
but building a building.  It is not a matter of job creation, it 
is a matter of saving lives.  That is the problem.  They have the 
wrong emphasis.

situation in Vancouver and elsewhere in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could he tell us how we could stop approximately one young 
person a day from dying of an overdose in East Vancouver and many 
other places in the country?  What could we do to combat that 
more effectively? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the big problem is the 
supply of drugs.  We need programs to cut it off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The demand for drugs is only going to decrease by fewer people 
being on them.  Unfortunately, in Vancouver we are not going to 
be able to stop people from dying because of drugs.  It will be 
unstoppable until we stop the drug trade.  Until we stop 
organized crime, until we cut off the supply, someone will die 
today, tomorrow and the next day.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We only have to go into some of the hotels in the downtown east 
side to see what a terrible scene it is.  I invite every Canadian 
watching to take the time to do that.  The police will take 
people to the downtown east side of Vancouver.  It is like a war 
zone.  I am not kidding.  I have seen young girls and young boys 
shooting up between their toes because there is no other place to 
do it.  All their marks have been used. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I really do not think it will be stopped until all members of 
parliament take action to cut off the supply.  That means 
boarding the ships that are anchored off Vancouver, getting the 
drugs, seizing the ships, selling the ships and telling the 
lawyers that they have to stop defending the bad guys and start 
prosecuting those people with everything they have.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, no other issue threatens the sovereignty of Canada, 
or for that matter other nations, like organized crime. 
Organized crime is operating in Canada with impunity.  The extent 
of organized crime is epidemic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Allow me to read a statement from the Canadian Police 
Association:  “Recent threats against the Bloc MP should be a 
wake up call for all politicians” says the executive officer of 
the 30,000 member Canadian Police Association, David Griffin. 
“The frightening reality is that organized criminals are 
flourishing in epidemic proportions and police feel frustrated by 
the lack of tools and resources to fight back.  Canada has gained 
third world status as a haven for organized criminals and money 
laundering”, said Griffin.  “Even our institutions are being 
threatened by the influence of global criminals.  Two Quebec 
prison guards were murdered.  A member of parliament and his 
family are now under police protection and players in the 
National Hockey League have become the targets of Russian 
gangsters”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am told by police officers that there is too much politics and 
infighting regarding who is in charge of fighting organized crime 
in Canada.  I am told it is foolish to have provincial law 
enforcement agencies take on this issue.  We are in dire need of 
a national organized crime agency to deal with this issue.  We 
must tie all of the different agencies together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently the solicitor general announced the formation of an 
organized crime directorate, headed by an individual of deputy 
minister status in the RCMP.  I was told last night by a crime 
fighter that this initiative is nothing but smoke and mirrors. 
The individual put in charge has no foot soldier to carry out the 
task, no resources and is wondering what to do.  He is in a void. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every August a report on organized crime is tabled by the 
Criminal Intelligence Service of Canada.  Every year is a litany 
of the proliferation of organized crime.  Every year it offers, 
according to my crime fighting friend, no plan of action, simply 
recognition of everything every police officer already knows but 
does not have the power to change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us get serious.  If Canada were really intent on fighting 
organized crime we would get away from the rhetoric and deal with 
such obvious issues as RCMP understaffing in British Columbia due 
to budgetary cuts.  There have have millions of dollars in cuts 
and the RCMP detachment is not meeting its own standards.  Yet, 
we expect police officers to do their jobs.  One would think 
there is some complicity with organized crime to allow these 
staffing issues in the RCMP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we were serious we would deal with the illegal entry of 
Chinese migrants.  We all know that organized crime is being paid 
to get them into Canada.  If we were serious we would not be 
playing the patsy for the triads in Vancouver.  If we were 
serious we would take a look at the kinds of companies we allow 
to do business in Canada, particularly those like COSCO, which is 
allowed to use the Vancouver waterfront but has been banned from 
U.S. ports because of nefarious or suspect criminal activity. It 
imported AK-47s into the United States for criminal purposes. It 
is banned from U.S. ports, yet it looks after the Vancouver ports 
now.  Is it not interesting that this government allowed the port 
police to disappear just when it took over?  Why are we so naive? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we were serious we would never have allowed a known triad 
leader, Tong Sang Lai, to enter Canada.  He was rejected in Hong 
Kong but allowed into our Los Angeles office.  He is known and on 
a Canadian list of high ranking triad leaders. 
If we were serious we would not have whitewashed how he eluded 
scrutiny by conducting a phoney inquiry at immigration.  Many who 
know the Lai story know of the drive-by shooting that took place 
at his residence in Vancouver, a settling of a score.  He is 
still around.  Is there is nothing we can do but turn a blind eye 
to the existence of known triads in Vancouver?

</I></B></P><P align=left>If we were serious, we would question and investigate the 
existence of crooked Hong Kong police officers who retired, so 
called, in Canada.  These officers made medium salaries in Hong 
Kong, yet live in million dollar homes in Vancouver.  How did 
they get that kind of money?  Are they doing it here on the take? 
What is the government doing? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At least 44 former Royal Hong Kong Constabulary police officers 
who fled a corruption crackdown in the former British colony have 
established themselves in Canada with their ill-gotten gains, 
police studies show.  Dubbed the millionaire cops, the ex-Hong 
Kong officers, their wives and concubines are believed to have 
invested tens of millions of dollars in businesses and real 
estate in Canada, mostly in British Columbia and Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A covert study by the Asian organized crime investigators, with 
the help of Immigration Canada officials, found that 30 of the 
police officers have invested in at least 13 B.C. companies and 
bought about 50 pieces of property in the Vancouver area.  This 
included large homes in West Vancouver, commercial buildings, a 
shopping mall and vacant acreage.  Others invested in restaurants 
and bought shares in a private hospital. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The study also found that four of them whose average salary had 
been about $30,000 Hong Kong a year, a pittance by North American 
standards, have built a two tower, 600 room hotel in Toronto 
valued at more than $20 million.  Police sources said the B.C. 
study into the cops with strong connections to triads in the 
Chinese mob began in the late 1970s and was updated in the 1980s, 
but it was kept under wraps. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last night I was told by a crime fighter that he thinks the 
Canadian embassy in Hong Kong has been bought and paid for by 
organized crime.  He feels our system of security has been 
penetrated and he has a point.  Allow me to explain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Project Sidewinder, a joint CSIS-RCMP venture, was launched in 
the mid-1990s to look into the influence of Chinese tycoons in 
Canada and their political connections.  The investigation was 
going along merrily, perhaps too well.  Names were being amassed 
and the information was being assembled on Chinese espionage 
activities and triad-linked businesses in Canada.  After a couple 
of years the probe was abruptly shut down, and following that 
CSIS destroyed documents pertaining to the investigation.  Why? 
Two people involved in it know and stepped forward.  One was an 
immigration official at the Hong Kong embassy, Brian McAdam, an 
expert on Chinese criminals.  He knows the immigration computer, 
and files and codes were accessed by those who should not have 
had access. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another Canadian, Corporal Robert Read of the RCMP, agreed and 
talked about the project sidewinder and was suspended.  In a 
series of compelling and investigative stories by Fabian Dawson 
of the Vancouver <I>Province</I>, the project sidewinder story has been 
revealed.  SIRC has been called in to get to the bottom of the 
issue.  Many important names are surfacing in its investigation 
and many of these names are those of individuals with investments 
and interests in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Frankly, the government is ignoring the proliferation of 
organized Chinese crime figures in Canada.  One asks the question 
where the direction is coming from when it comes to shutting down 
investigations like Project Sidewinder. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Canadian government was serious about organized crime, 
this would not happen.  Is our sovereignty being sold?  It is a 
good reason this is going to committee.  It is sad for instance 
that questionable and suspect organizations of our Hong Kong 
immigration office are surfacing. 
As well, one has to question the wisdom of our federal court in 
this entry of triad leaders into Canada.  I will quote one 
instance, a triad leader turned down by immigration a number of 
times.  His name was Lam Chum-wai, a member of a very notorious 
triad.  Yet the federal court overturned those rejections and he 
was allowed to stay in Canada.  A known criminal should not be in 
this country, a triad leader by all reports, and yet a federal 
court judge allowed him to stay in Canada.  Nobody questioned 
that issue of a judge and we should be.  We should be asking why 
this is happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In October I had the pleasure of attending the ministerial 
conference of the G-8 countries on combating transitional 
organized crime held in Moscow.  I knew organized crime was 
proliferating, but I did not know to what extent and in what 
high-tech way.  Clearly, the bad news guys have the upper hand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a communique issued at that conference that said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The G-8 are committed to fight against the dark side of 
globalization—transitional organized crime which threatens to 
damage our societies and our economies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have agreed that transnational organized crime can only be 
successfully combated by combining preventative and enforcement 
measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have agreed that all G-8 members who have not yet done so 
should consider the possibility of accession to the Council of 
Europe Convention on Laundering, Search, Seizure and Confiscation 
of proceeds from Crime.  We also agreed on the importance of an 
outreach to the media and non-governmental organizations because 
they have important roles to play in fighting against organized 
crime and corruption. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>8.  Today, we have endorsed the Guiding Principles and Plan of 
Action to Combat the Smuggling of and Trafficking in Human 
Beings, which was prepared by the G-8's Lyon Group under guidance 
provided at the G-8 Summit in Birmingham in 1998... 
</I></B></P><P align=left>10.  We have agreed to co-operate against an immediate 
threat—the possible use of Y2K as a cover for high-tech 
transnational organized crime frauds.  We have agreed to support 
the continuing work of our Lyon Group subgroup on high-tech 
crime.  We must explore new options for locating and identifying 
criminals who use networked communications for illegal purposes.

action against organized crime in Canada. 
<P><A NAME="LINK31"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Kilgour (Secretary of State (Latin America and 
Africa), Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, would the hon. member tell us a 
little more about how he thinks we could make it more difficult 
for criminals, particularly the organized career type of 
criminal, to get into Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds:</B>  Mr. Speaker, certainly there are a 
number of ways and a standard basis of just criminals getting in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the situation of the triad leader I mentioned who was 
turned down in Hong Kong and got in through the L.A. office. 
There is no question in my mind, even though there was a report 
written by a former ambassador, that there were cover-ups in that 
area. There is very strong evidence and I think we should call 
these people to the committee.  Mr. MacAdam who has gone public 
and Corporal Read when talking about Sidewinder have some answers 
in that area as to why these people are getting in.  We have to 
get them before that committee and talk about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to stop the payoffs and the fraud outside the country. 
We all know the RCMP has numerous investigations at embassies 
right now into people who are paid off at the local level to get 
people to the front of the line.  We have to stop that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One might ask, why did a federal judge with evidence from the 
RCMP and worldwide police organizations of a well-known triad 
leader allow that man to stay in Canada?  There should be no 
reason for that whatsoever and yet a judge did that in this 
country and it was a federal judge.  That is what disturbs me the 
most because most federal judges come by political appointment, 
as we all know.  I just start to wonder. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been in this business for a long time.  I sat in a 
committee of this House in the seventies on penitentiaries.  It 
was unanimous from all members of the House, yet I know the 
government did darned near nothing about it when it came in.  I 
hope that if we make this public enough, we can get some answers, 
get them out before the public and make sure that things change 
so that people do not laugh at Canada because it is such an easy 
place to get into by organized crime. 
<P><A NAME="LINK32"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I have in hand a copy of a criminal intelligence brief dated June 
15.  I brought it to the attention of the House in a statement 
last week.  I would just like the hon. member's comments on this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an RCMP criminal intelligence brief on computer crime 
and national security.  It states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The likelihood of a serious, deliberate and targeted attack to a 
Canadian critical infrastructure program has increased from low 
to medium and the impact of such an attack remains at high. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Several government departments dealing with an increasing number 
of sophisticated attacks, are seeking guidance, support and 
assistance from law enforcement, only to find there is a lack of 
skilled and trained resources. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Interestingly, when a reporter asked the RCMP to comment on the 
release we did of this criminal intelligence brief, it said it 
was going to move some resources around. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think that is quite the way to do it and I think the 
hon. member would probably agree with me.  Just moving resources 
around is not the answer.  Coming up with new resources and more 
of a determination on the part of this government is the answer, 
I believe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds:</B>  Mr. Speaker, there is no question that 
just moving the resources that we have around is not going to 
solve any problems.  As we mentioned to the Solicitor General 
earlier, we have RCMP shortages right across Canada and we need 
money for that.  Organized crime is costing Canadians about $18 
billion a year.  On top of that there are the profits the 
criminals make and the billions a year on drugs and other issues.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the new computer data and all of those problems 
across Canada and across the world, that was one of the issues 
discussed at the G-8 conference in Moscow.  It was interesting 
that all the countries agreed except for Germany, so they could 
not come to an agreement.  They just agreed to study it for one 
more year which is much of what we get here.  Politics around the 
world is not much different than what it is right here.  At  a 
conference like that everybody wanted to get in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now with encryption, criminals can talk to each other quite 
openly.  Wire taps cannot be put on like what can be done with 
telephones to investigate.  So it is not just resources.  There 
has to be a will to say to people that we have to do something 
about organized crime in Canada, that we can do something about 
it, that we have not done things about.  I hope the committee 
will make recommendations the government will listen to and act 
on in a very quick manner. 
<P><A NAME="LINK33"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney—Victoria, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
too will be dividing my time and I too, like every member who has 
risen so far to address this resolution, want to congratulate the 
members of the Bloc Quebecois for bringing it forward.  It is an 
important resolution and I can indicate that my party will be 
supporting it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only real concern I have is that unfortunately the 
government of the day does not always respond well to reports 
from committees, and we can name the committees to which the 
government has either watered down recommendations or dismissed 
them outright.  I can think of recommendations from the Standing 
Committee on Fisheries and Oceans, the Standing Committee on 
Environment and Sustainable Development, both of which at 
different points in this government's lifetime brought forward 
important recommendations which were then diluted after 
consideration by cabinet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my hope that the Standing Committee on Justice and Human 
Rights will take this issue as is recommended in the resolution, 
that it will investigate it, hear witnesses and bring forward the 
kind of report I know we can.  I sit on the committee on justice. 
We have brought forward unanimous reports in terms of important 
measures for the House to consider.  It is my hope that the 
government will then adopt those measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been some discussion here about frustration, about how 
long it has taken the government to recognize that organized 
crime is something that has to be dealt with in this country.  I 
share that frustration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today is November 30, 1999.  I have here my comments from almost 
a year ago when the solicitor general brought forward his 
statement on organized crime.  My comments are dated December 3, 
1998, almost a year ago to the day.  At that time we were talking 
about the need to take action on organized crime in this country. 
Much of what we have heard from the government today was said at 
the same time almost 12 months earlier.  It has taken an 
opposition party, the Bloc Quebecois, to bring forward this 
motion, and it will take the justice committee I suppose to get 
some action by this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Organized crime affects every single ministry in this government 
and every single geographic part of the country.  When I say that 
it touches on every ministry, it touches on transportation.  I 
will go back.  The member for Langley—Abbotsford began talking 
about the ports police.  We are a nation bordered by three oceans 
and yet when I first came to parliament two years ago, the 
Minister of Transport was eliminating the ports police, one of 
the real safeguards against the importation of drugs, weapons and 
illegal contraband into this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is no small irony that we stand here today debating organized 
crime at the same time as the talks are taking place at the World 
Trade Organization because there is a World Trade Organization. 
It trades in ammunition.  The single greatest item that is traded 
and sold is arms from one nation to another, illegal arms.  It is 
a billion dollar trade around the globe.  My colleague has 
correctly called them implements of destruction, and we trade 
them in billions of dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second largest item traded is drugs.  Although I do not have 
the figures, I would suspect the third is trade in humans, in 
immigrants, people who are seeking some kind of better life. 
If we look at what is being traded around the globe today we find 
that it is arms, drugs and humans.  It is about time that we 
began to address the issue here.

<A HREF="#LINKT20"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One protection we had were the ports police.  I argued in the 
House passionately with the Minister of Transport that we ought 
not to disband the ports police.  The government went ahead and 
did it anyway and privatized the ports.  It is in the process of 
privatizing airports.  The role of government is diminished at 
the points of entry where illegal activity takes place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have said that it cuts across ministries.  It is not the 
concern of a particular minister.  I mentioned the fact that 
there is trade in human beings.  Because of the situation in 
Vancouver with the boatloads of immigrants that arrived there, 
the general public is now aware of the snakeheads, the people who 
traffic in individuals seeking a better life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It touches on health and justice.  We know the cost of young 
people who are addicted to crack cocaine.  We know the cost of 
people who take drugs.  We know the cost to the country of 
prisons.  We know the cost of trying to treat people who have 
been the victims of organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Organized crime touches on finance and international trade.  Let 
us not forget white collar crime.  When we talk about organized 
crime there is a temptation to think that everyone involved in it 
looks like a stereotypical biker.  In reality many people in very 
expensive suits, shirts and ties are laundering money.  They are 
shifting the proceeds of crime from one country to the other and 
are robbing us with a fountain pen.  With one stroke they create 
criminal activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It touches on finance.  It touches on international trade.  It 
touches on Canada customs.  It also touches on defence because in 
many cases we rely on the men and women who serve the country in 
the military to fill the void created because of cutbacks to the 
RCMP and because of the elimination of the ports police. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of organized crime is the responsibility of every 
member of cabinet.  The fact that there has been little or no 
action taken on it is a shame shared by every member of cabinet. 
There are no geographical boundaries in terms of organized crime. 
No one area of the country suffers more than another.  In small 
towns across Canada there are concerns about organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Halifax, Nova Scotia, we have a sad spectacle of two rival 
gangs, the Hell's Angels and another gang.  One is located in 
Dartmouth and the other is located in Halifax.  The people in 
that community live under the ever present threat that maybe the 
situation will turn into the same situation that has been 
complained about and highlighted by my colleagues in the Bloc 
Quebecois as happening in the province of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In cities in Ontario there is a real danger and fear of 
trafficking in everything from tobacco and alcohol to drugs 
across the border.  In cities like Winnipeg there are real 
concerns.  The new government in Manitoba is beginning to take 
real action against inner city crime and inner city organized 
crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>British Columbia, as my colleagues have highlighted, has seen a 
dramatic increase in drug trade.  To the people who live in those 
communities it appears that the government is powerless to stop 
it because of the funding cuts to the RCMP.  It is also an issue 
that requires international co-operation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will end on perhaps a more positive note.  I congratulate the 
government on taking some steps to work with the international 
community.  It was my pleasure and privilege to accompany the 
minister to the United Nations in New York where we shared some 
ideas with attorneys general from other countries on how to fight 
organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate members of the Bloc for bringing forward this 
motion and will support it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am always very buoyed and entertained to a degree 
by the commentary from my learned friend from Sydney—Victoria in 
the province of Nova Scotia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He always gives a very insightful view.  I want to ask him a 
question specifically with respect to the problem of organized 
crime in the maritimes.  We face a very unique situation, not 
unlike that of the coast of British Columbia, where we have large 
bodies of water that make our coastline vulnerable, in particular 
for the importation of drugs, contraband material, pornography 
and weapons coming from large urban centres like Boston and New 
York. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am wondering, particularly in reference to his area in Cape 
Breton or Nova Scotia generally, if the hon. member could talk to 
that and the increased vulnerability of our coastline because of 
the disbandment of the ports police.  I know that Halifax, which 
was very much vying for superport designation, dealt with that in 
a very timely way.  It may have factored into the decision 
ultimately as to whether Halifax would receive that designation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the member expand on that thought and tell us what he 
feels we could do to address the situation in Nova Scotia? 
Specifically, what advice might he have for the solicitor general 
in this regard? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I welcome the question 
from my colleague.  I am glad to entertain him whenever I can. On 
this issue he is correct.  The ports police played an important 
role but not only by themselves.  I think this is an important 
point. The customs officers who worked at the ports in Nova 
Scotia relied heavily on the partnership with the ports police to 
assist them in ensuring there was no importation of stolen items, 
whether they be automobiles, drugs or whatever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My advice would be to reinstate the ports police.  There was 
some interesting discussion the justice committee could look at 
in terms of a national police force which might incorporate some 
of the work the ports police did if they were not reinstated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He talked about the vulnerability of the Atlantic region.  It is 
true.  The coastline is full of coves, full of areas where ships 
can land.  We need additional protection in that part of the 
country.  We used to be able to rely to some extent on a 
partnership between fishermen and the RCMP.  There were programs 
where fishermen could report if they saw suspicious activity. 
Again, with the downsizing of the RCMP that becomes more and more 
difficult. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about the sea coast.  I noticed in his remarks 
the solicitor general talked about funding for airports.  Halifax 
is not one of the airports that has been mentioned.  As the 
government enacts policies that cause rural areas to lose 
population and to congregate in large urban centres, we also lose 
the ability to protect those coasts as small villages and small 
towns lose their population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the member will understand, coming from 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, that as Halifax becomes a 
concentrated centre, because that is where the government has 
decided economic activity will take place, we lose some of the 
resources along the coastline and in other communities that are 
assets in the fight against organized crime and make those 
communities more vulnerable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I again thank the member 
for his commentary.  I know that his heart is very much in the 
right place when it comes to the province of Nova Scotia.  In 
fact there is a great deal of pressure on him to spend more time 
in his home province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question for him is with respect to airports because he 
raised a very interesting point.  There has been a lot of 
discussion in the policing community about privatization of 
policing, that is security guards.  The thought is that we might 
remove RCMP presence in airports.  This is very much a great 
concern because of the vulnerability of airports and because of 
being the flash point in terms of importation of contraband 
materials.  Halifax is certainly an international airport with 
that designation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the member expand on his party's position and his own 
personal approach to privatization of policing?  Standards are 
lowered and I believe police officers themselves do not receive 
the same level of training they would get as members of the RCMP 
or municipal police forces.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I agree with the hon. 
member again that the privatization of the police force is not 
the way to go.  We need professionally trained police officers 
with the benefits of good pay and good training to protect 
communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He is correct when he says that I am under pressure to spend 
more time in the province.  He is under the same pressure 
sometimes himself. 
<P><A NAME="LINK35"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
glad to take part in this debate.  I want to start by expressing 
appreciation to members of the Bloc Quebecois who brought forward 
this very timely, topical and relevant subject for us to debate 
today.  Special thanks go to the member for Berthier—Montcalm 
for bringing forward the particular motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come from the riding of Winnipeg Centre, the core area of 
Winnipeg.  In that neighbourhood, I am not proud to say, we are 
no strangers to the problems of organized crime albeit on a small 
scale.  I am speaking specifically of urban street gangs, often 
wrongly called aboriginal youth gangs.  It is a misnomer to call 
our problem an aboriginal youth problem.  These urban street 
gangs are run and orchestrated by adults, often using young 
people or abusing young people, to bring about their own goals. I 
want to make perfectly clear that when I talk about the gang 
problem in Winnipeg it is an urban street gang problem and not an 
aboriginal youth problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Much of our problem in the inner city of Winnipeg is a very 
predictable consequence of a disastrous social policy or the 
absence of any social policy.  This is a predictable consequence 
that anybody could have told us would be the outcome of years of 
neglect.  Years and years and years of letting the inner city of 
Winnipeg rot has had a very predictable outcome and consequence 
in the form of a permanent underclass.  Quelle surprise.  Starve 
people for a couple of decades and we will develop an underclass 
which will become organized.  When we shut people out of the 
mainstream economy where do they go to find a standard of living? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about organized crime everybody thinks of the 
Mafia.  It is almost a cliché.  Where do we think it came from? 
In the 1900s in New York City people were shut out of the 
mainstream economy.  People would not hire a swarthy 
Mediterranean type.  They were shut out of the economy and they 
created their own economy.  Yes, it was illegal.  Given the 
choice between my children starving and doing something a bit off 
colour, I have often said it is frankly an easy choice to make. 
They loved their children too and they were forced into the 
situation of doing something illegal in order to survive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the situation with the urban street gangs we have in the 
city of Winnipeg.  A whole generation of people were shut out of 
the mainstream economy and created its own illegal mini economy. 
Some people think that illegal is just a sick bird because 
frankly when it is survival or illegal they choose survival. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole social problem faced in the core area of the city of 
Winnipeg recently manifested itself in arson.  There is an 
epidemic of arson.  It is like Watts in 1965.  It is burn baby 
burn.  People are expressing their frustration by torching the 
miserable neighbourhood they live in.  They are levelling it. 
They are taking the law into their own hands.  They are 
expressing themselves and their frustration by burning down the 
neighbourhood they live in, maybe in the hopes that something 
will rise from the ashes that will be a better world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very predictable.  Any student of the human experience 
could have told us that this would happen.  We are playing with 
fire here and now we are experiencing fire.  It boils down to 
year after year after year of fundamental neglect in the inner 
city. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thankfully we have now elected a progressive mayor and a 
progressive provincial government.  Maybe those two could 
actually work together and start to turn the issue around.  Let 
us call it what it is.  Organized crime and street crime are 
predictable consequences of chronic long term poverty that we 
should have known about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague talked about an issue in which I am very 
interested: human bondage, human slavery, the advent of slavery 
again. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1200"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT24"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT24"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1200

<A HREF="#LINKT23"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see the member from the Tories gets a kick out of that.  I 
agree that human bondage can have many meanings.  The particular 
meaning I am dealing with now is the terrible spectacle of 
desperate people, looking for a better life, who are washing up 
on the shores of British Columbia's west coast.  They are getting 
put into a pipeline that is in fact organized crime.  The whole 
network of people who are taking advantage of these desperate 
individuals is organized crime in its truest sense.  They are 
very well connected.  They have a network all over North America 
that takes these people from the ships and puts them into illegal 
and abusive situations where they have to pay off the debt they 
owe for getting themselves smuggled into the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More sensitive people are looking at this issue and trying to 
understand how it comes about.  People from the Fujian province 
in China, desperate enough to leave their situation, are willing 
to get on some death trap of a boat and owe some criminal $40,000 
to come here to build a better life for themselves and their 
children.  Let us try and understand their motivation.  What kind 
of circumstances are they leaving that they would risk life and 
limb to undertake a journey like that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In doing a bit of research, I have learned a bit about the 
Fujian province where these desperate people come from.  That is 
the first place in China where they had these free economic trade 
zones, that great bastion of capitalism called free economic 
trade zones.  It is a fenced compound where labour legislation 
does not apply and no laws apply.  People work making Barbie 
dolls, The Gap jeans and Liz Claiborne sweaters.  A lot of our 
western products are developed in these trade zones in the Fujian 
province of China. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ILO, the International Labour Organization, did some 
research.  It found that they need to make about 85 cents an hour 
to make a reasonable standard of living in China.  To live like a 
Chinese peasant, they need to make 85 cents an hour.  This is $6 
or $7 a day.  The wage in these free economic trade zones is 18 
cents an hour, one-fifth of what it costs to survive as peasant. 
The Gap jeans, Liz Claiborne and all these outfits are paying 
these people 18 cents an hour for making western goods. These 
people are not stupid.  They put two and two together. They know 
there is another world out there that lives a hell of a lot 
better than they do.  To better themselves and their families, 
they will do anything to get here and maybe have some hope and 
optimism that they will enjoy a better standard of living. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe we have only seen the tip of iceberg in this 
situation.  I think we will face a day of reckoning.  As a 
western developed nation, we cannot keep those people down 
forever.  They know that we are here enjoying the good life and 
they are there living a life of misery and desperation.  We have 
this bizarre spectacle of people living in a grass hut with a mud 
floor watching <I>Mary Tyler Moore</I> reruns on a colour TV and 
wondering why it is not them and why they cannot have a piece of 
that good life.  So they become desperate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of less sensitive people or people who have not thought 
this through are saying “Why should these people be able to jump 
the queue and wind up on the shores of Canada and become landed 
immigrants in this country?   What about all those good people 
who are waiting patiently in line?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me tell the House something.  There is no way to get here 
from there.  China has 1.2 billion people and we have one 
Canadian immigration officer in China who is in Beijing, which is 
a heck of a long way from the Fujian province.  How does a person 
making 18 cents an hour save up enough money to get themselves to 
Beijing, to then stand in line for months sometimes and literally 
sleep outside the door of the embassy to get a visa to come to 
Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration why we could 
not set up a little satellite office.  If there is such a great 
demand from the Fujian province to come to Canada, we could set 
up a little office in the Fujian province for 18 months.  There 
would be no market for snakeheads.  We would pull the rug out 
from underneath them if we gave people conventional access to 
this country.  Well, the minister said that there was no budget 
for promoting Canada, et cetera.  It is all a budgetary issue. 
Now we are facing the consequences of these people who are 
desperate enough to come to our shores and become victims of this 
terrible criminal pipeline. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last thing I will say about this is that I am very critical 
of the way the government is handling the issue.  We know some of 
the problem people in that criminal pipeline.  We know some 
individuals, and I know some by name, in Vancouver, Toronto and 
New York City.  However, for some reason the government is hoping 
to wait until it can do one big sting, like a TV cop show where 
in the last five minutes of the show they will round everybody up 
and bust them so they can look like heroes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are the police not harassing the people that it knows 
already?   By the word harass, I mean within the context of the 
law. 
Why are the police not picking these people up and questioning 
them?  Why are they not doing everything they can to stop this 
and send a message back to the Fujian province that Canada will 
not tolerate the smuggling of human cargo and human bondage in 
our community.  That is one issue I am very critical of.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The other thing that my colleague from Sydney—Victoria raised 
is the RCMP's inability to enforce the laws and put an end to 
some of the terrible organized crime we have in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our party gets letters from RCMP officers telling us that they 
are unable to investigate crimes they know are being committed 
because they do not have the budget or personnel to do it.  It is 
sending a green light to organized crime, especially on 
complicated issues of white collar crime, et cetera.  It is a 
terrible thing when we do not have the money to bust criminals 
who we know are operating in our community and exploiting 
Canadians.  It is all budgetary.  It is strictly a matter of 
finance.  Balancing the budget seems to have priority over 
protecting Canadians from organized criminals, and I think that 
is scandalous.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Brampton Centre, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, could the hon. member table the letters from the RCMP 
officers that he spoke about earlier?  I would appreciate seeing 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin:</B>  Madam Speaker, I think they are a matter 
of public record.  The member from Kamloops stood up and made not 
only statements on that issue but questioned the government on 
that issue.  He quoted chapter and verse, and the name of a 
senior RCMP officer from British Columbia who wrote letters to us 
in response to a white collar scam that was going on in the 
riding of Kamloops. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seniors were being cheated out of hundreds of thousands of 
dollars by some kind of a scam.  The RCMP knew it was going on, 
knew the details, the amount and the people involved, but they 
wrote back saying, “We're sorry, but at this time we can't 
possibly investigate this.  We don't have the resources, the 
staff or the manpower to investigate”.  In other words, they 
said that there was no money to protect the interests of the 
victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would be happy to give those letters to the member because we 
want this publicized as much as the member obviously does. 
<P><A NAME="LINK37"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, the hon. member, who was just asking the question, 
points out the problem we have between east and west where these 
stories are quite well known. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have written the solicitor general and the head of the RCMP 
about the shortage of officers on the Sunshine Coast where they 
are supposed to have 52 officers for a population of 46,000.  We 
are about 10 short, which is well above the 10% the commissioner 
sometimes talks about.  Because of that, RCMP officers are 
sometimes quoted as saying that they cannot cover certain crimes 
overnight, like break-ins, because they do not have the staff. 
One officer was quoted as saying that they have been told by 
Ottawa not to go up to Pender Harbour from Sechelt to cover 
things at night, and yet there are a few thousand people who live 
there.  We know it is a serious problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A comparison with that is West Vancouver which has 40,000 
people, its own police force and 77 policemen on staff. It is an 
area bordered by water on two sides and a very compact area 
compared with the Sunshine Coast.  We have a real shortage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member made a comment about the Fujian province.  I agree 
with a lot of the things he said about that, but he also said 
that we only have one office in Beijing and at 18 cents an hour 
how can they afford to get there.  That may or may not be true, 
but how can they afford to pay the $40,000 to the guys to get on 
the boat?  It leads to the fact that organized crime is behind 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been told by an overwhelming number people in the Chinese 
community in Vancouver that if we do not turn the boats around, 
or at least send the people back by airplane immediately, the 
people in that province will not get the message that human 
smuggling is not the way we do immigration in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a difference here to start with.  Yes, they cannot 
afford it, but they can afford to raise $30,000 or $40,000 and/or 
pay it off in ware when they get here.  How does the member 
rationalize that statement? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin:</B>  Madam Speaker, I think the hon. member 
answered his own question.  No one pays it up front.  No one from 
that area has that kind of money.  They sign a chit or whatever 
that they owe that money when they get here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My brother is a lawyer in Toronto and has one of these people as 
a client.  This person was chained to a bed in the basement of a 
home and forced to work 16 to 18 hour days in servitude, in 
bondage. 
This is bonded labour.  This is a return to the bad old days of 
slavery.  People are desperate enough to undertake the obligation 
of owing $40,000.  If they do not pay it back, they are under 
great threat of coercion or of having damage done to their 
families back home.  Many of them probably still have loved ones 
back in the Fujian province.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the kind of coercion and manipulation that goes on in 
the minds of desperate people.  Can anyone imagine how desperate 
people would have to be?  The 18 cents an hour is not my figure. 
It was the International Labour Organization that just recently 
did the study of the free economic trade zones in the Fujian 
province where a lot of our products are made, such as children's 
toys, furniture and electronics.  Maybe the clothes that I am 
wearing right now were stitched together in that particular area 
of China.  There are 200 free economic trade zones in China now, 
many of them in the Fujian province, where western goods are 
made.  I did not invent that figure.  The International Labour 
Organization's estimate was that 85 cents an hour would be a 
reasonable living wage for a person in that area of China. They 
make 18 cents an hour.  Beijing is a heck of a long way from the 
Fujian province.  I do not know how they would even get there to 
file an application for a visa.  I do not think it can be done. 
Legally, they cannot get here from there.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am very pleased to rise and take part in this 
debate on behalf of the Progressive Conservative Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will begin by commending the Bloc for the impetus to bring 
this debate before the House.  It is certainly very useful and 
instructional in terms of the commentary that we will be hearing 
throughout the day.  I commend the Bloc's foresight on the use of 
this opposition day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the issues of options and priorities that we have when it 
comes to the decision that an opposition party must make with 
respect to the debate that will take place, I find it very 
interesting that the Bloc decided to choose this matter. It shows 
that it obviously recognizes the importance and the priority this 
issue has in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet, at the same time, the Prime Minister has chosen to provoke 
the Bloc and prefers a self-edifying folly into the minefield of 
separation.  Canadians are very fatigued with the neverending 
debate.  Obviously he is looking for a pedestal or a way to 
rehabilitate his abysmal performance in 1995 when he disappeared 
from the debate and left it to the then leader of the Progressive 
Conservative Party to try and carry his baggage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all recognize that organized crime is a threat to all that we 
hold dear:  peace, order and good government.  The Bloc Quebecois 
has chosen to make this a priority and it deserves praise for 
that.  It is something that is very close to home within the 
province of Quebec because of the competing biker gangs that are 
playing out their dangerous warfare on the streets of Montreal. 
We also know that Lennoxville is home to the largest organized 
crime unit in the country.  There is a chapter of the Hell's 
Angels that operates from Lennoxville.  It is very timely that 
this motion comes before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I get into the substance of my remarks, I also want to 
remind the House about the supply day motion itself and the 
process that brings us here today, which will culminate next week 
when the government will be asked for the authority to spend over 
$4 billion belonging to the people of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Supplementary estimates are referred to various committees for 
examination.  To date, the government has not produced a single 
minister at committee to answer questions or offer attempts to 
speak to the reasoning for this request for supply.  It is truly 
an offence to democracy.  It offends people's sensibilities.  I 
suggest that the smallest municipality in the country would not 
treat its taxpayers and citizens in such a cavalier fashion. 
This is $4 billion without a single word of explanation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will cite only one example of what is at stake when it comes 
to these types of estimates.  The National Capital Commission is 
asking for $40 million for projects on Sparks Street, only one 
block away from the Chamber.  The National Capital Commission 
meets in secret.  The only public scrutiny of this agency would 
take place at a committee and it probably will not happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another request is for $35 million for the firearms control 
program that is presently in chaos and making a black hole out of 
public money.  The minister and officials have been unable to 
defend in any way their stewardship of this program. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1215"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT26"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has shut down the scrutiny process when it comes 
to estimates.  The Liberals take the position that it is 
inconvenient for ministers to attend before committees.  The 
ministers have a duty, I suggest, to attend and to give the 
public and members of the House an accounting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not for the ministers to tell the committees of the House 
when they can appear.  It is a duty they have to parliament to be 
here and answer questions about supply.  Too many people in 
Canada, and in fact too many people in the House, have forgotten 
that cabinet ministers in particular are servants of the Canadian 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I raise this point in the proceedings to give the government 
fair warning that it is completely dissatisfying the people of 
the country and the members of the House with its arrogant 
treatment of committees.  To ask the House to approve public 
spending without an opportunity to question the government is 
highly unacceptable and inappropriate to everyone in this place. 
It is time for the committees to do their work.  It is time for 
us as opposition members to hold the government to a greater 
level of account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to turn now specifically to the motion before the House. 
It is appropriate to begin my remarks by congratulating the men 
and women who work on the frontlines of law enforcement.  Whether 
it be police officers, peace officers, customs agents or crown 
prosecutors, those working at all levels of law enforcement need 
our support.  They need our increased attention and they need 
resources very quickly.  Increasing the law enforcement budget is 
the only true way to address the problems pointed out very 
clearly in the Bloc motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In essence, what is occurring at this time in this area is that 
law enforcement agents are simply being asked to do more with 
less.  They have been ravished by government cutbacks and like a 
tired animal they are asking for assistance instead of having 
more heaped on to their backs.  Unfortunately government cutbacks 
and slashes over the years have led Canadians to question the 
commitment and the priority level the government places on this 
sector of our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This ultimately leads to vulnerability to organized crime and 
increased levels of organized criminal activity.  I am talking of 
Mafia type associations, criminal gangs and street gangs. Whether 
they be of any origin or national descent they are popping up at 
a shocking rate in communities around the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are having a field day in the area of white collar high 
tech crime such as fraud, telemarketing scams, money laundering, 
drug importation and exportation, particularly on the west coast. 
They are dealing in pornography and contraband materials such as 
firearms, trafficking, loan sharking, and influence peddling, 
another area where organized crime is very active. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is coming from international and multicultural groups within 
the country in the form of eastern European gangs specializing in 
counterfeiting, biker gangs that are mainly Caucasian, guns and 
explosives being smuggled in, Russian, Italian and Asian gangs, 
extortion, aboriginal gangs, pornography and firearms 
trafficking.  All these groups are actively involved in criminal 
activity.  However, the highest threat is drug importation and 
drug trafficking, the most lucrative area of organized criminal 
activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Intimidation of witnesses has been touched upon by a number of 
previous speakers.  Intimidation of juries, officials and law 
enforcement agents very much undercuts and undermines the 
pinnings and the very cornerstones of our criminal justice 
system.  If those working within the system are feeling hard done 
by and put upon by members of the organized community, they will 
not be able to do their jobs effectively.  Insidious efforts to 
permeate and pervert our justice system are happening as we 
speak.  Many of these threats to the justice system have come as 
a direct result of negligent underfunding on the part of the 
current government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that many coming from outside the country are from very 
tumultuous and sometimes wartorn backgrounds. When they come to 
Canada they are overjoyed, if they are involved in criminal 
activity, at the lax approach that is sometimes taken and the 
blind eye that is sometimes turned to organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These criminals are professionals.  They come to Canada 
oftentimes with quite a knowledgeable background of how to 
circumvent the law.  There is no code of conduct or unwritten 
rules of conduct among the criminal element in this country. 
It is not like the old Hollywood movies and the gangsters who 
sometimes had a code of thieves.  That does not happen.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Gangs are growing at an astonishing rate.  I spoke recently with 
an undercover officer from the city of Montreal.  He gave me some 
statistics and spoke of personal accounts of how gangs were 
cropping up in different parts of the city of Montreal and around 
the country at an astonishing rate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1999 a CSIS annual report stated that Asian based criminal 
organizations would continue to pose challenges for police and 
agencies across the country because of their abilities to 
function as tightly knit units.  The agencies we have in place to 
fight organized crime are aware of the syndicates that are 
cropping up.  Yet they are increasingly frustrated because they 
do not have the resources to react. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same report stated that the Hell's Angels had almost doubled 
in size in the province of Alberta in the last two years since 
coming to that province.  In 1997 there were 26 members.  In 1999 
there are 46 members.  As I have said, we have seen the numbers 
of chapters in and around the city of Montreal double in the last 
number of years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To combat this new form of organized crime, police officers and 
CSIS agents need to be high tech.  They need to be on at least a 
level playing field and working together with a common goal to 
try to stop the expansion of organized crime.  In order to 
protect the public they need at least the equivalent tools and at 
least the equivalent resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead we hear that the RCMP is unable to investigate fraud 
cases in the province of British Columbia because of lack of 
resources.  We know that in British Columbia close to 400 RCMP 
officers are needed to fill vacancies as we speak.  The closing 
of government RCMP training academies in the last year even 
temporarily was a severe blow to the police.  The elimination of 
ports police increased drug and human smuggling in our coastal 
communities.  The Quebec Mounties have been ordered to stop 
recruiting.  There are paid informants to help investigations. 
Real problems are happening out there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In particular, organized crime involving drug importation is on 
the rise because the force is simply running out of money.  It is 
not able to get people involved because it cannot pay them. Sadly 
one of the most effective tools the police have to infiltrate 
organized crime is to pay informants or the informants are not 
willing to inform.  Similarly they are not getting the same level 
of protection under the Canadian witness protection program 
because of a lack of funding.  Many investigators are unable to 
use wiretaps because the force cannot afford the computer time 
and the cost of transcribing tapes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The solicitor general refuses to take responsibility for his 
department's actions when it falls down and documents go missing, 
but we know from the same internal reports put out by CSIS and 
the RCMP that it is not co-operating.  It is not exercising the 
discretion to share information for a common goal because it is 
competing for resources.  This should be very alarming.  This 
rivalry is actually costing investigators and potentially putting 
lives at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Groups like the Asian triads involved in the smuggling of 
individuals, of human bodies into the country, is on the rise due 
to the poor situation at our borders.  There is a suggestion that 
many criminal gangs in Canada have links to the Chinese military. 
I was about to say Canadian military, and there is some 
suggestion of that too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know of the sidewinder investigation that took place and 
exposed a far-reaching, insidious plot to set up more organized 
crime in the country.  Yet, because of a lack of resources among 
other problems, the sidewinder investigation was put aside.  We 
will be hearing more about this issue.  I suggest there will be 
shockwaves throughout our entire political and justice systems 
when it comes to the sidewinder investigation being brought to 
the forefront. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Gangs in Quebec have been growing marijuana in farmers' fields, 
intimidating farmers to remain silent, intimidating families and 
intimidating members of parliament.  I congratulate the member 
who was threatened for his courage in continuing to fight for 
activity that will lead to the breaking of these types of crime 
syndicates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not the fault of our law enforcement agents.  The 
hardworking men and women involved in this battle continue to put 
their lives on the line.  They continue to risk their own safety 
even in the face of this lack of government support. 
They need greater funding.  They need greater support.  They need 
greater surveillance.  They need equipment, helicopters, patrol 
boats to monitor and actively take part in the effort to stem the 
tide of criminal activity.

<A HREF="#LINKT28"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some may argue that it is too costly.  The Liberals and the 
solicitor general himself can say that it is too costly. However, 
we know that they do not have enough money on occasion to fix 
patrol cars.  They do not have enough money in some instances to 
provide adequate firearms for our officers.  A shocking situation 
is developing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Internationally we are increasingly vulnerable because of the 
erosion of policing agencies.  Other countries have recognized 
this point.  CIA and FBI reports have said that the United States 
of America is increasingly vulnerable because of the breakdown of 
law enforcement agencies in Canada.  This is something that we 
should all be ashamed of, quite frankly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I need not go into detail about the morale that exists within 
law enforcement agencies.  That is at the point where it is 
bottoming out as well to match the funding.  In April 1999 the 
chairman of the U.S. judicial subcommittee, Republican Lamar 
Smith, said that Canada was being used as a launch pad for middle 
eastern terrorists, biker gangs and crime families that use 
Canada's borders to sneak persons into that country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier this year the government put a little money back into 
fighting organized crime.  In government terms it was $15 million 
per year for the RCMP to target organized crime at three 
international airports:  Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver.  As was 
previously mentioned Halifax was left out of the equation.  It 
also put $19.5 million per year into Canada's anti-smuggling 
initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend the government for recognizing the need to put in the 
money, but oftentimes we see that it puts in money over a long 
period of time.  It makes a great deal out of the announcement, 
just like we saw in the throne speech and the red book before it. 
There were all kinds of promises about commitment but in the 
short term we need to stop the bleeding.  We need to put in the 
money now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This recognition by government is only the first step.  We know 
that law enforcement officers need that money now.  The DNA 
databank and the reopening of the RCMP training facility are 
great moves.  We commend the government for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The solicitor general spoke in his remarks about changes in 
legislation to the Corrections and Conditional Release Act and 
changes to the court system which would enable police officers to 
get witnesses before the court and provide them with greater 
protection to encourage them to testify. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one glaring omission.  I can sum it up in a very simple 
phrase.  We cannot keep people in prison longer and we cannot get 
them to court with greater ability unless police officers are 
able to catch them in the crime, bring them forward and get them 
into the system.  That simply is not happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian police information system was recently upgraded by 
the solicitor general.  With great pomp and ceremony he said that 
$150 million were being put into the upgrade.  We know, and RCMP 
officers themselves have stated it, that $280 million were needed 
for the upgrade to be effective.  Less than half the money 
required was put in by the solicitor general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the face of making these announcements about government 
spending, it is very apparent it has been spread far too thin 
over far too long a period.  The solicitor general always says 
that fighting crimes is their number one priority.  We on this 
side of the House are questioning that statement because it 
appears a lot of number one priorities are fighting for 
attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hear a plethora of platitudes from the solicitor general 
denouncing criminal activity and talking about changes in 
organized crime strategy, but all we are seeing are increased 
levels of bureaucracy and ossification from the solicitor 
general.  I truly question his grasp of his own department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see that there is not a co-ordinated effort.  Our agencies 
are not working together at the level that they should be because 
they are not getting leadership from the top.  They are not 
receiving leadership from this department.  They are not 
receiving leadership from various agents at the top like the 
director of CSIS who completely abdicated his responsibility with 
respect to lost documents.  Recently a CSIS agent was actually 
brought to task, but the CSIS director was completely untouched 
and, it appears, was complicit in the act itself and in the 
cover-up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the solicitor general has made promises to modernize 
the department and do everything he can to increase the funding, 
it is not happening quickly enough.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The member spoke of the anti-gang bill and the CCRA review. 
Again these are pale in comparison to the priority when it comes 
to the need to inject real resources, real quick.  Opposition 
parties, and I would suggest, provincial governments recognize 
this, and it is high time the government recognized it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to commend the Bloc Quebecois as well.  I want to commend 
the member for Charlesbourg who sponsored a private member's bill 
to get rid of thousand dollar bills, which are very popular among 
the drug trade.  As well, I again reference the member for 
Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot who stood up to real threats from drug 
producers in his part of the country.  I commend the member for 
his courage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are various elements of the criminal justice system that 
have to continue to work together, such as information sharing. 
Earlier in questions and comments I spoke about the privatization 
scheme which may be coming forward.  I hope that is not the case. 
The Liberals continue to pat themselves on the back for creating 
initiatives, but this self-aggrandizing and plagiarising of 
policy is the trademark of the Liberal government.  We have 
witnessed the GST, free trade and others.  It was the 
Conservative Party which actually kick-started many of the 
initiatives dealing with organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1989 and again in 1993 a former Progressive Conservative 
government passed four major pieces of legislation to assist our 
law enforcement community.  In 1989 the Conservatives passed 
proceeds of crime legislation, which was a first in Canadian 
criminal law history.  They passed legislation to help officers 
trace the flow of money diverted from criminal activities.  The 
former government passed the Proceeds of Crime Act in 1991. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Conservative Party also brought in legislation 
which dealt with the seizing of property.  A final initiative 
that I would reference is that of the organized crime bill, which 
had far-reaching implications and modified our Customs Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no doubt that this government has a high standard to 
live up to.  The solicitor general needs to recognize that more 
can be done by his department.  I hope he will do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I again cry out for the solicitor general to bring more tools, 
better and adequate legislation to address many of the problems. 
I thank the Bloc Quebecois and commend it for recognizing the 
need to discuss this matter now, ahead of an onerous, divisive 
debate which the Prime Minister would have had had he been able 
to provoke the Bloc in the way he tried.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I think the people reading <I>Hansard</I> or viewing this debate 
will note the collegiality which exists.  From time to time in 
the House we come up with a common objective, a common agenda, 
and clearly the issue of organized crime in Canada is one that 
every member of the House should be very serious about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member touched on the issue of the lost CSIS briefcase.  I 
think he may agree with me that the problem with respect to the 
action or inaction on the part of the government is probably best 
shown by what is or is not going on at CSIS. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the period of time the government has been in power, in 
addition to the lost briefcase, there was also the loss of a 
computer disk which was left in a telephone booth.  The solicitor 
general told us there was a review going on at CSIS by SIRC.  We 
then found out from the same paper that the chair of the SIRC 
committee, the overseeing committee, was informed of the loss of 
the briefcase through the newspaper, not by the solicitor 
general, not by anything kicking in, which should be kicking in, 
at the department.  But then we are told that the computer disk, 
in the so-called review— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Paddy Torsney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  Is the questioner opposite going to get to organized 
crime? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I would think the 
question is relevant.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it just shows that the 
Liberal member does not understand the connection, CSIS 
being able to uncover organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point I am driving at is that the person who discovered the 
disk in the telephone booth said that SIRC had not even inquired 
of them as to the circumstances surrounding the incident. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the hon. member agree with me that the government did not 
even have people at SIRC who were in the position of overseeing 
CSIS?  It was not until September 1999 that it finally appointed 
Bob Rae, Ray Speaker and Frank McKenna to three of the five 
positions.  It was not until November 15 that it finally got 
around to appointing, after years of the position being vacant, 
the inspector general of SIRC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the hon. member agree that it really belies this kind of 
inaction and the importance of CSIS relative to combating 
organized crime and getting intelligence? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for the question and I certainly agree that it is completely 
symptomatic of the breakdown in communication and the breakdown 
in terms of government recognition of the need for resource 
allocation in this area.  CSIS is very much involved in the front 
line battle against organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The examples that the hon. member has referred to were bad 
enough.  The bumbling type of activity that led to this lost 
information, which increased the vulnerability of some of the 
operations that CSIS was pursuing, was bad enough, but then to 
have that error exaggerated further by the CSIS watchdog, SIRC, 
not receiving the information, to use the phraseology of the 
Minister of Justice, “in a timely fashion”, but to read about 
it in the <I>Globe and Mail</I>, was absolutely abysmal.  Then the 
government does nothing about it or it waits weeks and weeks to 
do anything about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This watchdog, SIRC, which was unmanned in many ways, or 
unpersoned in many ways— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Paddy Torsney:</B>  Unstaffed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Unstaffed.  Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
hon. member for her politically correct question.  No substance, 
but political correctness has become the order of the day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point is, that watchdog cannot bite or bark unless somebody 
warns it that there is a problem, and that was not happening 
here.  In fact I would suggest there is ample evidence that there 
was a wilful effort to not let SIRC know that this blunder had 
occurred.  That is extremely problematic and the government is 
not reacting to this issue in a very responsible fashion.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
with some emotion to address the motion introduced by the Bloc 
Quebecois concerning organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few weeks ago, I hired a helicopter and was flown over my 
riding.  This proved to be a strange but enlightening adventure, 
as I now realize the scope of the phenomenon, just how much the 
gangs have taken over in Quebec and elsewhere in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In viewing my riding from the air, and in talking with 
colleagues afterward, I became aware that some 25% to 50% of 
fields in Quebec, and the same percentage in Ontario, have been 
commandeered by organized crime for the production of one of the 
best grades of cannabis in the world.  It has nothing in common 
with the pot of the 1970s, as it contains 7 to 30 times more 
hallucinogens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My flight, coupled with the discussions afterward, also opened 
my eyes to a very serious situation: the thousands of farm 
families terrorized year after year by organized crime, families 
prevented from enjoying their property in peace, from even 
going into their fields on pain of death.  Their lives and their 
children's lives are threatened, and they do not dare set foot 
in their fields because they have been booby-trapped and there 
could be an explosion.  These people have had enough, and they 
are appealing to us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have also seen that the problem in our cities is becoming more 
and more serious.  My colleagues referred this morning to the 
situation in Vancouver, Toronto and Montreal.  We are all aware 
that criminals are growing cannabis by hydroponics in a 
greenhouse or basement, or right out in the open in the middle 
of a city, and that there are shooting galleries all over the 
place.  This is becoming more prevalent in the city as well as 
in the country. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1240"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT32"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT32"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1240

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also realized something even more serious. The cannabis 
produced here is of such a high quality that it is often—and in 
fact increasingly so—traded for the same quantity of cocaine or 
heroin, for example on American markets. This means that the 
fields in Quebec, like those in Ontario and in other regions 
across Canada, are being used to smuggle huge shipments of 
cocaine and heroin on the Quebec and Canadian markets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since these drugs are smuggled in huge quantities, prices are 
low, which allows organized crime to sell it to children in the 
polyvalentes or high schools. Not only cannabis, but also 
cocaine and heroin, are found in the polyvalentes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is no surprise that, every year, there is an increase in the 
numbers of 12 and 13-year olds who use these hard drugs, and the 
children of anyone here could be among them. We should be very 
aware of this issue and its long term impact on our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to realize that organized crime makes money primarily 
from drug trafficking and production. The Canadian market alone 
generates $10 billion U.S. annually. The international market, 
which is controlled in part by some biker gangs in Canada, could 
reach $500 billion U.S. annually. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, drugs and organized crime are also the cause of 
several acts of violence in our society. For example, biker 
gangs are engaged in wars to control the drug market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Montreal, in 1995, an 11-year old child died because of these 
biker gangs and their turf war for a share of the drug market. 
It is not surprising, because it is worth $10 billion for Canada 
and $500 billion U.S. for the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our inaction also involves social costs.  For Quebec, Ontario 
and British Columbia alone, the costs related to the consumption 
of drugs are estimated at some $4 billion.  Our children, at the 
age of 12 or 13, are hooked on cocaine or heroin.  We have a big 
responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1994, no fewer than 79 murders have been committed in 
Quebec alone for the purpose of gaining control of the drug 
markets.  There have been 89 attempted murders, 129 cases of 
arson and 82 bombings.  In 1998, there were 450 acts of violence 
related to control of the drug market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each time such things occur, innocent people can die, just like 
the Desrocher child in 1995. 
We cannot let it go on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have started this fight and will continue it to the end first 
and foremost for my little Rosalie, but I do it as well for all 
children in Quebec and Canada.  I do not want them to be the 
next victims of these criminals whom we welcome here with our 
permissive laws and whose trade flourishes year after year 
because of our inaction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have got to know the RCMP a bit better recently, everyone will 
understand why, but all police forces are doing an admirable 
job.  They are competent and determined people.  Very few people 
would go to work with a smile if they faced the same environment 
as the police forces in Quebec and Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is their environment. They do not have the resources they 
need to go up against organized crime and the billions of 
dollars it can call up year after year to expand its operations. 
The RCMP budget shows $77 million under the heading of anti-drug 
activities, and $40 million under the heading of money 
laundering.  This is ridiculous, particularly since the budget 
has shrunk by 12% since 1994, while organized crime is 
increasing exponentially.  However great a job they do, their 
budget is in no way adequate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the same with respect to the agreement between the RCMP 
and the armed forces for the loan of equipment, including 
helicopters.  In the fight against drug traffickers, it is vital 
that there be hours of helicopter time available year after 
year.  For all of Quebec, there are 150 available hours.  Ten or 
twenty times that is needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, the Canadian judicial system is not helping.  Once 
again, these are competent, experienced people I have had 
occasion to deal with recently.  They have pointed out certain 
weaknesses in the judicial system.  By the way, I thank them for 
this information, for this wonderful contribution.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have identified five weaknesses in the legislation, but it 
will be up to the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights 
to identify many more and to find solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the sentences handed down are ridiculous.  Sometimes, 
they are shorter than the time it took to find people guilty and 
conduct an investigation.  This is becoming ridiculous, and the 
ringleaders are never charged, because it is not possible to 
make the charges stick. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sentences in Canada are so lenient, compared to sentences 
elsewhere in the world, that the country attracts criminals. 
Drug traffickers like to operate in Canada; I can see why, with 
sentences like that, which are much lighter than in the United 
States. They have a market in which their activities can 
flourish, unimpeded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Gang membership is not a crime under the Criminal Code, as it is 
almost anywhere else in the world.  It should be.  Belonging to 
a crime gang, or a gang recognized as such, is a crime and we 
ought to identify all 38 gangs operating in Canada, whether they 
are involved in drugs or something else, as such. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My response to the rights activists is this: the charter of 
rights and freedoms contains a notwithstanding clause, and I 
trust that the charter was put in place not to help criminals, 
but to help honest folk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must also be proven that the property of criminals has been 
obtained through criminal activity. 
Why do we not follow the example of the United States, where the 
onus is on the criminal to prove that his possessions, the fancy 
house, the boats and so on, that he owns although having no 
visible source of income, are not the proceeds of crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could have spoken of electronic surveillance, of the weakness 
of the clauses relating to money laundering.  I call upon my 
colleagues to support our motion.  The same thing could happen 
to them as happened to me and to the thousands of terrorized 
people living in fear of organized crime throughout Quebec and 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call upon them to support the Bloc Quebecois motion and to set 
themselves promptly to the task of fighting organized crime to 
ensure that families in Quebec and Canada can live in peace and 
quiet and in safety, and that they can enjoy their lives without 
having to deal with criminals who are out to get them or who are 
commandeering their property to produce the drugs that will 
eventually kill our children.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I will be very brief so that my colleagues can also get in a 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend this member.  He has faced just a horrific situation 
personally and at his family level.  I wish him and his family 
all of the best. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of the difficulties that he and his family have come up 
against because of the actions and the aggressiveness of 
organized crime against him, I wonder if he would agree with me 
that the government also has to take a look at the whole issue of 
protecting citizens who are going to come forward and be part of 
solving the problem with respect to organized crime and that in 
fact we should really be looking at beefing up the whole issue of 
our witness protection legislation and witness protection 
activities. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> Mr. Speaker, I agree with my colleague. I 
mentioned a number of problems with Canada's laws and the 
Criminal Code, but there are many others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why our motion calls on the House to instruct the 
justice committee to seriously consider the situation and the 
state and strengthening of these laws to make them really 
effective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said earlier that Canadian laws do not consider membership in 
a crime gang a criminal act, yet everyone knows how the 
organizations run and who is at the head of them.  However, 
because we are sticklers for rules, because we have a charter of 
rights and freedoms—which I respect—and because there are 
do-gooders in our society who say that we must be careful and 
apply the charter, we do nothing. 
The charter is not meant for criminals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same applies to warrants for wiretapping.  At one point, we 
have to stop being so soft.  Some wiretapping warrants, which 
are for six months or a year, require extraordinary action, even 
action that discourages all police forces.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is extraordinary, because I have seen determined, experienced 
and highly competent police dealing with equipment that is of no 
help to them. Most of all, there is the legal system, which 
allows criminals to laugh in everyone's face, because it is very 
permissive and full of loopholes. It even attracts criminals 
from other countries to come here to carry on their activities, 
because Canada is more permissive and Canada is a better place 
to do business, at least their kind of business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We as 
parliamentarians have got to put a stop to this. We have a huge 
responsibility, and we must take this responsibility seriously.

<P><A NAME="LINK42"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I just wanted an opportunity, like my colleague, to 
congratulate the member for Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot for what he is 
doing.  I think we could just about call him a Canadian hero. The 
member may jump at that and think it is an exaggeration, but I do 
not because when we take on organized crime, we have a serious 
problem, as the member is finding out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see the hon. member up in the gym and he is tailed by the 
RCMP.  I would not want that in my life and I do not think any 
Canadian believes that should be happening in Canada.  This 
should be too free a country for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the government, in accepting this motion, will also 
accept witnesses recommended by the opposition parties and be 
prepared to go to cities like Montreal, Quebec City, Toronto, 
Vancouver for committee hearings so we can get to the root of the 
problem in each of those cities and solve these problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could not let the chance go by to say that it is astounding in 
a country like this that organized crime is so deep it can get 
right up to the level of the House of Commons where it can make 
threats against a person and his or her family.  We should all 
take that seriously and make sure that does not happen again. 
Organized crime has to know the government and the people in this 
building are serious about ending organized crime in Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
should stop making this debate personal. I am no Canadian hero, 
but I would like us to think of the thousands of people who, 
because they are not parliamentarians, do not benefit from the 
protection of the RCMP or other police forces. We have to think 
of these people first. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what I found out. There are people who have been living 
in terror for years. A few weeks of terror is already difficult 
to bear, but nobody should have to live in terror for years. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  There is time for a 
very short question from the hon. member for Quebec. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK43"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, what I want 
to know, because it is often suggested, is this: regarding the 
control of marijuana fields by criminal gangs, if marijuana were 
made legal, would this not put criminals out of business? Could 
that be a solution? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like my colleague to comment on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am far from convinced that 
legalizing so-called soft drugs is the solution, and I will 
explain why. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Legalizing them would probably get organized crime out of the 
fields of Quebec and the rest of Canada.  There are, however, 
products that are substituted for this very high quality 
cannabis, and I am talking about cocaine and heroin.  Lowering 
the price of top quality Canadian cannabis would bring down the 
price of substitute drugs as well, possibly resulting in a 
situation where organized crime would go after a greater share 
of the market, because the price of hard drugs had dropped. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is lost in terms of profits, because some drugs have been 
legalized, could be made up for in increased numbers of hard 
drug users. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So I think this bears looking at.  But I am personally coming 
around to the idea that it would not be the solution, far from 
it, and it might make matters worse.  I think it is too easy to 
say that we are unable to do anything, because we are not 
putting in the necessary financial and legal resources, and to 
say that we will legalize what we cannot control 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the thin edge of the wedge to take everything we are 
unable to control and, when we are unable to find a solution, 
legalize it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think this is something we should avoid doing. 
<P><A NAME="LINK44"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I think it is 
extremely important to participate in this debate, as it deals 
with what will certainly be one of the most important issues in 
the next millennium. The Bloc Quebecois motion reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House instruct the Standing Committee on Justice and 
Human Rights to conduct a study of organized crime, to analyse 
the options available to Parliament to combat the activities of 
criminal groups and to report to the House no later than October 
31, 2000.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This debate is all the more important that it affects me as an 
elected member of parliament representing a riding located in 
central Quebec, where drug dealers have used agricultural land 
to grow the illicit substance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to congratulate my colleague, the member for 
Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, for his courage.  In spite of death threats 
on him and his family, he chose to continue his crusade against 
what he calls a real scourge.  It does take courage, but it was 
also his duty as member of parliament to protect the interests 
of his fellow citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot is the one who received 
death threats in this case, but other members of this House may 
also have received threats relating to their work, because they 
took their responsibilities and did their job as 
parliamentarians, as elected representatives of their fellow 
citizens. Now, they have become victims of violence. This is 
unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned earlier, in Quebec's central region and in the 
Montérégie, more than 50% of farmland is contaminated by the 
presence of cannabis producers who take advantage of corn crops 
to grow a very high quality product, which ranks among the best 
in the world. My colleague explained why it is important to act 
and to provide the necessary tools to police forces, in addition 
to strengthening our legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to take a brief moment to urge the solicitor general, who 
is responsible for the RCMP, to keep regional RCMP offices open. 
There is a threat hovering over our regions. A study was 
conducted and a report was produced, which indicates that 
regional RCMP offices, whose staff has great expertise in 
dealing with organized crime locally, might be slated for 
closure and their staff relocated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At present, everyone in the community, including municipal 
councils and chambers of commerce, is opposed to such a change. 
It just does not make sense. At a time when there is already a 
shortage of tools and resources to fight this scourge in our 
regions, the government lowers the boom by saying “We are 
closing your RCMP offices”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, these officers are working in close co-operation with 
other police forces, such as the Sûreté du Québec or the 
municipal police forces. Municipal police officers insist that 
the RCMP officers, who have expertise in this area, have to be 
kept in our regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliament has to deal seriously with this issue and realize 
that organized crime is rampant in Canada and around the world. 
We have to ask ourselves whether enforcement of current measures 
is enough. In the light of everything we heard this morning, I 
think not. Current measures are not enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois did an extensive study and sounded out 
several stakeholders, people responsible for enforcing current 
legislation. They are unanimous in saying that it is not enough.

done in terms of legislation. I feel it is important to mention 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Witness Protection Act now makes it possible for police to 
better protect people who co-operate to obtain evidence against 
criminal organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of the Criminal Law Improvement Act, police can more 
easily be involved in activities used as a front. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The anti-gang legislation, Bill C-95, which was enacted in April 
1997, includes the definition of gang in the Criminal Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Controlled Drugs and Substances Act gives police the power to 
conduct controlled drug sale and delivery operations through 
undercover agents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite all these legislative provisions, enforcement 
authorities seem to be unable to put a stop to criminal gang 
activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Drug trafficking is still the main source of revenue for most 
organized crime groups. 
Of all the activities related to organized crime, it is the 
illegal drug trade that has the worst consequences for Canada, 
given its social and economic effects and the violence that 
stems from it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In studies that try to give a dollar figure for the cost of the 
illegal drug trade in Canada, this cost ranges from a 
conservative estimate of $1.4 billion a year to almost $4 
billion a year for Ontario, Quebec and British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to mention the main difficulties encountered 
by enforcement authorities and crown prosecutors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On top of limited budgets, police organizations complain about 
the inability of the justice system to support their efforts: 
sentences are often shorter than the length of the 
investigation; the infiltration of criminal organizations by 
enforcement officers, which is very difficult because belonging 
to such organizations entails having committed criminal acts; 
the difficulty of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the 
accused became rich by committing a series of specific and 
identifiable criminal acts, a difficulty that could be 
eliminated by a reversal of the onus of proof; in some cases, 
the difficulty in exchanges of information between police forces 
and various departments, such as Immigration Canada and Revenue 
Canada; the inadequacy of provisions for the protection of 
witnesses and jurors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, in light of this brief overview of organized crime in 
Canada, it is important to take stock of these instruments to 
see which could be improved or complemented by new legislative, 
administrative, or financial measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I conclude by appealing to all members of parliament to vote in 
favour of this motion by the Bloc Quebecois, so that we can 
finally put a stop to this scourge. 
<P><A NAME="LINK45"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
hon. colleague mentioned earlier that some RCMP detachments 
could be dismantled in her riding of Drummond. We have heard the 
same thing about the RCMP detachment in the riding of 
Saint-Hyacinthe for the last year and a half. The government 
keeps saying that these are only rumours. Maybe, but these 
rumours are getting persistent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does my hon. colleague have any additional information about the 
dismantling of RCMP detachments? I just want to say, by the way, 
that this would be a major mistake, because we need these RCMP 
detachments to fight against organized crime for three main 
reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the RCMP officers working at these detachments are highly 
skilled. They have developed a bond with the residents and 
forged links of trust that are very important to the continuing 
fight against organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, their mere presence is a deterrent.

<A HREF="#LINKT36"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, this is like a game of chess. If a bikers gang builds a 
bunker somewhere, we need to have a police station nearby as a 
deterrent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, I want to know if the hon. member has heard any additional 
persistent rumours about the dismantling of RCMP detachments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pauline Picard:</B> Mr. Speaker, rumours are based on a report 
that is hard to get, and which may have been handed out to just 
a few people who have told us about its recommendations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report did recommend that RCMP detachments be closed in the 
areas of Drummond and Saint-Hyacinthe and in part of the Eastern 
Townships, near the border. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The RCMP detachment in my area was set up about 15 years ago, 
and officers are posted for good reason. They do an excellent 
job. Everybody, the chamber of commerce and the municipalities 
included, has passed a resolution asking the federal government 
to maintain this detachment, because the officers there have a 
close working relationship with the other police forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The situation is similar in the Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot area and in 
other communities near the American border, in the ridings of 
our PC colleagues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There had been rumours that there would be closures, but we have 
now learned that these rumours were based on an actual report. 
We are now being told that the Saint-Hyacinthe and Drummond 
detachments could be maintained, but, for the time being, there 
is no guarantee to that effect. 
<P><A NAME="LINK46"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jacques Saada (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to inform you right 
away that I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for 
Ahuntsic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will begin my speech with something that is rather unusual in 
the House, but I will do it anyway. I want to congratulate the 
Bloc Quebecois for putting forward this motion today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House instruct the Standing Committee on Justice and 
Human Rights to conduct a study of organized crime, to analyse 
the options available to Parliament to combat the activities of 
criminal groups and to report to the House no later than October 
31, 2000. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the French version, I would have preferred the word “choix” 
instead of “avenues” and the word “criminels” instead of 
“criminalisés”, but this is just a minor detail of a linguistic 
nature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could talk about all the initiatives our government has taken. 
I could also talk, for example, about the proceeds of crime 
control units, 13 of which were established across the country, 
one in each large urban centre. I visited the one in Montreal. A 
multidisciplinary team made up of lawyers, accountants and 
police officers works in that unit. It is an example of 
co-operation to fight organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could talk about the bill we have introduced to fight money 
laundering. We are the only G-7 country not to have done so, so 
far. I am glad we finally did it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could talk about Canada's leadership role in a pan-American 
group called MEM, chaired by the deputy minister of the 
solicitor general, Jean Fournier. This group's mission is to 
fight organized crime, particularly drug trafficking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could talk about Canada's participation in NORAD, the North 
American Air Defence, and the support of this organization for 
drug enforcement. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1310"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT37"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members are no doubt aware that I am the chair of the 
Canada—United States Standing Committee on Defence and that NORAD 
issues are of great concern to that committee. In this capacity, 
I had the opportunity to visit the NORAD facilities at Mount 
Cheyenne, in Colorado Springs. This is a technological marvel, 
especially the drug enforcement service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I might mention Operation Cisaille, which is so important in my 
region. Other members already mentioned it. In the Montérégie, 
this operation is highly important. The UPA, the stakeholders, 
the Quebec government, the Canadian government, members of this 
House, everybody agrees that this operation is a marvel of 
co-operation and efficiency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another example is the drug strategy developed by the Canadian 
government to combat drug supply, in other words the people who 
produce and sell drugs, and to limit the access to drugs. I am 
thus talking of prevention and of protection against supply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason I support this motion is that I do not accept that my 
colleague for Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot be threatened for doing his 
job. What threatens my colleague also threatens the 301 members 
of this House and the 104 senators in this parliament. This 
threat affects all of parliament. The life of the hon. member is 
torn apart. Such actions concern us all, and I reject them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason I support this motion is that I do not accept that 
senior citizens have their savings stolen as a part of a 
fraudulent telemarketing operation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support this motion because I cannot accept that children be 
robbed of their future by pushers who often are themselves the 
victims of organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We deplore child poverty and we know that, all too often, 
children go to school on an empty stomach, which is not the best 
way to start the school day. It is not conducive to learning 
either. The same can be said of drugs. A child who is under the 
influence cannot learn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why, as my colleague from Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot said just 
a moment ago, I believe we cannot skirt our responsibilities. 
Legalizing marijuana is out of the question; instead we should 
go after those who are responsible for that scourge that affects 
us all as a society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support this motion because I sincerely believe that we, as a 
government, while we are doing great things—and I do know we are 
doing a lot—must do even better. We must do more to fight 
organized crime, to deal with the globalization of organized 
crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard a lot about the Canadian initiative on human 
security. Canada is truly a leader in this respect. These are no 
idle words, it is true, Canada has taken the lead 
internationally in terms of promoting a new concept called human 
security. It is in that context that we are intervening abroad, 
that we are changing the definition of what a border is, and 
that we are questioning the very principle of non interference 
in the affairs of a foreign state. If human security is 
threatened, we avail ourselves of the right to interfere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is in the name of this same humanism that we must intensify 
our fight against organized crime.  It is in the name of this 
same humanism that every effort must be made to fight organized 
crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Parliamentary Secretary to the Solicitor General, I 
consider this a very important issue and have worked a lot on 
it.  I am delighted at the prospect of this motion, if it is 
adopted, giving me the opportunity to take even greater part as 
a member of the Standing Committee on Justice in formulating 
suggestions that, in my opinion, are fundamental at the dawn of 
the new millennium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I invite all my colleagues on this side of the House and the 
House as a whole to support this motion.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have a question for the hon. member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my province of Newfoundland, and in Atlantic Canada in 
general, we have hundreds of miles of coastline that is 
essentially unprotected and unpatrolled.  That coastline is very 
vulnerable to the importation of drugs, guns and all kinds of 
illegal activity.  Because of government cutbacks ports police 
have been eliminated.  It is a wide open invitation to the drug 
trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is government going to do to protect that kind of coastline 
when it has cut out the ports police and reduced the ability of 
the RCMP to do its job? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jacques Saada:</B> Mr. Speaker, I must say that protecting our 
coasts also means protecting air approaches to them.  In this 
regard, I referred in my presentation to the work we are doing, 
within NORAD in particular, to have support to block flights 
that could arrive here with drug shipments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would remind my colleague that we did indeed announce in the 
throne speech our intention to strengthen and support the public 
security initiative and, of course, the fight against organized 
crime is an integral part of this fight for public security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, I think that if my colleague has specific recommendations 
to make, he will understand that I am not in a position to give 
an answer now, when in fact I look forward to the working 
committee coming up with appropriate answers, but at the same 
time I would really like, once this motion has been adopted and 
the committee has begun its work, for him to take that 
opportunity to make them. 
<P><A NAME="LINK48"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
thank my colleague and I would like to ask him these three 
questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could he not make a commitment, while the Standing Committee on 
Justice is preparing its recommendations on legislative changes 
among other things, to not close any RCMP detachments in Quebec, 
starting with the one in Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot?  I agree with my 
colleague from Drummond that they are doing an excellent and 
much needed job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, can he assure us that his government is aware of the 
lack of police resources and is committed to putting a great 
effort into strengthening them?  This will let the criminals 
know that, when planting season starts in May, the fun is over 
and things will never be the same; they will no longer be the 
ones calling the shots? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, can he— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> Unfortunately, there is not 
enough time left for the third question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jacques Saada:</B> Mr. Speaker, I heard the same rumors as 
everybody else, but I must say that they are only rumors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague is asking me to take a stand on these rumors. It is 
absolutely impossible for me to do, and it is understandable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, it seems to me that the second question he asked me is 
extremely important. He alluded to the lack of resources 
available to the RCMP. Treasury Board asked an independent 
organization to make a study on the RCMP's levels of financing. 
This study will  show us what we must do to help the RCMP 
fulfill its mandate, which is getting larger every day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not forget that the DNA bank and gun control, for 
example, were added to its responsibilities. 
Many functions are being added to the RCMP's responsibilities. 
Consequently, we should perhaps ask if its resources are 
adequate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the report is made public, and considering what was said in 
the throne speech, I believe it would advisable to give the RCMP 
what it needs to fulfill its mandate. 
<P><A NAME="LINK49"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos (Ahuntsic, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, like my 
colleague, the parliamentary secretary, I would like to 
congratulate the Bloc Quebecois for this motion, and I will say 
that I support it wholeheartedly. It really is an excellent 
initiative, and I thank the Bloc for having given us the 
opportunity to address an issue which affects our children and 
the their future in our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to deal more fully with the activities of organized 
crime groups involved in drug trafficking. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1320"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT39"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a subject for which I have a keen interest. Just 
recently, there were reports in the newspaper about a police 
operation in the riding of Ahuntsic, in the northern part of 
Montreal. The operation, called Operation Embryo, led to 205 
charges being laid against two youth gangs. These young 
criminals between 19 and 25 years of age had been active for 
about two years in my riding and the neighbouring ridings, where 
through intimidation and harassment they sold drugs in 
elementary schools. 
They did not became gang members at 19. They had been recruited 
at a younger age by organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is exactly the kind of situation I want to avoid. This is 
why I approve of the opposition motion for an in-depth study. It 
will not go on too long, and I think it is a good idea not to 
give too much time to the justice committee. Even though I am no 
longer a member of that committee I can say that I keep an eye 
on justice issues and particularly this one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I personally want to congratulate the various police forces of 
my area and of Montreal North for this operation, which was a 
big success and helped to ensure the security of the population 
of my riding of Ahuntsic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government is keenly aware that most organized crime groups 
are very actively involved in drug trafficking. I just gave an 
example of the fact that they are recruit school children 
everywhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its recently published report on organized crime in Canada, 
the Canadian Centre for Justice Statistics found that nine out 
of ten organized crime groups are involved in drug trafficking. 
Moreover, drug trafficking is for these groups the primary 
source of revenue, a very lucrative source. According to the 
federal government's best estimate, the size of the Canadian 
market for illicit drugs would be between $7 billion and $10 
billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently, an study of the impact of organized crime published by 
the Department of the Solicitor General confirmed to what extent 
members of organized crime are involved in and help support 
illegal drug trafficking. 
Again, I want to support what was said by my hon. colleague, the 
parliamentary secretary, about what happened to our colleague 
from the Bloc Quebecois because he spoke out against criminal 
activities. He is faced with a terrible situation and I want to 
tell him that we all support his actions. We want to ensure that 
he will prevail against this organized crime group that has 
threatened his family. It is really deplorable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of all the activities associated with organized crime, it is 
illegal drug trafficking, as I said, that has the worst 
consequences for Canada, because of its social and economic 
impacts and the violence associated with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Studies to put a dollar figure on the cost for Canada of illegal 
drug trafficking estimate it at between a conservative $1.4 
billion a year and nearly $4 billion a year for the three 
provinces in Canada with the largest populations, namely Quebec, 
Ontario and British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we also take into account the fact that more than 93% of 
these groups resort to violence and other forms of intimidation, 
we get an increasingly threatening picture of the impact drug 
trafficking has on our society and, particularly, on our 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The costs to Canada are huge, if we also take into account lost 
productivity, illness, death, violence, crimes against property 
and robbery that can occur as a result of drug trafficking or 
use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Drug dependency has dramatic consequences on the life of people, 
and particularly on the future of our children. 
Trade and economic indicators cannot adequately measure the 
lives that are destroyed and the unrealized potential due to 
drug use nor the losses sustained as a result by society. The 
individual is not the only one that loses out. There is an 
impact on families, children, friends and  society as a whole.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When all is said and done, these intangible consequences could 
well be the worst damage caused by the illicit drug trade to our 
country and our communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Illicit drug use, we know, occurs mostly among children and 
have-nots. Street kids are particularly vulnerable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Cannabis is the most popular illicit drug in Canada. Cannabis 
consumption is said to have increased considerably in the last 
few years, and production of cannabis in Canada also seems to be 
on the rise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1985, Canadian marijuana represented 10% of the total supply 
on the Canadian market. In 1995, it had reached 50%. We have 
grown from cannabis consumers to producers and exporters in the 
last few years. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is absolutely horrible.  I am one of the members in the House 
of Commons who supports what the health minister has initiated in 
terms of doing studies to see whether the consumption of 
marijuana for health purposes should be decriminalized.  I 
support the Minister of Health in this study.  I hope that the 
conclusions will lead to the beginning of the decriminalization 
of marijuana in our society.  That is a personal opinion that I 
am giving on that issue. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government is fully aware of how bad the situation 
is. This is why it has adopted a series of measures to try and 
solve the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are encouraged by the co-operation between federal, provincial 
and municipal police forces to fight the illicit cultivation of 
marijuana. I believe that if marijuana consumption were 
decriminalized, we might see less crime related to its sale and 
purchase. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has taken a number of initiatives in order to 
ensure that there are tools that are needed by our crime 
enforcement forces across the country in order to fight organized 
crime.  I believe that other speakers before me have listed some, 
but I would like to list them again, because this question keeps 
coming up from the opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have invested $150 million for the RCMP to upgrade and 
enhance a national police information system.  We have invested 
$18 million for the national DNA data bank initiative, giving 
police a powerful tool against serious violent criminals, an 
additional $78 million to the national anti-smuggling initiative, 
which will combat illicit drug trade and an additional $15 
million annually to put more RCMP officers in Vancouver, Toronto 
and Montreal airports to ensure that the drug trade does not come 
in freely through our borders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government approved $13.8 million for the RCMP, to be used 
for workload increases in 1999 and 2000.  We established 13 
proceeds of crime units across the country in the RCMP.  The RCMP 
has recently created the new position of deputy commissioner of 
organized crime to oversee and co-ordinate the force's efforts at 
the national and international level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to say once again that I support this motion 100%, 
and I encourage all members of the House to give unanimous 
support to the great initiative taken by the Bloc Quebecois. 
<P><A NAME="LINK50"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I spoke just a couple of minutes ago about the feeling of 
camaraderie we have, but I cannot stay away from thinking about 
some of the comments a couple of government members, people who 
are in responsible parliamentary secretary positions, have made. 
For example, the preceding speaker to the last one talked about 
the proceeds of crime.  He must know that for every dollar 
collected, it is currently costing the government $1.40. In other 
words, there is no net gain there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other thing is, why has the government been so long, long, 
long in finally bringing forward a money laundering bill?  The 
government was talking about the Pan-American group and the NORAD 
group on combating drug trafficking while at the same time there 
were severe cutbacks to the enforcement capability of the RCMP in 
the lower mainland of Vancouver, where police cars could not 
roll, where the RCMP officers could not even use their 
cellphones.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It just goes on and on.  The question is simple and 
straightforward.  I believe everybody in the House is in 
agreement that this is an excellent initiative.  However, I have 
to ask a government representative, a government member, a 
parliamentary secretary, if this is such an excellent initiative, 
and it is, why it took the opposition to bring this initiative to 
the government for the government to finally get on the stick and 
start to do something. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for his question.  I believe he was not listening very closely to 
the comments of my colleague, the parliamentary secretary, who in 
fact stated all the different initiates we have taken over the 
years.  As former parliamentary secretary to the minister of 
justice I can also mention our crime prevention initiative of $31 
million and all sorts of other initiatives we have taken and will 
continue to take. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the member that we need more money.  That is 
exactly what we stated in the throne speech.   When the Minister 
of Finance brings forth his budget I believe there will be 
initiatives, although I will wait to hear what the minister has 
to say, that stem from our pronouncement in the throne speech of 
what we would like to do.  I encourage the hon. member to support 
the Minister of Finance and the government to ensure that there 
will be more funds to combat organized crime and the illicit drug 
trade.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the Bloc Quebecois for 
bringing this very serious motion to the attention of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should thank the previous speaker from the Liberal Party for 
her remarks but unfortunately rhetoric is cheap.  The hon. member 
should refer to a news release done by the Minister of National 
Revenue.  He referred to Bill C-18 which provides customs 
officers with the power to arrest and detain individuals 
suspected of having committed offences under the criminal code. 
Unfortunately the minister forgot to include Halifax and Halifax 
airport and harbour.  That is a piecemeal approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government made Clair, St. Stephen and Woodstock in Atlantic 
Canada part of this initiative but ignored the most important 
airport in Atlantic Canada and the most important harbour on the 
seaboard in terms of giving our customs officers the tools and 
the training with which to work and with which to protect 
themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately a while back the government got rid of the ports 
police as a cost cutting measure and gave the ports over to local 
police authorities.  The hon. member from Cape Breton said quite 
clearly that was a mistake.  RCMP and law enforcement officers 
across the country have been cut severely in terms of their 
resources.  Because of that organized crime has had more or less 
a free hand in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the hon. member's rhetoric is very important and 
although I appreciate her comments, will she be able to convince 
her government, especially in light of Bill C-18, that there are 
some serious flaws?  Will she encourage the revenue minister to 
include Halifax airport and the Halifax port in this very 
important initiative? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for his question.  I understand how committed he is to ensuring 
that his constituents have the necessary services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said in my speech and as the parliamentary secretary said, 
we are committed to ensuring that there are more funds.  As I 
stated, we have given more money to Vancouver.  I do not believe 
it was rhetoric.  I truly believe what I said and what was said 
by the parliamentary secretary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is committed.  We said that in the throne speech. 
I encourage all members to support the Minister of Finance and 
the Minister of National Revenue in the ongoing program to combat 
the illicit drug trade and to ensure that police forces across 
the country have the money to do their jobs properly.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want 
to thank the government members who are working with us today. I 
think all members of the House want this issue to be referred to 
the appropriate committee, because we all know too well that 
nowadays there are few problems more urgent and more serious 
than organized crime.

<A HREF="#LINKT42"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been following this issue very closely for several years 
now, because I was the member of parliament for 
Hochelaga—Maisonneuve in 1995 when, for the first time ever, a 
car bombing killed an innocent bystander, 11-year old Daniel 
Desrochers, who had the misfortune of being at the wrong place 
at the wrong time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was when I realized that we, as parliamentarians, have to 
fight organized crime. Organized crime does not come out of the 
blue. Not every society has to deal with this problem. There are 
certain conditions that foster organized crime. 
First, it happens in a wealthy society that has communications 
networks, airports and various means of transportation, because 
organized crime is interested in globalization and needs to do 
business and to connect with people on other continents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Organized crime is also rampant in bureaucratic societies. In 
that regard, we must acknowledge, even though our democratic 
rights are very dear to us, that the Canadian Charter of Rights 
and Freedoms and the legal guarantees stipulated in sections 7 
to 14 do sometimes undermine investigations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are facing a far from trivial paradox, since, as members of 
parliament and as members of Canadian society, we are dealing 
here with only about 200 individuals. 
As we know, there are in Canada 38 criminal biker gangs, one of 
which in particular, the Hell's Angels, is made up of less than 
200 individuals in Canada, but has fifteen chapters, six of 
which are in Quebec. These individuals and this highly criminal 
group have managed to beat the most clever strategies and to 
infiltrate all spheres of society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One must never forget that organized crime operates in stages. 
First, organized crime fights for a territory. This happened in 
Montreal in the early 1990s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then, organized crime turns to money laundering. One example of 
this stage is the Hell's Angels and the criminal biker gangs. 
In Canada we are now at this second stage. The Italian Mafia has 
mastered the third one. Once control over a territory has been 
gained and money laundering activities are going on, we move on 
to the third stage, to investments in both legal and illegal 
activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that we must all recognize that this situation allows 
organized crime to go on from generation to generation. The 
Hell's Angels have been around for 50 years and obviously they 
have an interface with lawyers, accountants and businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Montreal, for example, 83% of licensed beverage 
establishments are controlled by people with connections to the 
underworld. We must not imagine that the police do not know all 
this. 
Police officers are dedicated people; just like us, they want to 
fight organized crime effectively, but they do not have the 
resources they need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recently met a police officer, whose name I will keep to 
myself, who told me that tailing just one individual—for example 
when they know a person is a member of one criminal gang or 
another—can cost taxpayers from $400,000 to $600,000.  Do members 
really know how deep and widespread the problem is? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The interesting part in the motion of our colleague, the member 
for Berthier—Montcalm, is that it is not partisan; let me repeat 
how very grateful I am to all members in this House who 
supported the motion. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1340"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT43"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Organized crime can be found in Hochelaga—Maisonneuve.  It can be 
found in the Montérégie, in Alberta and in regions right across 
the country.  The only way to win against the modern version of 
organized crime is to work together, to create a common front 
made up of all members of parliament, an unbeatable common front 
because we will all stand united and determined in our fight 
against crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the justice committee will examine what they have done in 
Japan.  Naturally, the political context is not the same here as 
in Japan. 
I will say right away that there is no charter of rights and 
freedoms there. In Japan, groups similar to the Hell's Angels 
are not allowed to wear crests. Any public reference to this 
type of organization is prohibited. I think this is an 
interesting idea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, a police officer was telling me “You are quietly driving 
along highway 20, on your way to Quebec City. You know there are 
members of organized crime behind you going 40 kilometres an 
hour. Nobody is going to pass them. Nobody is going to dare pass 
them, because they are seen as something strong and invincible”. 
We do not have legislation to prohibit the wearing of crests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a myth surrounding the rise of these gangs. Never has a 
member of the Hell's Angels ever been kicked out of the gang, 
because of the incredible solidarity that exists within the 
gang. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Japan, which has had its share of problems with organized crime, 
has taken steps that have helped, I would not say to eradicate 
the problem—because it is not true and I would not want to imply 
that it is—but to control the progression of biker gangs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the idea of prohibiting any public reference to these 
organizations and the wearing of crests should be considered by 
the parliamentary committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was in the House at the time and I believe I was the first MP 
in 1995 to introduce a private member's bill following what 
happened to young Daniel Desrochers. We were truly convinced, 
all of us, the Liberals as well as people on this side of the 
House, that we needed anti-gang legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a problem though. We could not make it an offence  to 
belong to a criminal organization because, under common law, one 
cannot be found guilty by association. One can only be found 
guilty by virtue of one's acts, one's behaviour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could not directly declare a member of a group like the 
Hell's Angels a criminal. So we created a new offence called an 
organized crime offence. Today, we must recognize that in spite 
of all our good faith—and I am convinced everybody acted in good 
faith—the legislation has not produced the expected results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason for this is twofold: first, the offence itself is far 
too serious. An offence under the Criminal Code or any federal 
act is punishable by a five year jail term. Then the 
organization, whether formal or informal, must have a membership 
of at least five, and the individuals accused of the organized 
crime offence must have had a criminal record over the past five 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the theory of the three fives. 
The result of this is that unfortunately, in spite of the fact 
that police officers have solid evidence to present a test case 
before common law courts, we cannot at this point benefit from 
the work done on Bill C-95. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would have a lot more to say about organized crime, because it 
is an issue which deeply concerns me. My hope is that we will 
spare no effort and not give in to blackmail and intimidation. 
We should follow the example of some of our colleagues. What 
they did has shown us what we must learn on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am convinced that all the parliamentarians who take part in 
the work of the justice committee will do so in a spirit of good 
faith, determination and open-mindedness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we work together, in a non-partisan fashion, we will win the 
fight against organized crime.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I had a question for the previous speaker from the 
Liberal side but the question, in a little different form, is 
just as valid for the Bloc. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the problems we have in Canada is the severe cutbacks to 
the RCMP.  Some detachments are short 40 members and money is a 
problem.  At the same time, one of the initiatives the government 
claims it has taken to combat crime is the national gun registry 
with in the neighbourhood of $300 million already being put in up 
front. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hopefully the member for the Bloc has informed himself as to the 
usefulness of the gun registry.  In fact, the papers in Quebec 
today had some excellent articles on the national gun registry 
and its ineffectiveness.  I recommend that he reads some of those 
papers.  They are in French so it is difficult for me to get all 
of the different nuances.  However, it becomes clear that there 
are some huge problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would he agree with the solicitor general of Ontario who two 
weeks ago said that the government should scrap the national gun 
registry and put more police on the street to fight organized 
crime and some of these other things?  Would he agree that should 
be the tact of the government, to save those hundreds of millions 
of dollars, put it into fighting organized crime and putting more 
police on the street? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not agree that we should 
abolish the national firearms registry, because I think it is 
important, whether we are a politician in Alberta, Saskatchewan, 
Montreal or Winnipeg, to know whether there are firearms at a 
crime scene or any other place. I think the registry was one of 
the bill's good points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the operation of the registry, some members of our caucus 
have told us that there may be some technical problems. 
But this in no way detracts from the merits of a bill such as 
the one we supported, Bill C-68.  I agree with the principle of 
the bill and I think that all parliamentarians who are 
interested in helping to reduce violence in our society have a 
responsibility to support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I caution the hon. member against jumping to a facile 
conclusion.  Yes, more police resources are needed.  This is 
clear, and all members of the community who meet police officers 
are well aware of the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But organized crime is not just about police resources—it is also 
about evaluating evidence.  Since the Stinchcombe ruling in 
1994, the crown is now obliged to disclose all evidence.  This 
includes notes taken by police officers as well as all 
recordings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does it mean when evidence is disclosed?  It obviously 
means that it cannot be used in a subsequent investigation, and 
this makes the work of the police singularly difficult. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suppose it is the price of a full and comprehensive defence. 
I would say in closing that organized crime is not about police 
resources, but about evaluating evidence and legislation, as 
members on this side have realized. 
<P><A NAME="LINK54"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Denis Coderre (Secretary of State (Amateur Sport), 
Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I would like initially to applaud the 
initiative by the Bloc Quebecois on today's motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think, however, the debate should go a little deeper.  I find 
regrettable the remarks made by my friends in the Reform Party 
on the Firearms Control Act.  We should applaud the passing of 
this legislation, especially in light of the massacre at the 
école Polytechnique a few years ago.  I find such remarks rather 
regrettable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like my colleague from Hochelaga—Maisonneuve to tell me 
whether we should restrict the Canadian Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms.  Second, in his own view of things, would legislation 
on marijuana, for example, also have an impact on organized 
crime? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard:</B> Mr. Speaker, the question is relevant.  I think 
we have to consider this issue as parliamentarians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I were left to my own devices and had to decide only on the 
basis of what would best serve the interests of 
Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, I would not hesitate to say that we should 
use the notwithstanding clause and declare, for five years—this 
is what the notwithstanding clause provides; we can use it or 
not—but if we use it, we can declare the 38 existing motorcycle 
gangs outside the law for five years.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, I think this is something that must be used and considered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the subject of the legalization of marijuana, the link may 
not be so direct, because it is in hard drugs such as heroin and 
cocaine that organized crime deals.  I think we have to look at 
this.  Our colleague will recall the excellent work done by the 
member for Rosemont to have marijuana legalized for therapeutic 
purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have not decided whether we need go further. 
First off, I do not tend to think we need to.  But I think the 
parliamentary committee will give us all the latitude we need to 
hear people whose expertise is probably broader and more defined 
than mine. 
<P><A NAME="LINK55"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to take part in an important debate, as my hon. colleague from 
Berthier—Montcalm put it, given the expansion of organized crime 
in Canada and in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to stress how important the issue of organized crime is 
to the Bloc Quebecois. I am thinking of that the hon. member for 
Hochelaga—Maisonneuve who, in 1995, introduced an anti-gang bill, 
the hon. member for Charlesbourg, who put forward a bill on 
money laundering and $1,000 bank notes, and the hon. member for 
Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, who was not afraid to expose what farmers 
were going through and to stand up for them. I also want to 
commend the hon. member for Saint-Bruno—Saint-Hubert as well as my 
hon. colleague from Berthier—Montcalm for the contribution they 
have made on the motion before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois has been worrying about this important issue 
for a number of years, and I am also worried about it, because 
in my riding of Quebec, several gangs are fighting to gain 
control over the territory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today's debate is also about the quality of life and the 
security of the people. I want to remind those who are listening 
of Daniel Desrochers, the young boy who was the innocent victim 
of a car bombing in 1997. This most unfortunate incident 
prompted us to question the effectiveness of the tools at our 
disposal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In today's motion, we ask that the Standing Committee on Justice 
examine the various aspects of organized crime and recommend 
solutions to this problem. We know that organized crime is on 
then rise. Its control extends beyond alcohol and drug 
trafficking, to such things as the theft of luxury cars. 
Recently, we heard about a stolen luxury car ring. Is this 
related to organized crime? This must be investigated. Other 
things are stolen too such as trucks, luxury items, offensive 
weapons and counterfeit money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This problem exists throughout Canada. We know there are 38 
gangs across the country. That is why we are calling for more 
effective laws so we have the tools we need to fight organized 
crime. The tools we have now are not effective enough. Police 
officers also share that view. Several speeches were made this 
morning in which the issues of lack of funding or inadequate 
legislation were raised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now, several units have joined forces. I am referring to 
the Carcajou unit. There is also the anti-gang legislation that 
was passed, Bill C-95. 
It seems that we may have the necessary tools to meet the needs, 
but these tools must be re-evaluated or improved through 
increased funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under Bill C-95, the anti-gang bill, a criminal organization means 
any group, association or other body consisting of five or more 
persons having as its primary activity the commission of an 
indictable offence for which the maximum punishment is 
imprisonment for five years or more. The bill created a new 
offence.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those who belong to criminal organizations must be judged the 
same way as those who commit criminal acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also want improved tools to fight money laundering. The $1,000 
bills in circulation largely favour organized crime. There 
could be some improvements in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As regards the dubious transactions conducted through the banks 
or investments made in the various casinos, the police could be 
informed in the event of a reasonable doubt—not in the case of 
an honest individual who invests or purchases with $10,000, but 
when there is doubt about the source of the money—so they may 
be equipped to pursue the individuals or at least investigate 
the source of those assets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They say the police are impotent when it comes to alcohol and 
tobacco smuggling. <I>La Presse</I> had an article on this in fact. 
That does not mean that they do not do an excellent job, but if 
we could give them a hand through certain legislation in doing 
their work and improving what they are doing, it would be great, 
since we know that the heart of the issue are people's quality 
of life and security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They even say that at the federal department of justice they did 
not know how to remedy the failings in the law that prevent the 
police in their investigations from buying smuggled items such 
as cigarettes and alcohol.  When the police infiltrate a band 
involved in organized crime and cannot buy the alcohol or 
cigarettes, there is doubt within the band—

when, as the Prime Minister has said, it is not enough to amend 
its constitution?  In order to amend the constitution of the 
Reform Party, what is needed is a resolution amending the 
constitution, including the principles of the party, which to be 
carried must receive not only a two-thirds majority of the votes 
cast, but must also receive a majority vote of the delegates from 
a majority of the provinces.

Minister has a brand new word in his vocabulary.  The word is 
clarity.  He goes around everywhere talking about it, but does he 
not understand that the word clarity means putting his position 
out on paper so that everybody can see what it is? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask again, for the sake of clarity, if 50% plus one is not 
sufficient, what exactly is a clear majority for the Prime

to say anything.  They are the same people who, less than a week

them relax a bit because flip-flops like that cause problems to 
their physical and mental fitness.  Maybe before Christmas they 
will come to their senses and say that we were absolutely right 
in doing what we are doing at this time.

understands that the public does not want a referendum, that the

political career is characterized by his determination to put 
Quebec in its place? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How could the Prime Minister think we would take his offer 
seriously, considering that he is the one who imposed the 1982 
Constitution, the one who killed Meech, the one who, through his 
social union, infringes on Quebec's constitutional 
jurisdictions, and the one who now wants to change the 50% plus

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Really, Mr.

powers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But I clearly remember that the Parti Quebecois voted against 
the Meech Lake accord. At the time, the member for Roberval was 
an MNA and he voted against the Meech Lake accord. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do they not assume their responsibilities? Why do members of

the Prime Minister is one of these people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the weekend, the Prime Minister spoke like a statesman 
and said he was offering a truce to Mr. Bouchard. However, he 
behaves like a Liberal Party leader who wants to denigrate 
Quebec, who wants to please the rest of Canada in anticipation 
of the next election.

he just did.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

when we formed the government we worked very hard to improve the

</I></B></P><P align=left>What were the considerations at that time?  We said that we had 
to improve the deal for the protection of workers' rights, for 
the protection of the environment, and for the protection of

that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is 
a sham.  No wonder the Prime Minister does not want to talk about 
the WTO. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister knows that the enforcement mechanisms of the 
WTO are much stronger.  When it comes to defending Canadian 
product abroad, and that is very important, the government goes 
to the WTO.  Why?  Because it has teeth.

was enough.  He has said nothing since last Tuesday.  In his own

what the Prime Minister did with the Meech Lake accord and what 
he did in 1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Prime Minister is not backing up, could he listen to what 
the Quebec premier said about there being no referendum in the

<P><A NAME="LINK133"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of

because these clouds and allegations are hanging over his head,

</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, the minister issued a statement yesterday in which 
he said “According to the information provided by my official

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday, when we brought to the attention of the government the 
serious allegations of electoral wrongdoing by the international 
trade minister, the government House leader urged me to bring 
these allegations to the attention of the commissioner of 
Elections Canada, and I have done so.  Unfortunately, the 
commissioner cannot prosecute because two years have passed since 
these events occurred. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government House leader knows about this problem between the 
passage of time and the alleged incidence.  What will he do to 
make sure that this tarnished reputation is restored to the 
minister and an investigation takes place? 
<P><A NAME="LINK145"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the reputation of the minister 
in question is not tarnished.  Perhaps there are attempts to do 
so on the part of some, but the minister's reputation is 
untarnished and it will remain untarnished. 
<P><A NAME="LINK146"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, he 
can wish the problem was not there.  He can wish the allegations 
were not in the press and being circulated amongst Canadians but 
they are there and that is a fact.  I wish it was as easy as the 
Government House Leader would have us believe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Order, please. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</B>  Mr. Speaker, if the government side 
would listen, the allegations are a fact of life.  They are out 
there.  They are in the media.  They are being circulated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government House leader knows that section 279 of the 
elections act clearly prohibits the commissioner from prosecuting 
any offence that happened during the last election.  He is 
prohibited from prosecuting.  He cannot do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government House leader's advice to the House yesterday is 
not useful.  An investigation should take place.  It should be 
designed, I hope, to clear the minister's name.  Does he not 
realize that we should immediately start an investigation to get 
to the bottom of these allegations?

in the jobs fund.  Today a Liberal member blew the cover on how 
the HRD minister broke the rules to use a cool million of other 
people's money to lure a business to her riding away from a 
higher unemployment area next door. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the minister think that she has the right to rip off the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, at the minister's invitation let us look at her track 
record.  There were huge jobs fund grants that her riding did not 
qualify for, half a million dollars from the secret minister's 
reserve, and jobs moved from Hamilton so she could claim job 
creation in Brantford. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we have $1 million refused to Sarnia but wrongfully spent in 
her riding next door.  It is incredible that a minister in a

been so pathetically weak and timid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today the auditor general reports that the government has no 
idea whether or not the provinces are complying with the Canada 
Health Act.  The health minister has no idea and no way of 
knowing if the provinces are playing within the rules governing

provinces, where it is going and what impact it is having. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it not time for the minister to seize control over his

today about how the government handled an outbreak of food borne

government has really learned anything and changed its ways from 
the spring of 1998 when it happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday we learned about a potentially dangerous outbreak of 
botulism in cattle in New Brunswick.  Today we see that the 
government has again risked safety by fast tracking approvals for 
Monsanto on genetically altered foods.

Speaker, in 1997 the EI surplus was $7.5 billion and now it is 
almost $25 billion.  Today the auditor general criticized the 
handling of that fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is time for the government to realize that this 
surplus is not for its own use.  It is an insurance fund that 
belongs to the employees and employers, and they are entitled to 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How high will this surplus have to get before the government

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

have cut the premiums to $2.40.  They were at $3.70 when we took 
office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, as was mentioned in the Speech from the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour (Beauséjour—Petitcodiac, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, if the fund is so great and if they are doing so well 
with it, why do we have such a surplus and so many people who do 
not qualify or go with no income for so long?  I do not 
understand how the government can justify doing to this fund what 
it is doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could someone on the government side explain to Canadians why we 
have such a surplus and why we have so many people going with 
nothing? 
<P><A NAME="LINK167"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, when we took office there was a deficit of some $6 
billion.  In 11 of the last 17 years there has been a deficit in 
the fund.  The reason for the accounting treatment is that it was 
recommended by the auditor general in 1986 and we are following 
that policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member asks why there is a surplus.  The reason is, as 
we have seen today, that we are firing at all cylinders in our 
economy.  There are 1.7 million Canadians back at work, 700,000 
in the last year.  Young Canadians are back at work.  We have one 
of the strongest economies of any of the G-7 countries.

a private member's bill on the withdrawal from circulation of

</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of Bloc Quebecois members really contributed so that 
real thought is going into the eradication of organized crime. 
We know that there have been a number of turf wars over control 
of the market, including the drug market.  We read in our 
newspapers of fires, bombings and murders.  We must look after 
people's security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have some idea of the scope of drug trafficking.  Judging by

many people.

make it possible to look at the various pieces of legislation, 
the various tools, and the funding of law enforcement agencies. 
We are thinking of the RCMP and of the police forces in the 
various communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that it is very hard, for instance, to infiltrate these 
groups.  Is the legislation adequate?  Could all legislation not 
be reviewed in order to make it less unwieldy? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know very well that there are victims of organized crime in 
our society, and those victims include not always gang members, 
but ordinary citizens as well.  Someone in my riding was hit by 
a bullet during a turf war.

</I></B></P><P align=left>If I can do anything to contribute to the committee study, I 
will be very pleased to do so, particularly since safety is 
involved, the public's safety and the very lives of our 
children, and since drug trafficking wreaks such a terrible toll 
on the health of our young people.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
first, I would like to congratulate the member for Québec. I 
believe she has a very good grasp of the whole issue of 
organized crime in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Québec has often condemned this situation in 
caucus and, more importantly, asked that something be done in 
the House to fight organized crime. I understand full well her 
concern and the approach she advocated in her speech. She made 
an excellent speech, by the way, and I believe she has a very 
good grasp of the whole issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question for the member is rather simple. As we know, she is 
very much involved in the issue of poverty and she fights for 
people living in poverty. 
Here is the question I would like to ask her: Does organized 
crime not take advantage of poor people or does it not exploit 
people in need, for instance with its loan sharks or 
any other example the member is aware of? I would like to hear 
her thoughts on the issue of poverty as opposed to crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for 
his question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, we all know that there are a good number of loan shark 
networks in poor communities and we also know that interest on 
such loans can go as high as 250%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also deplore the illicit drug trade. We are well aware that 
often, in poor neighbourhoods where there is high unemployment, 
this trade is very much oriented toward a clientele for whom 
this can be an escape from the problems of daily life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also know that the organized crime cannot function without 
drugs pushers. People become pushers because it is an easy to 
make money. But we also know that the social impact is enormous. 
I feel particularly concerned because, I know that this is a 
scourge that has major consequences on people's lives, on their 
quality of life and on their health, as well as on the living 
conditions of families and children who make a living dealing 
in drugs and those who are led to use drugs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that society has better things to do and to say 
that to deal with drug trafficking. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK189"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I will be sharing my time with the member for 
Waterloo—Wellington. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to begin by offering congratulations to the Bloc and to 
the member for Berthier—Montcalm for putting forward a motion 
which finally, on an opposition day, the government can support. 
What a treat.  This has been done in a responsible way, which 
uses the parliamentary system to its best effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion asks that the House instruct the Standing Committee 
on Justice and Human Rights to conduct an investigation.  There 
might be some concern about committee members being instructed, 
but I am quite sure they will look at this as the will of 
parliament to conduct a study and report by the end of October 
2000.  That is a reasonable timeframe, which will give the better 
part of a year to hear witnesses, to perhaps travel on the issue, 
to conduct the investigation and to report.

<A HREF="#LINKT62"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder what this motion would look like if it was put by the 
Reform Party.  I strongly suspect it would be framed in such a 
way that it would make it impossible for any of us to support it. 
They would use terms like the government has abdicated its 
responsibility and so on and, therefore, we should do this study. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to give credit where credit is due because I have stood 
in the House and been somewhat critical of members of the Bloc in 
the past.  I think what they are putting forward is a responsible 
position.  I know that they come to this issue with some serious 
deep seated concern in the province of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have all heard stories of the biker gang wars in Quebec. 
There have been murders.  There is drug trafficking. They take 
over homes and destroy neighbourhoods.  They threaten people 
going to the corner store, for goodness sake, to get a jug of 
milk.  Women and children do not feel safe in communities when 
that type of local terrorism, which is really what that amounts 
to, is allowed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the Bloc comes to this issue with a point of view of 
perhaps some negative experience in this area and the problems 
around organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to come at this a little differently, though.  I believe 
that the long term, big picture way for us to attack organized 
crime, frankly, is to deal with our kids, our education system 
and our families.  We have to work harder at eradicating poverty. 
I know there will be some who will say that we have not done 
enough.  However, as we on this side of the House know, the 
government is committed to coming in with some programs that will 
deal with child poverty in the upcoming February budget.  I am 
confident that there will be programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason I think one fights something as insidious as 
organized crime by dealing with our young people is because the 
very nature of an organized criminal group is they look for 
people who are vulnerable.  They look for people who are 
impressionable.  They look for people, whether it is in illegal 
gambling, whether it is in drugs, whether they get young girls 
who are impressionable and lead them astray and get them involved 
in prostitution with promises of great money and beautiful 
clothes and things of that nature, or they get young people out 
of schools involved in selling drugs in the community, they 
encourage them through establishing a mindset that says it is 
cool to be part of an organized group. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thinks about the gangs and the problems that we see.  We had 
a terrible tragedy in the greater Toronto area a couple of weeks 
ago when a young boy was kicked to death by a gang of young 
people.  It is incomprehensible.  What could possibly make these 
young people react like that?  Tragically, we have seen it in the 
past.  A young girl was kicked, bludgeoned and beaten to death by 
other young girls.  Violence in the female education system for 
young girls, in my opinion, is becoming a crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can put in place all the RCMP and all the police assistance 
that we want in communities, but we must address the basic 
fundamental attitudes of young people and tell them that they 
have to respect one another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday, I was at Ploughman's school in Mississauga speaking 
to four grade five classrooms. They got together in the library. 
I was amazed to hear the questions coming from these young kids 
in grades 4 and 5, asking me about the problems of violence in 
the schools and what the government can do to combat it.  They do 
not feel safe in their own community; a community full of 
families, young people raising their families.  Kids at that 
tender age worry about this.  I am sure they hear their moms and 
dads talking about it around the kitchen table.  They do not 
understand how somebody who is perhaps 10 years older than them 
can actually go to the extreme of kicking someone to death.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can put something in place.  In fact this government has done 
a number of things which I would share with the House from a 
crime fighting standpoint. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to stress that I do not think that this debate is about 
the government standing up and strutting its stuff, saying 
“We're really tough on this issue”.  Nor is it about the 
opposition standing up and saying “You're not tough enough”. 
What this debate should be about, in my respectful submission, is 
how we build and create a safer community.  How do we get the 
drug lords?  How do we get the smugglers, whether they are 
smuggling cigarettes or guns?  I know it is a controversial issue 
with some members on the other side, but it is about issues such 
as gun control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the basic, fundamental principle in the values of Canada 
and Canadians?  Do we simply want to be like the Americans?  Do 
we simply want to pander to the gun lobby group, or do we want to 
put in place laws?  Yes, they will be difficult to enforce. Do we 
want to put in place a registry?  Yes, and it will be difficult. 
The criminals obviously are not going to register their guns.  We 
understand that, but we have seen so many tragedies in this 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that the insidiousness of organized crime just sits 
there and stirs the pot.  The way for us to combat that, in 
addition to the many programs that have already been announced, 
is to get to the hearts of our young people.  I hope that members 
opposite will see this as I do, and as many Canadians do, as an 
issue that we all need to work on together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not just about giving the Mounties more money.  In fact, 
in my own community at Pearson International Airport the GTAA has 
entered into an agreement with Peel Regional Police to provide 
policing services to Pearson airport so that the RCMP can free up 
more of its contingent to deal with the serious problems that 
occur at such a major international entry point to this country. 
That is a good, responsible, community partnership.  That makes a 
lot of sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Peel Region is where the airport is located.  The Peel Regional 
Police wind up with many of the problems once they leave the 
airport grounds.  They wind up with the problems.  Whether it is 
organized crime or crime of any kind, Peel Regional Police will 
have to deal with it.  Why not have them at the point of entry 
dealing with it immediately and put in place the systems and 
understanding of the flow that occurs when criminals come in? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other side of that coin, at a time when all governments 
are facing great financial pressures, it frees up an opportunity 
for the RCMP to concentrate on crimes that are perhaps more of an 
international nature, such as smuggling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, you are indicating that I have one minute 
remaining.  I wanted to talk about the people smuggling that we 
have seen recently, but I am not going to have time to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me just say that it is important that we focus our energies 
in the area where in a long term, big picture way we can actually 
eradicate organized crime.  We can convince our young people in 
our schools and communities that it is not an acceptable way and 
that they must respect their colleagues, their friends and their 
schoolmates.  They must not turn to violence as a way of solving 
a problem.  It is easy to say those things, but it is places like 
this, with responsible motions such as this one being put forward 
by the opposition with an opportunity to debate it, where this 
kind of issue can begin to be solved.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Diane St-Jacques (Shefford, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, first, I would 
like to thank the Bloc Quebecois for bringing forward this 
motion on organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As is the case for many of my colleagues, organized crime 
directly affects the riding of Shefford I represent. And like my 
colleagues from Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot and Drummond, Shefford is 
part of the triangle of fertile agricultural land ideally suited 
for growing marijuana. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have listened very carefully to today's speeches, especially 
those on the rumours regarding the closure of the RCMP 
detachments, because the one in Granby is included in the 
detachments that are to be closed, according to these rumours.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Since February 1999 we have been stepping up our efforts, our 
requests to the solicitor general. Also, in May, people in my 
riding sent a petition to parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Solicitor General of 
Canada said in answer to a question by a Bloc Quebecois member 
that he did not comment on rumours. I would like to point out 
that these are no longer rumours, as I saw the report on the 
proposed organizational restructuring of division C, which is 
dated August 16. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It recommends the closure of seven RCMP detachments in Quebec 
including Granby, St-Hyacinthe, Valleyfield, the Magdalen 
Islands, Roberval, Baie-Comeau and Joliette. 
I also happen to know that the rapport was favourably received 
by the solicitor general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is for my colleague from the Liberal Party. Is he 
aware of this report and, if so, does he support these 
recommendations? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am sorry, I was not sure 
if the member was going into a speech or was asking a question. 
I will try to answer if I can.  I would have to look at those 
recommendations in some detail and would be pleased to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She talked about the closing of police stations in her community 
and the impact that that can have.  I understand that because we 
have gone through it as well.  What our police force has done is 
gone to a more community based policing.  We are trying to get 
officers into the communities, the malls, the plazas and the 
schools, which fits right in with the comments that I made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not having seen the report she is referring to, I may not have 
answered the member's question.  I do think that policing is 
about the entire community working together and understanding the 
dynamics and the problems that occur when young people do not 
have an opportunity to interact properly with the police force 
and the community. 
<P><A NAME="LINK191"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am very pleased to rise today in support of the motion to ask 
the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights to study the 
issue of organized crime and analyze the legislative avenues open 
to parliament to fight against activities of criminal 
organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have 10 years experience in police service.  As the former 
chairman of the Waterloo Regional Police, I find this of 
particular interest.  It is certainly one where all Canadians 
look for leadership from their federal government to ensure our 
communities, wherever they are in this great country, are safe 
and secure for themselves and their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Public concern over organized crime is not limited to any one 
part of Canada.  The RCMP reports that there are biker gang 
activities and criminal enterprises in several parts of this 
country.  Indeed, the gang problem goes far beyond outlaw biker 
groups.  In addition to biker gangs, there is a host of organized 
crime groups that operate and prey upon the weak in their own 
communities and on Canadian society.  That is unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is commonly known that organized crime is actively involved 
in trafficking in illegal drugs.  Last summer all of Canada saw 
firsthand how organized criminal snakeheads were callously 
smuggling Chinese people on rusty old ships to our shores.  This 
is unacceptable as well.  It is perhaps less well known that they 
are also involved in environmental crime, like illicit waste 
treatment and disposal, trade in endangered species and ozone 
depleting substances.  They are involved in economic crime like 
white collar crime, for example, such as security fraud and 
telemarketing fraud.  We also know that they are involved in the 
sale of counterfeit products, in violation of intellectual 
property rights and software piracy, money laundering and motor 
vehicle theft for export or for parts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are those who claim that the police are powerless to fight 
organized crime.  Some argue that the police need more money. 
Others argue that they need less.  I think we should find out 
what the facts are in this case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been two years since parliament considered and enacted 
any gang legislation.  The provisions contained in Bill C-95 
originated in discussions with the police community and other 
members of the justice system in September 1996 when the then 
minister of justice and the solicitor general held a national 
forum on organized crime.  This event brought together 
representatives from the police community, the federal and a 
number of provincial governments, the legal community, private 
industry and academics to examine the increasingly complex 
problem of organized crime in Canada and to recommend integrated 
and effective measures to address it. 
Participants examined the feasibility of legislation that would 
provide new tools to the police, prosecutors and courts to combat 
organized crime.

<A HREF="#LINKT65"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must recall another factor that led to the enactment of Bill 
C-95, and that is the public's revulsion at the violent events 
associated with a turf war between two rival biker gangs,  the 
Hell's Angels and the Rock Machine in Quebec, in which not only 
members of the gang but also innocent bystanders were tragically 
affected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation that followed Bill C-95 enacted new powers in 
relation to the interception of private communication, proceeds 
of crime and property used to commit offences and other things. 
It also outlined for the first time in Canadian criminal law a 
definition of a criminal organization and created a new offence 
of participation in a criminal organization offence.  This 
legislation has been in force now for two years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This may seem like a long period of time to some, but I 
understand that a typically complex organized crime investigation 
takes several years to progress to the point where charges are 
laid.  In fact, I know that to be the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nevertheless, some of these investigations directed at criminal 
organizations using the tools provided in Bill C-95 have now been 
completed.  Charges have been laid and prosecutions are 
proceeding.  Indeed, there have been convictions.  Reports have 
appeared in the media in recent weeks regarding some of these 
prosecutions, notably in the provinces of Quebec, Manitoba and 
Alberta. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important, however, to ensure that the provisions of Bill 
C-95 are well understood.  Not every case is appropriately 
pursued as a criminal organization investigation or a 
prosecution.  It is not intended to be the only tool used to 
combat organized crime.  It is built on the tools already 
available in the criminal code and responded in particular to 
investigative and prosecutorial challenges posed by criminal 
organizations.  These are specialized tools in that sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Justice officials have been working in co-operation with the 
solicitor general's department to provide training to police and 
prosecutors regarding the contents of the criminal organization 
legislation.  Justice officials have provided full day and half 
day training sessions across the country to over 500 members of 
the provincial and federal police and prosecution services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Law enforcement must be careful to ensure that powerful but 
integrate powers provided for in legislation are not used 
inappropriately or unnecessarily. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee may want to assess the extent to which the 
provisions are being used and their effectiveness.  If there are 
ways to improve upon the manner in which the legislation is used, 
we should facilitate the sharing of these best practices. If 
there are improvements in the legislation that could be 
considered, we should assess them collectively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In another area of organized crime, combating telemarketing 
fraud remains a priority for the Government of Canada, in 
particular within the context of its organized crime agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the 1997 binational report, Canada in partnership with the 
United States has made significant strides in combating 
cross-border telemarketing fraud.  The major legislative 
developments include Bill C-20, which recently added the new 
offence of deceptive telemarketing to the Competition Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also includes Bill C-51, which amended the criminal code to 
link the new deceptive telemarketing offences in the Competition 
Act to the criminal code scheme authorizing the seizure and 
forfeiture of proceeds of crime for enterprise crime offences. 
This amendment now allows the significant proceeds generated by 
many telemarketing schemes to be captured. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, Bill C-40, which amended the Canada Evidence Act and 
the Extradition Act to provide for the use of video linked 
testimony to be given at criminal trials and at extradition 
hearings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are building on our successes and will continue to combat 
telemarketing fraud through public education, information sharing 
and co-operative law enforcement using the new legislative tools 
that we have developed over the past year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before concluding, I would also like to address the issue of 
acts of intimidation directed against key players in the criminal 
justice system.  My colleagues in the House will know that the 
concerns have been voiced with regard to this issue of 
intimidation directed against officials responsible for the 
investigation and prosecution of crimes:  judges and persons 
responsible for the administration of sentences of convicted 
offenders, as well as members of the public who become involved 
in the criminal justice system as informants, witnesses or 
members of juries.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The intimidation of justice participants is purpose-driven.  The 
purpose is either to interfere with the ability to secure a 
conviction against the accused or, in the case of an 
organization, against other members of the organization in the 
future, or to exact revenge.  It is intended to destabilize the 
criminal justice system, particularly where the prosecution of 
organized crime is concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is acting in this area and the Department of 
Justice is currently examining this issue.  It is consulting with 
representatives of federal, provincial and municipal police 
agencies, federal and provincial prosecutors, federal and 
provincial correctional officers and officials and judges in all 
parts of Canada.  The object of this exercise is to determine the 
scope and severity of the problem of intimidation and to develop 
an appropriate legislative response.  I applaud this initiative. 
It is important for all our communities in terms of making them 
safer and more secure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude by observing that organized crime is a pressing 
problem which takes various and many forms.  The international 
community has identified the fight against organized crime as a 
priority issue.  The Canadian government has taken a similar 
position, and rightfully so.  It is important for all Canadians 
to have us move in this very important area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us see if the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights 
can identify legislative avenues that can be effectively pursued 
by parliament to win the fight against the activities of criminal 
organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think this motion is most in order.  It is useful and we 
should get on with passing it to make sure it goes to the 
committee where we can examine these and all important issues 
relating to organized crime.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to ask my colleague a question because he is the chair 
of the Standing Committee on Health, of which I am a member.  I 
know that he has shown a wonderful sense of fair play, and it is 
a great pleasure to work with him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last report of the Criminal Intelligence Service Canada 
described organized crime as making $10 billion annually from 
drug trafficking, and an estimated $400 million from the sale of 
jewellery on the black market.  Every year, fraudulent credit 
card purchases total close to $80 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for economic crimes—the hon. member referred to 
telemarketing—losses are in the neighbourhood of $4 billion. 
Fraudulent use of credit cards accounts for something like 
$127 million.  Between 8,000 and 16,000 people are smuggled into 
Canada illegally every year.

considered in our efforts to more effectively combat organized 
crime?  It is not just a question of additional resources for 
the police, but all options must be considered, including—and 
this is something I think the committee will have to look at—the 
Japanese model, which prohibits the public display of crests and 
badges belonging to biker gangs, up to and including possible

<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. gentleman 
opposite for his question.  It seems to me that what the motion 
today is saying is that by referring the motion to the justice 
and human rights committee we should analyze the legislative 
avenues open to parliament to fight against the activities of 
criminal organizations and then report back to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the question is, should we take a look at the variety of 
options available to the committee and ultimately to parliament 
and all parliamentarians, it seems to me that we should.  We 
should take a look at the kinds of things that we as a society 
and we as parliamentarians should do in order to curtail criminal 
activity wherever it may be in this great land of ours.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As a former chairman of the Waterloo Regional Police, I can tell 
the House first hand that police services across our great 
country need parliament's assistance in this very important area. 
The government has done many things over the last number of years 
to enact the kinds of legislation that are necessary to give the 
police the kinds of measures they need in order to carry out 
their function in society, all of which enables us to live in 
more safe and secure communities wherever they may be in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to the report of the standing committee in this 
very important area.  I know that under the leadership of the 
chairperson, who is a very capable individual, that is precisely 
what will be done.  The committee will report back to the House 
in a very meaningful way and give parliament and, by extension, 
all Canadians the kinds of necessary analysis and tools that will 
help us to ensure that criminal activity is curtailed in Canada. 
<P><A NAME="LINK193"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it gives me a great deal of pleasure to rise on debate in the 
House.  It gives me a great deal of pleasure to tell the people 
of Canada about the strength of the opposition in the House, 
because if it were not for the Bloc Quebecois—and I give them 
full marks—if it were not for the pressure of the Conservatives 
and also of the Reform Party, this kind of motion would never 
have come to the House.  This kind of action would never take 
place under the Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It absolutely astounds me, with the encroachment of organized 
crime into every part of Canadian life, that the government just 
basically sits on its hands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look at the fact that the speaker just immediately prior to 
me, in answer to a question from a Bloc member, said that under 
the auspices of the chair of the committee on justice that 
everything will go well. I remind the House that the chair who is 
presently in that seat is the former solicitor general.  It was 
under that solicitor general that many of these pieces of 
inaction in fact continued to fester. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I draw the attention of the House to a specific case.  Let us 
take a look at some specifics.  As a result of coverage in the 
news media, I and members of the House have learned that in 1997 
RCMP Corporal Robert Read reported a cover-up of incompetence, 
negligence and corruption within DFAIT and immigration and 
complained of criminal misconduct by his superiors.  This related 
to activities that had happened in the very late eighties and 
early nineties in Canada's office in Hong Kong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The RCMP did not acknowledge that complaint much less 
investigate it.  In January 1998, Corporal Read took his 
documented complaint to the RCMP Public Complaints Commission. He 
was told it was the wrong venue, and indeed it was the wrong 
venue.  The reality is that within the purview of the government, 
within the bureaucracy of the RCMP, there is no correct place for 
that complaint if the RCMP hierarchy will not act on allegations 
of this nature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In January 1999, he took the same complaint and documentation to 
the auditor general.  None of these investigative bodies are 
investigating this complaint, and Corporal Read is a veteran 
insider.  None of them are investigating the complaint that a 
major cover-up is continuing today within the government's 
bureaucracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I apologize, I have to parenthesize.  I failed to 
mention that I am sharing my time with the member for Surrey 
Central. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have personally questioned Corporal Read.  He has confirmed 
and detailed his allegations to me.  As a matter of fact, I have 
seen pages and pages and pages of documented evidence that 
clearly substantiates that there must be an investigation into 
his allegations of cover-up on the part of the RCMP.

<A HREF="#LINKT68"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of this cover-up is to protect the government from 
the public humiliation of being systematically deceived by its 
own employees.  The effect has been damage to Canada's national 
security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is all very well and good for the government to say that a 
wonderful measure has been put forward by the opposition.  It 
thinks the Bloc motion is a good one and that it should be 
proceeding with it.  I want to know from the government in this 
debate today why the allegations about which I have just informed 
the House have not been acted on by the government.  Why has the 
government been sitting on its hands in the face of this 
stonewalling? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It started in 1997.  After two years of bureaucratic 
stonewalling Corporal Read made his complaint public.  What 
happened?  He was suspended.  Rather than the RCMP actually doing 
anything he was suspended.  To the best of my knowledge there has 
never been any further action taken to investigate the 
allegations about Corporal Read to this date.  Corporal Read's 
findings of negligence, incompetence and corruption have not been 
challenged.  It appears no one will investigate even though the 
complaint is substantial and has been documented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a first step.  Thanks to the opposition, issues of this 
type will come before the standing committee.  I can tell the 
House what I fully anticipate in committee.  There will be 
further stonewalling by the majority representing the government 
in that committee.  Furthermore, as I pointed out, the chair of 
the committee is a former solicitor general who in 1997, when 
these events were taking place, was the solicitor general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the current solicitor general appoint an independent 
prosecutor to examine the evidence of Corporal Read?  Not only 
the evidence of Corporal Read.  A lot of the evidence is 
substantiated by pages and binders full of information, graphs 
and flowcharts on information compiled by Brian McAdam, a former 
immigration official in the Hong Kong office at the time of the 
alleged incidents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not understand how we can end up in Canada with a 
professional bureaucracy that would allow this kind of situation 
to continue to fester.  Why has this never been properly 
investigated?  If the solicitor general will not act, will the 
Speaker of the House order the auditor general to report directly 
to the House? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are serious allegations.  I am fully aware of the 
seriousness of the allegations I am relating to the House.  I am 
taking responsibility for that as a member of parliament.  I will 
repeat.  These allegations have been brought to the RCMP.  These 
allegations are part of what led to the start-up of the 
investigation called sidewinder.  We all know what happened with 
sidewinder. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sidewinder was a two year investigation by a combined force of 
CSIS and the RCMP.  They compiled information for a full two year 
period.  They look into the kind of allegations that Brian McAdam 
brought forward.  What did they do?  At the end of two years 
someone at CSIS decided to terminate the sidewinder 
investigation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was not good enough.  Instead of just terminating the 
investigation they terminated all the e-mails and all the written 
documentation.  They made sure to the best of their ability that 
all information on electronic files was also terminated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was absolutely scandalous because it was going on at 
exactly the same time as the government was not appointing people 
to the Security Intelligence Review Committee.  SIRC 
was set up under the 
legislation which established CSIS in the first place.  Its 
purpose was to have civilian oversight of a top secret 
organization.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government neglected, and I use that word in its strongest, 
most pejorative sense, to put people into positions of trust and 
responsibility in SIRC so that SIRC could continue to oversee 
CSIS. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of the government leaving the SIRC position open, 
CSIS basically ran rampant.  When it came upon some results, 
which it presumably did not like, it decided not only to 
terminate it but to destroy the whole thing.  Guess what?  SIRC 
found out about the destruction of sidewinder as a result of 
reading about it in the newspaper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is completely out of control.  It has no idea 
what we are looking at in the area of organized crime.  The very 
least I can say is that I am thankful the government will support 
the motion put forward today by Canada's opposition which has 
embarrassed it into action. 
<P><A NAME="LINK194"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jacques Saada (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am quite impressed. 
My colleague across the floor recognizes the merit of the Bloc 
Quebecois initiative to bring the issue before us today.  He 
claims that it is because of the opposition that the motion is on 
the floor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would agree with him if he were to be excluded from the 
definition of opposition.  Many days have been devoted to issues 
put forth by the opposition, and the Reform Party never saw fit 
to put the issue before the House.  How dare he say that the 
Reform is responsible for this issue? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, I heard my colleague speak about democracy and in the 
same sentence say that the government should interfere either 
with the launching of an investigation or with the suspension of 
an investigation.  He is asking us to have the government 
interfere with the operation of a police body.  I am saying there 
is a great danger to democracy if we do that.  Apparently he does 
not understand this concept. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, I should remind him that Mrs. Paule Gauthier, the head of 
SIRC, has declared that she is fully satisfied with the 
co-operation she has with CSIS.  Again we are reaching a point 
where in the Reform Party fearmongering, insinuation and innuendo 
have become a way of life.  Is it surprising that it is losing so 
much popularity? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, if Madam Gauthier was aware 
of the theft of the briefcase after the Toronto Maple Leafs 
hockey game, how did she become aware of it?  The solicitor 
general was informed by the director of CSIS that the briefcase 
had gone missing.  The solicitor general did not inform SIRC. 
SIRC is the body.  They are the people who are responsible to us 
as Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are people of name who we can trust.  We can trust Ray 
Speaker.  We can trust Bob Rae. We can trust Frank McKenna.  We 
can trust people who have a long history of public service. These 
are people who are put into the trusted position of overseeing 
CSIS because of the kind of inept things that have been going on 
over there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The solicitor general sat on that information.  It took a report 
in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> to make the chair of SIRC aware that 
the briefcase had been stolen in the first place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The piety that has been coming forward from the solicitor 
general's parliamentary secretary is a bit misplaced.  If the 
Reform Party were the Government of Canada, we would take 
responsibility for the fact that we have not taken any action on 
organized crime.  The Liberals are the Government of Canada and 
it is the Liberals that have not taken any action on organized 
crime.  It is the Liberals who are deficient in protecting 
Canadians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK195"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I find it incredible when we are talking about something 
as important to Canadians as their own safety and security that 
the parliamentary secretary would dare to rise and say that even 
speaking about this issue is just fearmongering. 
Shame on him.  Shame on him that we had to have this debate.  The 
government should have been on top of things so that this problem 
would not be a matter of debate in the House of Commons.  There 
should have been procedures in place where we would be safe, but 
instead the government is asleep at the switch.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find so dismaying that the government is prepared to ignore 
this issue and call people names who are trying to get it dealt 
with.  It actually punished those who tried to bring forward the 
matter.  The employee with the courage to raise the matter is now 
toast.  What kind of a signal does this send to people who want 
to make sure that gross injustice and corruption in the country 
are dealt with properly? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it sends a very bad signal 
because in the case of the particular corporal, if we can believe 
it, he has been restricted to staying within 100 kilometres of 
the city of Ottawa.  There is no future idea of when that 
restriction will be lifted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He is being punished for coming forward and being straight and 
trying to bring these allegations to the attention of his 
superiors.  The only way he has been able to do that is to go 
public.  More is the shame on the government. 
<P><A NAME="LINK196"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise on behalf of the people of Surrey Central to speak to the 
Bloc supply day motion that calls on the House to order the 
Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights to study the issue 
of organized crime, to analyse avenues available to parliament to 
combat these criminals, and to report back to the House by 
October 31, 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today the government side of the House is being forced by the 
opposition to discuss organized crime.  We will see how little it 
will do, if anything.  The people of Surrey Central are anxious 
to do something about organized crime and its effect on our 
country, our cities, our region, our children, and many other 
aspects of our lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The weak Liberal government that has no vision and no political 
will keeps our criminal justice system weak.  There are less and 
less resources, money and effort going to our law enforcement 
community.  We can clearly see this in Surrey.  We feel the 
effects of the scarce resources of the RCMP which is trying to 
preserve and protect our communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The immigration minister tells the Prime Minister to adopt a new 
slogan.  The motto is that Canada is the place to be.  The Prime 
Minister brags about that.  There is no political will on Liberal 
benches to give B.C. and the rest of Canada the RCMP services 
that are needed.  Because of this, international criminals know 
that Canada is the number one country and the place to be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals already know that organized crime has a great 
effect on our country.  There is no need to study it.  Illegal 
migrants arrive at our airports and on our coasts.  They are 
brought here by organized criminals, and the Liberals do nothing 
about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They do nothing about corruption in our embassies.  When it 
comes to filtering out criminals our embassies are just like 
sieves.  In Hong Kong 2,000 visas were stolen.  Are gentle people 
stealing them and using them?  No, it is organized crime.  It is 
criminals who stole the visas and used them to bring over 2,000 
criminals into Canada, and the Liberals do nothing about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did something about it when my constituents told me about 
corruption at the embassies at New Delhi and Islamabad. 
Legitimate immigrants were harassed while criminals were buying 
their way into Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I got results.  Was I lucky?  No.  I did the work.  I had the 
political will to get to the bottom of these allegations of crime 
and corruption on behalf of the people I was elected to 
represent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I took action on their behalf.  I went to the RCMP.  They were 
glad to work with me and they did a good job.  People were fired 
as a result of my efforts and the corruption was cleaned up, for 
a while at least. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals keep the RCMP starved of resources:  money, 
equipment and personnel.  The Liberals do it with our military as 
well.  They starve our emergency preparedness, too.  The Liberals 
leave only four officers patrolling the B.C.-Washington border 
near my constituency.  Our ports and docks are understaffed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps only 5% of containers are inspected at the Vancouver 
port, but many of them contain drugs and other things being 
smuggled for organized crime.  The Liberals are not serious about 
fighting organized crime.  If they were they would dispatch the 
military on a special two-day mission to open the 95% of 
containers that have not been inspected.  Let us get to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that there are refugee claimants on our streets selling 
drugs.  We know they have been arrested, but the police tell us 
they are back on the street within hours, or at least the next 
day, after being slightly slapped on the wrist.  Why does the 
government not do something about it?  It is a shame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third world people are being enslaved into a life of crime. 
They are being sent to the U.S. via Canada.  What do the Liberals 
do about it?  Nothing.  The CIA and the FBI in the U.S. are 
furious about what is happening in Canada.  They are furious 
about our Prime Minister because he is cutting budgets, dragging 
his feet and not upholding Canada's part in fighting crime in 
North America. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government knows about money laundering operations in our 
country.  Organized crime has built a very large, multibillion 
dollar underground economy.  The weak Liberal government has done 
nothing about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week the newspapers published 10 ways to launder money and 
those are the 10 ways the Liberals have refused to prevent money 
laundering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a former credit union director, I know that our federal 
government is not doing enough to help prevent fraud through our 
financial institutions.  There are many areas where the 
government has dropped the ball on combating organized crime, 
including industrial espionage, white collar crime, national 
security risks and others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government should have introduced legislation to 
protect the rights of civil servants who come forward to expose 
corruption in government.  It should have done this long ago.  In 
other countries the legal rights of public servants who blow the 
whistle are protected.  They are rewarded.  In Canada we need at 
least to protect the public servants who report, in good faith, 
evidence of wrongdoing.  They should not be subject to 
disciplinary action, as the government has shown in the last few 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada needs a mechanism for our public servants to follow when 
they detect wrongdoing, including mismanagement, misleading 
information, cover-ups and other things like the issue we are 
debating today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will soon be putting forward a bill for the government to 
support that will protect and reward whistleblowers.  The purpose 
of the act will be to establish a procedure and provide 
appropriate rewards and incentives for whistleblowing.  Everyone 
knows about the work of Brian McAdam, who exposed corruption in 
our Hong Kong embassy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sidewinder investigation should certainly be of value and in 
the best interests of Canadians.  My hon. colleague has already 
spoken about it.  For three months Fabian Dawson, a Canadian 
journalist working out of B.C., has been publishing articles 
chronicling corruption in our federal government's overseas 
missions. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1605"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We commend these Canadians for their work, but where is the 
government?  Where are the Liberals?  Why do the Liberals not 
investigate what Fabian is writing about?  Why do they not help 
him?  Why will they not take action when our media uncovers 
things through good journalistic investigation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we are looking for answers to the problem of organized 
crime.  What can parliament do?  It is easy.  The people of 
Surrey and all Canadians know how easy it is.  Contrary to the 
motion we are debating, there is no need to study this problem. 
We already know the answers.  Parliament can legislate tougher 
penalties.  Parliament can provide whistleblowers with protection 
and rewards so that they can come forward with the evidence of 
corruption, exposing the techniques and modus operandi of 
organized criminals and gangs like the triads. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather than this weak Liberal government listening to them and 
taking appropriate action, rewarding whistleblowers like Brian 
McAdam and Corporal Read, it tries to shut them up and muzzle 
them while intimidating and threatening them.  This weak 
government should see to it that the laws which are already in 
our statute books are enforced.  The government can do that by 
providing our law enforcement community with what it needs to get 
the job done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Surrey the RCMP is always short of staff, equipment, time and 
resources.  There is no reason for that except that the Liberals 
are starving the force of what it needs.  We are the fastest 
growing community in Canada and this government is starving our 
city of police protection from organized crime.  It is a shame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask this weak Liberal government to wake up.  Rather than 
sitting on its hands, looking like an empty bag, it should get 
tough on organized crime and send a strong message to criminals 
around the world on behalf of the people of Surrey, B.C. and all 
Canadians.  It should tell those criminals that Canada is not the 
place to be. 
<P><A NAME="LINK197"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Maloney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am very happy to rise today to speak to this matter.  Certainly 
the debate in itself will send a message to organized criminal 
elements that their behaviour and activities will not be 
tolerated for the reasons which have been elaborated and which I 
will continue to elaborate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for Scarborough 
East. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take a bit of a different tack in my address.  I 
would like to address some of the key international activities of 
the federal government in addressing organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members on both sides of the House will appreciate, 
international co-operation in combating organized crime is very 
vital.  Canada, like other countries, is faced with responding to 
an increased movement of goods and people as our economy 
globalizes.  At the same time, increased use of 
telecommunications and finance in everyday affairs shrinks our 
world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To be sure, criminals are quick to try to capitalize on the 
opportunity that globalization and technological change present. 
Canadian ministers and officials are required regularly to attend 
meetings or conferences where key discussions and negotiations 
occur and where decisions are taken as to how to combat organized 
crime.  It is a very complex issue.  The objective is always to 
support a co-ordinated international approach to deal with this 
problem while recognizing that the sovereign interest of states 
must be respected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An important recent meeting was the 1994 UN ministerial 
conference on organized transnational crime held in Naples.  At 
that session a political declaration and global plan of action on 
organized crime was produced.  This document has served as a 
framework for future multilateral activity in this area, some of 
which I will now describe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the Halifax summit of 1995, on the initiative of the Canadian 
government, the G-8 heads of state created an experts group on 
transnational organized crime, now called the Lyon Group.  The 
Lyon Group has produced 40 recommendations on fostering closer 
co-operative legal assistance, law enforcement and other efforts 
to address the problem.  This was followed by a meeting of G-8 
justice and interior ministers on high tech crime in December 
1997, a video conference of the G-8 ministers of justice and 
interior in December 1998, and most recently a meeting of G-8 
ministers in Moscow on October 19 and 20 of this year where 
discussions focused on financial crime, high tech crime and 
illegal immigration.

Canada and the Attorney General of the United States, it was 
agreed that Canada and the United States would form the 
Canada-United States cross-border crime forum.  This agreement 
was reinforced by the commitment of the Prime Minister and 
President Clinton in April 1997 to form a bi-national body on 
criminal justice issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian group is comprised of officials from the Department 
of the Solicitor General, which co-chairs the forum with the U.S. 
Justice Department, the RCMP, the Canadian Security Intelligence 
Service, Correctional Service Canada, Revenue Canada, the Canada 
Customs and Revenue Agency, Citizenship and Immigration, Foreign 
Affairs, the Department of Finance, as well as representatives 
from provincial governments, including Quebec, and our police

Tobacco and Firearms, the Secret Service, the Internal Revenue 
Service and regional and state officials. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first full meeting of the cross-border crime forum took 
place in Ottawa in October 1997.  The forum met again in 
Washington on May 21, 1998.  The most recent meeting of the forum 
was in June of this year in Prince Edward Island. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The forum provides a regular opportunity for officials from 
Canada and the United States to discuss transnational crime 
problems and strategies to improve operational and policy 
co-operation and co-ordination.  The work of officials through 
the forum's subgroups on intelligence, enforcement, prosecutions 
and telemarketing fraud is ongoing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bi-national strategies and threat assessments have been 
developed and continue to be refined.  Officials are also 
evaluating current priorities and examining practices and 
legislation on both sides of the border to support co-operation 
at the national level, as well as regionally and locally in 
communities where border crime is a serious public safety 
concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next meeting of the forum is to take place in May or June 
2000 in the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Still looking at the Americas, the Secretary of State for 
International Financial Institutions participated on behalf of 
the solicitor general at a ministerial level conference on money 
laundering held in Buenos Aires in December 1995.  The conference 
produced an action plan on how to deal with money laundering in 
the Americas in terms of strengthening law enforcement, 
regulatory and legal measures.  The action plan is an important 
marker for efforts in this hemisphere to combat organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also note Canada's activities in the Inter-American Drug 
Abuse Control Commission, or CICAD as it is known by its Spanish

the commission is to address drug abuse and trafficking within 
the Americas, as well as related activities such as money

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
motion reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House instruct the Standing Committee on Justice and 
Human Rights to conduct a study of organized crime, to analyze 
the options available to parliament to combat the activities of 
criminal groups and to report to the House no later than October 
31, 2000. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say at the outset that I support the motion and look forward 
to the reference to the committee on which I sit and which I 
consider to be a very important committee to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take this opportunity to congratulate the hon. member for 
Berthier—Montcalm for his initiative in this area. It is always 
appropriate that parliament oversees government initiatives and, 
in this particular instance, this is a valuable and worthwhile 
initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will speak to the irony underlying this discussion.  This 
irony revolves around the rule of law.  Canada prides itself as a 
nation subject to the rule of law, much to the chagrin sometimes 
of many of the members of the House, particularly when the rule 
of law comes in conflict with, for instance, the supremacy of 
parliament or when we have interpretations from the Supreme Court 
of Canada which conflict with the will of parliament. 
Fortunately, we all respect the rule of law and therefore are 
able to work out those conflicting points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Governments are circumscribed by the rule of law.  Institutions 
are circumscribed by the rule of law.  Individuals are 
circumscribed by the rule of law.  People in institutions cannot 
simply do what seems most advantageous to their self-interest, 
regardless of whether it be in the field of criminality or in the 
field of civil law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians live under the rule of law and see it as their most 
valuable tool to protect themselves, their families and their 
assets against arbitrary actions by governments, institutions, 
police and other individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Organized crime on the other hand has no such limitations. 
Whether it is trafficking in people, drugs, liquor or stolen 
cars, organized crime challenges the very basis of our Canadian 
society as we know it and, therefore, it is a threat like no 
other threat to our civilization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The irony is that while organized crime seeks to destroy the 
rule of law in order to gain its revenues, it simultaneously 
wishes to invest its revenues and its proceeds from its 
activities in the societies which have the highest standards of 
the rule of law, because there they provide safe and secure 
banking systems, safe and secure property registration systems 
and safe and secure judicial remedies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The irony is resplendent that ill-gotten gains, regardless of 
where they come from, whether they be from North America or from 
other places, frequently end up here because of the rule of the 
law and because of the security of our various institutions.

<A HREF="#LINKT75"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope I am not naive, and there are some who might say 
otherwise, but I believe that organized crime will be with us 
forever, much like original sin, of which many of our members 
know a great deal.  It has been around since the dawn of time and 
is not likely to go away soon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given that it is not likely to go away soon, we have to be 
realistic about what can or cannot be done in the area of 
organized crime. I believe we should support the efforts of the 
RCMP in their interdictions in Sri Lanka for people smuggling, or 
in Akwesasne for other kinds of smuggling.  The question really 
is whether the government is approaching this in the best 
possible fashion.  What are the initiatives that make the most 
sense? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To me, hitting at profitability is what makes a great deal of 
sense.  What hits most at profitability?  I think that will be 
the question that determines the direction of the committee. For 
instance, the principles enunciated by the ministers collective 
of justice for the country states that taking a profit out of 
organized is an effective way of putting these criminals out of 
business and efforts to seize their illegal proceeds should be 
vigorously pursued.  I support that view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take a look at some of the initiatives that this 
government has taken on in the last few years.  The first 
initiative is the $115 million given to the RCMP to upgrade its 
CPIC facility. I had the good fortune of touring that facility in 
the last term and found it to be a useful tour.  I encourage the 
other members to do so as well because the information held in 
those files is quite useful in fighting crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next one was $18 million to the data bank initiative.  Many 
of these people have no compunction about any method in order to 
secure their profits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An additional $78 million to the national anti-smuggling 
initiative will fund 100 additional RCMP officers in major 
airports to help target organized criminals who use these 
airports as points of entry into Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An additional $15 million paid annually will put more RCMP 
officers in Vancouver, Toronto and Montreal, and $13.8 million to 
the RCMP to use for workload increases.  Thirteen proceeds of 
crime units have been created within the RCMP across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While all of these are laudable initiatives, I do not want to be 
circumscribing the work of the committee, assuming the motion 
goes forward, by simply listening to what the government says. 
To my mind, if those initiatives do not meet the profitability 
test as to cutting out the profitability of the activities of 
organized crime, then we probably have to ask ourselves whether 
that is well spent money.  If the foregoing interrupts the 
profitability anywhere along a spectrum then, in my view, the 
initiative is doing a good job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to the reference to the committee.  I reflect on 
the last time that parliament referred an initiative to the 
justice committee which was in the area of drunk driving.  We on 
the justice committee spent a great deal of time reviewing the 
evidence.  As the evidence came before us, we started to see the 
patterns that were there and the gaps in the legislation.  We 
were fortunate enough to not only be able to produce a unanimous 
report, but the justice committee also produced a bill which was 
referred back to the House and in turn proclaimed on July 1. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my constituency, the work of the justice committee and the 
support that we received from the justice minister and the 
government in that area, and from all parties, was well received 
by my constituents.  I look forward to this initiative also being 
dutifully undertaken by the committee and that it will produce a 
report that will not only be of use to the government but of use 
to the House.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Frankly, I will be interested at looking at anything that is 
effective.  I will also be interested in looking at initiatives 
which are not effective.  We live in a world of limited 
resources.  We continue to live and will always live in a world 
of limited resources.  We as a government will always be 
criticized that we never apply enough resources.  If the 
resources that are being applied are not useful and are 
misdirected then that should also be part of the review of the 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I appreciate that there is an irony going on here, that 
the rule of law is being abrogated by a certain subset of 
criminals, ironically, the work of the committee will, I hope, 
return us to the rule of law. I hope that ultimately, as we 
examine this issue, we will continue to move ourselves back to a 
rule of law and a society where all people can have security of 
person and property. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It is my duty, pursuant to Standing 
Order 38, to inform the House that the questions to be raised 
tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows:  the hon.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to rise today to speak to the Bloc Quebecois motion. It reads as 
follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House instruct the Standing Committee on Justice and 
Human Rights to conduct a study of organized crime, to analyse 
the options available to Parliament to combat the activities of 
criminal groups and to report to the House no later than October 
31, 2000. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I applaud my colleagues who have worked on these important 
issues, sometimes at their own personal risk, particularly the 
hon. member for Berthier—Montcalm, who, with my colleague from 
Saint-Bruno—Saint-Hubert, is leading this debate, the hon. member 
for Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot and the hon. member for 
Hochelaga—Maisonneuve who, in a way, raised the red flag after 
the tragic death of the young Daniel Desrochers in his riding. 
This young boy died in a car bombing incident involving feuding 
criminal gangs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very proud of the work my colleagues have done. We cannot 
tolerate in the Quebec society, or the Canadian society for that 
matter, any kind of ingrained violence as a way of determining 
markets. This is how it works in the underworld. 
Neither can we allow crime to become a way of becoming rich 
without being punished, because all our values could be 
compromised in the long run. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On a number of occasions, it was pointed out that, in Quebec, 
which we do not like to think of as a violent society, between 
1994 and 1998, criminal organizations were responsible for 79 
murders and 89 attempted murders, 129 cases of arson and 82 
bombings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a serious situation. We know that it is not all that 
serious in Quebec, but we are still concerned. However, this 
scourge also ties in very closely with what is happening 
internationally. Today we are looking at the globalization of 
organized crime. Global crime involves more than connections 
between Canada, Quebec and the United States, for example, with 
some ramifications in Mexico. It is much larger than that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said before, we know that places that lend themselves to 
criminal activity become markets that are fought over 
internationally. We only have to look at the various gangs 
competing with one another with the means and the level of 
violence we know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just want to take a moment to mention that, in other 
countries, in Europeans countries for example—and I have been 
made aware of that—one type of crime that is being dealt with is 
the exploitation of half a million women from developing 
countries who are brought to western Europe each year for 
profitable sex crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that young women and women are kidnapped and disappear 
and that they end up being exploited somewhere. 
When you add up all these numbers, it looks like a modern-day 
white slave traffic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there is the whole issue of the displacement of persons. 
According to the International Organization for Migration, those 
who are involved in the organized trafficking of human beings 
are responsible for the displacement of one million individuals 
at any given time, generating $7 billion worth of business every 
year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Putting an end to the trafficking of human beings was the 
primary goal of the European Union summit held in Finland. The 
aim was not to simply prevent the displacement of people. 
Displaced people who are charged $20,000—in the case of those 
from China for example—are subject to a kind of slavery and 
control including threats against their person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Several migrants from Europe landed illegally in western Canada. 
Recently, some of them were brought here by boat in the same 
unacceptable fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Drugs are an international scourge. Numbers vary but, according 
to a document we produced, there is between $100 and $500 billion 
in trade every year. By comparison, drugs account for 8% of 
international trade, or approximately $400 billion, roughly the 
same as oil and gas. This is a lot. Oil and gas represent an 
extremely important part of international trade. The drug trade 
is said to be of an equal value. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The stakes are enormous and profits from organized crime could 
be as high as one trillion dollars. I am not mistaken. I do not 
mean one thousand million in French, or one billion in English, 
I mean one trillion, which as far as I know is “un billion” in 
French. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This goes to show how extremely important these illicit, violent 
activities are with all their showy wealth. 
In Moscow I have seen the most sumptuous boutiques.  There are 
20 BMW dealerships in Moscow, and it would seem that very few 
are authorized dealers.  There is world-wide trafficking in the 
resale of stolen automobiles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why mention this in connection with the death of the Desrochers 
boy?  In order to indicate the extreme importance of the work my 
colleagues on both sides of the House will have to do.  They 
will certainly need to know exactly what is going on, as far as 
international agreements are concerned, because the 
globalization of crime is such that it cannot be considered 
localized and therefore solvable locally.  This is particularly 
the case now that there are new approaches, such as high tech 
crimes, cyber attacks and crimes committed by hackers.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now there are brilliant hackers who are able to commit financial 
crimes by infiltrating computer systems and then, with a few 
keystrokes, hiding all evidence of their crime, or transferring 
the proceeds from it to another country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This field is one of extraordinarily rapid change, and it is at 
the service of biker gangs as much as it is for any other group. 
Under these circumstances, the authorities face a major 
challenge, because the crime must first be located and then the 
data has to be obtained to prove it.  There is considerable 
urgency here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some countries, we have heard, want to make encryption keys 
mandatory.  Encryption uses extremely lengthy formulas that 
supposedly make it impossible to get into messages and therefore 
protect honest people from those who want to invade their 
privacy.  They may, however, also afford protection to dishonest 
people by preventing the justice system from being able to find 
out what they have been doing.  This is what happened in Japan, 
when a sect carried out its plans to poison subway travellers 
and Japan found itself with evidence that had to be decrypted. 
This was a very long and difficult task and it had to be done 
before the criminals could be tried, and they were not able to 
decipher it completely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I wish to say that, as a society, we cannot allow 
these crimes to go unpunished, because the entire social balance 
is jeopardized.  What is more, young people who are struggling 
to make it in the world may be attracted by this way to get rich 
quick.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened carefully to the speech made by my colleague and I can 
see once again that the hon. member for Mercier has a very good 
grasp of the issue of organized crime and of its scope, in 
Quebec and in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Her calm and rational tone was a reflection of today's debate. 
Indeed, all the parties said they would support the Bloc 
Quebecois' motion. We feel this is a very important issue which 
deserves to receive all our attention, and the other parties 
obviously think so too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a question for the my colleague, the hon. member for 
Mercier. I know she is very interested in what goes on at the 
international level. I am sure she said something about this, 
but I missed the beginning of her speech. I would appreciate it 
if she could comment about what is being done at the 
international level, if she had not already done so in her 
speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I realize that we must first have good national legislation. 
Obviously, we must first clean up our own backyard, but my 
question to the hon. member is about what goes on at the 
international level. 
Does the hon. member think that, once we will have cleaned up 
our act, there are things that must be done at the international 
level? Is some form of co-operation desirable? Are there useful 
lessons that could be learned from European countries, as the 
hon. member has frequent contacts with them and comes back with 
good ideas? I know that she recently travelled with the Minister 
of Justice precisely to talk about organized crime at the 
international level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to hear the hon. member, because she has a unique 
experience. The Bloc Quebecois is lucky to have her, because she 
increasingly brings her great expertise to us and to all 
Quebecers. I would like to hear her comments on this issue.

me blush. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, I have had the opportunity to join the justice minister 
at the G8 Summit. Having a government with a small majority can 
sometimes be useful to the opposition. I know about the 
collaborative work being done, and the secretary of state has 
mentioned the Lyon Group. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To be able to work together, countries have to agree on some 
rules. They have to know that if an offender is sent to another 
country, he will be treated the same way as he would be in his 
own country. Therefore, it is extremely important for countries 
to come to an agreement, and it is not always easy, because each 
and every state wants to run things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am glad to see that the committee is considering this issue as 
well as parliaments around the world, so that they can exchange 
information. Of course, in order to be able to exchange 
information and make a decision when the proceeds of some crime 
are located, we have to decide in advance how the proceeds of 
crime will be divided and who will try the alleged offender. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will foreign countries agree with the way the trial will be run? 
We also have to think about the severity of the penalties 
provided. This has become crucial because it is so very easy for 
criminals to go from one country to another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to thank my hon. colleague for his question. I think 
that, from now on, parliamentarians from countries around the 
world will have to talk about these things. I hope the committee 
will be the one to initiate these discussions. 
I also hope that the committee of a sovereign Quebec will be 
able to carry on and to discuss this issue with the committee of 
a sovereign Canada and the committees of other jurisdictions. It 
will be crucial to agree on some basic rules to ensure a minimum 
of justice.

parliamentary leaders of the various parties represented in the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The full motion reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House instruct the Standing Committee on Justice and 
Human Rights to conduct a study of organized crime, to analyse 
the options available to Parliament to effectively combat the 
activities of criminal groups and to report to the House no 
later than October 31, 2000. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In March 1998, Angus Reid conducted an omnibus survey containing 
questions about organized crime.  The results of the survey said 
it all:  91% of the population described organized crime as a 
problem, and one Canadian out of two thought that it was a 
serious problem; 21% of the population thought that existing 
efforts to combat organized crime were adequate, and 77% wanted 
to see such efforts increased.  Finally, the same survey showed 
that residents of Quebec and British Columbia were more anxious 
about organized crime than other Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the Bloc Quebecois to have set aside as a possible theme for 
this day a subject as important for our collective future as 
sovereignty and anti-democratic measures to control that process 
being dreamt up by the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
the Prime Minister is a sign that the situation is critical with 
respect to organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since our arrival in the House in 1993, a number of incidents 
have had a sobering impact on our existence as ordinary citizens 
wishing to live in peace and harmony.  Let us recall briefly 
some of the more tragic among them. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1645"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995, during a war between biker gangs for the control of a 
territory, Daniel Desrochers, an 11-year old boy, was killed by 
the explosion of a bomb in the Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, in the east 
end of Montreal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few months later, a bomb went off in Saint-Nicolas, just south 
of Quebec City, and windows were shattered, including those in a 
baby's bedroom. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997, Diane Lavigne and Pierre Rondeau, two prison guards, 
were killed in cold blood, presumably by bikers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a report by the Canadian Press published in <I>Le Soleil</I> of 
March 20, 1998, the then Quebec minister of public security, 
Pierre Bélanger, declared that the security and custody measures 
taken for the suspect had cost $1 million. Moreover, the chief 
crown prosecutor in Montreal, André Vincent, said Hell's Angels 
hitmen killed the two prison guards at random, just to 
destabilize the justice system. He added that these criminals 
intended to attack crown prosecutors and judges too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will add that André Tousignant, one of the Hell's Angels 
hitmen, was murdered and his body found on February 27, 1998, in 
the woods near Bromont. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These terrible incidents add to the problems faced by, among 
others, the Sûreté du Quebec in the fight against the so-called 
forced plantings of marijuana in farmlands across Quebec.  In 
this regard, the Canadian Police Association stated in a press 
release on October 8 that the awful reality was that organized 
crime had reached epidemic proportions and that the police were 
frustrated by the lack of tools and resources to fight it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The statistics are very revealing in measuring the scope of the 
problem of organized crime, regardless of its source.  For 
example, the RCMP advises that, between 1994 and 1998, in 
general terms, there were 79 murders and 89 attempted murders in 
connection with biker gang wars in Quebec.  These wars are also 
behind 129 cases of arson and 82 bombings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at an impact study on organized crime commissioned by 
the Office of the Solicitor General and released in 1998, we 
learn that the illicit sale of drugs in Canada provides revenues 
of $10 billion annually to those involved. Evaluations of the 
scope of the world market of illicit drugs vary between $100 
billion U.S. and $500 billion U.S. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><I>Le Devoir</I> of January 8, 1999 reported that, in Canada, in 1998, 
smuggling, which concerns all criminal organizations, involved 
primarily tobacco, alcohol and jewellery.  It even reported 
that, in jewellery alone, the Canadian black market was 
estimated to be worth $400 million. All smuggling activities 
together are estimated to have cost the federal and provincial 
governments some $1.4 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Crimes of an economic nature are on the same scale. 
To list them quickly, these include fraudulent telemarketing, 
aimed particularly at the elderly, stock market fraud and the 
fraudulent use of credit cards. According to the same source, it 
would appear that economic crimes cost the people of Quebec and 
of Canada a minimum of $5 billion annually. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This being the case, what has the Parliament of Canada done on 
the legislative, financial and international levels? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the legislative aspect first of all.  The 
government has passed four bills we feel it would be worthwhile 
to review briefly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First there is the Witness Protection Act.  Police forces are 
now in a position to provide better protection to those 
co-operating with them in obtaining evidence against criminal 
organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the Criminal Law Improvement Actenables the police to 
carry out storefront operations more easily. 
This enabled the RCMP to successfully carry out Operation 
Compote, resulting in charges against 50 people, one of them a 
Montreal lawyer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third is the anti-gang legislation passed in April 1997, the 
main thrust of which is inclusion in criminal law of the 
definition of gang. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1650"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT82"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT82"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1650
<A HREF="#LINKT83"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT81"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill makes it a crime to take part in the activities of a 
gang and provides heavier penalties for those who commit crimes 
for a gang. It also authorizes the seizure of goods used for 
gangs' criminal activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should noted that this legislation does not target the 
leaders of criminal gangs, since it is assumed that the 
individuals targeted are the ones who commit the crime. However, 
it is a well-known fact that in this type of criminal 
organization, the dirty jobs are often done by subordinates and 
that the leaders must be caught for these organizations to be 
broken up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fourth legislative measure is the Controlled Drugs and 
Substances Act, which gives police the power to conduct reverse 
sting operations with undercover officers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In spite of all these legislative provisions, police forces seem 
unable to put an end to the activities of criminal gangs. As for 
the financial resources earmarked by the governments of Canada 
and Quebec to fight organized crime, they seem clearly 
inadequate. However, it must be realized that it is difficult to 
get a precise breakdown of all the moneys spent on the issue 
that we are discussing today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, at the international level, during a conference held in 
Montreal in 1998, the deputy commissioner of the RCMP for 
investigations, René Charbonneau, proposed the establishment of 
an international criminal tribunal to deal with drug dealers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of this brief overview of organized crime in Canada, we 
can see that the measures and the legislation in place and the 
amount of money spent at this time cannot eradicate this 
problem. That is why the Bloc Quebecois believes it is important 
to examine the tools available to us to determine if they could 
be improved or if they could be complemented by new legislative, 
administrative and financial measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There seems to be a consensus on the urgency of passing new 
tougher and more explicit legislation to counter activities by 
criminal organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Organized crime is certainly a national problem that threatens 
public safety. 
It is important that the efforts made by parliament to pass 
legislation that is suited to the reality faced by police match 
the efforts made by police in the field to uncover criminal 
organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government must show the political will to take 
action and must find ways to improve intelligence gathering by 
the police, to impose harsher sentences on members of criminal 
organizations and to give more teeth to its money laundering 
legislation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK202"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to congratulate the hon. member for Rimouski—Mitis for 
such an interesting speech, and on her knowledge of the 
international scene. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very often easier to obtain international consensus on a 
criminal reform project than to obtain federal and provincial 
consensus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recall that we managed to get three international treaties on 
the control of international terrorism passed in a matter of 
mere months, going beyond the ideological and conventional 
borders of the day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Has the hon. member considered making suggestions to the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs on the drafting of more detailed 
international conventions on this? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay:</B> Judging by the performance of the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs in the drafting of the treaty on 
anti-personnel mines, the crusade on which he set out in order to 
get the other countries on side, I feel he ought to again pick 
up his pilgrim's staff and set off on another crusade in 
connection with organized crime.  This would lead to the 
ratification of a treaty that would, in a way, make the 
legislation more flexible.

<A HREF="#LINKT82"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would enable the countries that were signatories of such a 
treaty to really deal with criminals, drug dealers for instance, 
without our having to resort to extradition because our country 
had sanctions against this crime and the other did not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the 
signatory states would have to be able to try these criminals 
and to impose upon them the penalties set out by a kind of 
international tribunal or the treaty itself. 
<P><A NAME="LINK203"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
comment will be along the lines of those I have made in the 
course of the day.  It must be understood that the motion tabled 
by the Bloc Quebecois today, which will get hopefully a 
unanimous vote in the House of Commons this evening, is the 
product of considerable work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois has long been discussing and working on it. 
I take this opportunity to thank the members for 
Saint-Bruno—Saint-Hubert, Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, 
Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière, Québec and 
Drummond, and, for their support, the members for Roberval and 
Rimouski—Mitis, who, in the past few hours, have been 
negotiating with the other opposition parties to come up with a 
motion that would receive the unanimous approval of the House. 
Once and for all, we will study this issue seriously and with 
all assumptions on the table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is common knowledge that drug dollars are a huge problem. 
The Bloc Quebecois has already tabled a bill on money 
laundering.  Could we not in our study also look at the issue of 
money laundering and take the avenue proposed by the Bloc 
concerning, among other things, $1,000 bills and the deposit of 
large sums of money?  Could the member respond to this question? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will respond quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, I think we must study this issue.  Our colleague from 
Charlesbourg has already introduced a bill to remove $1,000 
bills from circulation.  We are probably the only major 
industrialized country to have such a large bill.  It is easier 
to carry ten $1000 bills in one's pockets than five hundred $5 
bills or two hundred $10 bills, and so on.  It makes for not 
such a thick wad with ten $1,000 bills, and it is easier to 
launder them, in the casino, for example, some evening. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK204"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Sophia Leung (Vancouver Kingsway, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today to express my support for the motion currently 
before the House.  I will share my time with the hon. member for 
Wentworth—Burlington. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Organized crime is a serious national and international problem 
that threatens public safety.  It is now a multibillion dollar 
enterprise in Canada.  It has a negative impact upon all 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of the problems Canadians see every day are linked to 
organized crime.  Whether it be a drug related burglary, a carton 
of smuggled cigarettes, a telemarketing scam or juvenile 
prostitution, it is usually part of the larger problem of 
organized crime.  That is why fighting organized crime is a major 
task for the government and a key priority of the RCMP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has done much so far to hit hard at those 
criminals.  The government is proud of what it has accomplished, 
but we all know there is more work to do.  The government has 
undertaken a number of initiatives in its fight against organized 
crime. 
This government also recognizes that in the global war on 
organized crime, no one country or government can win by acting 
alone.  Take the example of human smuggling and trafficking.

<A HREF="#LINKT83"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government shares the concerns and frustrations of many 
Canadians in relation to the challenges posed by the arrival of 
illegal migrants.  Canadians are proud of and deeply committed to 
our humanitarian traditions, but it is equally true that we have 
no tolerance for those who would abuse this generosity.  Today 
criminally organized smuggling and trafficking operations are 
conducting an extensive international trade in lives and in the 
forced labour of human beings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The United Nations estimates that international smuggling and 
trafficking operations have grown to a $10 billion a year 
industry.  Organized criminals are demanding as much as $50,000 
from their naive or misguided victims, exploiting their simple 
desire for a better life.  We know that this debt is typically 
repaid over a short and brutal lifetime of illicit activity, 
sexual exploitation and forced labour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a truly despicable set of circumstances but we must be 
clear about its source and direct our rightful anger and outrage 
toward the criminals who seek profit in human suffering rather 
than toward those victims who in search for a better life allow 
themselves to be put into such slavery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be clear about what has been happening with respect to 
our recent boatloads of arrivals from China.  The boats were 
identified, intercepted, boarded and apprehended.  Nine crew 
members have been charged.  Their passengers have been detained. 
Organized crime has been denied access to the source of its 
profit.  The economic incentive has been cut off.  Those who have 
claimed refugee status are being given a fair hearing on an 
accelerated basis and in accordance with our charter, our 
international obligations and our proud humanitarian traditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian government officials from the coast guard and national 
defence, the RCMP and Citizenship and Immigration Canada have all 
responded admirably under extremely stressful conditions, but the 
integrity of the system is something we take very seriously. 
Simply put, if we allow the rules to be abused and the rules are 
not respected, they cease to have meaning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People smuggling and human trafficking are serious international 
problems.  That is why we have initiated a serious international 
response.  Canada has assumed a leading role in the development 
of United Nations protocols on transnational organized crime and 
migrant smuggling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been working closely with our partners in the United 
States to improve our crime databases and on joint efforts to 
track and apprehend international criminals and terrorists.  We 
are working along similar lines with law enforcement agencies in 
Australia, New Zealand and the European Union.  It is worth 
noting that other countries are confronting similar problems, 
often on a significantly greater scale.  This month alone 
Australia has seen the arrival of 10 migrant vessels carrying 
almost 900 people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are working with the People's Republic of China.  Senior 
immigration officers along with members of the RCMP have recently 
returned from Beijing and the Fujian province where they met with 
representatives of the Chinese government, its enforcement 
officers and local police. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1705"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last September I and two colleagues from the House went to 
China. We had discussions and negotiations with Chinese officials 
to work jointly to solve the human smuggling problem. This visit 
has helped us to advance our working relationship on human 
trafficking, people smuggling and the repatriation of Chinese 
nationals. The Chinese government has reported the recent seizure 
of six migrant vessels, including up to four which are thought to 
have been destined for Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Smuggling has been around for a while.  It is a fee for service 
operation where smugglers are paid for simple passage across 
international borders.  They provide this service through various 
means which include such things as false travel documents and 
undetected border crossings.  Their customers are sometimes 
economic migrants, but sometimes they are legitimate refugees who 
resort to smugglers as the only way to escape the source of their 
persecution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Human trafficking is more akin to human slavery.  The goal of 
traffickers is to profit from indentured human slaves.  Once 
their debts have been imposed, the victims of human trafficking 
are bound to a long term repayment plan involving forced labour, 
prostitution and other illicit activities.  These victims often 
have reason to fear for their lives and the lives of their family 
members back home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For human traffickers, the goal is not legal status.  In the 
first instance it is to evade detection at our ports of entry in 
order to enter unnoticed and force their passengers underground 
and into slavery as soon as possible.  We are opposed to both 
smuggling and trafficking.  But above all, Canada will not 
tolerate the abuse of our system by organized criminals engaged 
in such deplorable human exploitation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Citizenship and Immigration has travelled across 
the country speaking with her provincial counterparts, 
representatives of various non-governmental organizations and 
other concerned citizens. She has listened to a wide range of 
views on the matter in order to come up with a solution to this 
problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no easy solution to this problem.  That is why I am 
pleased to support the motion that is before the House.  I urge 
all members to do so. 
<P><A NAME="LINK205"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is really a pleasure to rise in this debate because 
just yesterday I was saying that I felt that the Bloc Quebecois, 
despite their agenda of sovereignty, contributes mightily to this 
parliament.  I think this motion today is an example of a very 
positive contribution of the Bloc Quebecois. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not have a lot of time, but I would like to take this 
debate in a particular direction.  I would like to draw the 
Bloc's attention and this parliament's attention to the fact that 
organized crime has also entered the field of charities.  I think 
this is something that should be of concern to the justice 
committee when it comes to act on the motion proposed by the Bloc 
Quebecois. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, organized crime enters the field of voluntary 
service in a number of ways.  One way is the proliferation of 
various telemarketing and direct mail scams.  The commercial 
crime squad of the RCMP has recently reported, in Montreal in 
fact, that there have been links to the biker gangs.  They have 
established links to biker gangs of organizations that are 
engaged in soliciting funds by telemarketing. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1710"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT85"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the people, Mr. Speaker, who phone and chiefly prey on 
the senior citizens in our society, both in French and in 
English, I have to say.  It very much is a Canadian thing because 
this type of activity occurs and all we Canadians, our elderly 
parents, actually are very vulnerable to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So this kind of thing is going on, Mr. Speaker.  The other thing 
that is occurring that again I believe is the effect of organized 
crime, and this is the case of international organized crime 
where organizations take advantage of the ethnic makeup of Canada 
and perpetrate scams that basically involve making contact with 
individuals from whatever ethnic group and saying that a long 
lost relative has died in Africa, or Europe, or the former 
Yugoslavia, or the far east, and that they have been left an 
inheritance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of people have lost a lot of money through these scams 
which, again according to sources in the RCMP commercial crime 
squads, often are linked to international organized crime. 
Canada's ethnic community is very vulnerable to this kind of 
thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But, Mr. Speaker, probably the most significant penetration of 
organized crime into the charity field has to do with the fact 
that as the law stands now with respect to non-profit 
organizations, and especially charities, because there is so 
little scrutiny on the way charities operate, and so little 
scrutiny on the financial affairs of charities, I suggest to you, 
Mr. Speaker, that charities have become a major conduit for the 
laundering of money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, Mr. Speaker, I am not going to give you chapter and verse 
on which charities are engaged in this or which organizations are 
actually involved in it because, frankly, I do not know.  I am 
not a policeman.  I am not somebody who is involved in ferreting 
out criminal activity.  I can tell you though, Mr. Speaker, based 
on my research, and you know, Mr. Speaker, I am very active in 
examining the charity sector, I can tell you that there is a lot 
of evidence, and recorded evidence, that charities have been used 
as fronts to finance overseas ethnic conflicts and terrorism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That stands to reason, Mr. Speaker, because a charity can 
collect money.  Under the current rules a charity can collect in 
loose change, shall we say, at bingos and lotteries and all that 
kind of thing, more than a million dollars and there is 
absolutely no way that that money can be audited as it stands 
now.  On the other side with charitable organizations that have 
overseas branches, again there is no mechanism, Mr. Speaker, to 
be sure that when that money of that charity is transferred out 
of this country to its parent organization in another country, 
that that parent organization is not using it to finance ethnic 
conflict or some very non-charitable activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Well, Mr. Speaker, what is good for international terrorism, I 
suggest to you, is good for international organized crime and I 
will say that the government has shown some interest in this area 
and we can hope that perhaps we will move with some kind of 
legislation, or some better regulations at the very least, to 
control charities which I point out to you, Mr. Speaker, is a $90 
billion industry that has run for years and years without any 
kind of meaningful oversight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And so, Mr. Speaker, I conclude my remarks.  I am glad to put 
that on the record so that that can be part of what the justice 
committee considers when it follows through on the motion by the 
Bloc Quebecois, but I will end my remarks by saying that I think 
it is an excellent motion.  I think it is the credit to my 
colleagues opposite and sometimes, Mr. Speaker, quite frankly, 
you know they do so well, that sometimes I wish that they were 
the official opposition but then, what can I say, Mr. Speaker. 
They would have to change their politics for me to really believe 
that.  Thank you so much, Mr. Speaker, and I thank them as well.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>RECOGNITION OF CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK213">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK214"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Brampton Centre, Lib.)</B> moved that 
Bill C-224, an act to establish by the beginning of the 21st 
century an exhibit in the Canadian Museum of Civilization to 
recognize the crimes against humanity as defined by the United 
Nations that have been perpetrated during the 20th century, be 
read the second time and referred to a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, Bill C-224 was originally introduced on 
February 15, 1999, as Bill C-479.  The number was changed because 
the House prorogued and began a new session.  The bill calls upon 
the government to establish an exhibit in the Canadian Museum of 
Civilization to recognize the crimes against humanity that 
occurred in the 20th century.  In total about 90 million people 
have died in this century from crimes against humanity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many different definitions of crimes against humanity. 
Some call it genocide.  Some call it holocaust.  Some call it 
murder or atrocities.  I chose the UN definition so that nobody 
could argue about it because we signed the UN definition of 
crimes against humanity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did not use the word genocide because our government and many 
governments around the world recognize that over 90 million 
people died of genocide.  For example, 35 million Chinese people 
died because of genocide.  I have used the phrase crimes against 
humanity because it would be inclusive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second point I wish to make is that I did not ask to have a 
freestanding museum for genocide or crimes against humanity, 
simply because as backbenchers we are not allowed to ask the 
government to spend money.  I hope those two reasons will be 
taken into consideration when we go forward in our discussions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also acknowledge the presence in the gallery of the 
representative of the Turkish government at the embassy here and 
the charge d'affaires of public affairs of the Republic of 
Armenia.  I was successful at bringing these two nations together 
in the gallery to sit down and listen to the debate.  I also 
believe there are some Canadians of various backgrounds who are 
very much concerned with this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I first introduced my bill on February 15 I said in the 
House: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the bill is to mandate the establishment at the 
beginning of the 21st century of an exhibit in the Canadian 
Museum of Civilization recognizing all crimes against humanity 
that have been perpetrated during the 20th century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians from diverse backgrounds have been affected by crimes 
against humanity that have taken place throughout the 20th 
century.  The suffering of any group of victims is no less 
significant than that of any other group. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In introducing the bill I hope to address the concern that the 
creation of a museum to recognize only one group of victims would 
severely diminish the significance of the millions of other lives 
that have been lost or ruined as victims of crimes against 
humanity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can we as a government support one group of victims and 
ignore the suffering of others? 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That would be an insult to the other 90 million people who died 
during this century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Senate held hearings in May 1998 and came up with a report 
called “Guarding History”.  Recommendation No. 12 of that 
report called for the establishment of a museum for the genocide 
and/or the holocaust.  My bill addresses the report given to us 
by the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will recall also that the Prime Minister went to Auschwitz at 
the beginning of this year.  I was hoping that he would make an 
announcement there that we would have an inclusive museum of 
genocide in the country.  I regret that was not the case. 
Hopefully after the discussion today an inclusive museum will be 
established. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I visited Poland with the parliamentary delegation for NATO.  I 
had a chance to visit Maidanek where I saw incredible scenes of 
atrocities.  The number of nationalities involved in those 
atrocities was about 54.  There were all victims of crimes 
against humanity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I presented my bill back in February I received, within two 
hours, endorsements from over 100 members of parliament.  They 
wanted to see the bill come to the floor to be discussed.  I will 
take this opportunity to thank them for their support.  It was 
very beneficial to me. 
Throughout the few months that I worked on this, I had enormous 
support from various cultural groups, the list of which I will 
read soon.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We also had the chance to send about 85,000 pieces of 
literature:  some post cards, some letters, some petitions and 
some just regular mail.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to submit some 
to you.  I would ask for the unanimous consent of the House to 
table these two pages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The member for 
Brampton Centre has asked the unanimous consent of the House to 
table some papers in connection with his private member's bill. 
Is there unanimous consent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Sarkis Assadourian:</B>  Mr. Speaker, earlier in my 
comments I said that I had enormous support from many Canadians. 
Twenty-three committees have supported me so far.  For the record 
they are:  Association for Learning and Preserving of the History 
of WWII in Asia, ALPHA; Belarusan Canadian Coordinating 
Committee; Buddhist Communities of Greater Toronto; Canadian Arab 
Federation; Canadian Islamic Congress; Canadian Ukrainian 
Immigrant Aid Society; Council of the Muslim Community of Canada; 
Cypriot Canadian Federation; Federation of Associations of 
Canadians Tamils; Federation of Canadian Turkish Associations; 
Hellenic Canadian Congress; Hellenic Committee for Human Rights 
and National Issues:  Latvian National Federation of Canada; 
National Association of Canadians with Origins in India; National 
Federation of Pakistani Canadians; Palestine Heritage Canada; Pan 
African Movement of Canada; Serbian National Shield Society of 
Canada; Slovenian National Federation; Toronto Kurdish Community 
and Information Centre; Ukrainian Canadian Civil Liberties 
Association; Ukrainian Canadian Congress; Ukrainian National 
Federation of Canada; and Ukrainian Women's Organization of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two weeks ago, I had the honour of enlisting the support of the 
Armenian General Benevolent Union headed Mr. Danny Boyajan, which 
made my support at 23. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will read a couple of lines from a letter which I received 
from the Federation of Canadian Turkish Associations. It reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Federation urges the Canadian government to consider the 
establishment of a broadly based museum or exhibit on genocide 
that is inclusive of the realities of all ethnocultural 
communities. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such a process should be publicly determined and accountable to 
the system. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I whole-heartedly agree with this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also have a general letter of support from a group of 
Canadians called Canadians for a Genocide Museum.  They say that 
their 24-member association represents a wide multicultural group 
and that they whole-heartedly support the passing of Bill C-224, 
an act to establish by the beginning of the 21st century a museum 
exhibit to recognize crimes against humanity.  As members can 
see, the support for this bill is enormous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the chance to go to the Ukrainian church on the weekend 
for a commemoration.  It was the 66th anniversary of the famine 
genocide on the Ukrainian population which took place in 1933.  I 
was very moved to see young Canadians lighting candles for each 
of the nationalities I mentioned earlier that had suffered 
atrocities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further, on November 18 I asked a question in the House of 
Commons to the Minister of Canadian Heritage.  In reply, she 
said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I would first like to thank the member for Brampton 
Centre who has done an incredible job getting together 22 
organizations from across the country to work on this very 
important issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that all members of the House will be here to speak in 
support of private member's bill, Bill C-224, which will be 
debated in the House on November 30. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the minister for her support.  I would like to save a 
few minutes at the end of the debate for my final comments.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to speak to Bill C-224, the recognition of crimes 
against humanity act, sponsored by the hon. member for Brampton 
Centre.  It is regrettable that the bill is not votable.  It is 
hoped that the government will take serious note of this debate 
and act upon the sentiments that are expressed by myself and my 
hon. colleagues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under Bill C-224, the Canadian Museum of Civilization is 
directed by parliament to establish an exhibit that recognizes 
crimes against humanity perpetrated during the 20th century.  The 
exhibit is to be located in the Canadian Museum of Civilization. 
The board of trustees is given two years from the time of the 
parliamentary direction to establish the exhibit “crimes against 
humanity” under the act defined by the United Nations.  That 
definition is quite broad, encompassing specific acts committed 
as part of a widespread or systemic attack directed against any 
civilian population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By using the United Nations crimes against humanity definition 
rather than the United Nations definition of genocide, the hon. 
member has broadened the categories of acts that would be 
depicted by the Canadian Museum of Civilization. Genocide is a 
crime against humanity, although not all crimes against humanity 
are genocides.  Genocide is an act committed with intent to 
destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or 
religious group. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the notorious rape of Nanking, China by the Japanese prior 
to the commencement of World War II would be categorized as a 
crime against humanity, it is not genocide.  The rape of Nanking 
is a matter of particular horror to those Canadians with family 
ties to China, just as the Russian-induced Ukrainian famine of 
1932-1933 is a matter of particular horror to those Canadians 
with ties to the Ukraine. If, by the hon. member's bill, the rape 
of Nanking were to be remembered in Canada, that would mean very 
much to many people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am supportive of the hon. member's bill, and in particular of 
his willingness to support parliamentary direction into how our 
federally funded museums shall utilize the public financial 
resources that are voted on by this House and to be used in 
accordance with the wishes of the House. Sometimes bureaucrats 
forget that the public funds that they are accountable for are in 
fact trust funds for the public's benefit, with the trust 
established through votes in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past, we have seen a need for intervention by members of 
the House and the other place with respect to the administration 
of the Canadian War Museum and an ill-fated proposal to house a 
holocaust gallery in it. Many in the House and elsewhere 
commented that it would be preferable to address this dark side 
of humanity elsewhere than in the Canadian War Museum.  They felt 
this way since so much of our Canadian war artifacts and war art 
have yet to be properly displayed in the war museum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people also recognize that while there is one historically 
recognized Holocaust, the holocaust is part of a much larger 
history of attempted genocides and related crimes against 
humanity.  Humanity's dark side should be subject to a separate 
display that is not tied to Canada's proud war history.  As one 
step, I have introduced a motion, M-18, calling for a separate, 
self-sustaining world genocide museum in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill of the hon. member for Brampton Centre is one step in 
the right direction.  One reason that his bill is declaratory and 
does not go so far as to require the creation of a separate 
crimes against humanity museum is that, as a government 
backbencher, the hon. member cannot introduce legislation 
requiring government expenditures; in short, he cannot introduce 
a money bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The human race has witnessed acts of genocide throughout its 
history.  Genocide is not solely the horrendous byproduct of 
certain wars.  In fact many incidents of genocide are not war 
related at all.  Genocide is always a failure of humanity; the 
dark side of a civilization run amok. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to groups which have been decimated by genocidal 
acts that the world remember the particular atrocities in order 
to learn and understand what happened. All groups affected by 
genocidal acts want only to be remembered equally.  The genocides 
of world history cannot be distinguished on the basis of size or 
scope.  All genocide is horror. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my view, Canada should institutionalize remembrance to the 
construction of a world genocide museum. 
This would be a museum in Canada's capital depicting the madness 
and inhumanity of the decimation of so many.  Such a museum would 
send a powerful message to visiting world leaders.  It would 
speak clearly to all Canadians as to the duty to be advocates of 
a world peace that respects all persons.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As is commonly understood, our history has witnessed one 
Holocaust in World War II, and many attempted genocides.  The 
Holocaust is a uniquely recognized attempt at genocide.  Others 
are not so similarly recognized but should be clearly remembered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my view, genocide should be regarded more as a failure of 
civilization rather than a product of war, whether it be the 
Ukrainian famine, the Cambodian killing fields or the Holocaust. 
The dark side of humanity is a separate issue to be remembered 
quite apart from the honourable military histories.  It is my 
hope that consideration will be given to examining the dark side 
of humanity throughout history by way of the establishment in 
Canada of a permanent world genocide museum.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the bill put 
forward by the hon. member for Brampton Centre gives me pause 
for reflection on a very serious issue. I am talking, of course, 
about genocide and other crimes against humanity that we should 
never forget, let alone pretend that they never happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members know, these last few years, Bloc Quebecois members 
have supported every measure to underline and commemorate tragic 
events where men have shown how inhumane and violent they can be 
at times. We have stood up against those who tried to wipe out 
all memories of these tragedies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me remind my hon. colleagues that, in this House, in 1996 to 
be exact, the Liberal government toned down a motion concerning 
the Armenian genocide by dropping the word genocide and 
replacing it with the term tragic event. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That same year, the Minister for International Cooperation 
pressured the mayor of Montreal to abandon his plans to erect a 
monument to the victims of the Armenian genocide. Again, the 
minister would have preferred tragic event instead of the term 
genocide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the time, I rose in the House to remind my colleagues that 
toning down wordings in such a context is tantamount to 
confirming that the final step in a genocide is to attempt, 
after the fact ,to deny its very existence, or at the very least 
to minimize its importance. That is what is called selective 
memory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the Bloc Quebecois, genocide and all other crimes against 
humanity must not be hushed up. There are lessons to be learned 
from them. Also, the words used to describe these barbaric acts 
must not be used as a pretext to trivialize unspeakable acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not forget that our sense of history and our collective 
memory will keep alive the memory of humanity's past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The contents of Bill C-224, which we are now debating, are pretty 
clearly defined in the title, an act to establish by the 
beginning of the twenty-first century an exhibit in the Canadian 
Museum of Civilization to recognize the crimes against humanity 
as defined by the United Nations that have been perpetrated 
during the twentieth century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues in the Bloc Quebecois and myself will not oppose 
initiatives aimed at reminding people of past errors so they 
will ever occur again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having worked in education, I find it essential that our young 
people have a better knowledge of all these tragic mistakes and 
all these instances of genocide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, we are interested in the idea of informing the public 
about genocide and other crimes against humanity through an 
exhibit in the Canadian Museum of Civilization.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It could be an interesting tool for teaching the young and the 
not so young. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the teaching of history is also important, because not all 
Quebecers and Canadians have a chance to visit museums. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So that future generations recall these human tragedies, maybe 
they could be included in the curricula of our history courses. 
This would be another good way of ensuring that these events 
live on in our collective memory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We therefore see the debate on the bill introduced by the member 
for Brampton Centre as a unique opportunity to recall the 
growing concerns of Quebecers and Canadians with respect to 
major crimes against humanity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, it is not for the Bloc Quebecois to impose themes or 
exhibit material on museums.  It is not for politicians in this 
House to decide these matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are here today to raise a concern that is important to the 
constituents we represent and to express a wish and support for 
a future exhibit.  It is from this perspective that we feel that 
Bill C-224 is well-intentioned and that we support it in 
principle, but we feel that the Canadian Museum of Civilization 
should have full latitude to make any decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As parliamentarians, our responsibility goes beyond supporting 
the idea of an exhibit on genocides and crimes against humanity. 
For example, we know that Canada was and still is a haven for 
too many people responsible for war crimes or crimes against 
humanity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois has supported measures to amend the Criminal 
Code to allow the removal and expulsion of war criminals. We are 
still waiting for another amendment to the Criminal Code that 
would allow us to judge these people here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a concrete measure that the government and 
parliamentarians will have to adopt some day if they are serious 
about learning from the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, many genocides and crimes against humanity were 
committed during the 20th century. 
We are most familiar with the plight of Armenians, the Holocaust 
and, more recently, the atrocities in Cambodia, Rwanda, Burundi, 
East Timor, Bosnia or Kosovo, to name but a few. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For people to remember, for our collective memory to remain 
intact, for reconciliation to be possible among people, society 
must remember its epic moments, but also its darkest ones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is in the recognition of the peoples' right to exist that 
justice and freedom take on their full meaning. Is justice not 
freedom in action?

honour to rise today and speak to this important Bill C-224, an 
act which would direct the creation of a genocide exhibit at the 
Canadian Museum of Civilization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to start my remarks by thanking the hon. member for 
Brampton Centre for bringing this important matter before the 
House.  I would like to thank also the hundreds of Canadians who 
have expressed opinions to members of parliament through cards 
and especially through thoughtful letters which many of us have 
received from national organizations on this matter. 
It is clear that this matter has received a lot of thought from a 
lot of Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Among New Democrats there is no dispute that our society should 
honour the victims of all crimes against humanity, no matter when 
and where in the world this has occurred.  We know we must 
increase our efforts to educate our children and to remember 
those who have fallen to genocide and encourage all of the 
national institutions dedicated to providing such assistance to 
fulfil this important mandate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud to be part of a political movement which has always 
stood up for domestic and international human rights, even when 
such stands were not particularly popular.  The CCF, the 
forerunner to the NDP, spoke out against the racist immigration 
policies of previous Canadian governments, such as the Chinese 
head tax and the confinement of Japanese Canadians in the second 
world war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1970 the NDP was the only voice in the House of Commons to 
question the suspension of human rights by the government under 
the War Measures Act.  NDP policy has always called for the 
respect of human rights as the primary consideration in our 
foreign policy.  On the whole, and there are exceptions which I 
will not get into in this debate, Canada is now seen as a country 
which supports human rights and which fosters peace by most other 
countries and by most of the world's people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many associate the word genocide with places far from Canada. 
But we have our dark moments in our history, moments which many 
try to forget, moments when our forefathers and foremothers 
committed massive human rights abuses, which I would define as 
crimes against humanity.  I specifically think of the shameful 
slave trade which took place 200 years ago in Halifax or of the 
barbaric actions taken by colonial powers against our aboriginal 
populations from coast to coast to coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should never forget the practices of slaughtering the Beothuk 
in Newfoundland or the reallocation of the Inuit, the destruction 
of the Potlatch or the policy of residential schools. These 
practices were also a form of genocide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are things which we must recognize as part of our history 
and which Canadians should be educated about by our national 
institutions devoted to remembering the victims of crimes against 
humanity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sadly, it is easy to develop a list of all those who have been 
victims of genocide.  Our century has been the most barbaric in 
history.  As we have developed as a civilization with 
technological and scientific leaps, we have seen individuals, 
groups and whole societies use that technology to find better 
ways to kill their neighbours. The Holocaust and the famine in 
Ukraine are but two examples of how modern methods which were 
meant to raise our standard of living have been used to mass 
murder men, women and children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe it would be of benefit to Canada to have a national 
institution which recognizes these facts.  I believe that we need 
to educate our next generation on how these evils occur.  We need 
a showcase which allows Canadians to confront our past both as 
Canadians and as citizens of the world.  We need a place to mourn 
the millions who have died.  We need a place where we can learn 
from our history and so that it cannot be repeated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is Bill C-224 the best way to recognize the gravity of the 
subject?  I want to raise two questions on this issue.  First, 
should parliament dictate to a national museum the content of an 
exhibit?  That issue has already been raised tonight in the 
House.  Is a gallery at the current Museum of Civilization the 
most appropriate national forum for this subject? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the first question, I would have to answer with a firm no. 
Politicians should not get directly involved in telling museum 
directors and especially curators how to do their business. 
Politicians have a responsibility to provide a framework for 
appropriate expressions of our heritage.  The result has been the 
Museums Act which establishes our national museums and our 
national art gallery, and gives them arm's length government 
structures and states their goals in law. These institutions 
report back to parliament on how they are meeting their goals and 
account for their expenditures of public funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is our tradition.  That is the way it should work.  But if 
parliament says to a museum “Above and beyond your current 
responsibilities you must have the following specific exhibit 
with specific content objectives and meeting the specific 
following time line”, which is what clause 2 of Bill C-224 says, 
I have a real problem with that.  If this passes, then the 
tradition of the arm's length relationship with a national 
heritage agency is broken, and I do have a problem with that. 
I do not want politicians telling cultural agencies what art is 
or what history is.  That would be a danger.

<A HREF="#LINKT95"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a problem with the current bill based on the wording in 
clause 2 which breaks the arm's length relationship between 
parliament and the Canadian Museum of Civilization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is an exhibit at the museum of civilization the most appropriate 
forum?  I am proposing an alternative approach.  Why not ask the 
government to establish a genocide museum under the current 
structure of the Museums Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A separate institution would allow for the kind of meaningful 
discussion which I know would be required to have the best 
institution of this kind in the world.  Many views exist on what 
form a museum dedicated to victims of genocide should take.  I am 
aware that discussions have taken place between various parties, 
notably the groups proposing an institution, to remember the 
Holocaust and others in an appropriate forum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish all concerned success since I know that no group is 
approaching this debate with an agenda of exclusion.  The purpose 
of a stand-alone museum could be, as is set out in Bill C-224, to 
recognize the victims of crimes against humanity.  A separate 
institution would have a permanence, something that an exhibit at 
the museum of civilization may not have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A separate institution would allow for a special place for those 
who go not only to learn, but for those who go to remember and to 
mourn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am optimistic about this as a possibility, partly based on the 
work done by the member for Brampton Centre.  Many of the groups 
which have expressed support for the gallery included in the bill 
have also expressed support for a separate institution.  When the 
member for Brampton Centre asked the question of the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage about this matter on November 18 of this year, 
she stood in her place and encouraged all MPs to support the 
initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To me this is a clear signal that the government is open to a 
proposal for a stand-alone institution.  In the end, the success 
of an exhibit, gallery or separate institution would be based on 
adequate funding from the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having a proposal from the government would guarantee that the 
resource question has been dealt with.  I believe that having 
such an institution will not break the bank.  I remind members 
that the total cost of all our national museums and galleries is 
less than $4 per capita.  I think it is a bargain, quite frankly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should be noted that more Canadians visit museums than attend 
professional sports events every year.  The museum of 
civilization and its affiliate museum, the war museum, received 
over one and a half million visits last year alone. While all 
such institutions cost money, they are used and they are valued 
by Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I regret not being able to support Bill C-224 
because of how it breaches the arm's length relationship which I 
believe parliament should maintain for our cultural institutions 
or agencies, but I am proud to add my voice to those calling on 
the government to create a museum which can deal with this 
important matter.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I consider 
it a privilege to rise before the House to debate the merits of 
Bill C-224, an act to establish an exhibit in the Canadian Museum 
of Civilization in recognition of the crimes against humanity, as 
defined by the United Nations, that have been perpetrated during 
the 20th century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate my hon. colleague for Brampton Centre for having 
the courage to introduce such an important piece of legislation. 
I say courage because there remains considerable controversy, 
whether some of the killings that are being characterized as 
crimes against humanity were somehow justified as acts of war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suspect that all parliamentarians have received significant 
amounts of correspondence in response to the member for Brampton 
Centre's private member's bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can honestly say that each day I receive a number of letters 
or postcards from fellow Canadians showing their strong views 
about the prospects of Canada establishing an all encompassing 
Canadian genocide museum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank each and every one of those Canadians who have taken the 
time to share their personal experiences with me.  Reading about 
some of their terrible experiences has helped me develop a 
greater understanding and deeper sense of appreciation for this 
wonderful country in which we live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suspect that most Canadians who have the good fortune of being 
born in a country such as Canada are guilty of taking our freedom 
for granted.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Our heroes who fought during the first and second world wars and 
those who participated in the Boer and Korean wars, along with 
the many peacekeepers who have represented us with honour 
throughout the hot spots in the world, would have a different 
perspective about what it means to live in a free and democratic 
society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In an ideal world, all people are created equal and are free to 
live and work where they choose and free to practise their own 
religion without fear of persecution.  Unfortunately, history has 
shown that this simply is not the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>History is riddled with extraordinary acts of cruelty against 
mankind.  Crimes against humanity have been chronicled almost 
since the beginning of time.  It is because of this long history 
of treachery that I question whether an exhibition of crimes 
against humanity that is limited to the 20th century is 
sufficient. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many examples of genocides or crimes against humanity 
which have had a direct impact on the evolution of Canadian 
society.  To ignore some of them by restricting the exhibit to 
events that happened in the 20th century would be committing a 
huge disservice to our young Canadians.  Our youth should be 
exposed to the various interpretations of history so that they 
can develop a broader perspective and a better understanding of 
events that have shaped the social fabric of this country. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most Canadians know about the deportation of the Acadians that 
occurred in 1755. This was a tragic event in Canadian history. 
During the deportation, most Acadians were put on boats and sent 
to the United States. A lot of them ended up in Louisiana. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thousands of Acadians lost their lives in this tragedy. The 
survivors tried unsuccessfully to hook up again with their 
families. Many Acadians were able to flee to New-Brunswick and 
Quebec to avoid the fate of their fellow citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It took several centuries for Acadians to recover from this 
tragedy. Some would argue that we are still suffering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Historians do not all agree about this deportation. Was it a war 
against the Acadians or an ethnic cleansing operation? This, I 
guess, depends on the viewpoint of the historian. Nevertheless, 
no one can deny that this tragedy happened and that the measures 
taken by Great-Britain had some serious consequences. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A better understanding of what happened to our Acadian people 
can help Canadians to understand the interesting dynamics that 
have helped to shape our individual communities.  Surviving these 
crimes against humanity has created a special bond among our 
people.  It has given us cause to unite and strengthen our unique 
cultural heritage.  Understanding the tragedy of the 1755 
deportation can help us better appreciate the human suffering of 
more recent examples of crimes against humanity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On October 5, 1998 a redress monument was erected in the city of 
Montreal by the Armenian community.  It erected this monument on 
behalf of all victims of genocide in the 20th century.  This is a 
very significant achievement considering the extensive 
persecution that was carried out against the Armenian community. 
By recognizing not only its own tragedy but also the many acts of 
genocide committed in the world, the Armenian community has 
helped to focus our attention on this ongoing tragedy.  In a 
sense this act of compassion may help with the healing process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An all-encompassing genocide exhibit at the Canadian Museum of 
Civilization has been proposed by the hon. member for Brampton 
Centre.  It could be a very useful tool in helping Canadians to 
learn more about the terrible acts of terror we perpetrated 
against our fellow human beings.  Perhaps such exhibits might 
help the world come to grips with these atrocities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot stress strongly enough the notion that such an exhibit 
must be all-encompassing.  Where disagreement threatens to blow 
up into full-fledged controversy, it is important that both sides 
of a conflict be allowed to present their different perspectives 
on events surrounding a charge of genocide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Crimes against humanity are not a new phenomenon.  Examples of 
genocide can be traced to a time before the birth of Jesus 
Christ. 
Sadly, history is saddled with examples of acts of genocide. 
Crimes against humanity have been committed on religious, racial 
and political grounds, yet the only common denominator continues 
to be the extermination of millions of innocent men, women and 
children.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned the Armenians earlier because they were the victims 
of persecution in the early 1900s when millions were reportedly 
massacred during the first world war.  Although some argue that 
they were victims of war and not genocide, it is generally 
acknowledged by many historians that millions of Armenians were 
indeed the victims of genocide.  Even to this day, the Armenian 
people continue to be the target of the repressive government of 
Saddam Hussein. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Ukrainian people are another example of a people who 
suffered tremendous persecution, in particular during the early 
1930s.  Josef Stalin created a state-generated famine that 
resulted in the starvation deaths of millions of Ukrainians. 
These people died needlessly when there was food available to 
save them.  They were also victims of Hitler's ethnic cleansing 
policies that most people associate mainly with the Jewish 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think most people are aware of the Holocaust and the notorious 
death camps of the second world war in which over six million 
Jews perished.  These Jews were shipped from across Europe in 
order to be systematically slaughtered in those death camps. 
Perhaps ignored by history is the plight of the Gypsies and 
Ukrainians during this particular onslaught on humanity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The world was said to be appalled by this unprecedented attack 
against humanity.  At the time it was said that such a horror 
could never happen again.  We all know that history has an 
unfortunate way of repeating itself.  Many acts of genocide have 
occurred since the second world war and, unfortunately, many acts 
of genocide continue today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have examples of genocide in Cambodia where from 1975 to 
1979, between two million and four million people were killed by the 
Khmer Rouge simply for disagreeing with the regime.  More 
recently in 1994, we watched apathetically as the Hutus in Rwanda 
massacred hundreds of thousands of Tutsis.  We have the ethnic 
cleansing that was carried out in Bosnia-Herzegovina during the 
wars of the former Yugoslavia.  Even today, we are receiving word 
of crimes against humanity in Sudan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am standing here reciting atrocities as if they were score 
cards, yet we are talking about the death and destruction of 
millions of our fellow human beings.  Is it not disgusting how 
mankind has persecuted their fellow human beings?  Perhaps it is 
easier to talk about atrocities because we have not witnessed 
them ourselves.  I am afraid to consider that we are being 
desensitized by the constant reports of atrocities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it is indeed the case, as I do fear, then I think it is 
important that we support the member for Brampton Centre, along 
with the millions of people who are victims of crime against 
humanity.  Let us create this exhibit in the Canadian Museum of 
Civilization.  Perhaps by seeing this horror for ourselves, we 
might be more supportive in our efforts to try and put an end to 
these atrocities worldwide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  May I have some 
indication of how many members intend to speak on this motion?  I 
know there are two, the members for Lac-Saint-Louis and Vancouver 
Kingsway.  We have five minutes for the sponsor of the bill. 
There are about 15 minutes left, so that if the hon. member for

I will cite a few incidents of inhumanity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the earliest examples are the horrors that were 
perpetrated by the ancient Romans when they fought and destroyed 
Carthage. 
In the 1930s Stalin began his collectivization programs in 
Ukraine.  The result was mass starvation of untold numbers of 
Ukrainians, an atrocity that community even today is struggling 
to deal with.

slaughtered 35 million Chinese during the Japanese invasion of 
China. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1975 the Cambodian people began a terrifying period of their 
history as the Khmer Rouge took over.  The legacy of that 
regime is known as the killing fields.  Over the subsequent four 
years, an estimated 1.5 to 2 million Cambodian people were 
murdered or died as the result of the reorganization implemented 
by the Khmer Rouge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1994 attention slowly focused on Rwanda as news of a massacre 
emerged from the nation.  Those atrocities left communities 
shattered, families broken and left thousands struggling for 
survival. According to statistics from the Rwandan Ministry of 
Home Affairs, obtained from the preliminary census of the 
vulnerable groups, the number of vulnerable because of 
genocide stood at 145,881 widows, 49,299 without shelter and 
39,727 orphans.  The physically and mentally handicapped 
totalled 4,619. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As recently as last week, stories from East Timor tell of the 
discovery of mass graves; priests, women and children shot or 
stabbed to death and buried in an effort to conceal the evidence.

recalling history so that our children may learn from our past 
mistakes.

have learned to respect one another's culture, religion, race and

inhumanity of war, or by bigotry and oppression.

Canadians wish those moments had never happened.  We wish we 
could rewrite history but unfortunately we cannot.  However we 
can and must learn from the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are to learn from the past, if we are to hope that one day 
humankind can live together in peace and respect, we must always 
be mindful of the cruelty of tyranny, of the massacres of

that man has wrought on his fellow human beings.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We must all be aware of the extent of the atrocious crimes 
against humanity which have taken place through history. We will 
be better able to learn from the past if we remember the crimes 
against humanity which are still fresh in our memories and which 
are the sorry legacy of the 20th century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The voice of Canada is a voice for peace. Canada was the first

the way into a safer and more peaceful world. 
In the last throne speech, the government promised to put a 
greater emphasis on human security in its foreign policy, and 
help international bodies make progress on the global issue of 
human security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One is better able to understand the significance of this

</I></B></P><P align=left>We strongly believe that on the world stage we as Canadians can 
influence change.  Protection from crimes against humanity can 
best be gained through ensuring that all countries and their 
peoples have a profound respect for and understanding of the 
universal declaration of human rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Human rights are intrinsic to a rich and fulfilled life.  The 
recent 50th anniversary of the adoption of the universal 
declaration of human rights by the United Nations General 
Assembly gave Canadians a superb opportunity to reflect on how 
human rights contribute to the quality of life in Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>International and Canadian organizations keep on looking for 
solutions to the ongoing problems of human rights violations, 
and to problems that have just been identified as such. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The establishment of an International Criminal Tribunal is only 
one of the many current initiatives taken by Canada and the 
international community to deal with these problems. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the years Canada has established a legislative and policy 
framework that defines the rights as well as the responsibilities 
of its citizens.  Every jurisdiction in Canada has enforceable 
human rights legislation designed to combat discrimination in 
areas such as employment, accommodation, and the provision of 
goods and services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However legislation alone does not guarantee de facto civil and 
political rights in the country.  It must be combined with the 
supportive infrastructure of good public policy and programs that 
seek partnership with and are informed by civil society through 
NGOs, the private sector and our institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I emphasize the importance of learning about the 
tragedy of crimes against humanity in the 20th century and 
understanding the lessons of the past.  By ensuring that the 
lessons are well understood, we will be able to build a better 
society for future generations of Canadians.  Because of this I 
would like to thank my colleague for the opportunity he has given 
us today to debate the issue.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Brampton Centre, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, in the last parliament the House passed a unanimous 
resolution calling for the week of April 20 to April 27 every 
year to be recognized as the week of man's inhumanity to his 
fellow man.  The motion was accepted on the occasion of the 81st 
anniversary of the Armenian genocide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the spirit of that co-operation, I would like to propose the 
following to the House. 
I ask for unanimous consent of the House that Bill C-224, the 
recognition of crimes against humanity act, be made a votable 
item.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. member for

make this motion a votable item.  Is there unanimous consent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Sarkis Assadourian:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am sorry to hear 
that.  I ask for unanimous consent of the House to instruct the 
subcommittee on Private Members' Business of the Standing 
Committee on Procedure and House Affairs to reconsider the 
votable status of Bill C-224, the recognition of crimes against 
humanity act, and that the bill remain on the order of precedence 
until the committee reports on the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Is there unanimous 
consent of the House? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Sarkis Assadourian:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will try a third 
approach.  I ask for unanimous consent of the House to refer the 
subject matter of Bill C-224, the recognition of crimes against 
humanity act, to the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage for 
review and report no later than April 14, 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Does the House give 
its unanimous consent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I 
am assuming that along with the unanimous consent of the House we 
are acknowledging that the proceedings on this item have expired, 
or will shortly expire, and that the item will be dropped from 
the order paper in accordance with Standing Order 96(1). Then the 
House would have unanimously decided to refer the subject matter 
in the way expressed by the member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I will have to seek 
clarification.  As I understand it we are referring it to 
committee, but let me do a bit of consultation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are referring the subject matter of the bill to committee and not 
the bill.  The bill will die at the conclusion of these 
proceedings but the subject matter will be referred to the 
committee.  Is everyone clear on that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Yes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Is there unanimous 
consent to refer the subject matter to committee with the 
understanding that Bill C-224 will die today? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  Because I happen to be the chair of that committee I want 
to make sure what we are talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a very long agenda right through to well after the 
recess.  I want to know the importance of this matter.  Is it 
purely in principle so that we take whatever time is available? 
It could be many months before it ever comes up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  That would be the 
purview of the committee.  The subject matter would be referred 
to the committee and it would be at the pleasure of the 
committee, one would assume.  Once again I will check.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been brought to my attention that I neglected to add a 
written addendum, so I will read the motion again because there 
is a time limit on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what we will be deciding.  The hon. member for Brampton 
Centre has requested unanimous consent of the House to refer the 
subject matter of Bill C-224, the recognition of crimes against

and report no later than April 14, 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see there is ongoing discussion so we will just stall for a 
minute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln:</B>  Mr. Speaker, certainly I would like 
to try to accommodate my colleague if he would be more flexible. 
We have a huge amount of work before us.  If he would say before 
the June recess or something like that, we certainly would try 
our best to see how we could do it.  If he says April, I do not 
know.  I would not like to commit myself in that there is so 
little time to handle matters right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  It is highly unusual 
to have negotiations of this nature in the House.  The sponsor of 
the bill has to be in his place to say anything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee:</B>  Mr. Speaker, just to allow some time for 
animus revertendi to take place here, if the hon. member 
sponsoring the bill were to extend the date for return from the 
Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage to June 15, 2000, that 
would satisfy the hon. member who just spoke and might allow the 
House to adopt the unanimous consent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The Speaker is not 
able to negotiate something of this nature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Sarkis Assadourian:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am quite happy to 
extend it to June 15, 2000.  It will be a brand new beginning for 
the new century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  We will start all 
over again because we need to be absolutely clear on what we are 
doing here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Brampton Centre has requested unanimous 
consent of the House to refer the subject matter of Bill C-224,

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Wendy Lill:</B>  Mr. Speaker, when you say the subject 
matter being the crimes against humanity act, I understood the 
subject matter of the bill to be an exhibit of crimes against 
humanity.  I need clarification on what exactly we are asking the 
committee to deal with.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
today thousands of demonstrators were tear-gassed and pepper 
sprayed in Seattle in protest of the millennium round of the WTO 
and in defence of democracy.  Thousands of students, seniors, 
trade unionists and concerned citizens travelled to Seattle from 
Vancouver to join the tens of thousands of people there to make 
it crystal clear to Canadian government representatives, 
including the Minister for International Trade, that Canada is 
not for sale. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mobilization and opposition to globalization is widespread 
and more and more people are connecting and understanding how 
threatening the WTO agenda is to our democracy and public 
services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Liberal government believes it can get away with quietly 
handing over control of our resources and services to the WTO it 
is absolutely mistaken.  It is shameful that the Canadian 
government has supported and promoted the very narrow and 
anti-democratic definition of trade liberalization as envisaged 
in the WTO. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether it is the auto pact that protected Canadian jobs, farm 
income support or culture, Canada has already suffered from WTO 
rulings.  We are threatened now with challenges to our drug 
patent laws that will force drug prices to go up even higher than 
they have been under NAFTA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is even scarier is that for the first time the federal 
government is looking to include health care and education as 
priorities for export.  Any changes in the General Agreement on 
Trade in Services by reverting to a top down agreement will be 
devastating to our education and health care and allow them to 
become commodities for trade and subject to control by foreign 
corporations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot believe the Liberals are allowing this to happen.  Who 
is serving whom?  Surely the role of our federal government is to 
serve the public interest, meet the needs of Canadians and 
protect our valuable resources and services.  All the evidence 
shows us that the Liberal government has gone on a wild binge of 
serving not ordinary Canadians but the corporate elites and the 
global market ideology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians who are at the battle in Seattle today and many more 
people who could not be there are saying to the government, 
“Stop the WTO sell out.  We are opposed to the global hegemony. 
We are opposed to corporate rule.  We are opposed to Canadian 
resources and public services being put on the WTO chopping 
block”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need rules that protect our services and rules that make 
multinational corporations operate within the confines of the 
public interest.  Why will the government not make that its goal? 
It is what Canadians want. 
<P><A NAME="LINK226"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cannis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is our goal.  The upcoming 
negotiations of the WTO, which will be launched in Seattle on 
November 30, have generated a lot of interest, and rightfully so. 
These talks are important to Canadians, as they should be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the agreements that will be discussed is the General 
Agreement on Trade in Services.  This is an important agreement 
for Canada, as we were in 1998 the 10th largest exporter of 
services in the world.  Currently over 60% of our GDP and 12% of 
our exports are in the service sector and service exports are 
growing at a rate of over 9% per year. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1905"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT103"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our service industries are a critical component of our growing 
knowledge based economy.  As well, with advances in technology, 
an ever-increasing amount of our goods exported depend on a 
service component either in the production process, distribution 
or after sales service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Globalization is pushing Canada to grow and develop markets 
outside our borders.  This is benefiting Canadians and is an 
important contributor to job creation.  Because we are trading 
beyond our borders, it is important to have rules to protect our 
interests.  These multilateral rules, agreed to by the 134 member 
countries of the WTO, helped to create an orderly marketplace. 
This is why we participate in the World Trade Organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has world class service firms in sectors including 
engineering, telecommunications, environmental, computer, tourism 
and financial services.  In GATS negotiations, we will try to 
further open foreign markets for Canadian service exports.  As in 
the case for goods, more exports of services means more jobs for 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, we are fully aware of domestic sensitivities 
in certain service sectors such as health, education and social 
services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As has been stated already and stressed, in the WTO and under 
GATS, our universal health care and public education are not 
subject to any international trade rules unless Canada accepts 
such rules.  This means that we will not be engaging in 
negotiations in these most important sectors.  Canada's position 
is that our health care and public education system are not 
negotiable and will not be jeopardized in the current upcoming 
negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The motion to adjourn 
the House is now deemed to have been adopted. Accordingly, this 
House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m., pursuant to
