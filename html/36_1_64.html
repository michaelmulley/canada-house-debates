</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from February 19 consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-19, an act to amend the Canada Labour Code (Part I) 
and the Corporations and Labour Unions Returns Act and to make 
consequential amendments to other acts, be read the second time 
and referred to a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Gouk:</B>  Mr. Speaker, for clarification, as I 
understand it, the member from the Liberal Party had just 
finished speaking at the last period for debate on this bill and 
is now subject to a period of 10 minutes of questions and 
comments.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it possible to proceed in that way, given that comments can 
be made by opposition members relative to the speech she made? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Technically speaking it is, if the time is 
available.  I do not know if the member is here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member has 10 minutes of questions and comments coming 
to her.  Are there any questions and comments? 
<P><A NAME="LINK4"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Gouk (West Kootenay—Okanagan, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I was reviewing the speech made by the hon. member when 
this bill was last debated in the House and I would like to 
comment on a couple of the things she stated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, and I am quoting from <I>Hansard</I>, she said: “I 
reject the view that collective bargaining is no longer relevant. 
The freedom of workers to organize and bargain collectively is a 
cornerstone of our democratic, market based society”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She went on to suggest that Canadian employers have also 
benefited from the collective bargaining system.  She said: “It 
helps to ensure stability, predictability and efficiency”. She 
goes on to state that 95% of collective agreements in Canada are 
negotiated without a work stoppage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is not with the 95% of the collective agreements 
which are settled without a work stoppage.  The problem is the 
overwhelming impact of large national employers that represent 
the 5%. That is the stoppage we are worried about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One side says do we penalize the 95% because of the problems 
created by the 5%?  We say no, do not penalize anybody. Who says 
that something that started 150 years ago should carry on without 
change?  Who says it should not be brought in at least to the 
20th century as we approach the 21st? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Strikes and lockouts are not a part of collective bargaining. 
They are a result of the breakdown of collective bargaining. 
Strikes and lockouts are a form of coercion used by one side or 
the other to try to return to real collective bargaining. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we need is a dispute settlement mechanism which works 
without causing catastrophic harm to Canadians, to Canadian 
workers, to Canadian business, to the Canadian economy and to our 
international reputation of having reliable suppliers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She uses the words reliability, certainty and efficiency in her 
speech, but what we need is something which absolutely ensures 
Canadians that— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I will give the hon. member a chance to 
respond. 
<P><A NAME="LINK5"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Labour, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the comments of 
my hon. colleague.  His point is well taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no doubt that when 5% of the workforce is affected by a 
strike or a lockout, a disruption in service, there is an impact. 
However, it must be balanced with the fact that collective 
bargaining has been and continues to be in some fields a very 
necessary tool in maintaining safety in the workplace and work 
standards, in setting hours that are to be worked to avoid 
inordinate hours and in setting types of pay.  Collective 
bargaining is important in many different aspects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the hon. member pointed out, 95% to 97% of all bargaining is 
settled.  That is a heck of a good record.  When both sides sit 
down they have the opportunity to air their complaints and they 
come to an agreement.  That agreement fosters a good working 
environment.  People want to work together and they want the 
company to do well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to look at all sides of the issue.  In this piece of 
legislation there are a number of riders and conditions 
concerning strike and lockout rights which will be helpful, such 
as the provision for a 72 hour advance notice of a strike or 
lockout which must be given to the other party and filed with the 
minister of labour.  That will avoid surprising the parties and 
the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of key things such as that in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  My colleagues, if I know how many hon. 
members want to ask questions or make comments then I can divide 
the time.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia—Matane, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point 
of clarification from my hon. colleague. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would say that a lockout or a strike is serious enough as it is. 
I cannot understand why there is no provision in this Bill C-19 to 
prevent the employer from hiring replacement workers. When there are 
disputes, sometimes, there is violence. In Quebec, we have antiscab 
legislation prohibiting the replacement of strikers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder why a similar provision was not included in this bill, so 
that workers cannot be replaced while on strike. I think this would make 
the rules of the game clearer. This would prevent acts of violence. It 
would prevent outbursts of anger and fights. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
answer this question.  The reason that the bill does allow for 
some conditions for replacement workers is that we believe the 
bill has to be balanced and fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will hear Reform Party members say they want that very 
strongly.  We will hear the NDP and the Bloc say they do not want 
any. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that the Liberal Party has always stood for 
fairness and balance in trying to find a compromise that is 
workable.  That is what we are trying to achieve in this bill, 
some sort of compromise that allows for employers to continue if 
it is needed, but that there are safeguards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are things in the bill like the formation of the new board 
which my colleague from Lambton—Kent—Middlesex is going to 
address later this morning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They all are an integral part of the bill which will make it 
work well.  I really hope members will support this. I went to 
Vancouver with the minister and we had about 140 individuals come 
to speak to us, with very few dissenting votes on this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers pleaded for it.  We had labour pleading for it.  We had 
several different types of management pleading for it.  I think 
we really need to get on with this.  It needs reform and we are 
going to try to do that in a balanced way. 
<P><A NAME="LINK7"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, one 
of the aspects of Bill C-19 that we are optimistic about is the 
composition of the new industrial relations board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask if the parliamentary secretary to the 
minister could speak a little about how she might see the 
composition of this new board speeding the backlog of cases 
currently pending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One aspect is that, from this point onwards, a single chair or 
vice-chair might be able to hear certain matters, rather than 
waiting for the composition of the full three person panel.  We 
would hope that might be able to expedite a backlog of cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be interested in hearing some targets or goals or ways 
she might be planning on dealing with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is very kind of 
my hon. colleague to allow me to elaborate a little on this 
because I think it is a key part in the good working of this 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill provides for the establishment of a new 
representational industrial relations board to replace the 
non-representational Canada labour relations board.  I think that 
is a key part. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The statute will require that the chair and vice-chairs have 
experience and expertise in industrial relations.  It seems to be 
common sense, although it was not always there, that the minister 
consult employer and employee organizations on the appointment of 
representative members, again a really good thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will make the board more responsive.  It will provide 
flexibility necessary to ensure that applications are dealt with 
in a timely manner and allow for a more cost effective 
administration of the code and encourage the use of alternative 
dispute resolution mechanisms, which again is key because we are 
looking at different ways to solve disputes. That is key when we 
have problems in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will address complex labour relations issues in today's 
changing workplace, a very important part of this bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Gouk (West Kootenay—Okanagan, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is West Kootenay—Okanagan.  A number of MPs have a 
bill in to amend the names of ridings.  By the time you have got 
it, it is going to change again.  I just thought I would put you 
on warning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very pleased to rise speak to Bill C-19.  There is a lot to 
be said about it and I believe a lot of people in the House will 
be speaking about it today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting that the Liberal member who just spoke said it 
was neither fish nor fowl.  They like to sit in the middle.  They 
have not really done a lot for this side or that side.  They have 
done a bit here and a bit there.  Sometimes that works and other 
times it does not.  This is an example of when that type of 
approach to things simply does not work.  Instead of fixing the 
problems, they make it a little bad for both sides.  In other 
words, they reduce the problem to the lowest common denominator 
of a problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is appropriate that I lead off with a reiteration of the 
Reform Party's written policy on labour, the right of workers to 
organize democratically, bargain collectively and strike 
peacefully. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to break that down into three separate parts so we 
can deal with exactly how the bill relates to our written policy 
on these things.  The first one is the right to organize 
democratically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Democracy can refer to the right of an individual or it can 
refer to the right of a group.  In the case of the bill it allows 
the renamed CIRB to certify a union without the support of a 
majority of the employees.  The bill also allows the CIRB to 
order an employer to release to the union the name and addresses 
of employees who work off site without requiring the employees' 
permission.  Both these provisions totally ignore the rights of 
individual employees and ignore the rights of employee groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can it possibly be said that democracy is being upheld, the 
question of organizing democratically, if the majority of the 
bargaining unit or the employee group has not said they want to 
be part of this union but this new CIRB can go ahead and 
establish it anyway?  That is hardly organizing democratically. 
It is basically one person or a small group of people making an 
arbitrary decision for a very large group of people.  That is 
something that flies in the face of democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Likewise, to say that an off site employee, a contracted 
employee, can have his name and address applied to a union 
without his permission is also undemocratic.  If the Liberal 
Party is looking for balance, this thing that says we do not want 
to go too far this way or too far that way, how about making a 
requirement that the employer pass on to these individuals 
materials supplied by the unions?  These individuals would have 
an opportunity to see what the union is proposing, what it wants 
to do and a way of contacting it if that is what they choose to 
do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, to arbitrarily hand out names of non-union people to 
the union so that they can take whatever action they choose to 
take, I do not think meets the test of democracy at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second part of our written policy deals with collective 
bargaining, the right to bargain collectively.  Here is where I 
differ from the member who just spoke and the NDP member who 
intervened in questions and comments.  I do not see taking away 
the right to strike in certain situations as ending collective 
bargaining.  I do not understand the concept of thinking or lack 
thereof that goes through someone's head when they say that 
strikes are what collective bargaining is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Strikes are an indicator of the failure of the collective 
bargaining system.  That is all it is.  Collective bargaining 
involves three things.  I have told hon. members this before. 
Maybe if I tell them enough it will start to sink in.  There are 
three components to collective bargaining:  negotiation, 
conciliation and mediation.  Those are the tools of collective 
bargaining. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When collective bargaining fails we have a strike by the 
employees or a lockout by the employer. It is pure and simple. 
Even then that strike or that lockout does not solve the impasse. 
It drives them back to the other point where either an offer 
comes through negotiation or they go back to mediation and 
conciliation. 
Strikes and lockouts do not solve problems.  They are a form of 
coercion that is used to drive the other side back to one of the 
three steps of collective bargaining.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consider the taking away of the right to strike of workers in 
certain situations, essential services.  Let us use an example 
that everybody accepts.  Would we expect to see the police 
standing on the sidewalk watching someone being beaten, mugged, 
raped or killed and doing nothing because they were on strike? Of 
course we would not.  We understand that in the public interest 
we must have the police on duty.  Even the NDP accepts that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Have we done away with collective bargaining?  Why can we not 
allow them to negotiate, to have conciliation, and to have 
mediation?  If all those things broke down, the only difference 
would be that rather than go on strike and get into the scenario 
I have just described we would have a dispute settlement 
mechanism that is as fair as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will talk a little later, as I am sure many members expect, 
about final offer arbitration.  The point is that during the kind 
of collective bargaining where the right to strike is not an end 
result, if something goes wrong we still have the collective 
bargaining process.  During that process any method of settlement 
could be agreed upon.  Right now we can still do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When someone is negotiating and things are not going well, if 
they have the right to strike the decision can be to go on strike 
or to lock the employees out.  They can mutually agree to binding 
arbitration.  They can agree to flipping a coin.  They can agree 
to just about anything.  Under what we have proposed they could 
still do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Final offer arbitration is a dispute settlement mechanism that 
is used to prevent work disruption that has a catastrophic impact 
on Canadians, our economy, our business and our international 
reputation.  They can still settle on whatever other method they 
want.  All we want is to have some dispute settlement mechanism 
that can be used if all else fails and they cannot agree on 
anything else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third part is to strike peacefully.  We believe in the right 
of unions under normal circumstances to strike peacefully if 
things have not gone well.  It is a very inefficient way to 
settle the problems, but in the normal run of things we agree 
that under the present process they can strike if they cannot 
reach a settlement and this is the route they choose to go, as 
long as it is a peaceful strike. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe the question of what is and what is not peaceful needs to 
be examined.  Peaceful does not necessarily refer only to the 
lack of violence.  A strike, for example in the port of 
Vancouver, impacts on business and industry across British 
Columbia because they need products coming in through the port 
The strike could involve towns and communities being shut down 
and workers being laid off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This could happen in certain small towns in my riding.  In one 
town the principal employer is a smelter.  In another town the 
principal employer is a pulp mill.  If they cannot export their 
products or bring in ore or the different supplies and materials 
they need to run their plants, they shut down entire towns.   It 
affects farmers right across the prairies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is that peaceful?  Is it peaceful when the entire economy of a 
town is thrown into turmoil and some people lose their businesses 
or their livelihoods?  Maybe they have mortgaged their homes to 
put money into their businesses and they risk losing them.  They 
are not even part of the negotiation process.  They are an 
example of what happens when it goes wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the past few years we have had national port strikes and 
national rail strike.  I had the same problem in my riding during 
the national rail strike.  We reached a point where it was almost 
a shutdown of the economies of entire communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have just had a Canada Post strike, the fourth strike in 10 
years.  Each time it ends up in legislation.  Is this a good 
process?  Should we let them go on strike?  Should we say “Yes, 
you have the right to strike, but when you go out we will 
legislate you back”, or should we come up with something that 
meaningfully deals with some form of dispute settlement 
mechanism?  It would ensure that workers would not lose their 
wages and the company would not lose its revenue and ultimately 
some of its business, which means jobs for the employees.  What 
about all the people who are impacted by mail dependent 
businesses?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe we need to look at this situation collectively.  I realize 
that each party has different political philosophies and points 
of view.  Instead of standing on our own little hills and saying 
I am right, maybe we need to sit down together to find some way 
to address all the problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill, by singling out the grain industry for special 
consideration, is acknowledging the need to make special 
provisions.  Why do we not do it across the board?  The bill 
recognizes that there should be some certainty in the ability of 
farmers to ship grain and in our fulfilling international grain 
contracts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case we are talking of the ports.  What about all the 
other things that go through ports?  A tremendous amount of 
potash from Saskatchewan used to be shipped internationally 
through the port of Vancouver.  The port was so unreliable that 
the Saskatchewan potash industry made a deal with the port of 
Portland, Oregon, to build new facilities.  It is shipped by rail 
down there.  It is felt to be a much more certain method of 
shipment.  The port of Vancouver has lost that business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Workers have lost work because of strikes which have resulted in 
shippers being concerned about the reliability of that port. That 
business has gone.  They cannot come back and sign a 10 year 
contract.  Those facilities have been built and the contracts 
have been made down there.  That is business lost to Canada. That 
is revenue lost to Canada.  Those are jobs lost to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we start questioning the right to strike, we are not only 
doing it for business, for taxes, or for things of that nature. 
We are doing it for jobs, about which I am sure the other parties 
feel very strongly.  They want more jobs for Canadians.  They 
want better jobs for Canadians.  We cannot have better jobs for 
Canadians if Canadians lose their jobs because the people who use 
the services do not feel confident about them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Strikes and lockouts hit absolutely everyone.  They hit the 
businesses, employees and jobs I have just described. Everybody 
is impacted.  It is an old, archaic way of dealing with a 
problem.  We have to find a new way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to touch on one aspect of the bill on which I admit 
that I differ from my own party's position.  Who says at any time 
that everything is right or everything is wrong?  There are 
always different colours.   I want to address the fact that I 
differ for a very specific reason on the point of replacement 
workers.  I happen not to like the concept of replacement 
workers.  From my point of view I would be quite happy if there 
were no replacement workers.  I know this is at odds with my 
party.  The strength of our party is the fact that we do not all 
have to stand and sing off the same song sheet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole concept of strikes is stupid.  It has to be changed 
and I have already addressed that at length.  Replacement workers 
tilt the scales to one side.  If there is a strike or a lockout 
employees cannot replace the company.  They cannot replace 
management and go back to work while management stays out because 
they did not co-operate.  How can there be an offset of balance 
on the other side?  They cannot replace the company but the 
company can replace them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The collective bargaining system needs to be amended so that we 
have a better dispute settlement mechanism and there are no 
strikes. Then the question of replacement workers will not even 
come up.  While it is there, all we are doing is trying to soften 
some of the impacts of strikes to make like it is not as bad as 
it is.  It is bad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people might find this humorous, but I recently saw a rerun 
of an old episode of the original <I>Star Trek</I> program.  A 
planet had been at war for 300 years. In order to get rid of the 
carnage and the destruction of its civilization, buildings and 
everything else, it agreed to fight the war by computer.  What 
happened was another world mounted an attack by computer.  The 
computer decided how effective the attack would be and how many 
people would have to be killed. 
Then they just marched 125,000, or however many there were, into 
destruction chambers. Nice and clean, no carnage, no destruction 
of their buildings or anything. And because they had done it in 
this clean way to soften the impact of the real horrors of war, 
the war had gone on for 300 years.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Good old Captain Kirk went in and destroyed all the destruction 
chambers so they could not meet their quota and then the real war 
started. He said that was what was necessary to solve the war 
because as long as you keep putting band-aids on something, you 
are never going to have the real impact of problems and 
consequently you are not going to deal with the real problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case it is strikes and lockouts. We cannot keep putting 
in things that tilt the balance of the real horrors of strikes 
and lockouts. Let it get to its absolute worst and then maybe 
finally people will realize we have to find a better way to 
resolve these things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the Reform Party the better way is final offer arbitration. 
I have spoken to union groups and business groups all over the 
country on this particularly in my own riding. One of the things 
I say is if there is something better that does not result in a 
work disruption, I am all for it. If they would rather do 
something else as long as it does not end up in a work 
disruption, then I think that is great. But until such time as 
someone comes forward with a better idea, and given that I am 
totally opposed to work disruptions because they are bad for 
absolutely everybody, then I think this is a viable alternative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Final offer arbitration is something designed first of all to 
bring the employer and the employee as close together as 
possible. Hopefully that 95% becomes 96%, 97%, 98%, as close to 
100% as can humanly be brought.  There are always going to be 
some difficulties where employees and employers simply will not 
settle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about wages. Simplistically put if it is a wage item 
and all the economic indicators in the marketplace suggest that a 
rightful raise is $1.50 and the company offers $1 and the union 
says it wants $5, the union is going to end up getting 50 cents 
less than it would reasonably be entitled to because it was 
unreasonable in its demands. Likewise if the union says it wants 
$2 and the employer says “We do not think you deserve anything 
and we are not offering anything”, the employees are going to 
get 50 cents more than they were reasonably entitled to. Each 
side knows it.  And if they want to roll the dice and say `We are 
going to try for $5 just in case the arbitrator is sleeping and 
lets this slide through', it is not going to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are suggestions that it is still a roll of the dice. It 
depends on how the actual mechanism is designed. It can be 
designed in such a way so that it cannot be an arbitrary decision 
of either this package or that package.  Rather it has to be 
weighed against a whole number of economic indicators, the cost 
of living, past raises, the ability of the company to pay, 
comparability as to what other industries in comparable 
workplaces are paying, all of these different factors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That can be designed into it.  There can be a requirement that 
the arbitrator or arbitration panel, if that is the way it is 
designed, has to make a decision as to which one is closest to 
meeting all of the requirements. Then when the arbitrator is 
finished a report has to be prepared justifying the package that 
has been chosen against each of those indicators. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can design something that will work. It will work for both 
sides. It will work for the employer and it will work for the 
employee, but every bit as important if not more so, it works for 
everybody else in Canada who is impacted by these strikes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A small strike that deals with a store and its employees in a 
small group and there are alternatives for customers and there is 
no major impact is one thing. However when there are strikes that 
shut down the industry of this entire country, we have to 
recognize that we have globally grown to the point where it is no 
longer feasible to have work disruptions in certain industries.

there? If it is recognized that the problems in the grain 
industry are too overwhelming, then why can it not be seen that 
this needs to be expanded to others as well, to the mining 
industry, to the forestry industry, to all of the other 
industries so that Canada can once again have a reputation of 
being reliable.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
have a number of points I would like to raise with regard to the 
speech by the hon. Reform critic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He started with a comment on what he thought was an unfair 
aspect of the bill.  It had to do with the automatic 
certification in an organizing drive where the union can 
demonstrate that there were unfair labour practices, or where the 
board finds there were unfair labour practices the board may then 
intervene and grant certification even if the number of union 
cards signed does not indicate a majority vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I challenge the Reform critic's reaction to this. It is very 
much an issue of basic fairness and natural justice in that where 
there is interference to the point where the true wishes of the 
employees cannot be figured out because there has been 
interference, then it should be the role of the board to 
intervene just to give them the benefit of the doubt and grant 
that certification. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The counterbalancing aspect of this is that a year later, after 
the certification has been granted, if those same employees do 
not like being represented by a union, they can decertify just as 
easily as they certified.  Many people do not realize that.  A 
group of employees can make application to the board at any time 
and decertify just as they can certify the union. I really do not 
think it is an issue and it is one of the fairer aspects of the 
code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member spoke a number of times on how strikes, work lockouts 
and interruptions are in fact violent figuratively and literally. 
I would argue that withholding one's services is the most 
peaceful way of dealing with any kind of an impasse in the 
bargaining process.  In fact it is a form of passive resistance. 
It is time honoured.  All through history groups that have not 
had access to sources of power traditionally have used the act of 
withholding their services to add emphasis to their argument. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do have other things I would like to speak about but lastly, 
the member and I have had the argument about final offer 
selection a number of times and I am not going to speak to that 
at length.  In fact I would like to recognize the— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The hon. member for West Kootenay—Okanagan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Gouk:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will try to be brief because 
I know there is another question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I point out to the hon. member that I am not the labour 
critic.  I just happen to be speaking on this bill on behalf of 
our labour critic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the hon. member talked about interference in the process 
of certification by giving them the benefit of the doubt. Why not 
give them the benefit of the doubt the other way?  That cuts two 
ways.  If there is no proof that those employees want to join, 
then why not have it conducted by a separate vote individually 
for those people and find out.  Do not just arbitrarily assume 
that they were interfered with so they would have joined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The concept that they can just decertify after a year is an 
absolute crock.  The member knows full well that once a union is 
in place, if those workers step forward and identify themselves 
as being opposed to that union, boy, if they do not get it 
decertified they have a major problem inside that bargaining 
unit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second thing the hon. member talked about was passive 
resistance, the peacefulness of a strike.  He totally missed the 
point which unfortunately is not really surprising. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where the problem lies, and I used an analogy to violence, is 
when families are going hungry, when businessmen in small 
businesses are losing their jobs, are losing their businesses and 
perhaps are losing their homes.  Entire communities are shut down 
because the services impacted on them. When that happens, that is 
my understanding of something which is not peaceful, not violent 
in the physical sense but certainly violent in terms of 
disrupting good Canadians' lives.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
will speak rather specifically and I do not know whether the 
member will want to respond. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the years a number of things have happened in the 
transportation industry. The statutory freight rate was dropped 
and rail line abandonments are taking place.  All of this was 
supposed to help western diversification. People were supposed to 
begin processing agricultural products inland to reduce some 
shipping charges or things like that.  These kinds of things now 
take place, but under the current regime the things that are 
protected at port are the unprocessed agricultural products like 
grain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My riding happens to have a number of dehy plants.  Their 
concern is that their products are not protected under 
legislation like this.  They ship their products out to the 
coast.  Grain shipments are protected but we are talking about 
all farm income, not just the grain portion of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation is deficient in this regard.  It does not 
really protect farmers' interests the way it is meant to.  It 
protects the grain industry, but it does not necessarily protect 
the agricultural industry. Small shippers will be left vulnerable 
because the government would be under pressure to deal with the 
strike where grains are concerned but it would not be under any 
pressure to seek a resolution for the smaller shippers like 
agricultural dehy plants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to bring that to the attention of the House. Not 
everything fits into broad definitions. Consequently we need a 
mechanism that will protect everybody. I believe that the final 
offer arbitration selection process is the way to go, aside from 
having to have an exception or something written into every piece 
of legislation, such as the grain transportation act and things 
like that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to see the House seriously consider what our hon. 
member is proposing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Gouk:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will be very brief in my 
response.  The hon. member raises a good point.  I brought it up 
at length during my speech in debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It cannot be said too often that government recognizes the need 
to intercede in the grain industry, therefore why can it not 
recognize that need in other agricultural areas, in mining and 
forestry and in all the other commodities that are shipped? There 
cannot be special treatment for one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make it absolutely clear that we are not suggesting 
that grain be taken out. We think the fact that the government 
recognizes it is a small baby step in the right direction.  What 
we are asking the government to do now is to recognize that it 
actually, by accident or otherwise, did something right, and to 
build on that and to do something right, to protect all 
industries, all agricultural sectors not just one small part. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, on the subject of FOS, I 
would like to actually move a little from the arguments that I 
have had with the previous speaker a number of times on final 
offer selection.  As he is aware, I have used final offer 
selection in the province of Manitoba and I am well aware of the 
whole process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The difference between the legislation in Manitoba and what the 
hon. member has been putting forward here is that the employees 
get to vote on whether or not they would use the final offer 
selection process. Therefore either party, the employer or the 
employees, can make application in this case to the provincial 
government to use the process.  The labour board would then 
supervise a vote of all the employees. If the majority of the 
employees chose to settle the round of bargaining by FOS, so be 
it.  There would be no strike, no lockout and a final selection 
arbitrator would ultimately choose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a situation like that, I have no argument.  I think it is a 
useful tool.  We recognize that.  I have actually used it in my 
personal labour relations experience.  I will give that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Gouk:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
his intervention on this point. 
I understand how it worked in his home province.  It worked well 
but it worked slightly differently.

other who are not part of the strike, are not part of the 
bargaining group, impacted sometimes catastrophically.

problem of job disruption, which would deal fairly with the—

I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for 
Lambton—Kent—Middlesex. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk a bit about some of the issues the previous 
speaker touched on.  I also want to talk about what is the role 
of government in the area of labour relations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that, very important, the role of government is to try 
to establish a balanced and level playing field which has some 
fairness.  We see that in provincial governments.  We have seen 
it traditionally in the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the hon. member opposite talks about final offer 
arbitration as being the panacea to labour unrest, I think he 
misses a number of key points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe that responsible labour leaders want to lead 
their people on strike.  They want to negotiate the best deal 
they can for the men and women in the rank and file.  They know 
the hardship of going out on strike. Many have come up through 
the rank and file.  They know the last thing they want to do is 
lead their people out on strike. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the hon. member did not mention is that these labour 
leaders are elected.  Indeed they are politicians.  I know a bit 
about it because my father was one for 26 years, the national 
director of the United Steelworkers of America, a vice-president 
of the Canadian Labour Congress and the chairman of the ICFTU in 
Brussels.  He has had a bit of experience in the area of labour 
relations, as have I. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During my previous incarnation in the Ontario legislature I was 
the labour critic for the Liberal Party when Mr. Rae was in 
power.  Believe me, there were a number of issues which came 
forward in that regime.  It was a bit like shooting fish in a 
barrel.

Fundamentally, all the labour leaders today, particularly 
industrial labour leaders, are vice-presidents of the New 
Democratic Party.  That was not the case in the days of Bill 
Mahoney.  That was not the case in the days of Joe Morris. That 
was not the case in the days of Charlie Mallard.  That was 
because they understood that it was their responsibility to 
represent the men and women who elected them at every level of 
government.  If they walked into a meeting with John Diefenbaker, 
Mike Pearson or a Conservative provincial premier they knew that 
person automatically knew they were a vice-president of the party 
whose main goal in life was to destroy the government— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> So they were dishonest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Excuse me.  The member is suggesting 
my dad and those people were dishonest?  I find that to be a 
repugnant comment from the member of the New Democratic Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was quite the opposite.  They were honest, dedicated and 
faithful to the people they worked for, the men and women who 
elected them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to tell him something else.  I believe it was in 1958.  I 
was a fairly young boy and it was Christmas time.  We had a large 
family.  My mom and dad had 10 kids.  They were both in labour 
quite often.  There was a strike in district 6 which involved the 
cities of Hamilton and Sault Ste. Marie.  It was a big strike. It 
was a big issue.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My dad was the national director.  I remember my family having 
some pretty good Christmases, but this one Christmas was 
particularly lean.  My mother explained to me that my father was 
on strike pay and that it would be a difficult Christmas. Is that 
not interesting? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member opposite says he would like to see some solutions 
that would avoid strikes.  How about if the head of the union 
goes on strike pay when he or she leads their membership out on 
strike?  That might make them change their minds.  This is just 
an alternative idea that I throw out to the member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem with final offer selection is that it works only in 
financial matters.  There is a lot more involved in labour 
negotiations and labour relations than simply the $1.50 raise the 
member talked about.  There are health and safety issues, 
conditions in the workplace and the term of the contract. There 
can be a lot of different issues put forward that simply will not 
fit in that neat little box that the Reform Party seems to want 
to wrap up labour relations into. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard a member asking if we would expect a police officer to 
stand by and watch a crime being committed because they were on 
strike.  Everybody knows that the police and firefighters cannot 
strike. That is a given.  That is not what we are talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are talking about in this bill is creating a level 
playing field where labour and management can sit down and 
negotiate.  What are they negotiating?  The workers, through 
their leadership, are negotiating with the only tool they have, 
their services.  Their services are their product.  They can go 
to management and tell it what their services are, that they are 
underpaid, conditions are bad, they are concerned about its 
health and safety track record and they want management to 
improve things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people will say unions were important back in the 1930s and 
1940s but they are not important today.  I strongly disagree with 
that.  I did not follow in my dad's footsteps in the labour 
movement.  I went into business.  I too have concerns when there 
are irresponsible strikes, which we have all seen.  However, I 
also have concerns when there are companies that refuse to 
bargain in good faith. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are putting forward are a number of amendments that will 
bring some form of calm to the labour relations movement in this 
country and bring clarity to the ability to certify a union. What 
can possibly be wrong with saying to a new organizing union that 
it must get somewhere between 35% and 50% of the people to join 
its union and sign a card before a vote is ordered?  If the union 
gets over 50%, which is not just a matter of submitting cards but 
a clear indication that men and women who have signed these cards 
want to form a union, then the board can certify a majority of 
the people who would be in the union or could call for a vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In some jurisdictions such as Ontario we have seen where some 
unions have said that there was going to be a vote no matter 
what.  Even if 90% of the cards are signed, the union does not 
care because it is an automatic vote and it is a right of 
democracy.  I understand the rationale behind that, but there are 
also a lot of problems in the federal area when that occurs 
simply because many of the jurisdictions we are talking about are 
right across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about people who work in the airline industry they 
can come from all across the country.  When they land in Montreal 
are we going to run up and get them to sign a card or cast a 
ballot as they leave the airplane and come down the ramp?  It is 
very difficult.  There must be more structure just because of the 
700,000 men and women who work in the private sector regulated 
under the federal act.  That is what this does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to talk briefly about what I think is totally 
a red herring, the issue of giving out names and addresses to 
people who work off site.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We live in a different economy today.  We see what is happening 
in the union movement. It is now trying to organize McDonald's, 
taxi companies and other service industries. In the case of the 
Canadian Auto Workers, only 25% of the membership of the CAW work 
in the automobile industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is all over the map. Why? The union is a business.  It is a 
thing called dues.  When it gets those dues, it has more money. 
It has more money, it has more members.  It has more members, it 
has more influence in this place and all legislatures.  What is 
wrong with that?  That is democracy.  It is growing its business. 
Members would say it ties things up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Am I out of time already? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I am sorry, my colleague, you are. I must 
tell you it was quite enjoyable listening to you.  You had five 
minutes, as did the previous speakers. 
<P><A NAME="LINK12"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Gouk (West Kootenay—Okanagan, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member said labour leaders do not want to go on 
strike.  Fine, let us give them some mechanism so they have an 
alternative when they cannot settle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He talked about strike leaders on strike pay.  That makes it 
okay because they suffer?  What about the people who are not part 
of the bargaining agent who are forced out of work?  They are not 
even a part of these negotiations and have no strike pay at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said unions are important.  We never denied that. When unions 
were brought in they started to deal with deplorable working 
conditions.  If unions were done away with in their entirety, the 
pendulum would swing back, although maybe not all the way. We are 
not talking about whether there should be unions but whether 
there should be work disruptions with major impacts on the 
economy of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of off site workers, what we object to is providing 
unions with home addresses so that they can actually go to the 
homes of these people.  If they want to send something to them, 
that is one thing.  It can be done through the employer.  It can 
be done in other ways.  The provision in this bill is 
unreasonable and undemocratic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, on the issue of off site 
workers it is quite clear that the board can lay down the rules 
for making contacts.  It even says that the most likely way would 
be through the mail.  If there is a situation where an organizer 
is using unfair aggression or trying to intimidate, which happens 
from time to time, the board has the ability to put sanctions 
against the union and to charge it properly with unfair 
bargaining. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is totally an overreaction.  In the case of off site workers, 
the company can take the union information and pass it through 
its electronic system, e-mail.  It is all about communication. 
Why would the company and the union not want to let them know 
what is going on? 
<P><A NAME="LINK13"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
so much has been said in reference to this act and how it will 
alleviate some of the problems within the grain handling 
industry, specifically for the farmers.  It is no secret that the 
farmers have really had to foot a major bill in the past because 
grain handlers and others in the union system, which is quite 
elaborate from the prairie fields to the ports, go on strike. 
The only people who pay for it are the farmer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 87.7 talks about the strike and the lockout being 
prohibited under certain circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the member supports this bill, how will it deal with every 
entity when it comes to the handling of grain from the country 
elevator to the port when the bill itself restricts— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The hon. member for Mississauga West. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I guess it is 
interpretation.  I suggest it is interpretation for the 
convenience for the member opposite to adopt a position.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is quite clear that if longshoremen go on strike there 
is still a requirement to load the grain.  That is a recognition 
by this government of the importance of that aspect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has also said that we are not sticking our heads in 
the sand on this issue.  We are prepared to look at it to make 
sure it works.  There will be committee hearings in which people 
will have the opportunity to have input and make comments.  If 
adjustments need to be made down the road, this government will 
make them.  We are flexible.  This is about creating a level, fair 
playing field of labour relations between unions and management.

creates an important tool.  The rural lens provides a mechanism

urban areas face challenges and opportunities that differ from 
the challenges and opportunities of rural residents in more 
remote locations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rural lens will also identify whether there is flexibility 
for decision making at the local level.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in the OECD

increased productivity.  In the long term, knowledge, technological 
knowledge in particular, constitutes the main force that drives 
economic growth and an enhanced quality of life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet our top researchers are choosing to move elsewhere because 
there are not enough resources here to fund leading edge research 
in their fields. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government thinks it has found the solution to this by 
creating the Foundation for Innovation and announcing the creation 
of the Millennium Fund. 
This is not so, for post-graduate bursary programs have fallen 
victim to the budget cuts to funding bodies, thus adding 
considerably to post-graduate students' debt load. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am therefore calling upon this government to increase the 
budget allocated to the funding councils, the key mission of which 
is to fund research, on which the new knowledge-based economy rests

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, today 
outside the House of Commons Canadians are demonstrating their 
opposition to the MAI, the multilateral agreement on investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are concerned about the MAI and are showing up in 
droves at town hall meetings and forums around the country.  They 
want to know why the government is negotiating this deal in 
secret, behind closed doors and with no consultation with 
Canadian people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are worried when key spokesmen promoting the deal say that 
the MAI is necessary because there is a surplus of democracy in 
the world today which is interfering with the movement of 
investment and capital. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A surplus of democracy.  Some of us were raised to believe there 
is no such thing as a surplus of democracy.  My father went to 
war to fight for absolute democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The more Canadians learn about the MAI, the more they oppose it. 
It is a bad deal for Canadians and it is a bad deal for 
democracy.  This government should do more than delay the signing 
of the deal, it should say no thanks to the MAI.

that profits increased in each of the four quarters. As we can see, 
Canada's economic life is not as bad as sovereignists would have us

In fact, economic growth would be even greater if separatists stopped 
spreading myths about Quebec's separation from the rest of Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
was reported last night that this year Canadians could have had 
debt reduction and tax relief.  There would have been a surplus, 
but it has all been blown on new government spending.  The big 
surplus that the government has been crowing about for months has 
already been spent before the budget.  Canadian taxpayers have 
been robbed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me ask the junior minister for finance, what about tax 
relief and debt reduction?  Where is it?  Gone with the wind? 
<P><A NAME="LINK52"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International

pleased to give my response to the junior deputy leader. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have taken a very balanced approach as we have come through 
these very difficult fiscal circumstances.  One thing I will 
guarantee to this House is that when this government commits to 
making an expenditure, we will take responsibility for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every household in Canada knows this has to be done.  Our 
government does as well.  We will pay as you go.  We will not 
saddle future governments with announcements of investments we 
are making today. 
<P><A NAME="LINK53"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
every household in this country pays its Mastercard bill when it 
is due.  It is as simple as that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have over half a trillion dollars of debt. Canadians are 
paying the highest income taxes in the industrialized world. They 
might expect a bit of debt and tax relief, which is what they 
have been promised for a long time.  It is crazy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians did take the Prime Minister at his word that 50% of 
the surplus would go to debt and tax relief.  That simply has not 
happened, not with what the finance department has been leaking 
anyway to the press lately.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International

belongs to Canadians and this is why we have been stewards of 
that money.  This is why we have adopted a balanced approach of 
reinvesting in Canada's social and economic infrastructure, a 
balanced approach of paying down the debt and a balanced approach 
of reducing taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are going to meet the Reform Party's targets for deficit 
reduction, but we will do so without ripping apart the social 
fabric of this country.  We have done this at the same time as we 
have reduced taxes. 
<P><A NAME="LINK55"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B>  Well, Mr.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget surplus is being blown on new spending, $2.2 billion 
worth.  That money should have gone back to taxpayers.  It should 
have gone to pay down the debt.  Oops, not the deficit but the 
debt.  That is what this government promised and that is what we 
are trying to hold it accountable for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it so easy to say yes to new spending and so easy to say 
no to debt and tax relief?  Why is that?

no to more spending on a better quality of life for Canadians. 
Why does it say no to what Canadians want and need? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say let Reformers wait for the budget.  Canadians I submit 
will be very satisfied with the budget as they are satisfied with 
the government's performance now as demonstrated by a poll on the

Speaker, my question is for the senior Deputy Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The surplus does not belong to the Liberals no matter how much 
they would like to think it does.  It belongs to Canadian 
families.  Budget after budget this finance minister sucked 
billions of dollars more out of Canadian households than Brian 
Mulroney ever did.  This was supposed to be the taxpayers' 
surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the Prime Minister treating the budget surplus like the 
property of the Liberal Party when it belongs to weary Canadian 
taxpayers? 
<P><A NAME="LINK58"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, when the budget is presented next week it will be seen 
that we are responding to the needs and concerns of Canadians and 
responding to what they want us to do with the funds that they 
have provided. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is pointless to speculate at this point on the details of 
what we are going to be doing.  However, I can assure members 
that it will not be a smash and grab attack on the well-being of 
Canadians as is set out in every pronouncement by the Reform 
Party since it came into existence. 
<P><A NAME="LINK59"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, let us talk about what Canadians really want.  Canadians 
know how they want to spend the surplus.  They are responsible 
even if this government is not.  They want to cut taxes and they 
want to pay down the national credit card.  A majority of 
Canadians say to pay down the debt.  Millions of Canadians want 
immediate tax relief.  They have all been robbed this year by 
this government.

want:  tax relief and debt reduction?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am told that in an Environics poll this morning 87% of 
Canadians support the government's 50:50 formula, a division 
between tax reduction and debt and deficit reduction and spending 
on key investments, on education, on young people, on innovation 
and the like. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have already begun cutting taxes.  We have cut employment 
insurance premiums.  We have been cutting taxes for young people 
taking post-secondary education and their parents.  We have been 
cutting taxes for people who are disabled.

already doing?  I am willing to recognize that this shows our 
commitment to what—

it is that economic conditions can change.  Interest rates, the 
dollar's value, foreign crises, many things can make an expected 
surplus disappear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to attack our huge debt now. Canadians need that tax 
relief now.  Job creators need some running room now. Instead the

setting us up for another broken Liberal promise?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

the CBC last night, more than 70% of Canadians strongly support 
the concept of the millennium scholarship fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. lady is right when she says that economic conditions 
can change.  For example it was announced this morning that a 
strong performance in December pushed retail sales to their 
largest annual increase since 1988. 
This in my view is due to the restoration of the country's 
finances since this government took office. It has almost 
eliminated the $42 billion deficit.

facts he wants to look at but the real facts.  Our debt is way 
too high, taxes are way too high, our unemployment is double that 
of the U.S.  The responsible thing to do with the surplus would 
be to pay down our debt and give Canadian families tax relief now 
while the economy is still strong. Why does the Prime Minister 
not do that now? 
<P><A NAME="LINK84"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, if we can return to the facts, there is more to be done 
in unemployment, but it is down considerably from what it was 
when we took office. The interest rates are down. There is almost 
no inflation.  We have just about eliminated the $42 billion 
deficit left us by the Conservative government. I do not know why 
the hon. member in her questions does not recognize those facts. 
If she did, she would have a lot more credibility.

million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will note his support for this program.  When discussions

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the minister for that answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has to know that most of the $100 million spent on 
the east coast of Canada in licence buy backs did not buy back 
active licences.  That is the problem with the original program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need an active licence buy back program and we need input in

fishing the resource and wanting to have some input.

</I></B></P><P align=left>He is correct that the buy back of licences which are not being 
used does not immediately affect fishing capacity.  On the other 
hand, a licence which is not currently being used could be used 
in the future.  The buy back of even those licences is important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the second aspect of his question, the need to 
have the involvement of fishermen and of the industry, I assure 
him that is being done and will continue to be done.

once somebody is elected, assuming that the government through 
the prime minister appoints that person, the person is there 
until the age of 75 and nobody can do anything if that person 
does not do a proper job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why when the Prime Minister said he wanted to have the

with the passage of Bill C-4 in the House this week, the Minister

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What percentage of current “The Atlantic Groudfish Stategy” 
recipients were sent letters of commitment regarding the benefits 
they would receive for the original five year program to May 
1999, and how much money does the twelve month commitment between 
May 1998 and May 1999 represent for those receiving letters? 
</UL>
<P><A NAME="LINK178"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development), Lib.):</B> The Atlantic Groudfish Stategy, TAGS, was 
announced on April 19, 1994 as a transitional measure to assist 
east coast and Quebec fishers and fishplant workers, who lost 
their jobs due to the closure of the Atlantic groudfish fishery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some 40,000 individuals qualified for TAGS.  Originally, each 
TAGS recipient received a letter which confirmed their 
eligibility and duration on TAGS.  The letter also indicated that 
in order to maintain one's continuing entitlement to TAGS, 
clients were required to actively participate in adjustment 
interventions such as counselling and career planning and to have 
in place an agreed upon action plan.  A minimum duration of two 
years was given to all TAGS recipients. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since this initial letter, there have been a number of changes 
to the TAGS program including changes to duration and active 
measures.  At each change clients have been kept informed by 
letter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All TAGS recipients were offered the opportunity to participate 
in a variety of adjustment measures to assist them to adjust out 
of the groundfish fishery.  TAGS clients participated in 
approximately 16,500 interventions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The administration of TAGS is dependent on funds being 
appropriated by Parliament.  In order to maintain income support 
benefits at current levels, and to remain withing the original 
$1.9 billion budget, it was announced in July 1996 that TAGS 
would end earlier than expected.  This was anticipated to be in 
May 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On December 16, 1997, the Minister of Human Resources Development 
Canada announced that the Government of Canada will continue 
paying income support until the end of August 1998, when it is

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton—Kent—Middlesex, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to have this opportunity to speak in 
support of Bill C-19 which would amend part I of the Canada 
Labour Code regarding industrial relations and makes the Canada 
industrial relations board more effective. I have met with 
constituents on this bill.  They have encouraged me to support 
C-19 and hope the House passes it forthwith. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill contains a number of important and timely amendments 
to part I of the Canada Labour Code. This part of the code 
applies to over 700,000 workers and their employers in the 
federally regulated private sector. This includes industries such 
as banking, interprovincial and international transportation, 
airports and airlines, broadcasting, telecommunications, port 
operations and grain handling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members in this House know that at a time when the global 
economy is becoming increasingly competitive, it is crucial that 
governments lead the way with forward looking legislation such as 
C-19 put forward by the Minister of Labour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also essential that the strategically vital infrastructure 
industries that I have mentioned are able to operate as 
efficiently as possible. This means that we must invest capital 
in these industries.  But just as important, it means that we 
must invest in our labour relations institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our dispute resolution process must be as modern, as effective 
and efficient as possible. This is precisely the objective of 
this legislation, to modernize part I of the Canada Labour Code 
and improve labour relations in the federal workplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members from the previous Parliament will know, this bill is 
almost identical to Bill C-66 which was approved by the House 
last April. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my belief that the new C-19, as was the former bill, is a 
legislative initiative which achieves the exceedingly difficult 
task of balancing the interests of workers with the interests of 
employers. It accords certain rights to each party but also 
demands that both sides act in the interests of their own 
membership and in the interests of the general public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I firmly believe that this bill is a model of how labour 
legislation should be developed. During each stage of the 
legislative process, labour and management have been at the heart 
of it all expressing their opinions and offering their 
considerable expertise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is useful to point out that consultations began almost three 
years ago when the Minister of Labour asked the task force to 
review part I of the Canada Labour Code and then to offer 
recommendations or needed changes. The task force was led by Mr. 
Andrew Sims, a respected and non-partisan labour relations 
expert. He and his colleagues criss-crossed the country meeting 
with labour and business representatives, labour law 
practitioners, academic experts and ordinary citizens concerned 
about what was going on in our workplaces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of identifying issues in areas in which agreement 
between management and labour was possible, the task force 
certainly benefited from the excellent contributions of a 
labour-management consensus group. Membership in this group 
included representatives of the Canadian Labour Congress, the 
Confederation of National Trade Unions, the Canadian Federation 
of Labour, the Federally Regulated Employers, Transportation and 
Communications, the Western Grain Elevator Association and the 
Canadian Bankers Association. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Sims task force compiled the results of the consultations 
and resulting recommendations in its final report entitled 
“Seeking a Balance”. There is a significant and recurring theme 
in this report. It is that the Canada Labour Code is generally 
regarded by labour and management groups as an effective labour 
relations framework which has facilitated collective bargaining 
in the federally regulated private sector. Of course I must add 
that there is still room for improvement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the remainder of my time I would like to focus on one such 
area where changes are required. It is in the structure and role 
of the Canada Labour Relations Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The task force examined many aspects of the board, including its 
non-representational structure. Since 1973 the board has been 
made up entirely of public appointees. None of these members is 
designated as either representing labour or management. In this 
regard the structure of the board differs from labour boards in 
almost every other Canadian jurisdiction. This must change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fortunately the Sims task force achieved a consensus between 
management and labour on this very item. All sides agreed that a 
representative board would have at least four related benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, for those appearing before the board, they would have 
more confidence in the process knowing that their cases are fully 
understood and properly reviewed. Second, decisions made by the 
board would generally be more acceptable to both labour and 
management. 
Third, it would provide some assurance that when the board 
exercises discretion, as it often must, that it would be on the 
basis of practical real world industrial relations experience. 
Fourth, the presence of a friendly viewpoint of the board would 
help the parties involved in the dispute to feel more comfortable 
about offering and accepting compromised solutions.

<A HREF="#LINKT28"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill adopts an approach recommended by the Sims task force. 
The non-representational Canada Labour Relations Board will be 
replaced by one that does represent each side.  The new more 
credible board will consist of a neutral chair and vice-chair and 
equal numbers of board members representing labour and management 
groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A second aspect examined by the task force was regional 
representation.  It is not credible to have all members from the 
national capital region.  Regionally based members will help to 
improve the visibility, accessibility and credibility of the 
board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The task force examined whether the board members should be 
committed on a full time or part time basis.  The report noted 
that many provincial boards have part time members which is cost 
effective while it enables the boards to benefit from the 
expertise and experience of people still active in labour 
relations and not stuck in Ottawa as full time bureaucrats. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However concerns were expressed about part time regional 
members.  Some suggested that regional decisions would be made by 
part timers with other large demands on their schedules and would 
not be available for long drawn out cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Canadian way, the task force recommended a balanced 
blend.  A core of full time adjudicators located in the national 
capital region will be joined by part timers located in the 
regions.  This seems to gain the best of both worlds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On these questions the government has listened to the respected 
members of the Sims task force.  The bill provides for the 
appointment of part time and regional members.  This will 
significantly improve the cost effectiveness of the board.  It 
will give the board access to labour relations experts and it 
will improve the links between the board and the labour relations 
community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The consultation that led to this bill identified the 
inflexibility of the Canada Labour Relations Board in responding 
to routine and urgent cases.  One approach recommended was to 
move from the system of a three person panel to a one person 
panel.  Many routine cases can be adequately conducted by a one 
person panel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I stress that as a result of this legislation the major criteria 
for appointment as chair or vice-chair will be competence, as it 
should be. A clause will be inserted into the code to reiterate 
that these people must have experience and expertise in 
industrial relations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the flexibility of the board will be enhanced by 
the repeal of the provision that requires the parties to obtain 
ministerial permission before they file an allegation of bad 
faith bargaining.  This will be particularly significant in cases 
where an immediate board hearing is needed to break a deadlock. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The board's remedial powers will be expanded to ensure good 
faith bargaining. An amendment will confirm the ability of the 
board to direct one side to include or withdraw specific terms in 
a bargaining position in order to rectify a failure to bargain in 
good faith. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Time does not allow me to outline the many more improvements to 
the Canada Labour Relations Board contained in Bill C-19.  It is 
fitting that the government, which has consulted broadly, is 
proposing a board that can take full advantage of the skills of 
the labour relations community. Labour relations boards are 
extremely important agencies.  Their work affects thousands of 
employees and thousands of businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate the minister on the work thus far and for looking 
forward in establishing a labour relations system that will 
instil confidence in Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I would like to comment on a labour relations problem which 
occurred recently in my riding of Edmonton East.  It was the 
result of the intransigence between labour and management.  For 
months and months I worked with other political and elected 
people from the community.  We talked to the company and union 
representatives but it was all to no avail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real concern at these meetings was the very realization of 
the threat by the company that the plant would close if the union 
went on strike.  That was understood and crystal clear to the 
union management to the point where they even admitted they knew 
the owner would close the plant if there was a strike. 
Prior to this the union had asked for a mediator's report. The 
company accepted the mediator's report but the union would not.

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My concern is that yes, controls must be in place for this but I 
believe that the union by calling the strike closed this plant. 
Now 1,000 people are out of work in Edmonton East, 1,000 people 
who worked at the plant, possibly affecting up to 10,000 people 
in the community. This is all caused by the intransigence of the 
union management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to agree with my colleague that there should be final 
offer selection in order to prevent this tragedy from ever being 
repeated and happening again. Had that been in place, as sure as 
I am standing here that plant would be open today and those 
workers would be at work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur:</B>  Madam Speaker, I can see where the 
hon. member's concerns are coming from. Being from the government 
side we may differ a bit on his perception and what his concerns 
are.  Perhaps the issues he has brought forth could be discussed 
further at committee.  Some of these issues could be discussed 
and perhaps changes could be made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new composition of the board will probably address some of 
the concerns my hon. colleague has brought forth.  The task of 
achieving this new board will protect the interests of the 
workers as well as those of the employers.  That is an added 
benefit. Also, with this new composition of the Canada Labour 
Relations Board it will have a co-operative working relationship. 
Collective bargaining legislation must have fair and balanced 
rights and obligations for employers, employees and unions, as my 
hon. colleague has brought forth.  I take his question with due 
respect. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK188"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am pleased to 
participate in the debate at second reading of this important bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am especially pleased to do so since I also participated in the 
debate when the bill was called Bill C-66 and since I was involved with 
a major central labour body in Quebec for many years. This is indeed a 
matter of great importance to me and it is from these various 
perspectives that I look at this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to start by saying—and I hope that government members 
will listen—that when this bill was first introduced in the House and 
referred to committee, the parliamentary process was short-circuited. 
Second reading was cut short to refer the bill to committee, where it 
was bulldozed through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in dealing with this bill, it is extremely important that 
parliamentarians have the time to consider every clause. This act is not 
like any other act that usually goes through this House. Most acts we 
pass are not likely to be challenged in court. In fact, they are often 
akin to a government decree on some issue. A labour code, on the other 
hand, must be scrutinized line by line, word by word, and even between 
the lines. Jurisprudential decisions will be rendered. In the end, this 
code will regulate all labour relations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is essential that parliamentarians be given the time to examine 
the bill on their own, consult experts and form an opinion. 
Otherwise, regardless of whether they are on the government or the 
opposition side, parliamentarians may think of this process as nothing 
but red tape.

<A HREF="#LINKT30"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That having been said, and I hope it will be repeated, people 
were initially pleased with the intention of the bill.  But when we 
saw this bill—I think I can speak of “we” meaning not just the 
unions, but labour relations people from both the management and 
union sides—a great many of us were worried. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were worried for a number of reasons that I will give, 
bearing in mind that we are at second reading. I hope that the 
committee will hold substantial hearings during which 
these questions and objections can become amendments supported by 
the government, because we know that, if they are not, it will be 
difficult for the opposition, regardless of party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, I want to say that the minister, whether this 
one or the one before, kept telling us that the Industrial 
Relations Board would be representative.  The idea is an 
interesting one.  The problem is that the bill does not give us a 
representative board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A reading of the bill reveals that the minister appoints 
“after consultation”.  This means that the final decision is his. 
He does not make appointments from a joint list supplied by the 
unions and management.  These persons, if selected in this fashion, 
might be representative.  They could then play a role that was more 
active, with a greater impact on the respective parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A supposedly representative board is being deprived of some of the 
powers it could otherwise have. I am convinced that the parties will 
make representations on this important issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill, which comes after years under the existing act, should 
modernize labour relations, or at least adjust the legislation to the 
changes in that sector. It is a fact that globalization and the new 
economy, which has some advantages but also many drawbacks in terms of 
distribution and levels of income, including salaries, have changed 
labour relations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that the unions have also taken a long look at the whole 
issue. I am a member of the Bloc Quebecois. 
I can attest to the fact that, since the eighties, the Quebec union 
movement has changed considerably and is now much more active in 
identifying the interests of businesses, not by ignoring those of 
workers, because a democratic union protects the interests of its 
members, but by getting involved, by knowing that jobs are created by 
the businesses, and by realizing that the more productive businesses 
are, the more competitive they will be and the greater the chances of 
preserving jobs and getting decent salaries. At least this is how it 
should be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After some tough battles when conditions were difficult, the unions 
have changed some of their attitudes.

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been some major changes in the world of labour 
relations, in labour organization.  The exceptional agreement that 
was reached between Alcan and its employees testifies to that.  In 
similar situations, the labour code has to help the parties, not 
hinder them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even more striking in this supposed reform of the Canada 
Labour Code is the fact that it provides less flexibility for the 
law and the minister to intervene.  Instead of promoting dialogue 
and negotiation, even in the context of a balance of power, the 
supposed new code does the opposite. 
I have to say I have never understood why the departmental experts 
produce some of these provisions, including those pertaining to 
determination of the right to strike and ministerial intervention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would remind those watching us that the Canada Labour Code 
applies to only about 10% of unionized workers across Canada, and 
the situation is essentially the same in Quebec.  I take this 
opportunity to point out something that is important in this House. 
The Privy Council in London finally decided in 1927 that labour 
relations were a provincial matter.  In London, they often sided 
with the provinces, unlike the Supreme Court, which always upheld 
the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some 10% of unionized workers are covered by the Canadian 
code, but these unions are rather special.  Most of them are 
national or involved in areas under federal jurisdiction, such as 
shipping.  The unions are often big ones that need time to conduct 
a vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know our colleagues in the West are very concerned about 
what is happening with grain.  As the critic during the rail 
strike, I realized the importance not only of labour relations and 
the union movement, but of the use of the powers of the minister 
and the House in connection with wheat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is essential that the committee look at the provision in 
the code requiring a union that has obtained the right to strike to 
exercise that right within 60 days of obtaining it. This is an 
extremely limiting provision, which is almost guaranteed to prevent 
a settlement. Why? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said that many of these unions are big ones.  Many of them 
are national and need time to obtain the right to strike. 
Sometimes the period between obtaining the right to strike and 
reaching a settlement can go well beyond 60 days. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1240"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT32"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sight must not be lost of the fact that, often, a settlement 
is reached when management or the union is close to resorting to a 
strike or lock-out. However, when there is a cut-off point and the 
union does not want to find itself without a mandate, what will it 
do? It will break off negotiations before they are too far advanced 
and go after another strike mandate.  This strikes me as sensible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only exception to the 60 days would be when both parties 
agreed to a postponement.  If a dispute is intense, it is dangerous 
to think either party would agree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This provision worries me, as does the one requiring 72 hours' 
notice of a lock-out or strike.  This time, I will look at it from 
management's point of view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An employer that intends to lock out its employees in 72 hours 
and so informs the union may find itself in the rather difficult 
situation of having to pay employees to do precious little because 
they know they are going to be locked out in 72 hours anyway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I look at it from the union's point of view, that of 
longshoremen, for instance—there are many of them—if they have to 
warn management that they are going to strike in 72 hours, what 
will happen?  Ships that were scheduled to dock for unloading will 
have taken another route. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, instead of making settlement easier, instead of using the 
imminent arrival of a ship for instance, they are taking away 
flexibility, taking away from the relationships of power for 
reaching a settlement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a strike or lockout occurs, it is because no agreement 
has been able to be reached.  Of course this is always a sort of 
admission of failure, but at the same time it must be seen as the 
start of something new.  Very often we have seen businesses, where 
labour relations had been difficult for years, go through a real 
conflict and then, afterward, the workers, the union 
representatives, the employer and its representatives start talking 
and a new and far different era in labour relations begins, because 
both sides have understood that to do otherwise was not in their 
best interests.  They agree to listen to each other, and perhaps to 
take the concerns of both sides more into account. This was a 
common occurrence in the 1980s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this is to happen, the labour code must help make it 
happen.  The code must not give one party an advantage, one which 
I would call an undue advantage, over the other.  But what do we 
see here?  The Canada Labour Code, while claiming to be modern, 
does not accept that employers should be forbidden to use scabs 
during a labour conflict. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one thing I can guarantee.  When a company has used 
replacement workers, to use the euphemism, settlement may be 
difficult, but the subsequent return to work is far more difficult. 
I am arguing in favour of not losing sight of what will happen 
after the return to work, of ensuring an atmosphere that will lead 
to a proper organization of the work afterward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no business anywhere that can thumb its nose at what 
the workers think—at any time, but particularly during and after 
a conflict—because those workers are the ones responsible for 
production, whether they use sophisticated machines or a hammer, 
they are the ones that make the company viable, the ones that make 
it profitable. 
This also applies to services.

machinery with metal gears.  It must respond to the current labour, 
business and economic situation.  It must equip the parties to 
resolve their differences readily and then to start on a new 
footing, leaving the dispute behind as quickly as possible in order 
to move on to a new phase where work is assured and the business is 
competitive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee has an important job to do.  I will close by 
repeating that I hope it has the time to do it and pointing out 
that this legislation is not ordinary. 
It is legislation that becomes the law of the parties in its 
codicils and commas and therefore both its content and form must 
give both employees and businesses the means to resolve disputes 
and to play a role in this changeable economy, which is a challenge 
to everyone.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I appreciate the comments of the Bloc member for whom I have 
considerable respect.  We sit on some committees together and I 
am always interested to hear her comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a couple of questions which I would like to pose to her, 
but I would like to give some background before I pose them.  I 
come from a business environment in which I was involved in 
labour situations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One particular part of the bill serves to illustrate the 
importance of what our party has been putting forward.  That has 
to do with the fact that the bill allows the government to 
require grain vessels to be serviced at port.  That is probably a 
good thing, in recognition of our international standing and 
serving the vessels which come to port.  However I think it is 
tragic that it does not deal with getting the grain to the port. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are in the information age.  We move information around but 
few people actually produce a product.  When we boil down all the 
moving of information around, where are the people who are 
actually producing something?  It is our Canadian farmers who are 
doing that.  Much of the information age rests on the foundation 
of people who are actually producing a product.  That is why it 
is so critical those people not be subject to hindrances due to 
labour stoppages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My concern is that we have a government which recognizes the 
need to maintain our international standing at ports for vessels 
but ignores or seems to put secondary the needs of Canadian 
farmers and Canadian producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rail system knit the country together in the beginning.  The 
rail system was a very important factor in building this nation 
and carrying product to port so we could participate in the 
international market.  When Canadian farmers suffer, I suggest to 
the House and to those watching that all Canadians suffer.  That 
goes to my point that the information age has been built on top 
of those who actually produce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we can do this for the international community, why can we 
not also specifically entertain new ideas such as final offer 
arbitration that our party has put forward?  If it cannot be 
embraced by all venues, why not for venues like Canadian farmers 
who are so desperately in need of getting this product to market 
to ensure a strong Canadian economy?

<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde:</B> Madam Speaker, my colleague has 
reminded me of the rail strike, when the Bloc Quebecois was the 
official opposition and I was the critic in this area.  I can tell 
the House I have more pleasant memories than those from that period 
of time when the rest of Canada was accusing us of holding up quick 
passage of the bill, while we simply insisted on the usual three 
days between the bill's introduction and its passing. We had 
proposed a perfectly acceptable amendment, which the government 
rejected.  The next time around it agreed.  We were told we were 
threatening Canada's economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said two things at the time “If the Canadian economy cannot 
afford the Canadian Labour Code, then change it. Until then, we 
will defend those who abide by the code”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also learned at the time that workers were prepared to load and 
unload the grain anywhere. It is the employers that locked them out to 
force the government to pass special back-to-work legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Labour relations are a complex issue. I understand your point of 
view, but potential disputes cannot be solved overnight. When workers 
feel they are not getting their fair share of the profits, when 
companies do not listen at all, some confrontation is bound to take 
place. When the economy is doing better, of course. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the final offer solve the problems? I have often heard members 
from this side express satisfaction that a final offer was made. I 
reviewed the issue, and I am prepared to do so again, but I am not 
convinced it would solve the problem at all. Indeed, if the final offer 
that is accepted is such that, afterwards, workers are so upset that 
they keep the company from operating at full capacity, nothing will have 
been solved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think this is the right solution. In any case, my 
colleague should realize that when unions are dynamic, strong and 
democratic, as most of them are, nothing can replace discussions between 
the workers' representatives and those of the employer. 
The code must keep such talks alive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, I believe Quebec was the first to undergo this change in 
labour relations. Since the province was hard hit by the 1981-82 
recession, unions had to adjust to the new reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A similar adjustment was also made in the rest of Canada. It is 
good for the union if a company does well, but the union must be 
recognized. A company should be willing to make compromises when the 
union is taking its needs into account. We must facilitate this kind of 
approach in Quebec and in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing better than a business whose employees feel truly 
involved. 
But for unions to be recognized, they must have a role to play; they 
must know that their proposals will be taken into account.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Madam

issue surrounding replacement workers.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the bill replacement workers cannot be used, but the concern 
is whether or not it is for union busting.  Businesses have the 
right to continue operating.  They can bring in replacement 
workers to continue keeping the business open but they cannot use 
them for the purpose of union busting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the province of Quebec I believe replacement workers are not 
allowed under any circumstances.  Would the member have a comment 
on the difference between the two situations? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde:</B> Madam Speaker, we can certainly come back to 
that. I would just like to tell my hon. colleague that, at first, when 
the antiscab legislation was passed in 1977, businesses were very angry 
and could not wait for the Liberals to be back in government to revoke 
the antiscab legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When his government was voted in again in 1985, Robert Bourassa 
told the companies whose concerns were voiced in the business magazines 
of the time “You are enjoying labour peace. Why do you want to change 
that?” While this legislation is intended to prevent the hiring of scabs 
by a company looking to undermine a bargaining unit, it leaves the door 
wide open. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can one think that, even if the company claims to recognize and 
not to dispute their position, striking employees will not get furious 
when scabs are hired and will not try, by every means available, to 
resolve the dispute in their favour? This will lead to problems down the 
road. The use of scabs is a source of problems after a strike. The 
company can never resolve its labour relations problems.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime 
Minister, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am pleased to have the 
chance to speak to the bill to amend part I of the Canada Labour 
Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud to support the legislation because I believe strongly 
in collective bargaining.  The bill does not create any unfair 
advantage for anyone.  In fact it balances the needs and 
interests of workers, employers and the Canadian public. 
Therefore it is good for the Canadian economy of today and 
tomorrow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has been well served by its system of collective 
bargaining.  We know that labour and management groups in the 
federally regulated private sector view part I of the Canada 
Labour Code as a viable framework which has facilitated the 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also beginning to see a new level of co-operation between 
management and labour and new styles of negotiation.  These new 
developments challenge us to find the proper balance between a 
number of goals and objectives.  A balance must be found between 
social and economic goals.  Work is a form of personal social 
expression and a source of economic security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A balance must also be found between instruments of labour 
policy.  Property rights, for example, must be balanced against 
protection of freedom of association.  A balance must also be 
found between rights and responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While our system of collective bargaining conveys certain rights 
to management and labour, it is also based on the expectation 
that labour and management will meet the responsibilities to 
bargain fairly and in good faith. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also facing global economic challenges and increasingly 
competitive markets.  Our collective bargaining system must be 
flexible enough to ensure that labour disputes can be resolved 
speedily and positively.  Enhanced co-operation will lead to 
greater productivity, increased employment security and more 
participation by workers in workplace decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation contains a number of important reforms and 
innovations which together accomplish the difficult task of 
finding the proper balance between the interests of workers, 
employers and the Canadian public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The following reforms and innovations will prepare us for the 
economy of the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, a new Canada industrial relations board will replace the 
Canada Labour Relations Board. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1300"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT36"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new board will include a neutral chairperson and 
vice-chairperson and equal numbers of members representing 
employers and employees.  The new board will be more flexible and 
able to act more quickly and its powers will be more clearly 
defined.  This will ensure that complex labour-management 
disputes can be fully addressed and it will be possible for 
appropriate actions to be taken in the event of unfair labour 
practices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the federal mediation and conciliation service will be 
strengthened and its neutrality will be enhanced by defining its 
role by statute.  These amendments will help to emphasize the 
fact that dispute resolution and prevention are important aspects 
of our collective bargaining policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, the right to strike or lockout will be subject to the 
holding of a secret ballot within the previous 60 days and the 
provision of 72 hours notice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, replacement workers will not be banned outright. 
Rather, the board will be given the power to stop their use if it 
finds that they are being used as an unfair labour practice to 
undermine a union.  At the same time, the legitimate rights of 
employers to continue their operations during a stoppage of work 
is recognized without undermining the strength of the union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fifth, employees will be entitled to insurance and benefit 
programs during work stoppages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each of these measures will ensure that part I of the code 
contributes to an effective and efficient collective bargaining 
system which is responsive to the needs of both employers and 
employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will discuss the consultations that led to this legislation 
and the consensus that exists on the bill presently.  This is 
important to better appreciate and understand why the bill is as 
it is today.  Consultations began with preliminary discussions 
led by senior government officials with the labour movement, 
business groups and representatives of other groups with an 
interest in the federally regulated private sector. These 
discussions identified major areas of agreement and disagreement 
concerning required amendments to part I of the Canada Labour 
Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following these preliminary discussions, a task force of 
exceptionally able and credible labour relations experts was 
established to examine part I of the code and to make 
recommendations to the Minister of Labour.  The three person task 
force was led by Andrew Sims, an Edmonton labour lawyer 
recognized for his accomplishments as former chair of the Alberta 
Labour Relations Board.  Mr. Sims was joined by Paula Knopf, an 
accomplished arbitrator and mediator based in Toronto, and by 
Rodrigue Blouin, a professor at Laval University and a 
distinguished labour arbitrator. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The task force held public consultations in many cities, 
Halifax, Montreal, Ottawa, Winnipeg, Edmonton and Vancouver. 
More than 90 written submissions were received from close to 50 
groups and individuals including major labour and business 
organizations.  In most of the cities it visited, the task force 
also met informally with labour lawyers and labour law 
administrators.  Full day meetings were held at the universities 
of Laval, Toronto and Calgary.  These meetings provided academic 
experts in labour law and administration an opportunity to 
express their opinions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The task force also benefited from the work of a 
labour-management consensus group made up of representatives of 
the Canadian Labour Congress, the Confederation of National Trade 
Unions, the Canadian Federation of Labour, the federally 
regulated employers, transportation and communication, the 
Western Grain Elevator Association and the Canadian Bankers 
Association. The work of this group was important in identifying 
issues in areas in which consensus was possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Sims task force produced its report which included extensive 
recommendations early in 1996.  The recommendations of the task 
force received strong support from both business and labour 
groups.  An additional round of consultation involved meetings 
held by the Minister of Labour in April 1996 with representatives 
of labour, management and other groups in Vancouver, Regina, St. 
John's, Montreal, Toronto and Ottawa. These meetings gave the 
minister a chance to hear in person reactions to the 
recommendations of the task force.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the public had a chance, through the work of the 
Standing Committee on Human Resources Development, to express its 
views on Bill C-66, which was passed by the House of Commons in 
April 1997 and which was awaiting third reading in the Senate 
when the 35th Parliament was dissolved for the general election 
of June 2, 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The concerns raised during the study of Bill C-66 have been 
taken into account in Bill C-19 now before the House.  The 
amendments to part I of the Canada Labour Code are important and 
necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They will not radically alter the current system but rather will 
encourage co-operative and productive labour-management relations 
and provide a framework for collective bargaining. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation will establish a fair and balanced set of rules 
which will allow management and labour to define their own 
problems and to find their own solutions to the challenge of 
global economic change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation is the combination of extensive consultations 
with all parties with an interest in mounting a collective 
bargaining system for the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope all members of this House will agree that the bill 
deserves their support because this bill is a fair and a balanced 
package of amendments based on recommendations of an independent 
task force of labour relations experts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has the general support of labour and management 
organizations subject to the code which have devoted considerable 
time and resources to a lengthy review and consultation process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, modernization of part I of the code is needed to 
improve the administration and functioning of the industrial 
relations in the federal private sector and to address changing 
workplace issues. 
<P><A NAME="LINK192"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I would like to speak on Bill C-19, the Canada Labour Code bill, 
as amendments have been presented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our party reviewed the consultation that has taken place in this 
country with many stakeholders.  This has certainly given us an 
opportunity to speak in favour of the amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to speak on some of the initiatives that the 
amendments are focusing on, an enlightening departure from some 
of the practices of the past in this country.  One is successor 
rights improvements.  In the province of Saskatchewan successor 
rights have been legislated provincially. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to speak on the issue of grain transportation as 
well, a major industry and a major concern to the many producers 
in my province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In recent years in grain transportation rail companies have been 
reviewing and downsizing their short line operations.  They have 
abandoned rail lines and also have sold off to other interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My concern is that a lot of the reasoning CN and CP have been 
using is the labour relations, the collective agreements they are 
bound by. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When they transfer rail lines to other operations, to American 
interests or to other small operators, the first to be 
compromised are of course the collective agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the many issues raised is the concern that grain exports 
have been compromised by labour disruption in some of the ports, 
labour disruption by the grain handlers and grain transportation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A couple of winters ago there were major disruptions in grain 
transportation that had nothing to do with labour.  This country 
has to revisit its transportation strategy.  Labour has a major 
responsibility to make sure the job is done on a daily basis, 
that the quality of work is done, that the safety and the health 
of the workers are not compromised, that democratically they 
represent themselves at negotiation tables with employers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The overall strategy of grain and rail transportation in this 
country has been compromised year by year.  It is going to take 
leadership from this country.  This kind of leadership might come 
with an industrial relations board where grievances can be 
brought to the table and addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are issues such as anti-scab and replacement workers. 
This is recognized in an amendment to the labour code now before 
us. It recognizes that employers cannot use scab workers to 
compromise union positions, or union busting as the hon. member 
mentioned. This is a major concern to the union leaders in this 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other issue labour leaders have raised is the whistleblower 
legislation.  This is the ability of a worker to raise an issue 
with federal, provincial or local powers or the public at large 
concerning worker health and safety within the workplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have seen the file increase on environmental issues such 
as hazardous wastes which are being used by the manufacturing 
industry and the transportation industry which compromise our 
environment.  This past week we heard evidence that hazardous 
wastes from offshore enter this country through our ports. 
This has been a major contributor to hazardous wastes in 
this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Environment Canada, through its cutbacks, reorganization and 
harmonization of its responsibilities with the provinces and 
other departments in recent years has confessed its inability to 
check all ports of entry for hazardous wastes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other issue is its ability to depend on intelligence by 
working with with customs officers, the RCMP and the provincial 
police in Quebec and Ontario.  There is also the opportunity to 
work with the workers and the labour organizations in this 
country.  They work the ports, the railroads, the manufacturing 
plants, the incineration plants where a lot of these hazardous 
wastes are located.  There is a lot of underground illegal 
activities with hazardous wastes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we mobilized and protected our workers through whistleblower 
legislation we would have a much safer environment, a much safer 
community and more transparency from an industry which is 
expected to police itself.  Sometimes in policing, when it comes 
down to an economic or financial decision, industries will put 
labour, safety and environment at the bottom of the list. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In grain transportation we are loosing miles and miles of rail 
transportation in light of our commitments to the environment in 
Kyoto, and to labour.  The Crow rate was taken away from western 
grain producers.  This issue is still a concern.  The rate cap 
that was created for grain transportation will be up for review. 
The price of grain transportation will go right through the roof.

<A HREF="#LINKT39"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue is can the employers talk with labour?  Can they talk 
with those in grain transportation?  Is there any kind of 
leadership this country can create, aside from our running to 
southern railways, to address port access to international 
markets?  Why can we not as Canadians keep our Canadian ports, 
keep our Canadian railroads, keep our Canadian labour standards 
and keep our Canadian labour industry in this country? Why can we 
not keep it truly Canadian Pacific or Canadian National? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That issue is very dear to the hearts of many grain producers. 
This is especially so in the northern part of our provinces. The 
industry and the producers are far away from their markets and 
have to transport their grain many miles. There are small family 
farm operations that cannot afford a semi-tractor trailer 
operation to take their grain to the nearest inland terminal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of all of this and hindsight being 20:20, it is the 
relationship we have with labour and employers and the leadership 
of this country.  This country has to provide leadership from 
coast to coast to coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed amendments now in the Canada Labour Code, the 
industrial relations board that is being restructured, are a 
positive move.  It represents interests on both sides.  It 
provides opportunities for issues to be rectified regionally or 
locally and more expediently.  The limited prohibition of 
replacement workers and scabs is being recognized.  It is not 
wholehearted but at least it is in the right direction. Successor 
rights have been taken a step further.  The preference for grain 
exports is also being recognized.  I think western grain 
producers are being heard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Overall when future amendments are being brought forward, I 
would like to see the issue of whistle blower legislation brought 
forward so that workers can have the protection to bring out the 
health and safety and environmental issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Labour Congress has publicly made it known through 
the consultation process that these amendments are being 
supported by the labour community.  However, in light of the 
concerns that hon. members from the Bloc Quebecois have raised, 
some of these issues are not taken far enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What our party is saying is that at least it is one step.  It 
may not be a whole jump through the door but future amendments 
might be an evolution to seeing that which the hon. members from 
the Bloc are envisioning.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Labour, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, the hon. member spoke so 
eloquently on this bill.  He is right.  It is a step and I think 
it is a good step. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was just in the back of the lobby a couple of minutes ago 
talking to some staff.  There were a couple of letters from 
farmers who desperately want this approved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is so important today that we move this bill along. It is 
going to be sent to committee.  Why does the member think the 
Reform and Bloc members, which I really do not understand, and 
the Conservative members are holding it up in a log jam? If we 
quickly move this bill on to committee, then we would have an 
opportunity for more input. Does my colleague have any thoughts 
on that?

</I></B></P><P align=left>The grain transportation issues were raised especially with the 
grain producers in the west.  The ports cater to the offshore 
markets. Farmers must have the ability to move their grain 
through the mountain passes. The operation of the railroads must 
be transparent to the producers which is something that has not 
been addressed. We quickly lay the blame of grain not being moved 
on labour disruptions, but the operation of the railroads is not 
transparent to the grain handlers and the producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The transparency of the operation of the railroads is 
compromised when amendments are made to the Canadian 
Transportation Act, such as those which have been brought forward 
in recent years.  It is as if rail transportation is on one side 
and the producers and the people who use the railroads are on the 
other side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have lost our head.  Somebody took time off and we have lost 
our head on this issue.  There is no vision.  There is no 
foresight.  There is no thought.  The railroads are selling off 
our Canadian interests when the rail beds are on Canadian 
property and title belongs to the Canadian nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many capital investments have been made by CN and CP over the 
years for improvements and line extensions.  Now they are selling 
it off to Omnitrax out of Denver and rail transportation out of 
Texas.  What are we left with? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We realize now the detrimental effect which greenhouse gas 
emissions will have on our environment in the future.  Rail 
transportation is the way to go because it is cheaper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were told in northern Saskatchewan to build a highway.  It 
costs $180,000 to build a kilometre of highway.  Why not build a 
kilometre of rail bed at $18,000?  The rail bed is mechanized and 
is very efficient. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of northern Saskatchewan, northern Manitoba, the 
Northwest Territories and the Yukon eventually will have to 
negotiate with firms in Denver and Texas to get rail 
transportation into the far north. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are losing our vision of the entire country for the benefit 
of industrial labour relations. The farmers feel alienated.  They 
sit at their kitchen tables and talk about the issues of this 
nation.  We have to bring those issues to the House of Commons 
because the vision of this country should be debated here. 
<P><A NAME="LINK194"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I certainly want to zero in on what the hon. member had 
to say about grain transportation. I want to assure him that not 
only in northern Saskatchewan, northern Alberta and northern 
Manitoba is this a concern.  It is a concern right across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come from a constituency which grows a lot of wheat.  The 
farmers there will openly tell you that they have been betrayed 
on three counts.  First, they were betrayed when they got one 
year's free freight out of the Crow rate.  Second, the practice 
of the grain companies and the railway companies getting together 
to plan the mass rail line abandonment is a betrayal of the 
farmers.  The third betrayal is our inability to go to the 
railways and say “Your cost of operating is 50% what it used to 
be, or it certainly will be.  We are not going to be talking 
about freight increases, we are going to be talking about freight 
reduction”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member agree with that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Laliberte:</B>  Madam Speaker, I hope there is 
foresight in the hon. member's comment and that his prophecy will 
some day come true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member is talking about decision making.  The decisions 
are made at the board tables of the rail transportation 
companies.  They are made for profit margins and shareholder 
interests.  However, the shareholders have lost sight.  The 
shareholders are Canadians.  We are the shareholders of the 
railroads. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Someone got their way.  They lobbied the right person at some 
point in time and now the railways are private organizations.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking of privatization, there was a recent decision made in 
Great Britain.  The chief executive officer of Virgin Records, 
Mr. Branson, challenged an American interest that has operations 
of all the lotteries in Great Britain. But lotteries as we know 
them in Canada are state run and non-profit intensive. However 
one person took it to court and has stopped privatization of 
railroads and privatization of the subway departments in all the 
major cities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what we have to look at in this country. Stop the 
privatization move.  Let us look at the national vision and bring 
in the shareholders, Canadians, those people at their kitchen 
tables from southern and northern Saskatchewan, from Quebec, from 
Ontario, from B.C., from the Yukon. Make these people a part of 
the decision making process and the vision of this country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise today. I see by the hour on the 
clock that my debate time is unfortunately going to be cut short. 
I will have to continue on Tuesday or whenever the government 
screws up the courage to bring the legislation back again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the government's second kick at the can for this 
legislation. That has become clear thus far. Certainly we in the 
opposition ranks have become well accustomed to seeing reruns in 
this 36th Parliament, leftover, retread legislation from the last 
Parliament that did not meet the bill, so to speak. The 
government has insisted on dredging it up, repackaging it, giving 
it a different number and bringing it back in the hopes that the 
Canadian public is going to be somehow fooled by this and give it 
a fresh look. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unfortunate on the government's part that it did not 
invoke closure on the old C-66 from the last Parliament to ram it 
through the House like it did with so much other legislation. But 
I suppose it must have had a little bit of a twinge of conscience 
at one point about doing that with every piece of legislation in 
the closing days of the last Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even after this government is told by Canadians that its bills 
are flawed, it just keeps reintroducing and recycling them. 
Often, as in the case of C-19, some minor cosmetic changes are 
made but we are really right back where we began. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problems that existed in Bill C-66 are still found in the 
present Bill C-19 that we are debating today. When I look at this 
bill I have to look at it through the eyes of my constituents, 
through the eyes of farmers and through the eyes of those 
Canadians who will be most affected when the government 
undoubtedly uses its majority in the House, as it did recently 
with Bill C-4, and just rams it through despite the pleas of 
Canadians from coast to coast that it simply does not do the job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some groups have told me that they are content with C-19 and 
they have encouraged me to support it. Even when those same 
people have expressed supreme disappointment at the considerable 
flaws in the legislation, they have basically said that it is 
better than nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is our job as official opposition and as MPs to strive to 
ensure that Canadians do not have to be content with something 
that is better than nothing. We believe that it should be a whole 
lot better than nothing. So we have to look at each piece of 
legislation on balance and we have to weigh the pros and cons. 
While some clauses may have some merit, we have to consider that 
the flawed clauses of the legislation, or the legislation that is 
missing altogether, may cause significant problems or 
consequences later on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that when it comes to C-19 those problems and 
consequences far outweigh any benefits that may arise from the 
passage of C-19. From my point of view as the chief official 
opposition agricultural critic, farmers who already contend with 
unstable weather patterns and many other challenges beyond their 
control, increasing input costs for one, will not find solace in 
this legislation. They will continue to have one or more unstable 
factors threatening their livelihoods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Grain farmers need guarantees that their grain will get to its 
destination. Despite government claims to the contrary, Bill C-19 
will not guarantee that grain will be transported to its 
destination.

<P><A NAME="LINK199"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, NDP):</B> 
moved that Bill C-248, an act to amend the Patent Act, be read 
the second time and referred to a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Madam Speaker, I am pleased to stand in the House 
today to speak to Bill C-248, a bill that will attempt to 
basically make prescription drugs affordable to those who need it 
most. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commence my remarks today by thanking my colleague, the member 
for Yukon, for seconding my bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-248 basically reduces the patent life of a new drug from 
20 years to 17 years.  It also reduces the period of market 
exclusivity on a new drug from 20 years to 4 years.  Market 
exclusivity is the patent holder's monopoly on sales. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The largest increases in sales volume of a new drug typically 
occur during the first four years.  After that the largely 
Canadian generic firms would have the right to manufacture copies 
on payment of a royalty to the brand name patent holding firms, a 
system called compulsory licensing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In essence Bill C-248 provides for competition among 
prescription drug manufacturers that now have monopoly pricing 
authority under government Bill C-91. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is supported by literally tens of thousands of seniors 
and thousands of other people in Canada who are ill and require 
prescription drugs.  It is supported and endorsed by the Canadian 
Health Coalition, by the Government of Saskatchewan, by the 
Canadian Labour Congress and by many other organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Debate on the patent drugs issue has often confused the two 
ideas of patents and market exclusivity.  The two points were 
only made synonymous when the pharmaceutical bill, Bill C-91, was 
introduced in 1991.  Bill C-22 in 1987 did not eliminate 
compulsory licensing.  It simply extended the period of market 
exclusivity from four years to seven years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-248 includes the best of the pre-Mulroney regime on 
prescription drug royalties and pricing.  It respects so-called 
intellectual property rights by establishing a royalty payment to 
the patent holder, but it does not intervene in the market to 
create a monopoly for an undue length of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is different from the 1987 system in that instead of a flat 
royalty rate Bill C-248 would allow for a sliding royalty scheme 
that rewards brand name pharmaceutical firms that actually did 
the majority of the research on a particular drug in Canada as 
opposed to now when they do it outside the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This proposal was adopted by the federal NDP as part of its 
platform in the last election.  The NDP is the only party to 
consistently support competition in the prescription drug 
industry.  This bill fulfils part of our campaign commitment to 
continue the fight for fair prescription drug prices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk for a few minutes about costs and benefits.  I 
believe it is time that we as parliamentarians admit that the 
current government policy of granting generous patent rights to 
foreigners as an enticement to establish a Canadian 
pharmaceutical industry just has not worked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The policy sees public funds used to pay for these generous 
patent rights through billions of dollars in drug costs from our 
provincial medicare and drug plans.  The drug companies get a 
five year average return on capital of over 14%.  In return for 
this generous ROI, layoffs, a trade deficit in pharmaceuticals, 
less R and D per sales in the U.S. and expensive drugs for those 
who need them most are the rewards for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have not even begun to pay the worst of the costs yet. 
Health economists like Stephen Schondelmeyer and Queen's health 
policy group have examined the costs of Bill C-91.  If we take 
their most conservative estimate and compare the situation under 
Bill C-91 to the case under Bill C-22, which was by no means 
perfect, the cost to consumers is between $4 billion and $7 
billion over a 10 year period.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most of that $7 billion will be paid after the year 2000, which 
as everyone knows is the new millennium.  If you catch the 
millennium bug, the millennium drug prices are going to kill you. 
That is because the last of the drugs approved with a seven year 
market exclusivity under Bill C-22 will be able to go generic in 
1999.  We have not even begun to feel the pain, in other words. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In return for $4 billion to $7 billion in additional drug costs, 
we have received maybe $500 million in additional R and D which 
was already required to meet Canada's drug approval regulations. 
We lost over 2,000 jobs as well.  We sustained huge cutbacks in 
transfer payments and social programs to pay down the debt and 
deficit, along with all the hardship and unemployment they 
entailed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People say that the Patent Medicine Prices Review Board is there 
to protect against price gouging or skyrocketing prescription 
drug costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What exactly has been done by the PMPRB, the great defender of 
the people of Canada?  The Patent Medicine Prices Review Board 
lacks accountability, which is a bit of a problem.  It lacks 
transparency, which is a bit of a problem.  It has no mandate to 
serve the public interest.  It serves the interest of large 
multinationals across the world.  Its methodology is skewed to 
give the appearance of price control while it permits drug 
cartels to charge the highest drug prices in the industrialized 
world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do I say that?  For example, they use in their formula for 
checking price controls seven OECD countries such as Britain, 
France, U.S., Switzerland and Sweden that have the highest costs 
of living anywhere in the world.  They are more expensive than 
Canada.  Yet the PMPRB uses as a reference retail prices which 
are never charged to the citizens of those countries or their 
drug plans because they always buy at discounts of up to 40%.  It 
is very clear that we pay the highest prices anywhere in the 
world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our view is that the PMPRB has to make some changes.  It needs a 
legislated mandate to protect the public interest, not large 
corporations.  It should make drug comparisons of all twenty-nine 
OECD countries, not the seven most expensive countries in which 
to live in the OECD. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Drug price comparisons should be made against the real price, 
the 40% discount price, and not the retail prices charged in 
these countries.  Finally, some due diligence should be exercised 
and the price data from large drug cartels in European countries 
should be independently verified to determine for sure whether or 
not the prices are accurate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My bill will basically restore competition and perhaps encourage 
the PMPRB to do the job it was supposed to do at the outset. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals opposite have said that they will work within the 
system, will go to the industry committee meeting and will fire 
tough questions at large multinationals written by the Minister 
of Industry, the Minister of Health and their colleagues to make 
drug companies look good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Working within that system has not really paid off.  There have 
been no tangible results.  I say this with some sympathy for 
colleagues in the Liberal government who faithfully toiled away 
in the industry committee last year on Bill C-91.  They lobbied 
their caucus and they lobbied their Minister of Industry.  They 
had every expectation that some minimal response would be 
provided.  As we know, nothing actually happened.  The Liberal 
government was able to slide into another election because the 
review was being done until the election call last spring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What reward did they get for this?  The biggest defender of the 
large multinationals, the chair of the industry committee, David 
Walker, got his reward.  He was defeated by my colleague, the NDP 
member for Winnipeg Centre, for all the great work he did 
misleading the people of his constituency and not doing his job 
to stand up for the public interest when it came to price gouging 
by large multinational drug companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about those who did not get defeated?  Not very many of 
those who supported the drug companies were not defeated by an 
NDPer.  They simply got humiliated by the cabinet's complete 
capitulation to the multinational drug companies just last month. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I argue that the only way to fix Bill C-91 is to scrap it and to 
support Bill C-248.  That is why I am asking for support of the 
bill.  It will make some definite changes, bring competition to 
drug pricing and help those who need it most.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Large foreign drug companies wanted 20 years of market 
exclusivity on new drugs for four reasons.  First, they said it 
would create jobs.  In fact there are 2,000 fewer people working 
in our pharmaceutical industry as a result. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, they said that it would keep drugs affordable.  In fact 
costs for brand name drugs have skyrocketed since 1987, forcing 
provincial government drug plans to pass on more of the cost to 
the sick and elderly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Saskatchewan is the best example.  It has been unable to defend 
its citizens who require prescription drugs to maintain their 
health because of skyrocketing costs of brand name drugs and the 
exclusion of generic companies from manufacturing competitively 
priced drugs for those who require them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has also driven the cost of medicare extremely high.  Prior 
to 1987 prescription drugs accounted for less than 8% of Canada's 
medicare costs and now it is over 12%, a 50% increase in medicare 
costs for prescription drug purchases alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third idea they put forward to allow Bill C-91 to pass was 
to generate funds for research.  Although most research money is 
spent on company directed clinical trials that are required by 
law anyway, only one new breakthrough drug has been developed in 
Canada since 1987, the AIDS drug 3TC.  Even now it is being 
manufactured in Ireland.  How many jobs did that create in 
Canada?  Probably none but maybe one or two to sell it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A commitment by large foreign drug companies to help fund pure 
research through the Medical Research Council was scaled back and 
still remains unmet.  The shortfall in the MRC's budget is having 
drastic consequences for Canadian medical scientists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To use the R and D pitch by the drug pharmaceuticals in 
Saskatchewan as an example, there were approximately 123 requests 
for clinical drug trials in Saskatchewan.  The international 
pharmaceuticals approved none of the 123 requests, not one.  Yet 
they are travelling from province to province claiming to be 
spending billions and trillions of dollars on more and more R and 
D. It is all a big lie by the pharmaceuticals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, they said they needed Bill C-91 and could not change its 
provisions because of international trade obligations under the 
WTO.  Members of the House who sat on the industry committee will 
recall that witness after witness, including international 
economic advisers and lawyers, appeared and said that the WTO 
permitted member countries to pass laws to seek to protect the 
public interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the public interest is being gouged by large pharmaceuticals 
or any other company unfairly, any government can take the 
decision under this clause to protect its public from unfair 
pricing practices.  The government does not want to do that 
because it would jeopardize its contributions from companies like 
Glaxo Wellcome which gave the Liberals $90,000 in contributions. 
Another pharmaceutical, Merck Frosst, gave the Liberals about 
$16,000 to help buy this protection under Bill C-91 and not to 
support a bill like Bill C-248 which I am putting forward in the 
House today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear the policy has not worked for the Liberals.  The 
Liberals in opposition agreed with abolishing Bill C-91.  Their 
critic, Ron MacDonald, the former member for Dartmouth, would not 
even run in the last election because he was so embarrassed by 
the flip-flop of the Liberal Party.  The Prime Minister stood in 
the House as leader of the opposition under the Mulroney 
government and said “The Prime Minister of Canada always sides 
with the multinationals and not the sick and poor.  When are you 
going to repeal Bill C-91?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that the former leader of the opposition is Prime Minister 
of Canada, he should look in the mirror and ask the same 
question.  Perhaps he should answer it by taking some initiative 
to help people who are suffering under unfair prescription drug 
pricing practices by multinational companies.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This is something, in my view, that is going to hurt those 
families even more when they require prescription drugs to 
maintain their health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals were persuaded very unanimously by their lobbyist, 
Judy Erola, the chief lobbyist for the Pharmaceutical 
Manufacturers' Association of Canada.  Judy Erola is very 
persuasive because she is a former Liberal cabinet minister under 
Prime Minister Trudeau.  They bought this line of sustaining Bill 
C-91 hook, line and sinker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cost and benefits of the current government policy on patent 
drugs does not add up.  I challenge parliamentarians in this 
House to say that the emperor has no clothes and that the process 
that we have under Bill C-91 does not work.  If we do not fix it 
soon the future of medicare is on the line and certainly the 
lives and future of all Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am pleased to respond to 
the private member's bill sponsored by the hon. member for 
Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian drug patent policy has three main objectives, to 
ensure that consumers have access to patent drugs at reasonable 
prices, to support the development of the pharmaceutical industry 
and to ensure that Canada conforms with its international 
obligations which, for example, require a minimum of 20 years of 
patent protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These objectives are fulfilled by striking a balance between 
ensuring that generic drugs can hit the market immediately after 
patent expiry and effective enforcement of patent rights. 
However, the bill put forward by the hon. member would negate 
this balance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In contrast, the package of regulatory reform proposals, which 
the minister announced on January 24, 1998, would maintain this 
balance and improve the regulatory framework for drug patents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me explain why the bill is inappropriate.  The hon. member 
wishes to turn back the clock.  He wants to restore compulsory 
licensing of patented drugs.  This would allow generic drug 
companies to manufacture and sell a generic equivalent four years 
into a patent term.  The hon. member also proposes to shorten 
patent terms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member proposes these measures to combat the spectre of 
increased health care costs.  He lays the blame for these costs 
at the feet of Canada's drug patent policy.  However, the facts 
do not bear him out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are making sure drugs are available at reasonable prices 
through price controls on patented drugs.  This regime has been 
very effective.  Canadians paid over 24% less for patented drugs 
in 1995 than they would have in the absence of the federal price 
regulation.  Total estimated savings to Canadians from limiting 
price increases over the years 1988 to 1995 were over $3 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at the latest report of the Patented Medicine 
Prices Review Board, which administers price controls on patented 
drugs, we find that prices of patented medicines declined by 2.1% 
in 1996. I remind the House that the consumer price index 
increased by 1.6% over the same period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Overall, Canadian prices for patented drugs have declined 
significantly relative to foreign prices on average by 30%. 
Canadian prices were 23% above the median of foreign prices in 
1987 but dropped to 10% below in 1996. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, even though patented drug prices have fallen, we are 
concerned about health care costs.  Pharmaceutical companies, 
through their extensive investments in research and development, 
have come up with new drugs to help improve the health of 
Canadians.  Not only are Canadians reassured because there is an 
increasing number of ailments that can now be treated with drugs, 
these new medicines can reduce hospital stays.  This helps reduce 
overall health care costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also firmly committed to making sure Canadians continue 
to have the best available drugs at the best possible prices.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to strengthen the PMPRB's mandate.  The PMPRB released a 
discussion paper and is concurrently consulting with the public 
about its mandate. I hope the member opposite has made his 
presentation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, as announced on January 21, 1998, federal, provincial and 
territorial ministers of health are working collaboratively on a 
number of pharmaceutical issues, including drug prices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government also acknowledges the importance of the generic 
industry in keeping drug costs down.  We want Canadians to be 
able to access generic drugs as soon as the patent expires.  In 
fact, we provide early working exceptions to patent infringement 
which enable generic manufacturers to enter the market as soon as 
possible upon patent expiry. This has been an integral feature of 
our patent framework along with the link between the patent 
status of a brand name drug and the regulatory approval of its 
generic equivalent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently the EU has challenged Canada's compliance with our 
international obligations in light of the exceptions I have just 
referred to.  It is Canada's intention to vigorously defend these 
exceptions. We believe we are in full compliance with our 
international obligations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to point out that the government's proposed 
changes would further reduce any delays in getting less expensive 
generic drugs to market while maintaining effective patent 
protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to turn to my second reason for opposing Bill 
C-248.  Patent protection if a prerequisite for innovation, R and 
D and investment, and Bill C-248 would severely limit this 
protection, jeopardizing investment and jobs in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1993 the brand name industry has spent over $2 billion in 
research and development across the country and that has meant 
jobs for Canadians.  We are speaking here of high paying, 
knowledge intensive jobs. We are speaking about economic growth 
in one of the most dynamic sectors in the global economy, where 
investment in research and development roams the world looking 
for the best place to make a home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada the pharmaceutical industry is a major R and D 
performer.  While the pharmaceutical industry accounts for only 
1% of manufacturing sector shipments it performs 10% of all 
industrial R and D.  Of the top 100 R and D spenders in Canada 26 
are pharmaceutical companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the House that when the Patent Act was amended in 1987 
the Pharmaceutical Manufacturer's Association of Canada made a 
public commitment that the brand name pharmaceutical industry 
would increase its annual R an D expenditure as a percentage of 
sales to 10%.  That is the period on which the PMPRB has now 
reported. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Have these companies lived up to their commitments?  Indeed they 
have.  In 1996 their R and D to sales ratio was not just 10%.  It 
was 12.3%.  For patentees as a whole the ratio was 11.4%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Spending on basic research was $136.6 million or 21.7% of the 
total in 1996.  Applied research accounted for 62.9% of the 
total.  This includes clinical and preclinical trials and 
manufacturing process R and D. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that the Canadian pharmaceutical industry has been 
making a significant contribution to the Canadian economy under 
modern effective patent protection.  The hon. member seems to 
acknowledge somewhat the importance of research and development 
performed by the drug industry in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the compulsory licensing system in Bill C-248 the royalty 
rate would take into account the amount of medical research 
carried out in Canada by the applicant and the patentee. Perhaps 
the hon. member believes these provisions would be sufficient to 
encourage companies to continue research in Canada. Perhaps he 
thinks Canada would continue to attract the same level of R and D 
investment under these terms.  Perhaps he thinks that these 
measures would be suitable in today's knowledge based economy.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This brings me to my third reason for opposing Bill C-248.  The 
measures proposed by the hon. member would contravene Canada's 
international obligations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me conclude by saying the proposed improvements underline 
the government's commitment to encourage investment through 
modern competitive framework laws that are consistent with the 
international obligations and support innovative growth and 
development of new improved drugs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These frameworks provide a stable investment climate for the 
pharmaceutical industry, which would further encourage R and D 
which, as I mentioned earlier, plays a vital role in the Canadian 
economy.  The regulations have been gazetted.  There is a 30 day 
time spell which will be completed next week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, our proposed package of changes improves the system 
and gets the job done. 
<P><A NAME="LINK201"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, what a delight it is on the last half hour on a Friday 
with everybody just brimming for his speech to come.  I am sure 
that you will find it very exciting, probably one that you would 
rather forget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to commend the hon. member who introduced this bill.  I 
appreciate this bill's coming forward.  I do not entirely agree 
with everything in the bill but it has merit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also gives me the opportunity to inform the hon. member for 
Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre that I was not part of a government 
in Saskatchewan in 1982, as he said the other day.  I was part of 
a local government which was perhaps as important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is with ease that I talk about this because the 
pharmaceutical industry has been very much a part of our family. 
I had an older brother who made his career in this area.  He was 
a Canadian.  He took his Canadian experience and travelled around 
this world.  That was a Canadian influence.  I suppose we might 
say he was multinational, but he was Canadian born, Canadian 
trained and for the most part represented Canadian pharmaceutical 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a doctor who is still practising, so drugs are very much 
part of the repertoire when I visit with him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if anyone here has ever visited one of our large 
pharmaceutical research stations.  The one I was at has hundreds 
of acres, thousands of employees.  I would not want to guess— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> It was probably a generic firm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey:</B>  No, it was not. It was in Michigan, so 
the member can guess from that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a tendency to take these important issues and make them 
too simplistic. Most of us will have to go to the history books 
for this, although a few might remember. Around the turn of the 
century, in 1918, a terrible flu hit this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember visiting a small village in northern B.C..  The flu 
of 1918 wiped out the whole village.  This winter a new strain of 
flu, the Sydney A, has already claimed 10 Canadian lives.  I 
mention this because to this end Canadians have learned to depend 
on medicine to protect us.  Even more so Canadians rely on an 
industry that produces and makes available the prescription drugs 
that maintain their health. With that neither member who has 
spoken would interfere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this respect the pharmaceutical industry is one of the most 
important and most lucrative industries worldwide.  In any 
country with a major pharmaceutical interest, the health of the 
industry as well as the health of its citizens must be considered 
a factor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because the industry is so lucrative and a significant portion 
of the economy relies on the industry's success, namely 
employment and investment in research and development, 
governments around the world are presented with a difficult task 
of balancing economic interests with very important social 
interests.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are here today debating my colleague's bill because many 
Canadians feel that the balance has shifted.  The hon. member who 
introduced the bill will say that it has shifted too far in one 
direction.  He will say that it has shifted toward the interests 
of the industry and no longer considers the interests of 
Canadians.  That is basically what he is saying in his bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I repeat that there is some truth to this.  But whether it is 
good for the economy or meets our social objectives, we must 
remember that first and foremost the pharmaceutical industry 
exists to provide prescription drugs to Canadians. Huge profits, 
jobs, research and development are important spinoffs, as the 
Liberal member mentioned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada people say that they take pride in our health care 
system.  We believe it is the best in the world and we want to 
keep it that way.  Canadians find great solace in the fact that 
barring everything else which concerns them, an affordable 
medical system must be kept in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know it matters not whether we are rich or poor, illness is 
illness and the requirement for medication should know no bounds. 
We also know that the chronically ill, seniors or children are 
vulnerable and therefore must have access to affordable medical 
assistance.  This is particularly true for seniors and the 
chronically ill.  They cannot afford to live in a country where 
the cost of medicine is too high. I commend my colleague for 
recognizing this and for putting forth his efforts to improve the 
situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However in debating this bill I would like to make certain 
recommendations which I feel would accomplish our goal more 
efficiently and more effectively.  In saying this I am indicating 
that I have certain problems with my colleague's bill and I will 
lay these out for the consideration of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague says that the 20% patent protection for brand name 
pharmaceuticals is the cause of the cost of drugs being too high. 
I would suggest that is being a bit too simplistic.  There are 
clear benefits to patent protection, not the least of which is 
the contribution made to research and development both in the 
performance of it and in the generation of it that goes into this 
country.  It is precisely this kind of research which brings 
Canadians the breakthrough they need to counter the effects of 
the flus we are seeing right now, such as the Sydney A. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Important commitments have been made by the brand name 
pharmaceutical companies.  A program between the PMAC and the 
Medical Research Council was initiated for research and 
development with a budget of around $250 million.  That is a huge 
sum of money.  Such agreements among sectors make an important 
contribution by fostering basic research in the pharmaceutical 
and biotechnical fields in Canada's universities and research 
industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>PMAC member companies have also made commitments toward an R and 
D to sales ratio.  As a result they have made a contribution to 
applied research, an important tool in achieving Canada's 
economic well-being. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However these commitments have not produced a perfect system. My 
colleagues are seriously concerned that the commitments made by 
the brand name pharmaceutical companies to invest in research and 
development are in no way assured.  The Liberal government has 
not ensured that these agreements are binding.  That is a problem 
for the people of Canada.  It is certainly a problem for the 
Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that the generous patent protection given to the 
brand name companies must be incumbent upon the willingness of 
the PMAC to make binding commitments to the research and 
development of new drugs in Canada.  Not only do pharmaceuticals 
gain from a competitive patent protection, they also gain from 
the most generous R and D tax write-offs in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Based on this we believe the government should be seeking a 
binding commitment from this sector.  We do not have that.  That 
to me is the real guts of this bill.  I agree with the hon. 
member on that point. 
The participation of the pharmaceutical industry in Canada is so 
important in building a strong knowledge based economy, but we 
must have some proof that this is happening. I would like to see 
the member's bill emphasize this.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maintaining the 20 year patent protection is in keeping with the 
patent protection of our global competitors. By ensuring this 
applies in Canada we can compete in the investment made by the 
pharmaceutical industry which enhances our economy. But in 
entering into this relationship we must ensure the integrity 
within this agreement by seeking binding commitments. Today we do 
not have that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest to the originator of this bill that rather than 
tinker with the number of years on the patent protection that 
exists now, accept the 20 year patent protection to ensure 
Canada's competitiveness, but also ensure that the promises are 
binding.  The government has the responsibility to see that they 
produce real benefits as a result of the initiatives of this 
industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  The hon. member's 
time has expired. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK202"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Hélène Alarie (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, in a 
speech on October 2, I said “Research and development is a key 
component for any society wishing to be fully prepared for 
the 21st century. Economic prosperity is increasingly the result of 
research and technological development, rather than the development 
of natural resources”.  That quote fits in well with the very basis 
of today's debate on drug patents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Private Member's Bill C-248, an act to amend the Patent Act, 
introduced by the hon. member for Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, is 
not votable, but it is very timely. The hon. member certainly had 
good intentions in introducing this bill to reduce the cost of 
health insurance and drugs for consumers, but the arguments, and 
the amendments my hon. colleague wants to make to the Patent Act, 
are weak and open to dispute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am, of course, opposed to the way this bill greatly weakens 
the present regulations as far as a 20-year drug patent protection 
is concerned.  The Bloc Quebecois has always stressed the 
importance of maintaining that twenty years of protection, and I 
will defend that position in my speech.  I will take this 
opportunity to counter the arguments advanced by the sponsor of the 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, a study published on February 27, 1997 by the 
Patented Medicine Prices Review Board shows that federal 
regulation of the price of patented medicines saved Canadians and 
Quebecers between $2.9 billion and $4.2 billion between 1988 and 
1995.  In 1995 alone, the savings were between $846 million and 
$1.1 billion. I would point out that the board was created in 
1987 under Bill C-91, which enacted amendments to the Patent Act, 
increasing the protection for drug patents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, the price of patented medicines has risen an average 
of 1.6% since 1988, compared to a 3.1% increase in the consumer 
price index.  In 1995, the average price of patented medicines in 
Canada dropped to a level 7% lower than the mean in other 
countries. 
In 1994, the cost of patented drugs represented 2.5% of the total 
expenditure of the Canadian health system, while generic ones and 
other non patented medicines accounted for 3.7%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is therefore totally wrong to say that the regulations 
passed under Bill C-91 caused a catastrophic increase in the cost 
of drugs when the bill became law, as the NDP member would have us 
believe.

<A HREF="#LINKT50"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following the introduction of Bill C-91, drug manufacturers, 
especially those with their head offices abroad, invested 
substantially in research programs in both Canada and Quebec.  This 
support helped Canada and primarily Quebec to narrow the ever 
widening gap between us and our competitors, such as those in the 
G-7 countries, in the levels of investment in basic research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1988, investments in the health sector by pharmaceutical 
companies producing patented drugs represented 18% of the total. 
In 1995, the figure reached 37%. 
There is no doubt that, if Canada does an abrupt about face and 
once again offers less patent protection than other developed 
countries, the growth in the pharmaceutical industry in recent 
years will be reduced to nil. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-91 was intended to protect intellectual property, and 
any amendment that would limit its application could well harm the 
industry in Canada, and thus the pharmaceutical industry in Quebec. 
Because this is my responsibility, my concern is and must be to 
consolidate one of the largest industrial clusters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our economy is becoming a knowledge-based economy, 
particularly technological knowledge, which is the main force 
behind growth in the economy and improvement in quality of life. 
Technology and increasing productivity are therefore now at the 
very heart of the job debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unlike the generic drug industry, the patent drug industry 
funds basic research, which, by the way, has been underfunded since 
the Liberals came to power.  Cutting funding further would dry up 
the source for the development of new drugs, which help us improve 
our quality of life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question that arises is this:  Would the generic drug 
industry be thriving if this basic research were not being done? 
Would there be anything for it to copy? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is therefore wrong to say that the regulations that came 
into effect as a result of passage of Bill C-91 have resulted in a 
catastrophic increase in the cost of drugs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, this bill is an attempt to use the cost of drugs 
as an excuse for weakening the 20-year protection. 
This bill is becoming less important because, just under a month 
ago, the Minister of Industry introduced proposals to amend the 
regulations.  Consultations are presently under way and anyone 
wishing to intervene on this subject may do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, because we have not forgotten the poor and the ill, 
because we want a better quality of life for our fellow citizens, 
and for all the other reasons given, the members of the Bloc 
Quebecois will be voting against Bill C-248.

debate on a number of occasions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I chair the subcommittee on foreign affairs and trade

the international agreements under the World Trade Organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Agreements such as those under the WTO, I think all members 
would agree, contribute to Canada's economic growth and help 
Canada in terms of its exports around the world.  Certainly in 
terms of our policy we would not want to support legislation that 
contravened very important trade agreements that have been very 
beneficial to Canada.

research and development which is critical for creating direct 
new jobs.  We also have good access around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The WTO requires a 20 year patent protection.  A pre-1993 
compulsory licensing regime and a 17 year patent term would not 
be in line with the WTO— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> You missed my point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Speller:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member will be 
given an opportunity to speak to this later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For these reasons I know that most members on this side of the 
House would be in disagreement with this bill.  Bill C-248 as a 
whole would upset the balance in our system between the benefits 
of having generic drugs reach the market as soon as possible 
after patent expiry and the need for effective enforcement of 
patent rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As other hon. members from this side of the House have stated, 
we are committed to this principle.  When we responded to the 
industry committee's report on Bill C-91 we reaffirmed our 
commitment to the principle of the proposed changes to the drug 
patent regulations announced January 21, 1998 and which were 
published on January 24 in the <I>Canada Gazette</I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's proposed changes will continue to provide 
effective enforcement of patent rights while reducing delays in 
getting generic drugs to market.  The length of the regulatory 
stay on insurance of a health and safety approval for a generic 
drug would be reduced from 30 months to 24 months. Members on 
this side of the House believe that the improvements we proposed 
will also discourage litigation and make the system fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have concerns.  We have worked on them for the last number of 
years since this bill was brought in by the Tories under the 
Mulroney government years ago.  We believe we have made 
significant changes.  We believe the system now in place is fair 
to all sides.

comments with respect to Bill C-248.  The parliamentary secretary 
read that speech exactly like Judy Erola and the Ministry of 
Industry wrote it.  So congratulations.  There is nothing new in 
that speech.  The people of Canada know that and they will make 
their judgments come the next election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to my Bloc colleague, I am absolutely shocked at 
what the Bloc member said with regard to the pharmaceutical 
industry.  This member said: “They don't care about the poor and 
the sick.  It is a matter of the welfare of the wealthy and the 
other corporations that produce those pharmaceuticals in 
Quebec”.  This is going to be a real surprise and wake-up call 
for all those poor and sick Quebeckers come the next referendum. 
If the Bloc and the PQ do not want to support them on an issue 
like this, why should they support Quebec on a referendum issue? 
We will see what happens when that comes along.  I thank them for 
that comment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the member for Haldimand—Norfolk—Brant, I am 
glad he stood in this House and indicated there are some concerns 
about it, but he did not catch the words I said earlier with 
respect to the World Trade Organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the review in the industry committee, witness after 
witness, including international economists and lawyers, came 
before us and said there is a public interest clause in the WTO 
that if the government deems it in the public interest to 
contravene one of the WTO regulations because it is abusing that 
country, it can make amendments with respect to Bill C-91 or drug 
patents.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the member to please consider those representations by the 
lawyers and economists, who are internationally renowned and who 
all share the same view that the WTO in the public interest can 
be changed in respect to issues pertinent to their country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank my colleague from Souris—Moose Mountain for his 
constructive comments.  He did say he would like to have some 
binding commitments with respect to Bill C-91. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I like my colleague's recommendation and I do support it, but I 
remind him that we did have commitments from the industry 
under Bill C-22 in 1997 and under Bill C-91. They were going to increase 
the number of jobs.  Wrong.  There are fewer jobs.  They were 
going lower prices on prescription drugs.  Wrong.  Drug prices 
are higher.  They made a commitment to increase R and D.  Guess 
what?  They are increasing a lot of their expenses in terms of 
marketing, going to doctors and hospitals, giving them 
computers and trips to Barbados and all these places for using 
their prescription drugs and they call that R and D, 
research and development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I guess they research the doctor and develop him or her into 
selling their prescription drugs and in return they spend R and D 
money by giving them new computers, trips to the Bahamas or trips 
to Australia or wherever they want to go.  That is not R and D, 
that is marketing.  That should not be in any kind of 
regulations, whether it is under the Bill C-91 regulations or any 
other commitments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I admire and thank the member for his constructive criticism.  I 
will pursue that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make one other comment with respect to what happened 
in Argentina and Chile. I had a visit from an Argentinian 
politician who came here because of the work I was doing on Bill 
C-91.  His name was Ernesto Algaba. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He told me that the people in Argentina were very concerned. 
They are all fanning out around the various countries of the 
world that are WTO co-signatories on Bill C-91. They are being 
forced by the American ambassador who is being told by the 
American Pharmaceutical Association to get the 20 year patent 
monopoly pricing in Argentina or else they would do something 
economic like maybe even pull out their ambassador from 
Argentina. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ernesto Algaba told me he went to Chile, which had the same 
commitments that we had in Canada.  After Chile passed the 20 
year patent protection it lost jobs, closed plants, drug prices 
skyrocketed and health care costs skyrocketed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have international examples.  There may have been a 
misunderstanding when the member for St. Catharines said we need 
this because of competitive pricing requirements.  Bill C-91 is 
not competitive.  It is a monopoly to charge whatever they want 
for prescription drugs for 20 years.  That is not competition.
