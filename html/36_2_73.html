dates numerically.  For example, 02/03/99 could mean either 
February 3, 1999 or March 2, 1999.  That ambiguity has always 
been there, but now that our year numbers are also less than 
twelve there is a great multiplication of ambiguities possible.

all these ambiguities.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Canadian 
Alliance)</B> moved for leave to introduce Bill C-465, an act 
respecting the creation of sanctuaries for endangered species of 
wildlife. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, there are over 300 species in Canada 
today that are in danger of imminent extinction.  What is the 
greatest failure in our not dealing with that?  It is the failure 
to protect habitat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This private member's bill will do just that through four 
mechanisms.  The first is an objective identification of species 
at risk using COSEWIC, the Committee on the Status of Endangered 
Wildlife in Canada, which will recommend to the minister those 
species that are in imminent danger of extinction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second is to provide for the establishment of sanctuaries on 
federal land and for agreements with both provinces and private 
land owners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third is to provide for expropriation or restrictive 
cognizance to be placed on those lands when there has been a 
failure to negotiate in good faith.  When that has occurred, 
compensation would be given to both the provinces and private 
land owners at fair market value. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fourth is that it enables individuals to donate land that 
has been deemed to be sensitive habitat and they would get an 
income tax break for doing so.  I hope the bill passes.  It would 
go a long way toward protecting endangered species in Canada.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CANADIAN INSTITUTES OF HEALTH RESEARCH ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK26">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK27"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson (for Minister of Health)</B> moved that Bill C-13, 
an act to establish the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, 
to repeal the Medical Research Council Act and to make 
consequential amendments to other acts, be read the third time 
and passed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK28"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Charbonneau (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the Minister of 
Health, I am very pleased to speak today in support of Bill C-13, 
an act to establish the Canadian institutes of health research, 
at third reading stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week, on the very day that this House completed debate on 
the report stage of this bill, members of Canada's health 
research community gathered together to bid farewell to the 
Medical Research Council, and to greet the new era of the 
Canadian institutes of health research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farewells are often tinged with sadness.  But that is not at all 
an accurate description of the prevailing mood.  Instead of 
sadness, there was excitement.  Instead of regret, there was 
tremendous optimism and hope. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout the day, at the MRC-sponsored symposium, researcher 
after researcher spoke about the tremendous gains in knowledge 
that had been made by Canadian researchers under the Medical 
Research Council, and about the potential for new knowledge, for 
new discoveries, under CIHR. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CIHR concept brought together the largest coalition of 
interests in the history of Canada's health research community. 
This concept was not imposed from above by government, but 
created and developed as a direct result of the efforts of so 
many members of the community from across the country.  It would 
not be fitting to let this occasion pass without paying tribute 
to Canada's health researchers who took up the Prime Minister's 
challenge to excel in our areas of strength, 
in particular, members of the original task force on CIHR, as 
well as members of the interim governing council of CIHR.  The 
interim governing council devoted tremendous time and energy 
meeting together and engaging the broader health research 
community in discussions to ensure that CIHR would meet the 
priorities of the health research community, of Canadians and 
of Canada as a whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Special mention must be made of the truly special efforts of Dr. 
Henry Friesen, president of the Medical Research Council, and 
chair of the interim governing council and the IGC vice-chairs 
Dorothy Lamont and Eric Maldoff. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian institutes of health research is an achievement 
that was brought about by the hard work and deep commitment of a 
great number of people 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To the 75 men and women who served on the task force persuading 
the Government of Canada that this concept could become a reality 
and to the 35 members of the interim governing council who have 
worked so very hard to find solutions to the challenge of 
expressing that vision in legislation and addressing the tough 
issues of structure, processes and accommodation between diverse 
disciplines, I want to express my gratitude and my admiration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we all know, every great cause needs a leader, and a leader 
in the work to create these institutes was Dr. Friesen.  Dr. 
Friesen had already secured his place of honour as a result of 
the remarkable leadership that he had provided as president of 
the Medical Research Council since 1992.  He saw the 
possibilities and seized the opportunities as only a true leader 
can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not underestimate the size and complexity of the 
challenges that he overcame.  In designing and defining the 
institutes, he must have sometimes felt that his task was like 
building an airplane in the air.  Somehow he made it fly and 
somehow he has brought it safely to ground. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of Canadians and the health research community, I 
want to express our sincere appreciation to all these 
individuals for their tremendous contribution.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With Bill C-13, the Medical Research Council hands on the torch 
of health research to CIHR.  Over the past 40 years, the MRC has 
been a godsend for researchers, providing them with the support 
they needed to devote themselves to research full time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very easy to say that Canada's health researchers are 
among the best in the world. 
As I reflect on the MRC's legacy of excellence, from the early 
days, with Wilder Penfield and the surgical treatment of 
epilepsy developed in Montreal, to more recent achievements, 
such as the  discoveries of Jude Poirier and Peter St. 
George-Hyslop in connection with Alzheimer's, May Griffith and 
her artificial cornea, and Arthur Prochazka and his bionic 
glove, I marvel once again at the talent and creativity to be 
found in our universities, hospitals and other research 
institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian researchers are making a difference in health, in the 
well-being of Canadians and of people the world over. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today there are many reasons for all of us, no matter what our 
role, to feel a strong sense of occasion.  We are, after all, 
sharing a moment of history as one great Canadian institution is 
retired to make way for another.  What a past to celebrate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For 40 years the Medical Research Council has nurtured and 
enabled the Canadian research community that has pursued 
excellence expanding human knowledge, improving human conditions, 
putting worldclass standards at the service of humanity both here 
in Canada and around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our purpose today is not only to celebrate that legacy and to 
honour that tradition.  It is also to savour the new 
opportunities that are upon us and to prepare for a limitless 
future.  We are about to embark on a new era in health research 
in this country.  The Canadian institutes will transform our 
research enterprise providing a new and even better way to carry 
on the process of discovery, to broaden its scope and deepen its 
worth, to quicken its pace and to enrich its value. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We shall now move beyond medical research to health research 
linking investigators in the biomedical sphere to those who 
pursue inquiry in the clinic setting, connecting that work with 
those who would better understand how to deliver health services, 
and grounding it all in a better understanding of how illness can 
be prevented and how good health can be promoted. New and better 
treatments, better strategies for health protection and promotion 
and for managing the health system, all of these things will be 
crucial to improving and sustaining Canada's health system and 
the health of our people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The concept of the institutes is as novel as it is simple.  It 
will create a network of knowledge linking investigators who 
tackle similar issues from different angles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recall reading some months ago a simple explanation of how 
collaboration can enrich inquiry.  An investigator wrote to a 
colleague in the following words “I give you my idea.  You give 
me yours.  Now we each have two ideas and together we have 
four”.  That is the arithmetic of a shared inquiry, adding in 
order to multiply, sharing information in order to accelerate 
discovery. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The nature of modern health research is changing and the issues 
that arise are more difficult than ever.  Today these issues 
cover a vast array of disciplines representing many perspectives 
and approaches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CIHR is a direct response to these contemporary challenges. 
It is based on a new integrated approach to health that is 
focused on understanding the factors underlying health and 
illness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CIHR will create a link between researchers in a broad 
variety of disciplines, enabling them share their knowledge and 
work towards common goals.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will transform the manner in which health research is 
conducted in this country by giving a national character to 
Canadian efforts.  By promoting the acquisition of new 
knowledge, CIHR will help to improve Canada's health care system 
and the health of Canadians.  It will help make Canada's 
research community a community of hope and encouragement where 
the grants awarded to researchers will be comparable to those 
awarded in other countries.  The CIHR will be the principal 
Canadian health research enterprise of the next century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thanks to additional large investments by the federal 
government, CIHR will do more than support excellence in 
existing research in Canada. 
It will promote new synergies among researchers, helping to 
resolve complex and difficult health issues through 
comprehensive, collective and multidisciplinary approaches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CIHR will build on research in Canadian universities, health 
institutions and research centres, provincial and federal 
government teaching hospitals, and the volunteer and private 
sectors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The integration of health research into a network of virtual 
institutes will make it possible to address important health 
issues more effectively by using resources from four 
intersecting health research approaches:  basic biomedical 
research, applied clinical research, research into health care 
systems and services, and research into the social factors 
underlying health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The institutes will serve as centres for the transfer of 
knowledge to local communities and the monitoring of Canadians' 
social and health environment, as well as to present related 
reports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For a new generation of researchers, this new orientation will 
result in the creation of training and innovation opportunities 
in Canada.  As a result, Canada will be among world leaders in 
health research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The creation of CIHR is a direct response by the federal 
government to the opinions expressed by health research 
directors, who were calling for change and modernization 
generally of this activity in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And they are not alone.  There is also a vast coalition of 
researchers representing all views and disciplines in Canada. 
These researchers know that CIHR is the most innovative and best 
integrated approach to health research in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me cite the enthusiastic and eloquent comments of our 
Minister of Health: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that CIHR will help us to attain the health research 
policy objectives supported by Canadians throughout the country. 
It will improve the effectiveness of our health care system, 
further enhance Canada's image as a world leader in health 
research, create new jobs in key sectors of the new economy and, 
finally, curb the departure of our best researchers and 
clinicians. Above all, CIHR will help improve the health of 
Canadians. 
</UL>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>CIHR will change the way we fund and carry out health research 
in Canada.  It will make the main priority of all research 
endeavours in the country, first and foremost, about improving 
the health of Canadians.  A closer examination of the objectives 
of CIHR as set out in its mandate reveals just how profound the 
change will be. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1030"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main aim of CIHR will be to co-ordinate and support 
multidisciplinary health research across Canada.  The legislation 
states that CIHR's mandate is “to excel according to 
internationally accepted standards of scientific excellence in 
the creation of new knowledge and its translation into improved 
health for Canadians, more effective health services and 
products, and a strengthened Canadian health care system”.  How 
will it do that?  The legislation says that it will meet its 
objective by forging an integrated health research agenda across 
disciplines, sectors and regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>CIHR brings together researchers from across regions and 
disciplines.  It includes all four key areas of health research: 
biomedical; clinical; health systems and services; and population 
health research.  It is an approach that will see research travel 
from laboratory to bedside and to communities. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health research in Canada already involves a multitude of bodies 
with partnership potential.  These are: the federal research 
councils, charitable organizations involved with health, 
universities, teaching hospitals, community groups, research 
institutes and private industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Associated with greater financial resources, this more 
integrated and more dynamic research framework that the 
institutes represent will generate new knowledge, which will 
result in improving the health of Canadians and improved health 
care, earlier discovery of new treatments, and enhanced 
possibilities of effective political intervention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The institutes will foster the establishment of an integrated 
health research program which will make it possible to make 
discoveries earlier in identifying new health threats and their 
treatments.  They will deal with the increasingly numerous 
statistics indicating that some of the most significant health 
factors are not being addressed by clinical and biomedical 
interventions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The institutes will provide a far better liaison for the health 
research partners already in place, and will encourage 
co-operation with the volunteer, community and private sectors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members will have understood that the role of these 
institutes is not, first of all, to invest in bricks-and-mortar 
structures, but rather to put into place in the form of a 
network in synergy with researchers in other disciplines with 
different horizons, within the framework of what we have already 
named the virtual institutes around various themes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To give one example, in a research institute focussing on 
asthma, basic genetic research might be carried out in a 
hospital in Quebec, while clinical trials and evaluations of 
asthma treatments might be carried out in Saskatchewan or 
Ontario.  Research assigned to social science specialists or 
public health authorities might be done in rural areas of 
Manitoba, Newfoundland and Labrador. 
Finally, evaluation of such a pilot project with a view to 
determining the best treatment approach might be done in another 
part of Canada, British Columbia or PEI, for instance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thus the institutes are intended to bring together researchers 
in the social sciences into a solid national network, which is 
then, in turn, part of a broad international health network. 
This national network would work in conjunction with scientists 
in other disciplines of health research, with researchers in 
such areas as sociology, psychology, education, social work, 
nursing, psychiatry, economics and public health, demographics, 
epidemiology, and public administration.  All of these could be 
associated with health research in one way or another, according 
to the role planned for the institutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to point out that a number of organizational 
principles will guide the selection of institutes.  First of 
all, there will not be just one model of institute. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1035"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT7"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT7"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1035

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each institute will be able to take a different path as far as 
its programs, its structures and the number of projects funded 
are concerned, depending on the determined needs of the 
community.  Second, all health researchers will have the 
opportunity of a place within the institutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Identification of the institutes, which will be 10 to 15 in 
number, will be based on several criteria, including their 
fundamental capacity to contribute to improving the health of 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The structure of the institutes must be simple and 
cost-conscious.  Finally, the institutes will encourage 
interdisciplinary research in the four key health sectors 
already referred to. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A key element of CIHR's stated objective is to facilitate the Translation 
of knowledge into better health services and a better 
health care system for Canadians.  Research has little value if 
its result cannot somehow be applied whether into new directions 
for further research, new ways to maintain the health of 
individuals and communities, new treatments and cures for disease 
or a new understanding of how best to deliver health care to 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By building the translation of knowledge gained from research 
into practical applications right into CIHR's legislative agenda, 
we are ensuring that we achieve the utmost value for our research 
investment. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another key element in the institutes' agenda. 
Promotion of research projects and assistance in their 
completion must be according to internationally accepted 
standards of scientific excellence.  Peer review is the best 
guarantee available to government and to the Canadian public 
that taxpayers' dollars are being directed to science of the 
highest quality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The institutes will build on a longstanding tradition in this 
country of rigorous evaluation of research proposals to ensure 
that we may continue to meet international standards of 
scientific excellence and take into account the special 
requirements of the institutes' expanded mandate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation before us provides as well that the institutes 
will carry out their mission by assuming a leadership role in 
Canada's research community and by co-operating with the 
provinces, volunteer organizations and the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having the institutes organized by theme will bring together all 
the principal stakeholders—researchers, donor agencies, research 
users—to develop a strategic research program promoting 
researcher creativity while meeting the needs and priorities of 
Canadians.  Herein lies the test of real leadership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This leadership, need I point out, will be exercised in 
co-operation with the provinces, whose responsibility it is to 
provide health care to Canadians.  This leadership will be 
exercised in the respect of provincial jurisdiction. 
We consider such federal-provincial-territorial co-operation vital 
not only to the advancement of health research but to the 
promotion, dissemination and implementation of new knowledge 
with a view to improving the health care system and services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians take a special sense of pride in their publicly funded 
health care system.  They believe that leadership in the areas 
of health care, research and education are key elements of the 
Canadian advantage that will help us maintain a quality of life 
that the United Nations continues to consider the best in the 
world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government shares that belief.  The institutes are part of a 
deep and abiding commitment that we have made to supporting 
health research in this country.

the new enterprise is to succeed.  By next year in relation to 
1998 we will have doubled the annual federal funding for health 
research in Canada to a total of almost $500 million per year. If 
as we expect the institutes' promise is fulfilled, that will not 
be the final point, it will be a new point of departure. The CIHR 
is only part of a determined effort by the Canadian government to 
encourage and reward innovation. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the past three years, we have invested more than $5 billion 
in direct and leveraged funding.  We have continued to fund and 
expand the network of centres of excellence, seven of which 
focus on health related topics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997, we established the Canada foundation for innovation, 
and, this year, we contributed an additional $900 million to it. 
A total of $1.9 billion is helping to modernize and improve the 
research infrastructure in our hospitals, universities and other 
research institutions.  We also established the Canadian health 
services research foundation to provide us with the data we need 
of how to deliver excellent, efficient and cost-effective health 
services to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the latest federal budget, presented a month ago, the 
Minister of Finance announced the creation of 2,000 Canada 
research chairs, a $900 million investment intended for 
researchers at the peak of their careers and the most promising 
researchers still at the start of their careers. 
As well in this budget the Minister of Finance announced a 
special one-time allocation of $160 million to Genome Canada to 
fund five genome science centres in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On top of all these initiatives, in two years, government 
investment in the institutes will be double the amount it had 
invested in the MRC.  And this is only the beginning.  We fully 
expect that, in future years, the federal government's 
investment in health research through the institutes will 
continue to grow. 
The end result of these investments will be a country where 
researchers see opportunities for support and innovation 
throughout their careers.  A country others throughout the world 
see as the place to be for health research.  A country which 
offers its citizens the very best in research and health care 
based on a solid foundation of excellence in this field. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to reiterate that our government understands these kinds 
of investments must continue to ensure that Canada can cultivate, 
keep and attract the very best and brightest.  By creating an 
environment for research excellence where good people take up 
challenges with enthusiasm and confidence, we strengthen the 
vitality of our country and we enhance our economic dynamism and 
competitiveness in a shrinking world.  We have produced results 
particularly when we speak of health research which makes our 
communities and families healthier and happier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Someone once said that the best way to predict the future is to 
invent it.  I believe that is what those who have developed the 
institutes have done.  Our future will be assured because of the 
hard work we are doing now which will be to the benefit of 
generations to come. What is more, the institutes will be an 
exercise in national solidarity linking not only scientists but 
also Canadians with each other in a common cause.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The institutes represent the most deliberately innovative and 
integrative approach to health research.  They form a structure 
uniting individuals and networks of researchers in a broad range 
of perspectives on health research.  I sincerely believe that 
the institutes will set the example for the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Prime Minister of Canada has said, the institutes will 
truly make Canada the place to be for researchers in the field 
of health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Standing Committee on Health heard from a wide range of 
witnesses during its hearings into Bill C-13, representing 
different regions, different areas of health research, different 
perspectives.  Despite their differences, though, there was one 
constant point of similarity.  Every individual, every group 
appearing before the committee began by expressing their strong 
support for the establishment of this new vision for health 
research in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to salute these witnesses and thank them 
enthusiastically for their support and their contribution to the 
advent of the institutes.  The expression of such unanimity 
during hearings for a piece of legislation is extremely rare, we 
must confess, but this is the extent of the support shown by the 
health research community: researchers, volunteer organizations, 
universities and the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I would like particularly to thank my colleagues, 
the members of the Standing Committee on Health, who made a 
considerable commitment to their work.  In addition, I would 
encourage the members of this House—including those of the 
various opposition parties, whose co-operation during the 
examination of this bill I wish to recognize—to show the same 
commitment to excellence in health research in Canada through 
their unanimous support for this bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo—Cowichan, Canadian Alliance):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise to speak to Bill C-13, a bill 
which would create the Canadian institutes of health research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member for Nanaimo—Cowichan and the deputy critic of 
health for the official opposition, the Canadian Alliance, I am 
pleased to state that we will be supporting this bill.  However, 
before I go into the actual body of the bill and give a bit of a 
critique on the substance of it, I would like to say a few words 
about our health care system in Canada today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the most recent opinion polls asking Canadians the 
question “What is the most important issue that you believe this 
country faces today?”, health care comes out on top. Health care 
is the most important issue to Canadians.  Why is that?   We do 
not have to look very long or very hard to see why this would be 
the case.  Simply put, we have a health care system that is in 
crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at why the health care system is in crisis we can 
see that part of the reason is the lack of funds.  While the 
provinces are responsible for the delivery of health care 
services, we can see that the majority of this problem rests with 
the federal government.  Over the past five years it has cut back 
transfer payments to the provinces which would have supported the 
provincial health care systems by some $2.5 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has made a great deal about the fact that it is 
going to put back into health care some $14 billion over the next 
four years.   If I have done my math correctly, that still leaves 
a considerable shortfall. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1050"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT10"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT10"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1050

<A HREF="#LINKT9"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This shortfall will be downloaded to the provinces, which will 
then force the provinces to prioritize their spending.  They will 
have to take spending from other places, like education, road 
building and things like that, and they will have to put the 
money toward health care, which is the number one concern of 
Canadians across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It puts the provinces in a tremendous dilemma.  How will they 
prop up, fix or change a health care system that is in crisis 
when they do not have the money to do it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we think that there is a health care crisis now, wait for the 
next 10 years or so when baby boomers start to demand the kind of 
health care that is needed when people reach the age of 
sixty-five.  We know what happens.  That little bit of arthritis 
in the knee or the hip joint gets worse and pretty soon a hip 
operation is needed.  Or, in the worst case scenario, the cough 
that is persistent turns out to be lung cancer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As those things come on in later years as we grow older, we 
become more of a burden to the health care system.  There are 9.5 
million people who will put an incredible strain on the health 
care system.  There will be a need for more facilities, more 
nurses, more doctors and more innovative research, all the things 
that go into making a good health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the last number of years as the deputy health critic of the 
Reform Party, now the Canadian Alliance—and I am very proud that 
we have become the Canadian Alliance, with a huge mandate from 
reformers across the country—I learned a great deal about health 
and health care.  I have come to have a deep admiration for the 
many people who operate and run our hospitals and our clinics: 
our very dedicated doctors, nurses and medical researchers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know that care is not something which comes out of a 
bottle or a box.  We simply cannot prescribe care.  It is not 
something we can send by courier.  It comes from within the 
people who interact and attempt to make life better for the 
patients in our health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Time after time during the past number of years the federal 
Liberals have attempted to talk about health care in strictly 
monetary terms.  The health minister or the finance minister will 
stand during question period and refer to the millions of dollars 
which they will put back into the health care system.  Like the 
compensation package that was offered to the hepatitis C victims, 
we have not seen a great deal of it yet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What they fail to acknowledge is that the Canadian people are 
not as gullible as the Liberals would like to think.  Canadians 
know and understand that the Liberals have taken away far more 
than they have returned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us examine some of the facts in a bit more detail.  In 1993 
when the Liberals took power the Canada health and social 
transfer per taxpayer was $1,453.  In the 1999 budget the Canada 
health and social transfer was $1,005 per taxpayer.  That means 
that the federal government is giving each province $448 less per 
taxpayer for health and social programs.  That is a 31% drop in 
federal transfers to the provincial governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, since 1966 when universal health care was introduced in 
Canada, the Liberals' financial commitment to health care has 
dropped from 50% to 9.4%.  How can the system be sustained on 
that kind of funding?  It cannot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that health care delivery is a provincial matter. 
Unfortunately, paying for it has also become a provincial 
responsibility.  The Harris government in Ontario pays more 
annually to health care in that province alone than Ottawa does 
for the whole of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me repeat that.  Ontario pays more annually to health care 
in that province alone than Ottawa does for the whole of Canada. 
There is something deeply wrong with the Liberal commitment to 
health care with those kinds of statistics. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1055"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT10"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Taken as a cumulative total, in 1993 the Canada health and 
social transfer was $18.8 billion.  In the 1999 federal budget, 
even with the so-called new money, the new total was $14.5 
billion, a difference of $4.3 billion.  That is money taken out 
of the national health care system.  It represents $143 for each 
person in Canada today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not just in dollars that the Liberals have failed.  They 
are responsible for violating the universal health care system of 
this country in many ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know that there are five main tenets which make up the 
universal health care system:  accessibility, portability, 
comprehensiveness, universality and public administration.  While 
I could speak at length to all of them, I would like to give two 
examples of where the government has failed to meet these 
principles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I would like to speak to accessibility.  Where the system 
is to be equally accessible to all Canadians, the British 
Columbia NDP government, which has a pristine record of being in 
favour of a universal health care system, regularly sends it 
Workers' Compensation Board claimants with knee injuries to the 
United States or to a private clinic in Alberta.  This amounts to 
nothing less than queue jumping, sanctioned by government, 
promoted and paid for by a quasi-governmental body.  This sounds 
a lot like two tier health care, the same two tier health care 
which the government loves to rant against when indeed it is 
responsible for the creation of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, I would like to speak to portability.  The universal 
health care system is not intended to penalize any province 
against another.  Full and equal services are intended for all. 
However, the province of Quebec—and it is not the only 
malefactor—will only reimburse other provinces $450 per day for 
Quebecers who are in other provincial hospitals.  The rate for a 
day of hospital care in Ontario is about $745.  Based on this 
rate difference, Quebec owes millions of dollars to the other 
provinces.  This goes on all the time across the country.  The 
federal government allows this to take place and allows the 
violation of the principle of portability under the Canada Health 
Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In reality, who has created two tier health care in this 
country?  The Liberal government.  Our hon. colleagues across the 
way do not like to hear that, but when truth stares them in the 
face they have to admit it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does this affect you and I, Mr. Speaker?  We are the ones 
who pay for this.  When our knees get to the point where we have 
to have an operation, when the arthritis is too bad, what are we 
to do?  What is the net effect of this loss of money to the 
system? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the first things that we see is the waiting time that 
many Canadians experience when they or a loved one needs a health 
care service.  For instance, in 1993 if a person wanted to see a 
specialist, on average he or she would have waited 3.7 weeks to 
see a specialist in Canada.  In 1998, five years later, the 
average waiting time would have increased 38%, up 1.5 weeks. Is 
that acceptable in a country which is purported to have the best 
health care system in the world? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of us may have experienced even longer waiting times, as 
these times vary from region to region and according to the 
specialist who is required.  We have all heard the horror stories 
of the cancer patient who needs radiation treatment and is forced 
to wait 10, 12 or 14 weeks, and in some cases much longer, for 
treatment to begin. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recently heard a gentleman on a radio talk show which 
originated in Vancouver at CKNW.  The program spent a whole week 
on the health care system in Canada.  This gentleman phoned in 
and told the very sad story of his wife who, at one point in her 
life, had been discovered to have a very small spot on her liver. 
The waiting time between the time she could get to a specialist 
and then eventually get treatment for her disease was so long 
that she died in the process.  That is the sad story, repeated 
time and time again across Canada, because of the inadequacies of 
our health care system.  It has to change.

<A HREF="#LINKT11"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is at that personal level when it actually affects people 
that the federal government loses its credibility.  While it 
looks at the money it has failed to recognize the human quotient. 
The cancer patient, the person waiting for an organ transplant, 
the elderly family member who is immobile and requires a hip 
replacement are people who have feelings.  They may be in pain or 
their quality of life may have been diminished.  They have family 
members, loved ones around them.  They may be missing work and 
therefore unable to fully provide for their families and 
contribute to the economy both locally and nationally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real impact of the serious health care crisis in Canada is 
not just monetary.  It is flesh and blood.  As people are forced 
to new levels of stress, they are forced to make difficult 
choices for their loved ones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are lots of ways to split up the problem.  We could look 
at the number of hospital beds that have closed.  We could 
acknowledge the doctor shortage in rural areas, the inadequate 
pay level of nurses and the conditions that many of them work 
under.  We could tabulate the tax level and the effect of the 
brain drain and losing some of our best and brightest medical 
people to south of the border. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However the Liberals will never acknowledge that this is a 
problem of their own doing.  This is a problem they have created 
by wantonly cutting the Canadian health and social transfer and 
failing to keep the principles of universality without realizing 
the full effect upon the people who need to use the health care 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the official opposition we believe it is important to address 
all these issues, to get them on the table, and to have this huge 
consultation from coast to coast with medical people, with 
professionals, with researchers and with Canadians.  We need to 
find new and better ways to cure the diseases that affect those 
around us:  our loved ones, our friends, and in some cases 
ourselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we enter the 21st century communication and technology are 
moving at an unprecedented pace.  As we all know, it is now 
possible to do work, research and communicate worldwide through 
the benefits of Internet and e-mail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This brings us directly to Bill C-13, a bill to create the 
Canadian institutes of health research.  In spite of the concerns 
I have about the government's handling of health care, I 
acknowledge that this is a good step forward on behalf of the 
government, and that is why we support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The technology available today allows an individual or a small 
company the opportunity to work and communicate with a major 
university, a public institution or a private company.  I believe 
the sharing of data, theories and information between large and 
small parties, regardless of location, has the potential to be of 
enormous benefit to all Canadians, and indeed citizens of the 
world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I support the bill I believe, however, that there are ways 
that the bill could be improved.  We are always in need of 
improvement.  Mr. Speaker, I am sure you would agree that you are 
not perfect.  I am not perfect and none of the bills in the House 
are perfect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to draw the attention of the House to several 
issues.  I believe the bill should have a new section, for 
instance, limiting administrative bureaucracy to a maximum of 5% 
of the total budget of the CIHR. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the scandal continues over the HRDC grants and the damning 
audits pouring out of the department of Indian affairs, the EDC 
and other financial fiascos will undoubtedly be added to the 
list, it is imperative that transparent and accountable financial 
controls be placed upon all government spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that Bill C-13 should contain directives that the 
governing council must ensure that no more than 5% of its annual 
budget is directed toward administrative expenses, using 
definitions that are normally applied to departments by the 
treasury board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe, if handled appropriately and based upon the positive 
results received through research, that the CIHR should strive 
for partial or complete self-sufficiency based upon funds raised 
through new medical technology, through the use of patents, 
licensing, copyrights, industrial designs, trademarks, trade 
secrets or other like property rights held, controlled or 
administered by the CIHR.  There exists the opportunity for the 
Canadian institutes of health research to recoup a portion of the 
public dollars invested in research institutes. 
It is a novel idea.  Imagine a government agency that actually 
recovers financial resources rather than simply spends them.

<A HREF="#LINKT12"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also believe that it is an opportune time to ensure that the 
selection of the research that will be funded through the CIHR 
will be based upon scientific merit.  The allocation research 
funding should be based upon the validity of the project, not on 
the basis of employment equity groups or one province versus 
another.  Funding should be upon merit alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the goal of the CIHR is to strengthen and ensure that we have 
improved health for Canadians through more effective health 
services and products and a strengthened Canadian health care 
system, there must be a transparent and accountable process using 
standard acceptable accounting procedures.  The research must be 
valid and likewise the financial accountability must be clear as 
well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also believe that this act and the Standing Committee on 
Health itself missed an opportunity to strengthen the section of 
the bill dealing with ethics.  Topics such as biomedical 
research, reproductive technology, gene therapy advancements and 
other future ethical issues will be a part of future medical 
research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While not all solutions may be determined now, the framework for 
an ethics board will provide future direction.  The preamble 
should state that it will take into consideration ethical issues 
with special attention to the highest value and dignity accorded 
to human life.  This is an issue that will be fraught with 
contention in the future and a resolution process should be 
included. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we have witnessed most recently with the HRDC debacle, 
political patronage cannot and must not be part of the decision 
making process.  The research that is done must be seen to be 
without political interference.  The decisions must be seen as 
being valid and necessary and with the broad based support of 
Canadian medical researchers.  Without this support the CIHR will 
only be viewed as another Liberal slush fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CIHR should be subject to a parliamentary review every five 
years.  While I support the premise of the CIHR, there may come a 
time in the future that it needs to be revisited, revised, 
modernized or perhaps eliminated together with something better 
that comes along.  That is exactly what we did with the Canadian 
Alliance.  We now have the opportunity to ensure that we 
undertake such a review on a regular basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the CIHR remains the most appropriate venue for conducting 
health research then we should endorse the program and ensure 
that it continues.  If it can be improved we need to take the 
necessary steps to improve it for the next five years.  We should 
always look ahead to the future, never looking backward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As with any organization consistency is appropriate.  However I 
also believe that positive gains could be made by bringing in new 
council members.  By having a maximum of three terms for each 
council member, there is sufficient time to ensure consistency 
over the long term and yet allow a regular planned turnover of 
council members, thus ensuring a steady influx of new thoughts 
and ideas.  Furthermore, for the same reasons I believe each 
member of the advisory board should serve a term of no more than 
five years and a maximum of three terms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the CIHR is to begin and remain non-political, I would 
support the premise that all governor in council appointments be 
ratified by the Standing Committee on Health by a two-thirds 
majority.  The accountability process must extend to all aspects 
of the CIHR.  In order to achieve this level of transparency the 
membership should be ratified by more than just the government 
majority on the Standing Committee on Health.  Such appointments 
should move beyond the partisan politics of the House and ensure 
that the health of all Canadians is maintained. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another aspect of transparency should extend to the companies 
and individuals that grants and resource funds are allocated to. 
At no time should there be a connection between members of the 
governing council, institute chairs and the recipients of the 
resources. 
To do otherwise does not ensure that the allocation remains 
transparent.  Canadians are demanding full government 
accountability.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to achieve financial accountability and transparency 
through the CIHR I believe the report of the auditor general 
should be made public, for without public accountability all the 
measures in the world are for nought. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the use of the auditor general and his reporting mechanism 
to all Canadians we can be assured that the highlights and low 
lights of the financial accountability of the CIHR will be seen 
by all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My final point on the bill is to enshrine a method of rebuttal 
within the CIHR.  The governing council should develop a 
subcommittee that can act as an ombudsman for complaints brought 
forward by researchers or their private sector partners. We all 
recognize that disagreements will occur.  Rather than wait for a 
problem to arise, let us put a dispute resolution process in 
place.  It would take so little effort now, and yet the bill does 
not contain this kind of allowance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am in favour of the intent of Bill C-13.  I believe the bill 
has the potential to partially address the problems of our 
medical brain drain.  We need to be sure to attract and keep our 
best and brightest.  Our loss of these people is definitely some 
other country's gain.  We cannot allow this to continue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course a major part of this problem involves taxes.  However 
I will save that particular part of my argument for another day. 
Bill C-13 is an improvement over the Medical Research Council. 
Throughout the committee hearings we heard from numerous medical 
and associated groups which asked that the bill be passed at our 
earliest convenience, and I agree with their comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill could be better, as any bill could be better, but the 
comments I have offered today could improve Bill C-13 in the 
future.  In the broader perspective the Canadian Alliance and I 
personally are very happy to support the bill.

more acceptable. More importantly, these amendments would have 
made the bill extremely compatible with the scientific policy 
statement proposed by the Quebec department of science and 
technology, while also making it respectful of Quebec and of its 
policies in the area of science and technology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Be that as it may, committee members from both the government 
and the opposition worked very hard. I do not think I missed a 
single committee meeting and I took a great interest in this 
issue, which involves research and a major concern to us, namely 
health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us begin by the beginning. If we wanted to look at the 
historical background of this legislation, we would go back to 
1994. At the time, I was a young member of parliament full of 
idealism, an idealism that is not totally gone. A report 
published by the OECD indicates that Canada lags far behind when 
it comes to public spending on research. During the pre-1994 
years, Canada was far behind the other OECD members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only is Canada far behind in terms of public spending and 
initiatives to promote research, but research is also 
fragmented, there is a lack of co-ordination and the myth of 
Professor Calculus, whom our young pages will surely remember, a 
researcher who works in isolation in his laboratory and has 
little interaction with the other members of the scientific 
community, was somewhat pertinent here in Canada, in the early 
nineties.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why we support the bill in its intent, which is to put 
researchers in contact with one another and to establish virtual 
research networks from very precise thematic orientations so 
that they can communicate their results to one another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few months ago, the government established a board of 
directors consisting then and now of really interesting people 
from all walks of life. I would like to take this opportunity to 
thank them for their involvement in the scientific community, 
because some of them have been involved for many years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am thinking of Dr. Henry Friesen who, as everybody knows, 
chaired the Medical Research Council of Canada. The bill before 
us will abolish this council. I am thinking, of course, of 
Michel Bureau, from the Fonds de la recherche en santé du 
Québec, who also worked very hard to guide the interim board of 
directors. I am thinking of Andrée Demers, the director of the 
research group on the social aspects of prevention, of Eric 
Maldoff, who is a lawyer, which goes to show that one may be 
trained in law and be interested in research, of Dr. Yves Morin, 
professor emeritus at the faculty of medicine, of Cameron 
Mustard, the director of research at the Institute for Work and 
Health, of Dr. Louise Nadeau, an associate professor, and of Dr. 
Neda L. Chapel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to thank Maria Knoppers, an assistant professor at 
the University of Montreal faculty of law, who is a specialist 
on ethical issues relating to research protocols and on the 
precautions to take to ensure that research complies with the 
ethical standards that we are entitled to expect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will make a digression to point out that it is rather strange 
to see that research work has been done in Canada for over 50 
years but the government has never felt the need to put in place 
a policy on ethics in research. There are of course granting 
agencies such as the Medical Research Council, the Social 
Sciences and Humanities Research Council and the Natural 
Sciences and Engineering Research Council that came together and 
drafted a common policy. The fact remains however that the 
government itself has failed to do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think of course of Paul Lucas, whom I know, as I have been 
very interested in the whole question of drug patent review, who 
is the chairman and chief executive officer of Glaxo in 
Mississauga. I think of Robert Mackenzie, who is the dean of 
advanced studies research at McGill University; of Murray 
Martin, the chairman of the board of the Vancouver Hospital; of 
Robert Perrault, a medical consultant in heart health; of Robert 
Pritchard, from the University of Toronto, and the list goes on. 
We must remember, however, that a provisional governing council 
has suggested directions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The intent of the bill before us is to get researchers into a 
network so that the whole scientific community can benefit from 
the results of the work done by a particular group of 
researchers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not what we have a problem with, and I will have an 
opportunity to revert to this point. 
What we do have a problem with is the fact that—and we find this 
quite strange—the provinces have not been associated with this 
bill. We will have some numbers to provide on this later. We 
know there is a great deal of catching up to do in Quebec, in 
the field of intra muros research, research done in federal 
laboratories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, Quebec, which is developing a science policy, has 
provided $400 million over two years. Quebec, which represents 
25% of the population, has managed to provide in its budget $400 
million for research over two years, while the federal 
government will provide $500 million for all of Canada, at the 
most important point in the establishment of Canadian institutes 
of health research. It seems to me it would have been 
interesting to associate the provinces with this, to agree to 
take their recommendations into consideration.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is especially important to recognize that health care is a 
provincial jurisdiction. The fact still remains that, when the 
government was seeking to establish the Canadian institutes of 
health research, it called on a number of actors. It called on 
people from industry, representatives of consumer groups, 
colleges and universities, which are responsible, as we know, 
for most health research; it also called on the hospitals. As I 
said, the provinces were consulted very weakly, very reservedly 
and very timidly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To show where things stand in health research, I will take the 
year 1998 as an example. I will take great care to speak slowly. 
I realize that, in the past, I have made things a bit difficult 
for the House interpreters; I was criticized for it and, in the 
next few months, I intend to adjust my speed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the House will surely join me in applauding the 
interpreters who work very hard for us. Thus, it is important 
that we keep delivering our speeches calmly, which makes them 
easier to understand anyway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was saying that, according to available data for 1998, which 
is therefore fairly up to date, $2.3 billion was spent on health 
research. 
For clarity sake, here is a breakdown of how the 
responsibilities were divided: 27% of health research was 
carried out by companies and 7% by provincial governments. This 
is a national average. Understandably, British Columbia , 
Ontario and Quebec invest more; an average being a measure of 
the central tendency, this can reflect a biased reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government invested 16% of the funding available for 
research, while the others, namely private lenders, invested 
18%; foreign sources, 8%; private non-profit organizations, 12%; 
and hospitals, universities and institutes, 12 %. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can see that it is primarily the private sector that is 
funding research in Canada, when the total of $2.3 billion is 
broken down by source. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, if we were to apportion intra-muros research mandates, 
namely the research being done by public institutions—as opposed 
to extra-muros research which is done in the private sector—by 
various federal laboratories and by various governments, the 
breakdown would be as follows: hospitals fund 18% of research 
and private non-profit organisations, 6%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the 1990s, the OECD reminded us that the federal 
government, which funds only 3% of the research, had to make a 
effort to catch up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel:</B> This is truly shameful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard:</B> This is truly shameful.  I agree with my 
colleague from Chambly, who is a trained notary. I like to point 
that out because I know he has pleasant memories of his training 
years on the North Shore, if I am not mistaken— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel:</B> At Laval University. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard:</B> At Laval University. If memory serves, he also 
hated administrative law, yet it does not prevent him from 
having an interest for politics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, provincial governments fund 1% and the private 
sector, through mandates and partnerships with the public 
sector, funds 27%. The most interesting information I want to 
point out is the fact that hospitals and universities fund 45% 
of research.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Close to 50% of health research is performed in hospitals 
and universities. It is therefore important to have a bill which 
will take this fact into account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I asked who is responsible for health institutions and 
hospitals, who has jurisdiction constitutionally, I believe that 
we would all be tempted to answer that it is, of course, the 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are facing a situation we have questions about.  The federal 
government wants to invest in research and development. I remind 
the House that the Bloc Quebecois, an eminently responsible 
political formation, has always asked an investment be made in 
research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish you had been there in 1993 during the electoral campaign 
led by an extraordinary campaigner, Lucien Bouchard. The current 
Premier of Quebec and his team of candidates asked the federal 
government to put an end to our historical lag in the area of 
research and development, with data to support that request.  We 
repeated the request in 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But it took two electoral campaigns, masterfully led by the Bloc 
Quebecois in Quebec, for the federal government to finally 
understand this request and to invest in research. 
The government is to be thanked for investing in research, but 
there is a problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am convinced that my colleague, the member for Chambly, will 
agree. Let me digress for a moment just to say that, according 
to the referendum results, the riding where participation was 
the highest in 1995 is Chambly.  I know that down deep the 
member for Chambly must be very proud of that fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Getting back to the subject at hand, I was saying that we hope 
there will be some major investments in health research. 
However, could we not be led to believe—I ask the question to my 
colleagues who all seem extremely interested in that bill—that 
what we have here is a nation building bill? By presenting this 
bill on Canadian institutes of health research, is the federal 
government not looking for greater visibility? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If its main objective were to consolidate biomedical research 
and to promoters greater interaction between researchers who 
work in that field, it could have allocated money to the 
provinces. Members should not forget that Quebec has its Fonds 
de la recherche en santé du Québec, chaired by Dr. Bureau. 
Quebec has had a policy for several years already and has been 
investing in research and has defined major directions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a paradox in the bill. There is an insistence on nation 
building and, yet, there is a divorce between where the research 
will be conducted and the responsibility the Canadian government 
wants to have confirmed by this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not to say that historically research is exclusively a 
provincial jurisdiction. No. We know better on this side of the 
House than to suggest that. 
What we say, however, is that it might have been more 
interesting, for efficiency's sake and out of respect for the 
provinces, to allocate money to existing initiatives, especially 
considering that half of the medical research is done in 
universities and hospitals, which are themselves agents of the 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Quebec is not comfortable with such a bill. 
Things would have been a lot simpler if the government had 
accepted the amendments moved by the opposition.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We said “Yes, let us establish institutes of health research.” I 
will, if I may, digress, because if people take a cursory glance 
at the bill, they may get the impression—and the minister said 
this many times publicly—that 15 institutes will be established. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government says that there will a budget of $240 million to 
begin with, that $500 million will be provided at the most 
crucial phase, in 2001-2002, that the Canadian institutes of 
health research will have a thematic focus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each institute will have four major research focuses: bio-medical 
research, clinical research, research to improve people's health 
of populations and research on our health care system. 
Yet, because I have been extremely vigilant in examining this 
bill, I noticed that there will be only one institute and that 
the governing council is very centralized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This centralized institute will oversee 15 other institutes that 
are not really independent. They will not have genuine 
operational independence, at least not according to what is 
provided in this bill. This is a trap and is of concern to us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just to show that there is no genuine operational independence, 
the bill provides that all equipment acquired shall remain the 
property of the federal crown. All research projects submitted 
to the different advisory committees in each institute and 
approved by them will have to get the approval of the governing 
council. I think members will agree that we have seen better 
instances of operational independence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another paradox. The chairperson of the governing 
council and the chief executive officer are the same person. I 
hope that the parliamentary secretary, my friend from 
Anjou—Rivière-des-Prairies, with whom I share a passion for 
Montreal, will remember that we asked him questions about that 
in committee. We asked him why the two functions were performed 
by the same person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give an example for the enlightenment of my colleague, 
the parliamentary secretary. Let us take the Régie des 
installations olympiques—$500 million is a lot of money—whose board 
of directors recently had a new roof made for the stadium. This 
organization has a budget of less than $500 million. 
Yet, as is the case with most crown corporations and other 
public organizations, it was felt that the chairperson of the 
board and the chief executive officer ought to be two different 
persons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such a distinction is important and, according to philosopher 
Montesquieu, it is essential in order to have checks and 
balances. The chief executive officer must make decisions for 
the day to day administration of the health institutes so they 
can fulfil their terms of reference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The role of the chairperson of the governing council is one of 
supervision and control, that of a watchdog. 
Are we to conclude that this role of monitoring, of control, 
this eminently desirable watchdog role when the public's money 
is concerned, can be properly exercized when we realize the 
chairman of the board and the CEO are one and the same person? 
Really now, that makes no sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has failed in its duty.  I repeat, we are in 
favour of the principle of this bill.  We acknowledge the 
government's desire to create links, forums for interaction, for 
exchange, for focusing researchers' efforts.  We agree that this 
is the path modern research needs to take, but we believe this 
bill has a certain number of flaws, and have sought to improve 
it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must admit, however, that the government has unfortunately 
turned a deaf ear to our amendments.  It has not, in fact, 
accepted a single one.  We introduced about thirty of them, each 
one more relevant than the last, and these were amendments which 
witnesses had called for.  Unfortunately, the government turned 
a deaf ear to them.  That is its prerogative, but I am forced to 
say that the bill would have benefited considerably from them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before going into any further detail on the research institutes, 
I would like to point out that, on February 14, the Government 
of Quebec, the government of Lucien Bouchard, through Mrs. 
Marois, the Minister of State for Health, and Jean Rochon, whose 
name is always mentioned with pleasure in this House because of 
his past accomplishments, wrote to the Minister of Health, over 
the signatures of the two ministers but on behalf of the entire 
government, to express its opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will read the letter in question, if I may, for the sake of 
transparency.  I will also say that we moved 33 amendments of 
every nature, and that it would have been desirable for the 
government to agree to them.  I will now begin reading the 
letter: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is pursuant to the introduction in the House of Commons, on 
November 4, 1999, of Bill C-13, an act to establish the Canadian 
Institutes of Health Research, to repeal the Medical Research 
Council Act and to make consequential amendments to other Acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Your government had already announced, in its February 1999 
budget, that this new structure would be responsible for 
distributing $240 million to fund research projects until the 
year 2001-2002. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, it is no surprise that Bill C-13 was welcomed by the 
scientific and research community which, 
needless to say, was severely affected by the federal cuts made 
in recent years. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will continue reading this letter, but I want to take this 
opportunity to remind the House that the federal government cut 
$33 billion in cash transfers and in transfer payments to the 
provinces. Obviously, when the government makes cuts to transfer 
payments, it affects the provinces' ability to support the 
research efforts of the various granting agencies for which they 
have primary responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next excerpt is very important. I do not know if my comments 
can be heard in dolby or in stereo, but I hope they will be 
clearly heard in the House, particularly by the Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Minister of Health and the Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Minister of Finance, who is here with us today. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the Government of Quebec shares and understands the 
satisfaction expressed by the research community in Quebec in 
that regard and recognizes that it is necessary for our two 
governments to co-operate in the area of research, it is troubled— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The term used here is quite strong, and meant to be. Could 
someone give me the Latin root of the word troubled? Does the 
hon. member for Chambly remember? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Charbonneau:</B> It comes from the word trouble. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard:</B> It comes from the word trouble, as in 
troublemaker. The Government of Quebec is troubled. I will 
go back to the letter: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—by the fact that Bill C-13 seems, unfortunately, to reflect the 
federal government's determination to exceed its jurisdictions 
by trivializing those of the provinces and by distorting the 
sharing of powers provided for under the Canadian Constitution. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that a government would use such strong wording as 
constitutional powers is quite something.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The letter further states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health is an area under provincial jurisdiction. In fact, what 
successive governments in Quebec have always claimed has indeed 
been recognized by the Supreme Court of Canada in various 
matters, including in Bell Canada v Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Quebec reminds the federal government that 
health is first and foremost an area under provincial 
jurisdiction, as recognized by the supreme court. 
In that context, certain aspects of your bill reflect a 
centralizing vision and a desire to reduce the provinces' powers 
and responsibilities, with regard to health, which we cannot 
accept. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, the Government of Quebec wants funding for 
research, but it has some concerns about the fact that this bill 
could open the door to interventionism and interference. With 
regard to research, the letter says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The approach based on networking, interdisciplinarity and the 
pooling of knowledge and experience is part of a trend that 
already exists in Quebec, where researchers in several areas are 
already used to working as part of a network on an 
interdisciplinary or inter-university basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, the Government of Quebec, which, each year, allocates 
more than adequate budgets to research funding, supports the 
objectives of this networking approach. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government must not think that there is anything new 
in asking researchers to do team work. It is a practice that the 
Government of Quebec has enshrined in its research policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I apologize if sometimes I do not keep still, but by way of 
historical background, I will remind the House that Henri 
Bourassa, whose last nationalist speech was delivered in the 
eastern townships, used to move or walk about a lot when he was 
a member of this House. I have read that in the archives. I will 
stay close to my microphone, because technology is much more 
advanced now, but that does not mean that we are not inspired by 
Henri Bourassa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was an ultramontane. He was also a very committed nationalist 
who opposed the conscription bill motion tabled in this House, 
as the member for Chambly undoubtedly knows since he is a 
scholar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Quebec government blames the federal government for not 
consulting it. I read further and I hope you will get the gist 
of the letter: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, by giving the institutes a leading and centralizing 
role in health research and by mentioning the development and 
implementation of an integrated health policy, Bill C-13 
reflects a federal government's desire to assume 
responsibilities it does not have in that area under the 
Constitution. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned Henri Bourassa for a reason. We have had young 
nationalists, like Henri Bourassa and Armand Lavergne, who were 
great orators. Why is there a strong sovereignist movement 
constantly striving to assert itself, which is about to succeed? 
Because throughout Quebec's history, and that of Canada, the 
roles assigned to each level of government have systematically 
not been respected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important to note that this government's health 
department alone employs more public servants than all the 
provincial departments, whose primary responsibility is health.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This is typical of Canadian history. The history of Canada is 
riddled with encroachments, all unjustified constitutionally, on 
other jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I may, I would like to quote again Ministers Rochon and 
Marois: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is cause for concern to have a bill which, while 
recognizing the provinces' role in health, tries to relegate 
them to the level of actors, just like any other Canadian or 
foreign individual or organization that have an interest in 
health. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is quite something. Clause 4 of the bill puts the provinces 
and voluntary organizations on an equal footing. We have nothing 
against voluntary organizations. We believe on the subject of 
Canadian institutes of health research, all sectors having an 
interest in research, namely consumers, voluntary organizations 
and industry, should be heard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure members will agree that there is nevertheless a 
distinction between the voluntary and community and the various 
governments. The bill pays lip service to co-operation between 
the federal government and the provinces, despite the fact that 
health care is primarily a provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that the Government of Quebec is right to be concerned 
by this bill and that we were also right in moving more than 30 
amendments to the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The letter goes on: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Quebec can only welcome any action taken by 
the federal government to increase the funding of health 
research, as long as such action does not encroach on Quebec's 
responsibilities and role in this area as well as in other areas 
which it considers a priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, it is totally unacceptable for your government, under 
the guise of action taken in the area of research, through 
agencies under its control, to seek to have an influence on the 
directions, the management and the implementation of health 
care services and programs over which, it must be pointed out, 
the federal government has no jurisdiction. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe members get the point of this letter. 
At the end of my speech, I will seek unanimous consent of the 
House to table this letter so that every member can benefit 
from of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to emphasize that the Quebec government has 
priorities. It has identified areas where it has developed 
know-how, a specific expertise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am referring to the whole area of genome, heredity and 
genetics. I am referring also to AIDS. AIDS is part of the large 
family of concerns that is virology and immunology. Quebec has 
concentrated on its territory a number of researchers extremely 
conversant with broad international trends in that field of 
research. 
I am also thinking of cancer, which has taken an enormous toll, 
as we know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I dare hope that in establishing the Canadian institutes of 
health research the government will take into account the 
strengths and the weaknesses of every province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, you are indicating that I have only three minutes 
left. That is unbelievable; it feels like I just started to make 
a number of important points. I will have to speak quickly of 
the amendments we have put forward. I have only three minutes 
left, but it is not totally unthinkable that I could get the 
unanimous consent of the House to continue my speech. 
In the interests of good relations, it would certainly be 
possible to obtain such consent, as ought to be the case, 
obviously.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to recall five of our amendments.  We would have 
liked to have the following in the preamble: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whereas Parliament recognizes the full jurisdiction of the 
provinces over health services— 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Had the government agreed to incorporate this amendment in the 
bill, we would have voted for Bill C-13.  We think it important 
in the field of health to establish clearly that the provinces 
have the primary responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also would have liked to amend clause 4 as follows: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—by replacing lines 23 to 26 on page four with the following: 
</UL></UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(iii) have the provinces participate in the choice of directions 
and decisions for research; and 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This takes no special talent.  It seems to me there is nothing 
outlandish in that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In another type of amendment we would have liked to see agreed 
to, with regard to clause 5, we said that there was a need to: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(<I>b</I>.1) involve the provinces in the choice of directions and 
decisions and form partnerships with them; 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means more than just co-operating. It recognizes the central 
role of the provinces, which must be involved in the choice and 
in the directions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most significant I would have liked to see agreed to, in 
addition to the recognition that this is a matter of provincial 
jurisdiction, is the one in which we said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>7.1 The Governor in Council shall appoint the President of the 
CIHR and the—members of the governing council from lists of names 
provided by the provinces. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would this not have been a good example of co-operative 
federalism, as the provinces could make proposals?  Not only 
would they make proposals, but the federal government would 
agree to draw, for the appointments to the various governing 
councils and in the various institutes of health research, on 
the lists provided by the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In view of the wild enthusiasm my speech elicited, I wondered, 
Mr. Speaker, if you could make sure that the letter sent to us 
by the Quebec ministers of health and research be first made 
public for the benefit of all parliamentarians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude on three points.  This is a nation building 
bill.  We would have been pleased to vote for it had the 
responsibilities of the provinces been recognized.  Despite all, 
we are pleased the federal government is investing in research. 
I hope as things unfold that the federal government will involve 
the provinces and their networks of researchers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is there unanimous consent of the House to 
allow the hon. member to table the documents to which he has 
alluded? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity on behalf of my 
colleagues in the New Democratic Party to express all our 
concerns about Bill C-13. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question we are talking about a bill that makes 
progress in terms of health research in this country today.  The 
New Democratic Party from day one has indicated that we support 
the principle of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support the idea of increased dollars for health research. We 
support the idea of transforming the country's health research 
agenda to ensure that it includes the whole range of health 
concerns, that it approaches health care and health research on a 
holistic basis and that it looks not only at biomedical research 
and applied research, but also at the soundness of our health 
care system and those determinants of ill health so much at the 
heart of everything we are dealing with today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make it perfectly clear that we support the idea and 
spirit of the bill. 
However, at the outset when the bill was before the House at 
second reading we said that we had serious concerns which we were 
prepared to raise at committee and would propose serious and 
constructive amendments.  We looked to the government to listen 
to those concerns and to respond where those concerns were 
clearly identified and reinforced by testimony from witnesses. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1155"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT22"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to say with some anger and bitterness that we were not 
successful for one second in moving the government to consider 
any changes to the bill.  From the beginning of the committee 
process right through to the completion of report stage 
yesterday, we did not have the ear of the government.  We did not 
have any kind of interest on the part of Liberal members in 
improving the bill to address those concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are very disappointed and disturbed at the arrogance of the 
government in its refusal to broaden its approach to allow for 
democratic participation on the part of Canadians everywhere. It 
is with profound regret that today we stand in the House to 
express our opposition to Bill C-13. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me put it in the context of the health care system as a 
whole because one cannot, as some have tried to do in the House 
today, separate our health care system from our health research 
agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All members in the House know that we have very deeply felt 
concerns about the general direction of our health care system. 
Time and time again we have raised the degree to which our health 
care system is being privatized.  We have asked the government 
time and time again to provide leadership and direction to ensure 
that the private sector is not the major dominant force in our 
health care sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is no coincidence that today we are dealing with Bill C-13 at 
the height of Canadians' concerns on the future of medicare and 
our health care system.  It is interesting to note that today as 
we debate this bill there are Canadians all over this city and in 
this place, the House of Commons, talking to, lobbying and 
pressuring Liberal members of parliament to rethink their 
direction on health care and for the government to come to its 
senses on what Canadians treasure the most and what needs to be 
done.  Privatization of the health care system on the one hand 
cannot be considered separately from what is being done by the 
government in terms of health research on the other hand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the beginning we have had four or five major concerns with 
Bill C-13.  We have tried to seek changes in those areas. We have 
been unsuccessful so our concerns remain.  Let me clearly outline 
those major concerns with the hope at this last minute of having 
the ear of the parliamentary secretary and other members of the 
Liberal government.  It is hoped that we will be able to make 
some changes at the last moment or at least work toward 
redressing these serious issues in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first concern is the degree to which our health care system 
is being privatized and commercialized. This bill is about 
research.  It is about the role of the Canadian government in 
advancing public health research. The bill is about how we can 
actually address the causes of ill health and move to make our 
system more efficient and equitable.  One of the measures of a 
bill is the extent to which it ensures that the public good is 
preserved and that there is no explicit reference in legislation 
to allow the private sector to take precedence over the public 
agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our concerns have been very clearly outlined in the House and at 
committee on a number of occasions. Those feelings, sentiments 
and opinions have been reinforced by dozens of witnesses who 
appeared before the committee and made representations to the 
government. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1200"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT23"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, if we are concerned and interested in advancing the 
public research agenda in the country today, we have to take 
extra special steps to ensure that the public good is protected 
at all costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill, however transformative in nature, does not address 
the fundamental question of ensuring that the public good is 
paramount at all costs.  The bill leaves open the question of the 
degree to which commercial efforts, private health sector forces, 
can have control over the health care agenda and the health 
research agenda in the country today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of the reputable organizations that appeared before the 
committee raised those concerns.  I do not need to go through the 
whole list, but I remind members that this is not an opinion 
coming from one small part of the country.  It is not just coming 
from the New Democratic Party members.  It is a concern that was 
raised by professionals, health activists and ordinary citizens 
from one end of the country to the other.  When it comes to 
health research, the role of the government should be to protect 
the public interest and advance the public good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While this bill makes progress in terms of transforming our 
health research agenda, it does not address that fundamental 
question of ensuring the public good is paramount.  If we look at 
the bill we will clearly see the reference to commercialization 
as part of one of the objectives of the new Canadian institutes 
for health research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our objective at committee was straightforward and simple. 
While acknowledging the role of the private sector in Canada 
today and the role of the government in ensuring the commercial 
advantage of Canadian businesses in society, we felt that the 
bill should specify that the public good was paramount.  We tried 
to convince the government to take a simple step and acknowledge 
that concern and eliminate any ambiguity in the bill.  We called 
for the government to entrench in this legislation words that 
would show that any commercialization of research would be 
secondary to the public interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We presented some 15 amendments, all of which were turned down 
by the government.  They were hardly considered for a moment by 
the government.  We suggested that the government could have, in 
all seriousness, changed the wording of the bill and improved it 
by adding the words “consistent with the public interest”. Does 
this not sound simple?   It only had to add the words 
“consistent with the public interest” so that there would be no 
ambiguity and no doubts remaining about who was controlling the 
agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Liberal members on the committee gathered together, brought 
their members out and defeated that straightforward proposition 
to ensure that the public interest was protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How in good conscience can we support a bill that could not even 
ensure that a fundamental principle was attached to the content? 
How can we support the government's move to change the research 
agenda if it is not prepared to be upfront and clear about the 
direction in which it is taking the country?  I do not think we 
are asking too much by requesting the government to remove that 
ambiguity and protect the public interest.  I do not think it is 
too much given the kinds of incidents and situations we are 
dealing with on a day to day basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not have to remind members about the situation facing Dr. 
Nancy Olivieri, a scientist who did considerable research on a 
particular drug dealing with— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon:</B>  A very good scientist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:</B>  Yes, a very good scientist, as 
my colleague from Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre just said.  She 
was doing research on a particular drug called L1.  She was 
trying to help people with a blood disease called thalassemia and 
who needed repeated transfusions.  She worked very hard on this 
drug and came to the conclusion that the side effects might be 
greater than the actual benefits.  She chose to inform the drug 
companies sponsoring this research about those concerns.  As a 
result of that expression of concern, she was silenced.  To this 
day, she is still fighting for the right as a scientist to 
operate with integrity and to ensure full disclosure of any 
information that would be important in terms of the public good 
and the public interest.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not need to tell members about Dr. Anne Holbrook, with the 
Centre for Evaluation of Medicines at St. Joseph's Hospital in 
Hamilton, Ontario, who was threatened recently with a lawsuit by 
a major pharmaceutical company when her findings showed that the 
company's widely sold ulcer medication had essentially the same 
effect as two cheaper medicines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not need to tell members about the outcry from scientists 
in the government's own Bureau of Veterinary Drugs who felt 
pressured by representatives of one of Canada's largest drug 
companies, Monsanto Canada Inc., on the whole issue of reviewing 
bovine growth hormone, or BST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not need to tell members about how the government, in one 
of its first initiative when it took office in 1997, eliminated 
the drug research bureau, the one independent body within 
government to provide ongoing analysis on an independent basis of 
drugs approved in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not need to tell members about how the government gutted 
the food research laboratory and how the government has, at every 
step of the way, weakened the capacity of government to ensure 
ongoing, independent, science based research around the drugs 
Canadians must take, the food we eat and the medical devices that 
are essential for health and well-being. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not need to tell members about the auditor general's recent 
report, following its review of the most serious incident of food 
borne disease in this country to date.  It documented very 
clearly the question of scientific investigation being influenced 
by owners of, in this case, a meat packing plant and documented 
interference right from beginning to end around the safety of 
Canadians when it came to food products being purchased in 
grocery stores today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not need to tell members about the recent decision by the 
government to fast track drugs through a new provision that has 
no basis in law, the notice of compliance with conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not need to tell members about how our whole Health 
Protection Branch has been under tremendous change and direction 
from the government to deregulate, privatize and off-load. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not need to tell members about how much danger Canadians 
are in because the government has made a decision to actually 
withdraw from the whole area of public research and independent 
science based investigation in this country today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I raise all of this so that we can all understand just where 
this bill fits in with the broad Liberal agenda in the country 
today, and just how much is at risk because we are letting 
commercialization and privatization rule the day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My plea today is for us to acknowledge the very important role 
of government to ensure that the public good is protected, that 
in whatever partnerships are developed between the private 
sector, the labour movement and the public sector, that we 
clearly understand and delineate the rules of government and 
realize its paramount obligation is, in the final analysis, to 
uphold the public good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole issue of commercialization was one of our concerns.  I 
see my time is going much more quickly than I expected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My second concern has to do with the way in which this bill 
allows for appointments to the governing council.  One way we can 
actually ensure that the public good is paramount is by having 
very clearly defined requirements in place with respect to 
appointments to the governing council.  The bill does not provide 
for clear conflict of interest guidelines and regulations, 
something we tried very hard to get in our amendments that were, 
as I said at the outset, just ignored by Liberal members on the 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill permits the appointment of representatives from the 
pharmaceutical industry, the biotech industry and the medical 
devices private sector, which carries with it the potential for 
conflict of interest between the goal we have on one hand of 
improving the health of Canadians at the lowest possible cost 
versus the objective of increasing profits on the part of the 
pharmaceutical industry. 
This should come as no surprise when we realize that this 
government, when it was in opposition, promised to nullify the 
Mulroney patent protection legislation for drug companies but has 
failed to do so.  Not only did it fail to keep its promise, it 
went a step further over the last number of years and has 
improved the conditions for brand name drug companies by giving 
them a greater share of the market and denying Canadians access 
to cheaper safe drugs.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We presented to the government some very concrete amendments for 
ensuring conflict of interest provisions were built into this 
bill to avoid precisely that kind of situation that all Canadians 
are worried about, and we failed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also made a concerted effort to ensure that the board would 
be more representative of the population by ensuring that smaller 
provinces, which do not have the ear of government the way 
stronger provinces have, would have a say on this governing 
council.   We wanted regional balance.  We wanted to ensure that 
the board reflected the population.  We asked for gender parity, 
something the government claims is part of its ongoing philosophy 
and the way in which it governs as a political party.  Did we get 
gender parity?   No, we did not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We tried to get a commitment from the government for a women's 
health institute to assist with their goals for promoting women's 
health policy.  We were unsuccessful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We tried to get the government to commit to addressing in a more 
serious way environmental and occupational health as part of one 
of these institutes.  We were unsuccessful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We tried to get a serious commitment from the government around 
aboriginal health, ensuring a very focused research endeavour in 
that regard.  We were unsuccessful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, and this is a point I am sure my colleagues across the 
way will be interested in, we tried very hard, and were looking 
forward to measures being adopted at the report stage of this 
bill, to get more transparency and accountability.   A five year 
review was something basic and something we expected would be 
adopted by the Liberal government when it came to report stage 
over the last couple of days.  Did that happen?  No, it did not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The basic elements of transparency, accountability, protection 
of the public good over private interests, gender parity and 
ensuring that we actually have a new transformative research 
agenda based on population health, based on environmental illness 
and occupational problems, all of which have not been dealt with 
by this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government had an opportunity to improve a bill that does 
make progress and makes an important transition from the Medical 
Research Council to a more holistic approach to health care but 
it failed in the final analysis to do what Canadians expected it 
to do, which was to ensure in that bill absolute guarantees of 
protection for public good, absolute accountability to the public 
and openness and transparency in the way it is run. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government refused to give even a token of consideration to 
these very important amendments and to the testimony presented to 
the House of Commons by numerous experts and witnesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is with great regret that we cannot support Bill C-13 in the 
final analysis.  However, we will continue to do whatever we can 
in the days, weeks and months ahead to ensure that the translation 
of this legislation into research bodies and 
organizations that are reflective of the population will be 
carried out.  We will be monitoring the appointment process and 
the way in which the institutes are established.  We will be 
outspoken in our attempts to ensure that this bill in terms of 
its noble objectives are actually transformed into action so that 
the words and the reality are one and the same. 
<P><A NAME="LINK32"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I guess the debate that is taking place here today is 
one of strange interest because so far all of the parties have 
indicated that they will be supporting the bill but that they 
have some reservations about it.   I sometimes wish we could 
actually sit down with each other, maybe in a circle somewhere, 
and hammer these different ideas out.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, one always runs a danger when one expresses himself 
or herself in this Chamber.  Come the next election even the 
slightest nuance of what one says can be misinterpreted, twisted 
and turned.  Therefore, it is tough for me to formulate the 
question that I want to ask.  It is, I suppose, a philosophical 
question:  What is it that actually drives research? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think of a number of friends who work not only in medical 
research but in other areas of research.  It seems to me that 
Canada has a very great stifling effect on medical research, in 
particular because of the fact that we are so entrenched in the 
socialistic way of thinking.  Somehow we do not think that we 
should reward those who come up with some really good ideas and 
inventions in the medical field, whereas we are quite willing to 
give those rewards to people in other areas where perhaps we are 
even more successful.  Is there a Bill Gates on the horizon in 
the medical area? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sometimes wonder why we have this great objection to the fact 
that somehow private enterprise should be involved in both the 
delivery of health care services and also in the development of 
new ways of doing things in the medical area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know whether the hon. member wants to respond.  I 
believe that in the Canadian context we need to reach a balance. 
I would like to stop punishing people who do good work in medical 
research, sending them to the United States, which is the only 
place they feel they can get a reward for the magnitude of the 
good work they do.  I would like that to end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the 
question and the very thoughtful issues posed by the hon. member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to his first comment, I too would have liked the 
opportunity to have avoided this kind of confrontational 
environment and found a place where we could sit down in a circle 
to seriously discuss where we are going in terms of health 
research and how we could balance the different interests in 
society today, one being the public interest and the public good, 
the other being the fact that, yes, we cannot as a nation deny 
that we need private sector involvement in the development of new 
products and new technologies, as well as ensuring Canada's 
commercial advantage in the world economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, why do we see a role for the private sector in the bill 
in terms of driving the research agenda?  Our point is very 
clearly this.  There is a role for government to balance the 
private sector and the public research communities.  This bill, 
in our view, does not make clear the lines.  It does not 
differentiate between those priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have said over and over again is that it is the role of 
government to ensure that the board, the governing council and 
the structure that will be put in place will not be geared to 
allow private commercial interests to determine the agenda or to 
use public funds for profitability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that is something we surely can agree on, that it is the 
role of government to fund our academic community, to fund our 
health research organizations and to develop partnerships 
appropriate in that context, but not for a bill to outline from 
the start that the commercial sector in the country has an 
advantage or is able to set the agenda and use public funds to 
advance private gain.  I think the member would have concerns 
with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would hope that we would at least understand the role of 
government in terms of public funds for advancing a public health 
care system and working on public health research which addresses 
the root causes of ill health and ensures that we have a much 
more comprehensive and broad based approach to these very 
difficult issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one is opposed to the private sector being involved in 
research.  What we are questioning today is the role of 
government in supporting, aiding and abetting commercialization 
and privatization to the detriment of the public organization of 
health care and serving the public good in the final analysis.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I congratulate my colleague from Winnipeg North Centre 
for her remarks on this very important bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask my colleague what distinguishes the New Democratic 
Party's view of health care from that of the Alliance-Liberal 
style government we have in the country.  Could the member give 
us some pertinent information as to why we are at this point in 
health care and on the cutbacks we have seen over the years? 
Maybe she could give us some information as to actual numbers in 
terms of cutbacks and the pressures that have been applied to our 
very important health care system.  Who basically drove the 
Liberal agenda?  Was it the Reform Party's drive for two tier 
health care or the Americanization of the system?  Maybe she 
could give us an overview as to how those positions differ from 
the NDP's. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
colleague for that question.  It is very pertinent to the debate 
today.  We are at a crossroads in terms of where our health care 
system will go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague knows that the New Democratic Party has always 
stood for a universally accessible, publicly administered health 
care system.  We have been strongly opposed to any move toward 
two tier, Americanized, privatized health care in this country. 
The same goes for health research.  We are very concerned about 
ensuring that the public good is served at all times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is obviously the case in the House today is that the 
Liberal government has chosen the path of inaction and passive 
response in the face of those threats from the private sector, 
and has created the climate and conditions for the likes of Ralph 
Klein to proceed with the privatization of hospital service in 
the province of Alberta. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon:</B>  Did you say Ralph Chrétien or Ralph 
Klein? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:</B>  It could be Ralph Chrétien or 
Jean Klein.  We are talking about two peas in a pod. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to say, that is an agenda, from all I have understood and 
heard recently, which is supported by the Canadian Alliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our biggest worry is that the Liberal government will not be 
able to stand in the face of the extreme pressure from right wing 
forces in the country today who want to open up our health care 
sector to market forces, something which we know will destroy 
medicare and make the five principles of medicare meaningless. 
It will put us on a direct path to a system of health care in 
which, if people have the money, they can get what is needed, 
when it is needed and at the best quality, versus those who do 
not have the money, who will have to stand in line and wait for 
handouts from the government of the day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Medicare is a model that is worth sharing with the world, not 
destroying and tearing apart at this critical juncture.  The idea 
of making a system universally accessible to all citizens, 
regardless of income or where they live in this vast country, is 
as good today as it was when Tommy Douglas first pioneered the 
notion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would hope that somehow we could convince the Liberal 
government to address how it has created this situation, with its 
tremendous cuts to transfer payments to the provinces and its 
failure to apply the Canada Health Act in the face of the likes 
of Ralph Klein.  Surely it can hear the voices of Canadians from 
one end of the country to the other crying out for the 
restoration of funding cuts, for leadership in terms of a new 
vision of health care and for holding firm to the principles of 
medicare and upholding the Canada Health Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a battle ahead of us and I would hope I could convince 
my colleagues in the Canadian Alliance to rethink their position 
around private sector involvement in health care and start 
thinking about how we could creatively develop a public health 
care system which would be, in the long run, more efficient and 
more cost effective.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
will be sharing my 20 minutes with our deputy House leader. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a pleasure to take part in this debate today.  As my 
colleague from New Brunswick Southwest has said, it is the first 
major health bill to come before this parliament. 
The bill would establish the Canadian institutes of health 
research.  It is worthy of support and we in the PC Party support 
it because we feel it is a very good initiative.

<A HREF="#LINKT28"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the process of supporting it, my colleague from New Brunswick 
Southwest put forth a number of amendments.  However, we know 
that government members have not been supportive of any of the 
amendments, even though they sought to make the legislation much 
better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure we all agree that this bill is long overdue.  This 
initiative was taken by the United States and most European 
countries some 25 years ago.  We are about 25 years behind the 
times in setting up these institutes for health research, so it 
stands to reason that we have a lot of catching up to do.  It 
stands to reason that we have a lot of ground to cover if we want 
to be competitive with the rest of the world in terms of medical 
research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the Progressive Conservative Party have other concerns, 
which include the makeup of the boards and who will pick the 
people who will sit on the boards.  For example, the president of 
the Canadian institutes of health research shall be appointed by 
the governor in council to hold office at the pleasure of the 
government for a term not exceeding five years.  The governor in 
council simply means the cabinet or the prime minister, who will, 
in the final analysis, appoint the president.  As well, each of 
the 20 members of the governing council will be appointed by the 
prime minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a lot of concerns about the appointments.  At the end of 
the day the prime minister has the ability to determine the 
agenda of the council.  We are not saying that will happen on 
every occasion, but the prime minister does have the ability to 
determine the agenda of the council.  It becomes a question of 
control.  That is why the government is not willing to entertain 
any changes to the council, how it is set up and who will appoint 
the people to the governing body. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is good news for Canadians, with the exception of the 
political overtones attached to it.  As my colleague from New 
Brunswick Southwest has said on a number of occasions, it is 
incumbent upon the government to tell the House how these 
institutes will be guided in their work over the next number of 
years.  That is our main concern and the main reason we have 
introduced the amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are suggesting that there is a better way to do this.  The 
government had the opportunity to listen to the opposition, and I 
am told by my colleague from New Brunswick Southwest that many of 
these amendments were discussed in committee and voted down by 
government members.  The government should take a very strong and 
a very long look at the makeup of these institutes and consider 
some of the amendments which we have talked about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister has been around for a long time.  He has a 
history of opposing appointments of this sort, whether 
appointments to a board, to a council or to the Senate. 
We are saying that the formula is flawed and the House of Commons 
is the place to change it.

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is good news for Canadians with the exception of who 
calls the shots. The question goes back to the arm's length 
relationship with government and the independence that we would 
like to see associated with these institutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our party cannot see where there will be any independence for 
these institutes.  We think that the strong arm of the government 
will still be present on the very bodies it has created. We ask 
the government, is there not a better way to set up a body that 
will take us into the 21st century in medical research? These are 
very serious concerns in my view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another concern the member for New Brunswick Southwest commented 
on was the reporting mechanism.  There is no provision in the 
bill that will allow the House to debate the performance of the 
institutes.  We are very much aware the minister will table a 
report of the institutes on a yearly basis, but that will be the 
extent of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliament will not have the opportunity to review the 
operations of the institutes to determine if the body is making 
its mark or whether it is missing its mark totally. That is a 
very legitimate concern.  We want the institutes to get off to a 
good start so that the body will not find itself in the same mess 
as the health care system finds itself in today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the past few years the country has seen unprecedented 
amounts of money cut from health care and Canadians have suffered 
a great deal.  The bill is welcomed as a much needed initiative 
aimed at improving the health of Canadians through a greater 
network of research institutes.  However, it is clear that 
something must be done to improve health care if the health care 
institutes are to be successful because it all goes hand in hand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister did not provide stable, long term funding for 
health care in the budget. Instead he provided a one shot 
infusion of $2.5 billion for health and education spread out over 
four years and spread out over 10 provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The institutes should have their mandate expanded to examine the 
effect that all of this lack of funding has had upon health care. 
Funding has been spread pretty thin over the last four or five 
budget years, for which the Minister of Health has been 
responsible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my own province of Newfoundland, our share of the $2.5 
billion which has been made available is only $10 million a year 
for a four year period.  If half that money is used for health 
care, that will be $5 million spread over 34 hospitals and health 
care institutes in the province.  That equates to less than 
$150,000 per institution, or about the cost of maintaining one 
extra doctor per institution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe these institutes should be examining the effect of the 
lack of funding on the province. Common sense will tell anyone 
that the amount of money that has been cut from the system today 
is having a devastating effect upon the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short the minister's prescription for the health care system 
is the same as putting a band-aid on a gaping wound.  The health 
care system needs money. 
The Liberals seem to run from that.  They keep denying the fact 
that the system needs money saying that a new vision of health 
care has to be created for the country.  It is something they 
will probably take into an election campaign.  One has to wonder 
if the problem here is that the federal Liberals are more 
concerned about getting political credit for health care than 
they are about the actual delivery of health care to our 
citizens.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I see that my time has expired so I will turn it over to my 
colleague, the deputy House leader. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK35"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Bachand (Richmond—Arthabaska, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, as we 
can see, when the truth is debated and spoken in the House, 
nobody speaks. So I would like to congratulate my hon. colleague 
whose speech has provided, I hope, food for thought for the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Little time has been allotted to each member to speak to a bill 
as important as this one. As my hon. colleague from Newfoundland 
has said, we are going to support this bill, even though we 
would have preferred the government to be more open on certain 
amendments that the Progressive Conservative Party, the real 
conservative party in Canada, and the other parties, proposed. 
We would have liked the government to have been more open. I 
will elaborate a little bit on three or four main themes for 
discussion or comments on this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the provinces were mentioned frequently. My hon. 
colleague from the Bloc Quebecois raised the federal-provincial 
constitutional and jurisdictional issue. This has been looked 
into. We are fortunate in the Progressive Conservative Party to 
have people with a good knowledge of federal-provincial relations 
and the Constitution. They considered whether, from a legal 
point of view, the bill was consistent with the constitutional 
laws of Canada. The answer is yes, it is legal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, even if it is legal in terms of jurisdictions, because 
shared jurisdictions do exist, as is the case here, we have no 
obligation to adopt the Liberal government's way of doing 
things, which is wanting to control everything and then saying 
to the provinces “Come to see me afterwards if you are not happy 
with something”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government missed a golden opportunity to provide in the 
bill for much broader participation by the provinces. It forgot 
about that. Is overlap or duplication of the money invested in 
research possible? I hope not, but when people do not talk to 
one another, it is like when a husband and wife go out to buy 
Christmas gifts. If they do not talk beforehand, they might very 
well come back with two identical Pokemons for the same child. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our view, it would have been wise to establish a permanent 
process in this bill so that the provinces and the other players 
in research could be partners. It is a matter of attitude and, 
once again, we find it most damaging even if it is legal. We 
would like to see the government reconsider it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, there is more money for research, but I remind members that 
the bill does not mention any amount. We will have to go from 
budget to budget to discover the amounts of money that will be 
made available for research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Newfoundland and Labrador raised the issue of 
patronage, of what is referred to here as the “governor in 
council”, who appoints a lot of people. I do not know the exact 
number of people the governor in council is responsible for 
appointing. Some figures being mentioned are 200, 300, 400, 500, 
600 or even 800 people. 
This includes, of course, the other house. It is a lot of people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case, perhaps the government could have agreed to be a 
lot more open in appointing members to the governing council. It 
would have been nice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did the Standing Committee on Health not take the time to 
look at the list and to listen to those whose names had been 
suggested? Some raised the question as to why, for example, 50% 
of the members of the governing council could not be suggested by 
the provinces. There could have been a certain number for each 
province or for each region. Why not? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1240"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, it is a matter of attitude on the part of the government, 
an attitude that, unfortunately, is not likely to change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would have been nice if parliament had been a lot more 
involved. With this bill creating the institutes, parliament will 
be involved once a year and we do not know exactly in what way. 
The Auditor General of Canada will make his rounds and will 
report to the minister, who in turn will report to both houses of 
parliament, but nobody knows what will happen after that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With all the scandals shaking up the government these days, it 
would have been nice if, while protecting the confidentiality of 
the research to be done, it had asked all parties to become its 
allies to avoid surprises. This government is beginning to have 
more than its share of scandals, but by involving other political 
parties, it could say “Look, if there are problems, it is 
parliament's fault and not the Liberal Party's fault”. There 
could have been a new way of doing things, but the government 
decided to keep on helping its friends. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We find that somewhat unfortunate. In the area of health and 
health research, which Quebecers, Ontarians and all Canadians 
believe is the most important, everybody could have been involved 
and could have worked together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, the members of the governing council will be 
appointed to hold office during pleasure, to use a phrase 
commonly found in bills. 
Members are appointed for three years, but during pleasure. In 
other words, they may be removed, if such is the pleasure of the 
governor in council or the Prime Minister. They will play 
musical chairs. It will be like a game of Monopoly where houses 
and hotels can easily be moved around. The membership of the 
governing council will be easy to change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was seen in government agencies. If someone dares to speak 
up and raise problems, they may removed in no time, unbeknownst 
to parliament. We find it unfortunate. Parliament has a 
constructive role to play. There are other very important 
points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is also a very complex bill. Reference was made to the role 
of the private sector. These last few years, Canada has become 
more open to the world because of free trade. 
Who was in office in the 1980s? Yes, indeed, it was a 
Conservative government, and this government implemented free 
trade. We have opened our business sectors to many more 
countries, particularly through free trade, but also under the 
World Trade Organization. It is important to bear that in mind 
when considering legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned the private sector's role. Clause 26 of the bill 
provides that the CIHR may enter into a partnership with other 
government or corporate bodies, including private corporations. 
One thing will have to be monitored very closely, however, and 
the auditor general will certainly do so: the CIHR may 
incorporate by itself a corporation. When an institute is 
independent from the government and may duplicate itself, this 
causes problems. 
All our questions may not get answered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to underestimate the people who will be there, but 
the bill states that the institute may enter into a partnership, 
or incorporate “by itself or with others a corporation, 
including a subsidiary”. It might decide to incorporate for a 
very specific purpose. This is dangerous, because we will lose 
contact with this institute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It may also enter into a partnership with governments. I may not 
be a legal expert, but I was reading the bill and it does say 
“with any other government”. Great. May it enter into a 
partnership with the United States, France or agencies from 
these countries? Perhaps. Is this desirable? Why not? But once 
again, what is the quality of the parliamentarians' 
relationship, the representatives of those who pay taxes?

<A HREF="#LINKT32"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These issues would not be raised if parliament were much more 
involved. With regard to the private sector, we will have to 
look into the structure of the institute to see how royalties 
and patent rights will be divided. If the institute may 
incorporate by itself, without coming under the direct control 
of the auditor general, if it may enter into a partnership with 
the private sector or with any other government inside or 
outside the country, to whom will patent and licence royalties 
belong? These are issues we will look at over time, but it would 
have been important, to reassure Canadians in general, that 
parliament played a much greater role in this sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My time is up. As I said earlier, we will support this bill, a 
bill that is 20 years late compared to other major countries. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK36"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to rise to make a few comments on what I believe to be 
a very important bill for Canada.  Bill C-13 seeks to establish 
the Canadian institutes of health research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By way of background so that hon. members will have an idea of 
some of the dynamics involved with the bill, the Canadian 
institutes of health research will create a series of institutes 
developed to link the research and health needs of Canadians.  It 
is a very important concept.  It means that we will make every 
effort to translate health research into health care for 
Canadians.  This will improve the functionality, efficiency and 
effectiveness of health care.  A very important principle is 
being espoused in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The institutes created under the Canadian institutes of health 
research will not be buildings.  They will not be institutes that 
have bricks and mortar.  In fact it is a virtual institute that 
will support the linking of researchers who may be located in 
universities, hospitals and other research centres to their 
colleagues in other institutions in other parts of the country 
and across all disciplines.  In today's society linking people, 
not physically but technologically and through our communications 
vehicles, is extremely important to expand upon the synergy 
available to us so that people can share ideas and work for the 
common good of all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A network of some 10 to 15 institutes will be established.  It 
will bring together the top research minds to bear on the most 
critical health challenges and priorities of Canadians.  There is 
no question at all that this is an important step for us to take. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the witnesses who appeared before the health committee 
described the institute as follows.  This was echoed by many 
witnesses, but I thought this was well put.  The witness said 
that this was a public body that would control millions of 
dollars, in fact about $500 million of research money, and would 
probably be “the most decisive institution in Canada with 
respect to the health of Canadians”.  Many other witnesses also 
said that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That should not be taken very lightly.  This is a very important 
bill.  Notwithstanding the fact that all parties in the House 
agree with the bill, they may have some concerns about some 
aspects of the administration of the bill.  In fact, no witnesses 
came before the health committee to argue against the creation of 
the Canadian institutes of health research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very significant.  This will be the replacement vehicle 
for the Medical Research Council, which heretofore has been 
responsible for the granting of research moneys.  We have to do 
this right, though.  That brings me to basically the theme I want 
to talk about in my comments:  who said other things at committee 
other than this is a great idea.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thought it was very interesting that many of the witnesses 
represented the who's who of health care and health care 
research.  They all came before the committee and they were 
talking about how important it was for their area of interest to 
be one of these new institutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to think about it for a while, but then we come to the 
conclusion that there are not enough institutes to provide for 
all people, all agencies and all groups in health research to 
have an institute.  In other words there will be winners and 
there will be losers.  That is an important aspect of the bill. 
As a result of the creation of these Canadian institutes of 
health research there will be losers.  The losers will be 
fighting viciously to make sure everything they can possibly do 
is done to get their health research area on the agenda of the 
Canadian institutes of health research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The very fact that there will be losers means that somebody's 
interest is not being addressed.  It could very well be the 
interest of Canadians.  It could be the interest of the broad 
majority of Canadians that may not be fully represented.  It is a 
possibility.  I do not anticipate that would be the case, but the 
fact is we will not be able to do everything through this new 
concept. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of other witnesses came before the committee that 
wanted to talk about the administration of the act which deals 
with the Canadian institutes of health research.  When we 
consider how so many had come before the committee and praised 
the creation of this new body, there were some who had some other 
observations and concerns.  Members should ask themselves why 
anyone would have concerns.  What is the motivation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some reasons.  It could very well be that what 
happened under the Medical Research Council was a situation that 
they were not happy with.  They did not want us to take one 
institution and roll it over into a new institution and be faced 
with the same kinds of frustrations or problems.  In fact some of 
those concerns were expressed.  We have to be honest.  As 
legislators we have to ask questions about why they are raising 
these issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The president and chief executive director of the Canadian 
Healthcare Association, Mrs. Sharon Sholsberg-Gray, said in her 
testimony: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To further strengthen this transparency and accountability, we 
recommended that Bill C-13 include the provision for a 
parliamentary review every five years.  Given what is at stake in 
terms of innovation, global competitiveness, the health of 
Canadians, the effectiveness of our health care system, and the 
enormous amounts of money that will be involved—we hope they'll 
be even larger amounts those predicted now—a regular 
parliamentary review seems necessary and appropriate.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a signal that something needs to be addressed.  Many of 
these agencies obviously have longstanding linkages with the 
health care system, with Health Canada, with the Medical Research 
Council and others.  They were obviously very cautious not to be 
critical, but in a very diplomatic way they were trying to raise 
issues which might suggest to legislators that we have to be 
careful about how we are doing this and to make sure that we get 
it right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was also an intervention by Dr. Mary Ellen Jeans of the 
Canadian Nurses Association who said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe the criteria for the selection for the proposed 
institutes, for their evaluation and monitoring, should be 
articulated in the legislation.  We'd encourage the addition of a 
parliamentary review process to ensure true accountability to 
Canadians.  We recommend that it take place very five years. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The theme comes up again.  In Dr. Jeans' response to some 
questions she referred to historical inequities and lack of 
balance in health research.  It is a question that has been posed 
to legislators to assess what happened and what is happening in 
the Medical Research Council, and what it is we want to ensure 
does not translate into the Canadian institutes of health 
research.  She said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mean, I would anticipate, five years from now, a significant 
increase in research that addresses caregiving, quality of life, 
relief of pain and other symptoms, coping with aging and chronic 
illnesses, and so on.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the vision of this group of caregivers, the Canadian 
Nurses Association.  She went on to say that we should see that 
vision being reflected in the mandate and the actions of the 
Canadian institute of health research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why they recommended a parliamentary review, so that 
they would have a place to go and tell legislators that they did 
not get it quite right and ask what changes could be made to make 
it right.  That is why review and evaluation are critical.  It 
was another reference to a concern about what has been going on 
historically and what should go on in the new institutes of 
health research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to look at this issue from the standpoint of whether or 
not there was sufficient opportunity for parliament to have a 
review.  Today the health critic of the Canadian Alliance rose to 
speak in favour of a five year review.  I was absolutely shocked 
because just last night when I rose to put that motion in the 
House and ask for a vote on it, the whip of the Canadian Alliance 
looked me straight in the eye and said no.  Unanimous consent was 
not granted by the Canadian Alliance, yet its health critic rose 
today and argued quite the opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to know why it is that members of the Canadian Alliance 
can play political games with the health care system of Canada in 
parliament.  Why can they not be consistent?  Why can they not 
stand and be consistent in terms of what they believe in?  If 
they believe in accountability and transparency, they should not 
have said no last night to the review by parliament.  Canadians 
should know that when it suits their purpose they play politics 
with important issues related to Canadians.  I think that is 
shameful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Report stage Motion No. 56, which I had put on the order paper 
and which was in order, was not moved during report stage.  The 
finance committee was meeting at the same time.  I sat in my 
place at the finance committee and was unable to be here to 
properly move that motion.  I came to the House during report 
stage debate, still having ample opportunity to put the motion on 
the table.  All parties at that point agreed to provide consent 
to allow me to move that motion, but members of the Bloc 
Quebecois said no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They said no for one simple reason, because my motion said that 
the review would be conducted by parliament.  As we know, 
parliament as defined includes the House of Commons and the 
Senate.  They withheld their unanimous consent to move this 
important motion related to accountability and transparency 
because they wanted me to amend the motion to exclude the Senate. 
They wanted me to say that the review would be done only by the 
House of Commons and not by the Senate, so I would have had to 
eliminate the word parliament to effectively exclude the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here again are politics coming into play.  I will not question 
the motivation of members of the Bloc Quebecois on why they 
wanted certain amendments.  I am a backbench member of 
parliament.  I came before the House to put a motion to amend the 
legislation so that the administration of the act dealt with the 
concern of witnesses and we would have a five year review of the 
administration of the act.  The health minister, after 
consultation over several weeks, finally agreed and we worked out 
a way to bring in the resolution in a manner that would be 
constructive and useful for parliament to add to accountability 
and transparency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ultimately the bottom line result was that the Canadian 
Alliance, known then as the Reform Party, and the Bloc Quebecois 
said no.  They both said no to transparency and accountability in 
parliament.  They then said no to Canadians with regard to 
supporting the health care system and supporting research.  It 
was all due to politics, and Canadians should know that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the review of report stage motions, and the critic for 
the New Democratic Party articulated this, a number of 
resolutions or suggestions were made on how to improve the bill. 
I thought there were some very interesting questions. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1300"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the bill the government will make order in council 
appointments to the Canadian institutes of health research, a 
governing body.  Because they are order in council appointees, 
they are subject to the conflict of interest guidelines for the 
public service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, clause 10 of Bill C-13 says that the governing council 
may establish by bylaw an executive committee and other 
committees of the governing council. It goes on in paragraph 2 to 
say that the bylaw establishing a committee other than an 
executive committee may provide for the committee's membership to 
include persons who are not members of the governing council.  In 
other words, in such an important body which will be responsible 
for about $500 million worth of health research expenditure, 
there will be people who are appointed by the governing council 
who in fact will not be covered by public service conflict of 
interest guidelines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was an important and valid discussion.  Generally in the 
terms of reference guiding the objectives and the operations of 
the governing council, certainly something like establishing 
conflict of interest guidelines for people who are not order in 
council appointees is an important element. I am sure they will 
do it. The request was to put it in specifically and I did not 
disagree.  It is on the record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure the governing council will understand because of the 
importance and the sensitivity of the institutes of health 
research, that these kinds of measures are needed.  Conflict of 
interest guidelines are needed to ensure that inappropriate 
actions are not taking place with regard to commercialization or 
special interest groups infiltrating committees by virtue of 
their lobbying of members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand that these people will be of the highest integrity. 
They will be the best in Canada, guiding the shaping of research 
in Canada.  They will be beyond reproach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about an enormous virtual institution that will 
be influenced daily.  If hon. members do not believe that those 
people will have any influence on the decisions, why is it that 
so many of them came before the health committee to lobby for one 
of the institutes to be for their special interest?  They came 
before the health committee for one reason, because they believe 
they have the opportunity to influence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should never risk exposing ourselves to undue influence 
particularly when it comes to matters of importance.  It is not 
debatable.  We have to make sure that all the tools are in place. 
When I conclude my speech I will outline how I feel that 
parliament will still have the levers, notwithstanding that we do 
not have a five year review. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill lays out for parliament and Canadians what the 
governing council will do.  The call was that health research 
objectives, priorities, et cetera should not be tied up with the 
legislators.  They should be independent and at arm's length to 
make sure that our health care givers, those who are involved in 
the science of research and development in our health care 
system, are the ones who will measure the priorities and the 
importance to Canadians and develop a vision that will not be 
driven by political interests.  That is why it will operate at 
arm's length. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the buzzwords of some of the governing council's 
objectives:  to exercise leadership; to create a robust health 
research environment; to forge an integrated health research 
agenda; to encourage disciplinary integration in our health 
research; to promote and assist in undertaking research that 
meets the highest international scientific standards; to address 
emerging health opportunities; to foster the discussion of 
ethical issues; to promote the dissemination of knowledge; to 
encourage innovation; to build the capacity of the Canadian 
health research community; to pursue opportunities providing 
support for the participation of Canadian science and 
international collaboration; and to ensure transparency and 
accountability generally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The governing council will have the opportunity to run its own 
show.  But as I said, we need to make sure that the vision of the 
governing council of the Canadian institutes of health research 
is compatible and consistent with the needs of Canadians and with 
the objectives and the visions of all the stakeholders in health 
care in Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We already have mechanisms in place.  In January 1999 the Public 
Policy Forum published a proposed governing structure for the 
Canadian institutes of health research in anticipation of the 
importance of this to Canadians.  This might be the most 
important institution driving the health care agenda in Canada. 
We need to think about the governance model. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Health is going to be the primary lead on this 
matter in terms of accountability to parliament.  The Canadian 
institutes of health research are going to be responsible to the 
Parliament of Canada. The minister has the opportunity to make or 
to cancel the order in council appointments. The auditor general 
is going to do an annual review. His report will include tests of 
economy, efficiency and effectiveness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report also recommended a five year review and appearance 
before committees.  We do have the annual review of the 
estimates.  I believe committees will have the opportunity to 
have the chair of the governing council come before them to talk 
about the success the Canadian institutes of health research have 
had in meeting the health care objectives of Canada and of all 
Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, before asking my 
question, I would like to set the member who has just spoken 
straight on a few points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He talked about moving Motion No. 56. First, he was not in the 
House. Second, he had presented the wording to our House leader, 
who had agreed to its being moved, even in the member's absence, 
on condition that certain words be changed.  Third, after the 
motion was discussed or debated and brought forward with 
unanimous consent, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister 
of Health arrived with a proposal to again amend what had been 
agreed on with the member who has just spoken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, when he accuses the Bloc Quebecois of playing political 
games in this connection, I think he is showing obvious bad 
faith. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the bill itself—and this is my question—when the president 
of the governing council of an institute of health research is 
also the organization's president—even an ordinary caisse 
populaire does not make this kind of mistake and the director of 
the board of directors of a caisse populaire is never the 
caisse's director because of the potential conflict of interest—I 
would say the government would do better not to present its bill 
as the best thing since sliced bread. 
In my opinion, it should—and this was suggested by the member for 
Hochelaga—Maisonneuve in one of his many proposals—separate the 
functions of president of the governing council and president of 
the organization. There is no need to look very far; it is 
immediately obvious.  This is something that is open to 
criticism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What can the member say about this without getting into 
political games?  I would remind him that we are in parliament 
and that we are just as entitled to express our views as he is. 
I would point out to him that 66% of Canadians did not vote for 
the Liberal Party of Canada in the last election. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo:</B>  Mr. Speaker, let me refer the member to 
Motion No. 56. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member knows that I had to leave the Chamber and go up to 
the Bloc House leader's office on the fifth floor to discuss this 
matter.  The member was not there.  I will not breach our 
conversation and relate it to the House.  All I can say is that a 
proposal was agreed upon as to how we would deal with it in terms 
of getting consent.  The member also knows that I can only move 
my own motion, I cannot amend it. 
Another member is responsible for delivering that amendment. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1310"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT37"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I came back to the House and got the consent of the parties to 
move the motion. Subsequently the member who was to move the 
amendment was not able to move the amendment in the form that the 
Bloc had it. There was no way to undo that other than to do the 
right thing which is exactly what I did.  I rose in my place and 
asked for the unanimous consent of the House to withdraw the 
motion because I could not deliver on the deal.  I did that.  I 
wanted the motion badly and I think the House wanted the motion 
badly, but unfortunately as a backbench member of parliament I 
could not be running between the fifth floor and the lobby to 
figure out the deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish that rather than playing politics the parties would get 
together on matters of importance to ensure that we understand 
what is in the best interests of Canadians. I found it 
disgusting. I was very sad to see that politics overrode the best 
interests of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the member's comments, I understand the points. 
We do not have time to debate it. I can say I have done my best 
as a parliamentarian to assess whether conflict of interest 
situations could arise and whether there was a control mechanism. 
I assure the member and all Canadians that I have satisfied 
myself as a member of the health committee and as a member of 
parliament that mechanisms are in place that are sufficiently 
appropriate to ensure there will be no reasonable possibility of 
any conflict of interest without parliamentarians knowing about 
it and having the tools to deal with it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK38"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is certainly my privilege to talk about why we support the 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The previous speaker said that the health critic for the 
Canadian Alliance was guilty of some charge or other.  I would 
inform the House that I am the health critic for the Canadian 
Alliance and that I have not spoken today about any issue.  I 
would ask the member to clarify that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is rather interesting and rather amazing to hear the— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The member has just raised the matter that his party member did 
not speak.  The Canadian Alliance spoke second in this debate. 
If he would check the blues, he would see his information is 
incorrect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I do not think that is a point of 
order.  I think it is a matter of debate but the point has been 
made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we do not need to debate 
this.  The fact is he did suggest the critic for the Canadian 
Alliance and I was just straightening him out on that item. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is amazing to hear the double-talk from the member about how 
we should not play partisan politics.  If anyone is playing 
partisan politics with health care I believe it is the member 
himself in his comments in the tirade he was on.  Canadians are 
sick and tired of playing politics with the health care issue. 
Health care is too important to people to play partisan politics 
with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to clarify the position of the Canadian Alliance. We 
are opposed to two tier U.S. for profit health care.  We believe 
in universal health care for Canadians as all Canadians do.  At 
no point has anyone in this party advocated two tier for profit 
health care where there is one system of health care for the rich 
and another for the poor.  We are opposed to that and will 
continue to be opposed to that. Canadians are opposed to that. It 
is important that Canadians hear that firsthand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To talk about the issue at hand, Bill C-13, the main thing is 
that we are creating research, we are creating an organization 
which will provide think-tanks and research which is so essential 
to improve our health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians tell us there is something wrong.  The status quo of 
health care is not acceptable and it is not sustainable.  We have 
to fix that problem.  We have to do it in an unemotional, 
intelligent and scientific way. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1315"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the message which all of us as parliamentarians should 
be getting.  This bill does that.  It provides us with an 
opportunity for research to flourish in the country.  For that 
reason it is important that all parties support it because the 
widening of research is important to us in the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to look at what the bill attempts to accomplish. 
There are some things lacking which should be pointed out.  The 
themes of the health research will involve basic biomedical 
research.  In that area, in talking to some of the scientists who 
are working on things like reproductive technology and gene 
therapy, we have not seen anything yet in terms of what will be 
possible in the future to help provide a healthier, longer living 
Canadian citizen, someone who could have a quality of life far 
better and longer than ever before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The application of clinical research, as well, is a theme of 
this research project, and the use of clinical research at the 
bedside has to be critical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third item concerns research on health care systems and 
services. We have to look around the world to see the changes 
that have occurred.  We cannot stay with the 1960s, socialized, 
state run, health care system.  There are countries which have 
done that, but unfortunately they are not at the top of the list 
and would include countries like North Korea and Cuba. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should be doing much better than that and research into 
advanced technology is one way to do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Society, culture, the health of populations and preventive 
medicine are but a few of the many things which would provide for 
a healthier Canadian.  We must also be very conscious of the 
demographics.  Today one in ten Canadians is over the age of 65. 
In 26 years, one in five Canadians will be over the age of 65. 
The implications of that spell out the need for research and the 
need to improve the quality of life for people over 65.  It is a 
major concern and something on which a great deal of research 
needs to be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A great many people told our committee what should happen.  Of 
course, my associate was part of that and has forwarded much of 
what was said in the committee hearings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The thing that struck me most came from Dr. Peter Vaughan, who 
is the CEO and secretary general of the Canadian Medical 
Association.  We might itemize several of the things he said and 
think about what they mean. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, he said it is very important to transfer research from 
the lab bench to the bedside.  Strictly doing theoretical 
research is one thing, but actually improving the quality of 
health care with that research is quite another.  To have this as 
an aim of the institutes is most important and should not be 
underestimated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said that we must focus on outcomes.  The ultimate goal of 
the Canadian health care system is to improve health status and 
health outcomes for Canadians.  One area where this needs to be 
addressed in particular is in the field of health services 
research, which is often restricted to either short timeframes 
which limit the ability to observe health outcomes or to the use 
of administrative data which more typically measures outputs 
rather than outcomes.  It is important that we listen when a 
professional tells us the focus that we should be putting on this 
particular agency. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1320"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT39"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the capacity for building, he said that the CIHR 
could play a key role in reversing the brain drain.  Retaining 
and repatriating our health researchers will improve Canadians' 
access to quality care within our national medicare program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must recognize the fact that half of our graduates in the 
medical field leave this country.  The average age of a 
specialist in Canada is 59 years.  It takes 14 years to become a 
specialist, from the time that person begins as a student until 
he or she is able to treat patients. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is essential that we keep well trained individuals in our 
country.  It is important as well that we increase the number of 
courses for specialists, rather than the trend which has gone on 
for some 10 to 20 years in which universities have cut the number 
of students allowed into various specialty areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an example, I have a daughter, about whom I will brag a bit. 
She is finishing her Ph.D. in Holland.  She went looking for a 
job.  She will graduate this spring.  She had nine job offers, 
four of which were from Canada.  One of them was at the 
University of Western Ontario.  They offered her a position in 
which she could teach 80% of the time, mostly first year 
students, and she could do research on the side.  To our 
disappointment, she accepted an offer from Germany. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She chose that offer because the job will give her 100% 
research.  She will be working in a university which emphasizes 
the importance of research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously in Canada we have to become more attuned to those 
professionals who want to do research.  This agency should help, 
and that is a positive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fourth item that Dr. Vaughan suggested was that we need 
balance.  He stated: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—we recognize the need to work with others to improve the health 
of the population by addressing the determinants of health, 
including social, lifestyle and physical environmental factors. 
The need for this balance is underscored by the persistent social 
inequalities in health in Canada and other industrialized 
countries— 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously that looks at the big picture, at all of the things 
that influence the health of Canadians.  These institutes will 
address that concern, and that is extremely important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fifth, he said that we must be internationally competitive. 
According to the OECD, and we have said this a number of times, 
Canada spends only one-third as much per capita on health 
research as any of the other G-7 countries, such as France, the 
United Kingdom, the U.S. and so on.  It is to be hoped that the 
enactment of the CIHR legislation would help to change that 
significantly less funding which exists in Canada and has existed 
for a number of years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the reasons we can support the bill.  It is a step 
forward in providing us with that research base which is so 
essential. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must also look at other factors.  While we support the bill 
and we see the bill as a step forward, we also have to show some 
concerns.  We have to look at keeping the issue of research in a 
non-political environment.  We have to be conscious of the turf 
wars that are so much a part of our health care system.  That 
goes right down to the researchers in the lab.  We have to make 
these non-political, non-partisan, non-turf war institutes.

<A HREF="#LINKT40"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have concerns about whether the federal government could 
keep this in a non-partisan sort of format, or whether it could 
keep from tampering with research and approving some projects 
based on reasons other than merit.  It seems most critical that 
merit should be the only reason research is funded and supported 
by these institutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, we must examine the Canada Health Act.  It is extremely 
important to realize how seriously flawed our Canada Health Act 
is as it exists today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talk about accessibility.  The Canadian health care system is 
not accessible.  People wait three or four months, or longer, to 
see a specialist.  That is not accessibility.  Over 200,000 
Canadians are on waiting lists. That is not accessibility. People 
are going to the United States for treatment.  That is not an 
accessible health care system.  We need to research that to see 
how it could be fixed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I emphasize that we have to work with the provinces and not 
hammer them with an outdated Canada Health Act.  We need to 
modernize it and work with them in a co-operative manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as it being portable, ask someone from Quebec who ends up 
in another province and needs treatment.  Ask the people from 
Quebec what they are told when they enter that hospital.  They 
are told that the Quebec system does not cover them when they are 
outside the province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ask about it being comprehensive.  Look at the many areas which 
are not covered by medicare as we know it today.  Each year more 
and more things are delisted.  What do Canadians expect from 
their health care system?  What do they want included and what do 
they want taken out? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have already addressed the area of universality.  I think that 
all Canadians want and would be proud of a universal health care 
system to which every Canadian would have access.  That is what 
the Canadian Alliance wants.  I believe that is what Canadians 
want.  I think that is what the Liberals might want as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The final area is public administration.  We have all kinds of 
problems there.  The ownership of the actual bricks and mortar is 
not the main emphasis, but it is something that should be looked 
at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There should be a sixth point, and that should be results.  Are 
we getting results from our health care system?  Is it working 
for Canadians?  What do Canadians think about that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We listened to the Prime Minister say that the status quo of 
health care would be maintained.  That is exactly what Canadians 
do not want to hear.  They do not want the status quo because it 
is not working.  It is not sustainable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We often refer to Liberal members as the Jack Kevorkians of the 
Canada Health Act.  They have not funded the system adequately. 
They have cut $25 billion from health care.  Sure, they put $13 
billion back, but they cut much more dramatically than ever 
before and they left the provinces to go their own way.  If the 
provinces try something new the Liberals slam them with the 
Canada Health Act, the very act which they have not bothered to 
improve, fix or reform since the 1960s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I would say that we will support this bill.  In 
terms of research, we must do it.  We are 23rd out of 29 OECD 
countries in terms of technology in health care.  The health care 
system is broken and needs to fixed.  All Canadians want it to be 
fixed.  The federal government needs to provide the leadership 
and work with the provinces to make this happen.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wonder if the 
hon. member for Red Deer could give us his views on how this 
research should be managed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a problem in the short term. Everyone agrees that the 
provinces do not have the resources they need to deliver health 
care, but our health problems require immediate solutions. The 
research institutes that the government wants to set up and 
support could pursue other objectives in the longer term. 
Indeed, the health of people requires long term planning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know how the hon. member suggests this problem 
might be resolved? Does he think that investing in research is 
an immediate solution? If so, how? If not, how does he think the 
most urgent problems could be resolved in the short term, while 
ensuring that the health of all Canadian and Quebec taxpayers 
will be protected in the long term, this time by emphasizing 
prevention? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the hon. member tell us how he thinks these two objectives 
might be reconciled? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from 
Joliette for his question.  He has raised several important 
points, the first one being the need for long term funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is essential that when doing research one is not inhibited by 
grants that are there for one year and may not be there for the 
next year.  Research is not an exact process and one needs to 
know there is sustainable funding in the research area.  I think 
that applies here more than anywhere else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Researchers do not know when they will find a cure for whatever 
it is they are looking for.  To know they have the support and 
the long term commitment of parliament is critical.  I think that 
should be written in.  It is something that can be strengthened 
in this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another item of equal importance is the administration of 
research.  More important, we should get to the nuts and bolts 
and say that the provinces are partners in this research.  All 
the provinces are working with the federal government to provide 
research for all Canadians.  This is why I emphasize the lack of 
partisan politics in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is to be hoped that the administration will not fall victim 
to the things we have seen in HRDC and many other areas, because 
that will do more to hurt us as Canadians and to hurt our 
position.  When we are 23rd out of 29 OECD countries, it is not a 
very favourable position to be in terms of our technological 
advancements.  We need to improve dramatically. Co-operation in 
this whole area will be critical for it to be successful. 
<P><A NAME="LINK40"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member for Red Deer 
mentioned partisan debate and partisan politics.  I am sure there 
are times when all of us in the House are engaged in partisan 
debates and we use statistics to perhaps stretch our position or 
stretch the facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard the member for Red Deer and his colleague earlier.  I 
also heard the Reform-Conservative Premier of Ontario talk about 
the transfers to the provinces for health care.  The member 
opposite also talked about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the facts, they are clear.  The federal government 
has restored the transfers to the provinces under the CHST to a 
new level of $31 billion at a time when federal government 
expenditure has been reduced by $4 billion compared to 1993. That 
is the direct program delivery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the member for Red Deer face his constituents with the 
facts he has presented in the House, when the facts are clearly 
not what he speaks?  How can he justify saying that in the House 
of Commons?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills:</B>  Mr. Speaker, let us go through the numbers 
and we can round them off if the member would like. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993-94 the money transferred for health care and education 
amounted to $18.8 billion.  In 1994-95, $18.7 billion; 1995-96, 
$18.5 billion; 1996-97, $14.8 billion; 1997-98, $12.5 billion; 
1998-99, $12.5 billion; 1999-2000, $14.5 billion; and now for the 
next four years, $15.5 billion.  If we went back to the level and 
kept it frozen at $18.8 billion from 1993 to the year 2004, the 
total would be $36 billion less than what would have been 
transferred had the government just frozen it at the 1993 level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is very simple mathematics but obviously Liberal 
mathematics is quite different from pure numbers.  Those are the 
facts and for whatever reason the Liberals do not want to 
recognize them. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK41"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
following this debate with great interest. I remember that 
initially the federal government was to support 50% of the 
costs relating to health, while each province supported the 
other 50%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today the federal government pays barely over 10%. It has 
reduced its involvement. If we look at its track record in a 
number of programs we can see a pattern where the federal 
government establishes programs and then withdraws from them, 
thus passing the buck to the provincial governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have the same concern regarding the bill before us. The 
government is taking initiatives that will have universities and 
research centres buy equipment and train researchers. One 
day the funding these people need for their research may just 
stop. This means that these researchers would have to go looking 
for other research centres, possibly abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if our colleague from the Canadian Alliance could give 
us his views on this. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is a very real concern. 
Obviously, when we went into the whole medicare issue and the 
Canada Health Act, the agreement was that the federal government 
would provide 50% of the funding.  For that it got control, 
making sure that the provinces lived by the Canada Health Act. 
That was a good deal for everyone.  The provinces received 
financial assistance and Canadians got a health care system of 
which they could be proud. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is that the federal government is now giving 13% to 
Alberta instead of 50%.  Some other provinces are getting 
slightly more if other figures are taken into consideration.  The 
important thing that also needs to be mentioned is that the $580 
billion debt on which we pay some $40 billion a year in interest 
payments is also a very major factor in cutting funding for 
health care and for many other projects.  Let us think of what we 
could do with $40 billion in any one of these programs, or even 
part of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is fine to say we will start the program and fund it for the 
next three years but, as the member pointed out, if they drop out 
after that, research will stop, those scientists will be lost to 
us forever and we will not attract any kind of research in this 
country.  That will put us even deeper into the hole and we will 
go from 23rd out of 29 to who knows where. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would simply like to add 
a few words to my earlier remarks in order to have my Canadian 
Alliance colleague comment further. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Tokamak project, it will be recalled, was, and I describe it 
in the past tense, a project involving a thermonuclear fusion 
reactor located in Varennes.  Funding for this project was shared 
jointly by the federal government and the Government of Quebec. 
The federal government decided two years ago to withdraw from the 
project.  Naturally, Quebec could not assume funding for the 
entire project on its own.

<A HREF="#LINKT43"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>So this second generation reactor, which was on the leading 
edge of technology, will have to be sold at a loss somewhere else 
in the world.  This is a dead loss of some $150 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know what my colleague thinks of this dangerous 
precedent. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills:</B>  Mr. Speaker, if we worked on it a bit, we 
could come up with an awful lot of burnt out projects like the 
ones that have been started, where the building was built, the 
funding stopped and the project collapsed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That comes from a lack of long term planning.  That is one of 
the reasons Canadians have so little confidence in government. 
Whether it is building ferries that do not float, whether it is 
nuclear projects or whether it is the Avro Arrow, if we want to 
go back in history, there all kinds of examples of where the 
Canadian government has not continued its funding long enough to 
reap the rewards.  Again the member is totally right.  It is a 
major concern. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK42"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski—Mitis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise to speak on Bill C-13, which we are debating 
today in at third reading.  Let us keep in mind that the purpose 
of this bill is to officially create the Canadian institutes of 
health research, which will be mandated to organize, 
co-ordinate and fund health research at the federal government 
level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government, while constantly faulting other 
governments for gaining their ends through devious means, has 
taken an approach in this matter which lets it off the hook in a 
way.  It has appointed an interim committee council 
comprised of 34 members from the scientific and academic 
communities.  That committee council worked for some weeks on 
the definition and operation of these institutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Far be it for me to cast doubt on the competency of these 
individuals to fulfil the mandate assigned to them, which is to 
organize, co-ordinate and fund health research in Canada.  The 
federal government most certainly did not tell them “Take 
care above all in fulfilling your mandate not to overstep the 
jurisdictional boundaries of Quebec and the provinces”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Simply put, the Canadian institutes of health research will replace 
the Medical Research Council and will have a broader research 
mandate.  They will make it possible for there to be new ways of 
doing research on biomedical themes but also on matters more 
directly related to the social sciences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We now know that these will be virtual institutes and will, 
first and foremost, facilitate the exchange of information. 
Researchers in universities, hospitals and the other research 
centres across Canada will all be linked on a computer network. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mission of the institutes includes some interesting and 
innovative aspects.  There are some new concepts involved here, 
and many say that Bill C-13 constitutes a first in the history of 
health-related bills as far as ethics are concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Final decisions on the institutes to be created have not yet 
been made.  The interim task forcecouncil has, however, proposed 
some themes around which the institutes might be formed. 
Some examples are aging, arthritis, cancer, molecular biology, 
the health of children and mothers, health services, clinical 
evaluation and technology assessment, heart disease, strokes, 
and so on. So far, officials estimate they have received close 
to 150 applications for grants that will eventually result in 
the creation of these institutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill emphasizes the need for integrated health research, 
with co-operation between the groups, organizations and 
governments now responsible for research, an important component. 
The approach is clearly multidisciplinary.  In addition, 
because the bill does not specify any particular type of 
institute, the permanent council will have its hands free to 
create whatever kinds of institutes it wishes. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1345"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT44"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One advantage of this is that it will allow the council to be 
flexible and to change its priorities quickly in response to the 
changing nature of society and to rapid innovation in the field 
of research.  This is a positive approach and is consistent with 
the recommendations of the OECD, which since 1993 has been 
asking Canada to increase its investment in research and 
development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget brought down by the Minister of Finance in February 
1999 forecast a budget of $65 million for CIHR in its first year 
of operation.  In 2000-01, this amount will be increased by $175 
million in order to create between 10 and 15 institutes of 
health research in Canada. 
With the base budgets already allocated to the Medical Research 
Council, the government now anticipates that it will double its 
funding, over a three year period, and that the funds for 
Canadian institutes of health research will total $500 million 
in 2001-2002. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government set an extremely tight deadline and is trying to 
rush us so that this bill is passed as quickly as possible. As 
for researchers, the government made them believe that April 1, 
2000 was a likely date for the coming into effect of this 
legislation. Therefore, it is not surprising that researchers 
really want the permanent governing council of the institutes of 
health research to begin its work on April 1, 2000, while hoping 
the government will not play tricks on April Fools' Day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once bitten twice shy, as the old saying goes. It is easy to see 
that, over the past 20 or 30 years, Quebec did not get its fair 
share of federal funds for research and development, given its 
demographic weight. On average, depending on the year, Quebec 
received between 14% and 18% of the federal funds for research 
and development. This is still the case today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois fully supports the federal government's 
intention to significantly increase funds for health research, 
since that sector of activity is a fundamental one. We will 
closely monitor the distribution of these funds, to ensure that 
Quebec gets its share. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois supports increased funding for research and 
development.  It also recognizes the efforts of the researchers 
who were closely involved in the drafting of the bill so they 
could have innovative equipment to improve the dissemination of 
information in the field of health and to be able to develop 
state of the art technologies in health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we cannot ignore the fact that Bill C-13, as it is 
drafted, seriously infringes on the jurisdiction of Quebec and 
the provinces in health care.  The bill refers, in several 
locations, to “issues pertaining to health”, without ever 
recognizing the responsibility to the public of Quebec and the 
provinces in the field of health services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the government boasting about imposing clarity on others, 
the Minister of Health should have made sure his bill referred 
simply to health research and not to the health care system and 
to services provided the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And yet, throughout it, the 
bill refers not simply to health research but uses the more 
general issues pertaining to health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec and the provinces are in fact nothing more than 
ordinary players, like the people and organizations with an 
interest in health.  The federal government gives national 
mandates to the institutes without involving the Government of 
Quebec or of the provinces in this process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois pointed this out at all stages of the bill. 
The Bloc Quebecois supports the bill in principle, but cannot 
support it as it is currently written. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us make no mistake.  It is not the creation of the 
institutes that is the problem.  Research and development falls 
under the category of residual powers and therefore, in theory, 
comes under federal jurisdiction.  The Bloc Quebecois can live 
with the fact so long as Quebec is a part of Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where the problem lies, and it is a serious one at that, is that 
this bill makes it possible for direct infringement on an area 
under Quebec jurisdiction, health services to the public, 
without any prior consultation of Quebec and the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to remedy this major problem, the Bloc Quebecois has 
proposed a series of amendments which were mainly aimed at 
emphasizing the importance of respecting jurisdictional 
divisions and at reaffirming the primacy of provincial 
jurisdiction over federal jurisdiction in the area of health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Research and development investments are necessary, and much 
desired in the hospital and academic research communities. 
Moreover, a number of Quebec coalitions have made applications 
for funding to the secretariat of the CIHR's interim council. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also important for Quebec to receive its fair share of 
federal R and D funding.  The Bloc Quebecois is in favour of stepped 
up investments in research, particularly health research.  In 
recent years Quebec has been heavily disadvantaged in this area 
and it is high time that the federal government remedied the 
situation by making available to researchers and universities 
additional funding to facilitate their research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Needless to say, the Bloc Quebecois is not opposed to this 
government's increasing R  and D budgets through the creation of 
virtual institutes.  This is why we support in principle the 
creation of these institutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important for Quebec to receive its fair share of federal 
funding, especially since we know that historically Quebec 
receives but 14% of federal R and D funding, as far as 
infrastructures are concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is, however, important to note that Quebec receives about 30% 
of funding to researchers when there is peer review.  Clearly, 
since clarity is something this government is fond of, when 
funding is awarded according to criteria which take merit into 
consideration Quebec researchers have no problem holding their 
own in a competition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although increased research funding is necessary, it is 
important to point out that, by creating the Canadian institutes 
of health research, the Canadian government is clearly 
appropriating the power to impose its priorities and its 
convictions in the health field, far beyond research per se. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, we know that the Quebec government is currently 
developing a scientific policy and that it has stressed the 
importance of certain areas where Quebec researchers excel, 
including mental health, cancer, the genome and biotechnology. 
The federal government must respect the specificity and 
strengths of Quebec researchers so as to benefit from their 
success and expertise in their respective fields. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we salute the multidisciplinary vision of Bill 
C-13, it is unacceptable that nothing was done to ensure that the 
provinces have a say and truly participate, including in the 
definition of mandates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois is not opposed to better communications 
between researchers or to better networking to facilitate 
dialogue and the transfer of information. 
However, we cannot endorse standards that would be imposed right 
across Canada, and we cannot support any intrusion in the 
jurisdictions of Quebec and the other provinces. Therefore, it 
is critical to ensure that the Canadian institutes of health and 
research not infringe on the jurisdictions of Quebec and the 
other provinces, and that Quebec be a full fledged partner in 
the selection and management of these institutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's bill ignores the division of powers between 
Canada and Quebec and the other provinces. For the Bloc 
Quebecois, it was important that this bill be about health 
research and not a possible broadening of mandates beyond 
research activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois wanted to make sure that the decisions about 
the choices and the principles underlying health networks and 
services provided to the public be under the exclusive control 
of Quebec and the other provinces. 
Without watering down the content of Bill C-13, it would have 
been possible to draft a bill that would have respected the 
division of powers between the various levels of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By refusing to propose such a measure, the Liberal government is 
denying the very principle of federalism. Respect for Quebec's 
jurisdictions must be at the core of any intervention in the 
health sector and this is why the Bloc Quebecois is in the 
unfortunate position of having to oppose this bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, for the benefit of those brave enough to be 
following the debate, I repeat that despite its feigned concern 
with health-related issues, the government unilaterally and 
irresponsibly pulled out of health care funding in 1993 when it 
introduced its Canada health and social transfer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is all very laudable for the federal government to now invest 
more in research, but it must not lose sight of the need to 
restore transfer payments to the provinces. CIHR must not be a 
way for the federal government to interfere in provincial 
jurisdictions while ignoring its responsibility for the shameful 
cuts it has made to date and for those that provincial 
governments will still have to contend with until 2003. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government must not turn a blind eye to the 
difficult situations which the provinces are facing in health 
care and for which it is directly responsible.  Estimates are 
that Quebec will be $1.7 billion short in social transfers in 
1999-2000.  Of this amount, Quebec has been deprived of close to 
$850 million annually since 1993.  For health alone, therefore, 
we are talking about a cumulative loss of close to $3.4 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government can always stick its head in the sand or 
haughtily decline to step into the fray, but there is absolutely 
no doubt that it would have done better to have respected the 
jurisdictions of the various levels of government in establishing

choose the institutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly, although clause 5(<I>c</I>) provides that the institutes 
shall consult other parties, including the provinces, for

was the second anniversary of the health minister's plan to 
compensate these people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the status of the compensation plan?  To date, the

the money?  Well, the lawyers have been paid.  What a sad excuse 
for compassionate health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two years ago the Liberal government made a personal commitment 
to Joey Haché on behalf of all hep C victims.  However, people 
infected with this incurable disease have seen no compensation 
and no apology.  The only action the government has been 
consistent with is its failure to honour its obligations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For each day the federal government continues to stall on this 
issue, more hep C victims are dying and losing their personal 
dignity.  Not only has the government treated these people 
poorly, it has completely dismissed all other victims who did not 
fall into its arbitrary 1986 to 1999 window.  How callous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of all hep C victims, the Canadian Alliance will 
continue to hold this government accountable for its inaction 
regarding compensation.  The government ought to be ashamed of

refers to them.

being a conservative, the case would not be thrown out for lack 
of evidence.

that government officials were wary of funding these projects all 
along. They said, “Analysts from financial institutions are very 
critical as to the profitability of the project”. But the Prime 
Minister pressed on.  After HRD officials had a discussion with 
the Prime Minister's office, the TJF grant was upped to $15,000 
per job.  That was $5,000 more than even the provincial 
government recommended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did the Prime Minister think that he knew better in this case,

deserved the opportunity to be employed in this area of la 
Mauricie. We are very glad, as I pointed out, to indicate that 28 
people are now working.  In fact the average cost per job is 
about $10,000 which is in concert with the recommendation of the 
province of Quebec.

could have the great Canadian boondoggle museum.  There could be 
model canoes, armouries, fountains, security roads, golf courses 
and maybe sell figurines of René Fugère and Gilles Champagne. 
There could be weekly seminars entitled “My Time at the Trough: 
A Liberal Retrospective”.  Of course we know there is no 
shortage of accommodation for the out of towners.

it would find that this project, Le Baluchon, has been recognized 
by the provincial authorities as the best tourist project. It is 
visited by thousands of people and it is creating more jobs than 
expected.  They are expanding all the time. They have made 
another application to expand because it is a very good 
operation.  I am very proud that people now can visit the 
Saint-Maurice valley and enjoy the beauty of this great part of 
Canada.

approved at $15,000 per job. This is precisely the sort of 
interference that HRDC officials have been complaining about in 
their radio ads. Moreover, after the interest free loans from 
Canada Economic Development were included, the cost per job shot 
up to $20,600, exactly the type of problem that CED audits warned 
about.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We have built our health care system on the principle, on the 
dream that health care would be there for Canadians when they 
need it regardless of their financial circumstances and 
regardless of where they happen to live. Canadians are rallying 
here on Parliament Hill behind that dream because the federal 
government has walked away from the health care partnership, has 
failed to enforce the Canada Health Act and has actively 
encouraged privatization.

the provincial governments because they were not respecting the 
five conditions of medicare was the government of today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said very clearly to Premier Klein that he has to respect the 
five conditions of medicare.  He told me that he wants to respect

</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the Prime Minister pretend that the universal, not for 
profit, public health care system is healthy?  Tell that to 
patients who are forced to pay $4,000 for routine eye surgery. 
Tell that to patients who are paying $400 an hour to get access

the government has already demonstrated its commitment to the

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>STANDING COMMITTEE ON CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION—SPEAKER'S 
RULING 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK175"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I am now prepared to rule on the 
question of privilege raised by the hon. member for London North 
Centre on Friday, March 17, 2000.  I would like to thank the 
member for having drawn this matter to the attention of the 
House.  I would also like to than the hon. member for Lakeland, 
the hon. government House leader and other members for their 
assistance in bringing the facts of this situation before the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for London North Centre, who chairs the Standing 
Committee on Citizenship and Immigration, indicated that the hon. 
member for Lakeland had, in his opinion, breached the privileges 
of all members by the premature disclosure of a draft report from 
the committee.  This disclosure was made by way of a press 
conference which the hon. member for Lakeland held on March 16 
using facilities provided by parliament after issuing a media 
advisory using CPAC and the internal communication services of 
the House.  Subsequently, the charges against the hon. member for 
Lakeland were repeated in the first report of the citizenship and 
immigration committee tabled on March 21. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In responding to these charges on March 21, the hon. member for 
Lakeland raised a number of issues.  He pointed out that there 
had been a deliberate decision of the committee at its meeting of 
March 2 to undertake the study of its draft report on refugee 
determination and illegal immigrants in public session.  A motion 
to that effect can be found in the committee's minutes of 
proceedings of that date.  The hon. member held that, while the 
meetings at which the draft report was considered may have 
actually been held in camera, the in camera nature of the meeting 
itself was contrary to an express decision of the committee.  In 
protesting what he took to be an irregular proceeding of the 
committee, he made reference to an earlier ruling of the Chair 
given on October 9, 1997, in which all committees were cautioned 
that care is necessary in laying out the manner in which draft 
reports will be dealt with. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say, first, that it is not the role of the Speaker to 
oversee the internal conduct of committees. Committees are 
masters of their own proceedings, and with that freedom goes the 
responsibility to see that they carry out their work in 
conformity with the appropriate rules and practices of this 
House.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Lakeland may well have a legitimate 
grievance with the manner in which the citizenship and 
immigration committee has conducted its affairs. However, when 
members disagree with decisions made by committee chairs, either 
tacitly or explicitly, our rules provide avenues either to 
appeal those decisions or to air those concerns openly in the 
committee before colleagues. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a different role to play.  When a committee feels that a 
situation is so irregular that it must be reported to the House 
then this is where I am called on.  As I mentioned earlier, a 
report on this incident was tabled by the chairman of the 
citizenship and immigration committee on March 21.  The hon. 
member for Lakeland has stated that he quite consciously and 
deliberately held a press conference for the purpose of making 
public the contents of the draft report.  He felt that he was 
entitled to take such action because the document was discussed 
by the committee during a meeting which he believed ought 
properly to have been a public meeting.  Nonetheless, the minutes 
of the proceedings of the committee for March 16, 2000 clearly 
indicate that the meeting was held in camera.  Similarly, the 
Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration rejects the 
member's view for its states unequivocally in its first report: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The members of the committee considered the matter...and felt 
that their privileges had been breached and that the in camera 
process had been jeopardized because of the disclosure by the 
member for Lakeland, Alberta. 
</UL>
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Speaker, I am not called upon to judge the manner in which 
the committee reversed its earlier decision and, since the 
committee has seen fit to report this incident to the House, 
then I, as Speaker, I must take very seriously the committee's 
complaint. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our rules are clear on the matter of the divulgation of a draft 
report.  At page 884 of <I>House of Commons Procedure and 
Practice</I> members will find the following statement of 
principle: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Committee reports must be presented to the House before they can 
be released to the public. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is further stated on the same page: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even when a report is adopted in public session, the report 
itself is considered confidential until it has actually been 
presented in the House. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Chair appreciates that this rule may, at times, prove 
inconvenient to some hon. members or to committees themselves and 
that there are divergent views on how committees should conduct 
their business when deliberating about the text of a report to 
the House.  However, as you Speaker, I am bound by the rules as 
they exist. In the present case, I have concluded that I have no 
alternative but to find that a prima facie breach of privilege 
has occurred. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I invite the hon. member for London North Centre to put his 
motion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK176"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Fontana (London North Centre, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I appreciate you having taken the time to look at this very 
serious matter.  On behalf of myself and the members of the 
committee, I move: 
<A NAME="LINK177">&nbsp;</A>

</I></B></P><P align=left>That the matter of the premature disclosure of the committee 
report by the member for Lakeland be referred to the Standing

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciated your earlier ruling on this matter.  The 
one question that was raised which I do not believe you answered 
in your ruling, and perhaps you could clarify it for me, was the 
question of whether a standing committee of the House of Commons 
could go into camera without moving a motion that it is going in 
camera. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does seem odd to me.  I do not know who has the power to 
decree such a thing or to make it retroactive.  It seems to me 
that it does require a motion to move in camera.  Otherwise, I do 
not know how those decisions come about if it is not by a motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  That will be decided by the committee 
itself, whether indeed they did move into camera according to 
procedures that were developed at that time.  That will be 
answered when we are in committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Kilger:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a totally 
different matter.  Perhaps I could ask for the indulgence of the 
House to dispose of the following matter.  There have been 
discussions that— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  We will wait for that.  The 
hon. member for Lakeland has 20 minutes for debate and 10 
minutes for questions and answers. 
<P><A NAME="LINK179"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have some questions that I would like to put.  I would 
appreciate it if members of the committee could answer these 
concerns at some time, whether it be in debate in the House in 
the question and answer session after my presentation or in 
committee at a future date.  There are some very interesting 
points which should be answered and should be responded to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first point raised by my colleague, the House leader for the 
Canadian Alliance, is the question of whether the committee acted 
properly, by the rules to which the committee has agreed to have 
a vote before going in camera.  I can assure you, Mr. Speaker 
that did not happen in this case.  There was no vote to go in 
camera and therefore the procedure was all wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems interesting that the committee and the chair of the 
committee can just throw aside the democratic process on a whim, 
it seems, ignore the process agreed to by the committee and go 
ahead in a dictatorial fashion to have this discussion of the 
report in camera.  Somehow that does not seem like anything they 
are particularly concerned about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On what I believed to be very honest consideration of the 
matter, I decided that because of the improper procedure, because 
it was in the minutes of the March 2 meeting that in fact this 
report would be discussed in public.  Because of these things I 
thought that meeting should be considered to be a public meeting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am quite concerned that the chair of the committee would have 
the nerve to stand in the House of Commons and express concern 
about what I did, believing that this was a public document and 
calling a press conference, not leaking this document to the 
media in the way the Liberals leaked the documents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We brought points of privilege to you, Mr. Speaker, on several 
occasions expressing our concern that reports which were 
confidential reports without a doubt were leaked by Liberal 
members.  They could only have been leaked by Liberal members. We 
have done this time and again.  In those situations, Mr. Speaker, 
you have ruled that we should not do these things but there was 
nothing you could really do about it.

<A HREF="#LINKT63"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case the chair of the committee has the audacity to come 
to the House of Commons and say that I am wrong because I did 
this publicly and not in a sneaky fashion.  They routinely leak 
public documents.  Most of the budget was leaked.  We knew what 
was in the finance minister's federal budget before it was 
actually presented in the House, because it was leaked piece by 
piece by piece.  This has become completely routine, and I do not 
think that is right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nor did I have any intention of doing anything wrong.  The last 
thing I would want to do is anything which would show a lack of 
respect for the House, for the committee and for the rules of 
these institutions.  That is the last thing I would do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You have ruled, and I respect your ruling, that under these 
circumstances you have no choice but to put this back into the 
hands of the committee.  I respect that, Mr. Speaker.  I am sure 
you have examined the issue and I trust your word on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would encourage the chair of the committee and other members 
to respond to this apparent contradiction that somehow it is okay 
to routinely leak documents which are clearly confidential, which 
is what Liberal MPs have done again and again.  It is undeniable. 
I did it openly and honestly in a press conference.  I presented 
a report which was marked confidential, but which I truly 
believed could not possibly be considered confidential. Because I 
did that in a public fashion, somehow I am in breach of the rules 
of the House in some way.  I am interested in hearing the 
committee explain this.  It is a very interesting contradiction, 
and I am looking forward to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said in my presentation to the House last week, if you 
look, Mr. Speaker, at the minutes of the March 2 meeting—and I 
tabled a copy of those minutes at that time—it said clearly in 
the minutes that it was agreed that this report would be 
discussed in a public meeting of committee, not in camera.  I 
take the decision of the committee on matters like that quite 
seriously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also in <I>Hansard</I>, as you pointed out, Mr. Speaker, the 
committee did agree to have a vote of the committee before ever 
going in camera.  That did not happen in this case.  Furthermore, 
at the very meeting before the committee went in camera, I asked 
the chair of the committee to allow me to put forth a motion to 
reaffirm it was the rules of the committee that we have a vote 
before going in camera. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The chair would not allow the motion but said “You do not have 
to worry about that.  We all know that and I respect that”, or 
something to that effect.  That can be seen in the <I>Hansard</I> 
of that March 2 meeting as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It takes an awful lot of nerve for the chair of the committee 
and for the members of the committee to come to the House 
claiming that I have done what is wrong.  I respect your ruling, 
Mr. Speaker, that this should go back to the committee, but I am 
saying the committee should decide that in fact, no, I have not 
acted improperly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet they are saying I did, when they completely ignore the rules 
of the committee which have been reconfirmed and reaffirmed by 
the committee at the very meeting before the committee went 
improperly in camera. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am extremely concerned by the loss of democratic process in 
this institution, not just in committee.  In these committees the 
process and the lack of respect for democracy, for the rules, the 
very rules that are agreed to, to govern the committees, are 
ignored routinely.  I do not find that to be a laughing matter. I 
take that as a serious matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the House generally, the lack of respect for the 
democratic process has become routine.  I have many people back 
home telling me that they see our House of Commons behaving more 
like an elected dictatorship than a democratic body meant to 
govern a country. 
They say that because they understand the Prime Minister and a 
few key people make the decisions, the big decisions, in 
governing the country. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1525"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT64"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do backbenchers and MPs in the governing party have influence on 
the Prime Minister's decisions?  I would suggest very little to 
none.  The only influence seems to be what can be exerted by the 
members of opposition parties through the use of the media.  We 
can take an issue which we think is an important issue, go to the 
media and get coverage.  Through that method public reaction can 
come against the government.  That seems to be the only way that 
we can have an effect.  It is the only way that any member of 
parliament, other than the Prime Minister and his little group, 
have any effect on what goes on in the House.  I am extremely 
concerned about that, and I have expressed my concern about that 
before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the issue of time allocation.  It was a very few 
years ago when time allocation or closure in the House was 
something that was used rarely.  Since this government took 
office in 1993, how many times would you think, Mr. Speaker, that 
time allocation and closure have been used in the House of 
Commons?  It is approaching 60 times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Look at the last 10 bills that have passed through the House and 
see how many times time allocation has been used to end debate 
prematurely on legislation.  How many times do you think in the 
last 10 pieces of legislation which have passed in the House?  A 
majority of cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has become absolutely routine.  Debate is not allowed in 
this place the way we expect it to be allowed on extremely 
important pieces of legislation like the new elections bill.  The 
very act that will govern elections in this country, Bill C-2, 
passed through the use of time allocation.  Debate ended after a 
very few hours.  It is completely unacceptable.  The official 
opposition, which is supposed to be given ample time to present 
our case to try to have an impact on legislation, was given only 
a few hours of debate on this important bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has become routine.  It is shameful.  That is why it amazes 
me that the chair of this committee and the members of this 
committee would have the nerve to accuse me of doing something 
improper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Look at the relative importance of these two issues.  What was 
my great crime?  My great crime was presenting in a public way, 
not in a sneaky way as they do, to the media a document which I 
believe truly was a public document.  I believe I was doing 
nothing wrong.  I was not willing to do it in a sneaky way, as 
the Liberals have done in so many cases.  That is my great crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the very meeting after it was agreed that this report would 
be discussed in public, after it was undeniably reaffirmed that 
this committee could only go in camera, into secret meeting, 
after a vote passed committee, in fact the committee went in 
camera without a vote.  Does that sound like democracy?  Does 
that sound like respecting rules of the committee?  It just is 
not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Look at the relative importance of the two wrongdoings here. You 
have ruled there was wrongdoing and I respect that, Mr. Speaker. 
At the time I believed there was not.  Yet the chair knew he was 
violating the very rules of the committee when he took that 
committee into secret meeting in camera without having a vote of 
the committee and against the minutes as written in the document 
I tabled from the March 2 meeting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because I understand that you have now put this into the hands 
of the committee, Mr. Speaker, I ask the committee to seriously 
consider the relative importance of the violations that have 
taken place.  As I suggested to you, Mr. Speaker—I asked you to 
rule on it and I understand that you could not—I would like the 
committee now to consider whether the chair of the committee 
should be removed from his position as chair.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To me, violating the very rules which were agreed on to govern 
the committee is a serious breach. There is no way that could 
have been done without the chair knowing exactly what he was 
doing, because I made a point of that at the very meeting before 
and <I>Hansard</I> will show this.  I made a point of that in a 
way which could not be easily forgotten.  It was that important I 
felt I should do that and that is what I did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I fully respect your decision.  There are many more 
points I could make.  I am sure there will be more debate on 
this, but I would like to ask the chair and the members of the 
committee after contemplating this issue, to deal with the issue 
of the actions of the chair.  I would like them to seriously 
consider removing the chair from his position in the committee 
and I would like the committee to move on from there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year with the former chair of the committee, we had a 
committee which I would say was completely dysfunctional.  It 
just was not working.  With the new chair we had a committee 
which I thought functioned quite well.  We went into what was an 
honest discussion at committee dealing with the very sensitive 
issue of illegal migration into this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, you know what happened this summer. About 600 
people came into the country illegally by boat.  Every year 
around 23,000 people come into the country illegally through our 
airports, border crossings and by boat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee debated.  Witnesses came from across the country 
to deal with this extremely important issue. A Conservative 
member on the committee asked for assurance that the work of the 
committee would be considered in drafting the new immigration 
act.  That assurance was given. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I received a leaked draft of the new act along with a schedule 
which showed that the new act went to the provinces for approval 
on February 25 and that the minister was going to approve the new 
act on March 7.  The committee report which was supposed to be 
considered in the new act was not tabled until last week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So there we were. Witnesses came to the committee in good faith 
and presented their thoughts on the issue of illegal migration. 
How are they to feel now knowing that their thoughts were not 
even considered in the new act? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new act was not put together in a few weeks.  It had to have 
been virtually a done deal back when we started with this issue 
before committee.  Certainly the report tabled last week in no 
way could be considered in the new act because the act was a done 
deal at least three weeks before that.  That is when I received 
my leaked copy of the new act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those witnesses gave of their time, their efforts, their money. 
They came to committee and presented their views believing they 
might actually have an impact on the new act.  How must they feel 
knowing that they have been used by the committee?  They have 
been used by the committee because what they reported to 
committee was completely ignored.  The legislation was in place 
before the committee even reported. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That shows an incredible disrespect for Canadians, for people 
who care enough about an issue.  In this case it is an issue 
which is important to the security of our country, illegal 
migration.  They cared enough that they came and they spoke.  I 
listened to them.  Other committee members listened to them. They 
were completely ignored.  How must they feel? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is sad.  When Canadians see these things happening they must 
completely lose their respect for politicians, for the House of 
Commons and for the committees of the House of Commons. They 
cannot possibly do anything but become cynical about the whole 
political process.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a sad thing when Canadians have that reinforced in the way 
they did by the chair and the committee. They ignored the 
committee rules and decided to discuss the committee report, a 
draft document, in secret and only then did they report it to the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee is functioning poorly now.  At the previous 
meetings we were not even discussing a draft document.  We were 
only discussing the witnesses we had heard and the committee went 
in camera.  In other words it discussed the issue in secret. The 
reason had to be because the Liberals on the committee, a 
majority of government members who have control, were afraid that 
something they might say would be heard by their constituents and 
would reflect poorly on them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I see that I have no more time to debate this 
issue.  I am looking for debate from others who feel that this is 
an important issue.  I am looking in particular for a response 
from the chair of the committee.  I also hope others will get 
involved in the debate because what debate in the House could 
possibly be more important than a debate on respecting the 
democratic process and respecting the rules of the House and of 
the committee?  What else could be more important than that?  The 
issue is that the chair of the committee and the committee did 
not respect the rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate having had the time to present my views.  I look 
forward to hearing the views of other members.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Sophia Leung (Vancouver Kingsway, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, we all know that any committee draft report is marked 
confidential in big letters.  I am a member of the Standing 
Committee on Citizenship and Immigration.  We all respect and 
have a clear understanding that we must honour such 
confidentiality.  Mr. Speaker indicated exactly that in his 
ruling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an all-party committee, we have worked very hard but the hon. 
member repeatedly broke the rules and walked out on a very 
important discussion.  That is disgusting.  It was without any 
concern for his duty and his responsibility.  The hon. member not 
only breached the trust of all committee members with his 
disrespectful attitude but with purposeful disregard he held a 
press conference.  I ask the hon. member how could he have such 
nerve and disregard for his duty as a member of our committee? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for 
that question.  She again expresses the concern about the 
document marked confidential. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I explained why I believe the document was not confidential. The 
committee had improperly gone in camera.  I would like to ask the 
member about her lack of respect for the rules of the committee. 
I assume she was at the meeting where the committee went in 
camera.  At that time the member did not say to the chair, “It 
is improper that we are going in camera.  We discussed this at 
the last meeting”.  Why did she not do that?  Unfortunately I 
was not at that meeting.  I was away on other matters of 
parliamentary business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She talked about my not being at some of the meetings.  I 
challenge her to have my attendance records at those committees 
compared with those of any other member of the committee.  I have 
taken part in most of the meetings of the committee.  I have been 
involved.  I took part in the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I found out that a copy of the new immigration act had been 
leaked, I realized we had all been taken for fools.  That 
bothered me. 
My co-operation at that point dwindled somewhat because this is a 
serious issue.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the member why at that committee she did not 
stand and say, “This is improper. I am going to have no part of 
it. I am going to respect the rules of the committee.  I am not 
going to allow you, Mr. Chair, to go in camera on this issue 
without a vote.  Mr. Chair, I am not going to allow you to go 
against the minutes of that March 2 meeting and now decide to 
have the discussion on the draft report in camera, in secret”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the member why she has so little respect for 
the rules that she did not stop that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  That is out of order.  We are still on 
questions and comments of the hon. member for Lakeland. 
<P><A NAME="LINK181"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I have a very simple question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard the member say that he was of the very strong conviction 
that it was a public meeting. He said that was decided by a 
majority vote of the committee. I am asking him to confirm that 
was the case.  Also, has he looked at the records of the 
committee and was there a motion subsequent to that which 
rescinded, reversed or changed that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for 
his question. I would like to clarify that in fact the committee 
had agreed I believe it was at the start of the fall session 
pursuant to the normal rules of committees, that before going in 
camera there would be a vote.  That should not have to be 
reconfirmed by a committee, but I have seen those rules breached 
often enough that I wanted it to be reconfirmed.  My memory says 
this was done back in the fall but I cannot say for sure. 
However it was reconfirmed when the committee went in camera when 
we were discussing not even a draft of the report, but just what 
the witnesses had said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That meeting improperly went in camera.  I made a point of 
bringing that issue before the committee and asking why we were 
in camera and that we should go public.  There was no vote held 
to have the committee go in camera.  Therefore it should have 
been a public meeting.  Through my pressure the committee agreed 
that the meeting was improperly in camera and it was going to be 
made a public meeting and it was. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was at that time I tabled a motion that before going in 
camera again there will be a vote of committee members. The Chair 
brushed it aside and said there was no need for that, that we all 
knew the rules.  At the very next meeting the chair took the 
committee improperly in camera.  I was not at that meeting.  I 
was on other parliamentary business.  All of the members of the 
committee allowed it to happen.  Not one member raised his or her 
voice to stop it. That is improper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other thing from that meeting is the minutes of the meeting 
said that the draft report was to be discussed publicly.  I would 
argue that issue should not even be a particularly important one 
because the committee had agreed not to go in camera without a 
vote and there was no vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I brought the improper procedure before the committee. I said 
there was no way we should be in camera that we should be holding 
the meetings in the open.  The chair continued to call it an in 
camera meeting. That is when I decided it was improper. The rules 
were not being respected.  It was not truly an in camera meeting 
and therefore the discussion should not be considered to be 
confidential. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was my decision at the time.  It was a decision which I 
made considering the evidence before me.  I would suggest that it 
was a good decision.  I would be interested to hear from other 
members of the committee.  I would like them to answer the 
question as to why they did not prevent the committee from 
improperly going in camera and why they did not ask for a vote. 
I would suggest that one of the reasons might be that there is 
seldom quorum at this committee.  We cannot hold a vote when 
there is no quorum.  We often have three or four Liberal members 
at committee out of a possible seven or eight.  The attendance of 
the Liberal members is not exactly something I would think they 
would want to brag about.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to follow up on the member's remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the reason there was no quorum at the time I tried to 
move my motion suggesting that the minutes of the committee come 
out of in camera and be published as soon as the report was tabled 
was because the Reform MPs had left the committee.  In fact, every 
time I tried to do something with respect to the minutes being in 
camera, I could not move the motion because the member opposite 
and his colleagues had left the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the member opposite how he can take this position, 
especially with me who has always argued that committees should 
not be in camera if they can possibly not be in camera.  In this 
case the chairman explained very clearly that it had to be in 
camera up until the time the report was released.  That was fair 
but we all agreed that the minutes could be released as soon as 
the report was released.  Would that not have satisfied the 
member? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit:</B>  Mr. Speaker, what the member says is 
absolutely incorrect.  At the meeting where the chair improperly 
went in camera, I was not even in attendance.  How could I have 
left?  To my knowledge, I never left the committee when a member 
was trying to present such a motion.  There was never any talk of 
such a motion.  I invite the member to review the record because 
that is absolutely not what happened. 
<P><A NAME="LINK183"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>   Mr. Speaker, 
I should tell you that I happen to be vice-chair of the committee 
and have found it necessary on occasion, when our chair was tied 
up with other committee business, to run some of the meetings.  I 
have been very actively involved in the writing of this report, 
as have most members and certainly most government members in 
having input. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am surprised that you, Mr. Speaker, did not rise to your feet 
when the member opposite finished saying that he thought his 
decision even today was a good decision.  I would interpret that 
as being a statement that he does not particularly agree with the 
findings that you, Mr. Speaker, brought forward before this place 
where you found in favour of the Chair that there was a prima 
facie case of violating the privilege of the committee members. 
Mr. Speaker, I heard you say that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I made it very clear that I respect your ruling.  I do 
not see a contradiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  We are in debate now.  Rather than interrupt 
each other on these points of order, I would prefer that we have 
a full run at it if we can, which is what we did on the other 
side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I sat here with my blood 
pressure boiling up as I listened to the hon. member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  That is not uncommon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  No, that is not uncommon.  However, I 
must say that I waited until I had the opportunity to have the 
floor.  I can assure the House that this member will agree with 
very little that I am about to put on the record. 
If he wants to jump up every time he disagrees with me, 
hopefully, Mr. Speaker, you will rule that those are not points 
of order.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the member wants us to read <I>Hansard</I>, I would invite him 
to do exactly the same when <I>Hansard</I> is printed wherein he 
said that he thought his decision to hold a public press 
conference was a good decision, in spite of the fact that you, 
Mr. Speaker, have found him guilty of violating the privileges of 
members of the committee.  I do not know how that can be 
interpreted in any other way than to say that he does not like, 
agree with or respect your decision.  He thinks what he did was 
right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a couple of basic principles here.  One is that when 
you are trying to get out of a hole you should stop digging.  The 
other one is the axiom that when a lawyer represents himself, he 
is often said to have a fool for a client.  When I hear the 
defence that has been put forward by this member, it is 
incomprehensible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prior to this unfortunate incident, I thought the member was 
making good contributions to the committee.  This obviously was 
not the first issue we have dealt with.  He was dedicated and 
worked hard.  I very seldom agreed with his position, the one 
which the Reform Party said, through him, that it considered 
anyone who arrived in this country as a refugee as an illegal. 
We had a long debate over the use of the term illegal.  This 
member considers all refugees to be illegal.  I certainly do not 
agree with that but I respect his right to hold that opinion as 
long as he does not mind me telling everybody that is his opinion 
so they can judge for themselves the attitude the Reform Party 
and this particular member have in relation to new Canadians, 
refugees and immigrants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You, Mr. Speaker, read from the rules which state that a 
committee report is considered to be confidential even if it is 
discussed in public at committee.  Whether or not the committee 
is in camera is totally irrelevant to the fact that this member 
decided to make the document public on his own volition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could accept it if he was willing to stand and say “Mr. 
Speaker, I made a mistake”.  Instead, he stands and says “What 
I did was good.  What I did was right”.  It is black and white, 
Mr. Speaker, as you have obviously found out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we want to talk about denigrating the democratic process, 
what does it do?  I will take members back to the meeting on 
March 2 which was held at the Promenade.  It was to be an in 
camera session.  Why?  As you, Mr. Speaker, and all members would 
know, committees represent the 301 members of this House. The 
reason for that is that we are unable to sit on all the 
committees. While everyone might want to be on the finance 
committee or on the citizenship and immigration committee, not 
all members can be.  We have to share the workloads and spread 
the responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result, the committee does its work when it writes a draft 
report and brings it into this place to show our colleagues, the 
members of parliament, those who are duly elected to represent 
the people of this country.  We do that before we go public with 
it.  We do not release committee reports in draft or in final 
form until we have completed our responsibility which is to 
deliver it to you, Mr. Speaker, and to the House of Commons.  The 
member knows that but he continues to try to defend the 
indefensible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It says on the document “Confidential until reported to the 
House”.  I ask the member:  What word in there does he not 
understand?   Confidential means it is confidential. 
It cannot be reported to the public until it has been reported to 
the House.  It is a very difficult concept.  This means that 
after the report is brought to this place, laid on the table and 
reported as a public document the member is then not only 
entitled to but probably obligated, as a critic, to hold a press 
conference and to say everything he is saying.  I do not have a 
problem with him accusing the committee of not listening to 
witnesses.  I do not agree with that but if I were in opposition 
I would probably say the same thing.  I do not believe it is 
true, but he has every right and indeed as a member of Her 
Majesty's Loyal Opposition he has a responsibility to do that.  I 
respect that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that meeting of March 2 at the Promenade, the member spoke up 
and said that he did not want the meeting to continue in camera. 
The Chair, quite appropriately, told him that the reason the 
meeting was in camera was because it was dealing with a draft 
report and that it must stay in camera and confidential until the 
report was presented to the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This member then said that he had a tape recorder.  He showed it 
to us and said that he was going to tape record the proceedings 
of the committee if we refused to pass a motion to move out of in 
camera.  Can anyone imagine the audacity?   He used the word 
nerve; how the committee has the nerve to ask you, Mr. Speaker, 
to decide on whether or not he has violated our privileges. 
Imagine the nerve of a member of parliament in this great 
democracy, called Canada, to come into a committee room and, for 
whatever reason, actually threaten members opposite and even 
members on his own side that he was going to tape record the in 
camera proceedings and then selectively release the information 
as he saw fit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my 20 years in public office, I have never felt so insulted 
by a member who would come in and say that.  If he wanted to 
fight the good fight he should have put a motion to move out of 
in camera.  I would not have had a problem with that. The 
committee could have voted on it.  He did not do that.  The 
Chair, in a conciliatory way, the same Chair who this member is 
now castigating and asking to be removed from the committee, said 
that he would agree to a suggestion by the member for 
Hamilton—Wentworth that the minutes of the committee would be 
made public once the report was completed.  The member agreed not 
to tape record the proceedings and agreed with that suggestion. 
All of this was agreed to before any press conference was held. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You can imagine, Mr. Speaker, how surprised members of the 
committee were when we heard there was actually going to be a 
press conference the next day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now deal with that issue.  The member said that he got a 
copy of the draft legislation that was put out by the ministry 
and had apparently been circulated to provincial legislatures, 
ministers or stakeholders.  Why would that happen?  The member 
said that it was for approval.  In reality it was for input.  If 
the government were to change the Immigration Act or any act 
without getting the input of the stakeholders that are directly 
involved, we would be accused of the most dastardly things by the 
opposition members, of not listening, of not seeking other 
opinions and of not caring what their beloved provinces might 
have to say about an issue that could have a tremendous impact on 
the future of those provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is absurd to suggest that sending a draft-for-comment piece 
of legislation to other interested stakeholders is wrong.  That 
is not wrong.  That is consultation.  It only makes sense to do 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of just perhaps questioning that at committee and saying 
“I have a concern”, what does the member do?  He decides to 
take the document that all of us have been working so hard on, 
that people have had input on, that is stamped draft and is not 
even 50% complete, an issue that became rather embarrassingly 
obvious at the press conference, and he calls a press conference 
with it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me tell the House why it was embarrassingly obvious that it 
was incomplete.  One of the reporters apparently asked the hon. 
member what it was that he objected to.  He said that he did not 
like certain words, such as the word “should” where the 
recommendations said “this should happen” or “that should 
happen”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While he was busy getting his notes ready for his press 
conference the rest of us were going through the document.  I 
put a motion at committee—and members who were there will 
remember this—that we should delete the word “should” and we 
should send a strong recommendation to the Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration that would not say “this should 
happen” but “this shall happen”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The entire report, at the direction of the committee, was 
rewritten by the clerk to eliminate that somewhat soft approach 
of saying “this should happen” and it changed the whole nature 
of the report.  That one change took that document from being a 
very thorough but somewhat soft document to becoming a firm 
report with clear cut directions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member did not even have the sense to release the final 
report.  It is incredible.  He released a report that was 50% 
done in the oven because he got all upset that, my goodness, 
there was a draft piece of legislation that had been sent to the 
provinces.  It is truly hard to understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would invite anyone to research the minutes of the committee 
or the committee evidence or anything else concerning the 
committee.  It is standard practice for a committee agenda to be 
sent out to all of our offices, saying that the committee on 
whatever will meet tomorrow morning at 9 o'clock in Room 308 West 
Block to consider the following items.  Then it will say the 
draft report of whatever the report happens to be.  Then it will 
have stamped on it “in camera”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a member objects to that, the member can say so.  That member 
can put a motion.  That member can call for a recorded vote.  In 
no instance did this member do that at the meetings which he 
attended.  He did complain, I give him credit for that, but he 
did not follow through.  He accepted the recommendation and the 
concept, which did not need to be formalized in some kind of a 
motion with which the chair agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real issue here is that this member could do an awful lot 
for his party, the Reform Party, as I will continue to call it if 
members do not mind, and he could do an awful lot for his own 
integrity if he would simply rise in this place and say “Thank 
you for your ruling, sir.  I appreciate the diligence and the 
time.  I am sorry that you had to come to that conclusion, but I 
would respectfully ask for the House to forgive me for making the 
error which I made”.  If he would not like to use that term, he 
could just stand and say “I am sorry.  I made a mistake”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be absolutely brilliant to hear that from that member. 
I highly doubt that we will.  Instead he rose to argue his case. 
Guess what?  When this motion goes to committee, this member has 
just given us all the prosecution we need.  We will just get 
<I>Hansard</I> and say “Here is what he said”.  He said it was a 
good idea, that it was a good thing and that he was pleased he 
did it.  He does not care what the Speaker said.  He does not 
care what committee members said.  He does not care about the 
opposition.  Mr. Speaker, he just does not care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is absolutely unforgivable, unless the member was to accept 
responsibility for his actions, rise and say to the members of 
the committee “I apologize for my mistake.  I still do not like 
the report.  I still do not think you did the right job.  I still 
do not like the minister”—whatever.  I do not care.  I 
understand and respect all of that.  But to actually stand here 
and try to defend something which the Speaker has ruled on, when 
it is so clear, when it is so black and white, I can only 
conclude by telling you, Mr. Speaker, as one parliamentarian to 
another, that I find it embarrassing.

member of parliament, but it would be much appreciated if he 
would stick to fact and reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I misunderstood the ruling of the Speaker, and if the Speaker

That was my understanding.

that is what he said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That I will find out.  I will look over <I>Hansard</I> later.  I 
want to show no disrespect for the Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The memory of the member who has just spoken is very 
interesting.  First, he referred to the March 2 meeting, and what 
he said about that meeting was absolutely incorrect.  He said at 
the time of the March 2 meeting that we were discussing a draft 
of the committee report.  We were not.  At that time we were 
discussing notes put together by the researcher about what the 
witnesses had said.  All we were doing was discussing that to 
rehash what the witnesses had said.  The chair decided to go in 
camera to discuss that.  I raised a fuss about it at the meeting 
and the chair agreed that it was improper and he made it a public 
meeting after that.  That is what really happened at that 
meeting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member is very talented, but not very factual.  I would 
prefer that he work on his memory and make it a little less 
selective.  I think that would be beneficial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I guess being one out of 
two is not bad.  It would be nice to have at least a 50% success 
rate.  I will take talent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can be as accurate as the member wants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me respond.  The member is saying that the staff of the 
committee and the clerk were doing something improper because 
they brought forward the document.  They said it was a discussion 
of the draft report.  If the member wants to hang his defence on 
whether we were dealing with the notes from the researcher that 
would lead us to draft a report or whether we were dealing with a 
draft report, if that is his defence, I would suggest that he not 
step on to the gallows.  It is a bit flimsy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, do not worry about my memory because I am going 
back about three weeks.  The member should think about his own 
memory and go back about 30 minutes or so.  He would find if he 
checked that the Speaker's ruling was not to refer the matter back 
to committee but to refer it to the procedure and House affairs 
committee, which is the hangman.  It will pull the lever and kick 
the sandbag out as the body drops to the ground. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit:</B>  Mr. Speaker, all of this is talk, 
but the real issue is the behaviour of the chair of the committee 
and the committee and how it could decide to break the very rules 
which the committee had set for itself and which the House has 
set for committees.  That is the issue.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Across the floor they laugh about breaking those rules.  They 
think it really is not that important.  The member brings up all 
of this fluff, much of it inaccurate, and seems not to understand 
the importance of respecting the democratic process and 
respecting the rules of committee, which they routinely break. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the procedure and House affairs committee reviews this issue 
I hope it will look at the behaviour of this chair and of this 
committee, because it is important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, really, this is almost 
silly.  If there had been a request by the committee to review 
somehow the behaviour of the chair and the Speaker had come in 
and made some kind of ruling, I suppose maybe we would be dealing 
with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know if I am hearing a plea for mercy, an act of 
contrition or the launching of some new defence.  These guys 
launch new things every day, so who knows, maybe the hon. member 
has come up with a new way to try to defend being caught with his 
hand in the cookie jar. 
<P><A NAME="LINK184"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke—Lakeshore, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, my colleague knows that I am a member of the committee. 
My colleague also knows that I have a recollection of what took 
place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sitting here listening to the member in his defence talking 
about people who break the rules and people who have no respect 
for the democratic process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like my colleague to comment on the day—and I speak for 
my privileges as a member of the committee—when he reached out 
and put on the table in front of him, in full view of the entire 
committee, a tape recorder and said that he was recording. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit:</B>  That is scary stuff. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jean Augustine:</B>  Yes, it was very heavy stuff and it 
was very threatening, because what we were discussing at the time 
were very sensitive matters.  The member put a tape recorder on 
the table and threatened us that he would be taping whatever was 
said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if my colleague remembers that occasion and the sense 
that we had across the way as we saw that tape recorder. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, in one sense I was 
outraged and in another sense I was highly amused.  The meetings 
are recorded anyway.  Everything we do and say in committee is 
recorded.  It is made available in the record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had agreed that the transcript of the meeting held in camera 
would be released to the public.  I said to myself “Let me 
understand this.  The hon. member will be tape recording what is 
already being tape recorded”.  Boy, that is pretty scary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Scary is not the right word.  The thing that was so 
offensive—and the member was right to bring it up—was that a 
member could come in and actually threaten that kind of 
silliness, that kind of nonsense, show that lack of respect for 
members of the committee, for the committee process and indeed 
for this place.  That is just not appropriate behaviour on the 
part of any member of any party in this place.  It is shameful 
and it is to be hoped that this member would realize the error of 
his ways and stop this kind of nonsense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would add that if the member had put as much energy into 
helping us write the report as he did in playing all of these 
silly games, he might have had an opportunity for some input of 
his own.  As it was, he was no help at all.

do not want to impute any motives to my colleague from Lakeland, 
who sits on the Standing Committee on Citizenship and

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do, however, want the Liberal members to hear what I have to 
say, because it is basically representative of my understanding 
of the meeting of March 2 in particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would remind hon. members that we received a notice to appear, 
as is the case for all committees.  I did indeed receive such a 
notice, in proper form, a few days before the committee sat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was initially rather surprised to see that session 15 was to 
be an in camera session.  Why surprised?  On the one hand, 
because the notice indicated that we were going to examine a 
draft report, whereas we had never received such a draft report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few days before the committee sitting, I recall very clearly 
receiving a document in proper form, a well-prepared document, as 
is usual with the research staff.  To my mind, this was far from 
being a draft report; it was instead a summary of options and of 
the appearances of witnesses throughout the entire examination 
of the refugee status determination system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This document summarized what the witnesses had had to say.  It 
went so far as to provide summaries.  This document contained no 
potential recommendations.  At no time did we have the position 
or statements of position from the Standing Committee on 
Citizenship and Immigration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recall that I spoke at that point in committee, and I would 
refer you to the transcript of the committee meeting on March 2. 
I had said clearly that the meeting should have been declared in 
camera, not on the basis of the report we had at our disposal, 
but rather on the basis of a study of a draft report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I quote my statement of March 2: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I would hope that we would study the real draft report 
in camera, the one our researchers have prepared for us on the 
basis of the options we choose. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I stress the fact that basically I wanted the meeting in camera 
because of the draft report for two reasons.  First, I felt that 
all the committee work we were starting and the report we would 
be producing several weeks later had to be done as fairly as 
possible, on the basis of the recommendations and evidence 
gathered during deliberations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, it seems basic to me that the meeting should be in 
camera when a draft report is involved.  Why?  Because we had to 
be sure we were free from influence from interveners outside the 
committee, which could have affected our proposals and 
recommendations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That seemed so important to me that I said on March 2, and I 
refer you again to the transcript of the committee's 
proceedings: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we study the report in camera, I hope we take the necessary 
steps, as responsible parliamentarians, to ensure there are no 
leaks.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I said at that time was that we could have a public 
meeting. We could have outside interveners come to our committee, 
based on the summary of options prepared by the researchers and 
the Library of Parliament. There was nothing confidential in 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was just a series of statements that we had heard in 
committee and that we were examining. This is why I was surprised 
to see, when I read the notice, that the meeting would take place 
in camera, because of the document that we had in hand. I 
questioned the committee and I expressed my astonishment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said “My first reaction was one of astonishment when I 
received the notice about this committee meeting and saw that we 
were going to study in camera the document that was sent to us. 
It was supposedly confidential, having been prepared by the 
library”. Again, I am quoting the transcript. I was surprised to 
see that we were having an in camera meeting on the basis of that 
document. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was prepared for a public meeting, so that outside interveners 
could read the summary of options. However, I was hoping from the 
bottom of my heart that the review of the draft report, which was 
supposed to be ready after March 2, would be conducted in camera. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I readily admit that I was disappointed to learn from some 
assistants that this report, which I believed to be confidential 
and which was jointly drafted by opposition and government 
members, had been leaked and could be found in the pages of 
newspapers outside Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is my interpretation or my version of these events. I 
believed and I fundamentally think that the review of the draft 
report should be conducted in camera. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Jordan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I am not on the committee but in following this debate I am a 
little confused. Perhaps you could provide some clarification. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did the Speaker rule that there was a prima facie case against 
the member?  If that is true, this is going to go to the Standing 
Committee on Procedure and House Affairs.  On the surface the 
Speaker found there was enough evidence that the member leaked a 
document to the public prior to tabling it in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This debate is redundant.  It could take place at the procedure 
and House affairs committee when it tries to sort out what it is 
going to do. The member might be a little confused.  He thinks it 
is going back to the immigration committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, maybe you could clarify the ruling for the member 
and we could get on to the orders of the day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The Speaker was 
asked to rule on whether there was a prima facie case of a breach 
of privilege made by the member for London North Centre. The 
Speaker ruled that in fact there was.  Then the member who 
brought the original complaint moved the motion that the matter 
go to the procedure and House affairs committee.  Subsequently 
this debate has to do with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debate upon whether or not this will go to the procedure and 
House affairs committee will go on.  It is not up to the Chair to 
determine what is going to happen in this debate.  The Chair has 
no recourse other than to keep us in this debate.  Theoretically 
we could debate this for two or three weeks.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North—St. Paul, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to make a very brief comment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very sad that events like this should happen in the House 
of Commons and that there would be a breach of privilege.  It 
tells us that we are less mature than we ought to be and that we 
could break the rules of decorum and procedure.  That is very 
sad.

</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, I am heartened that the member for Lakeland is 
prepared to apologize.  The Speaker made a final determination 
that there has been a breach of privilege. The member for London 
North Centre deemed it right to refer this matter to the Standing 
Committee on Procedure and House Affairs for a more thorough 
study of the facts of the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the motion goes to that committee and the issue is brought 
forward for further study, let me convey a message to that 
committee through you, Mr. Speaker. The member for Lakeland had a 
grievance about the behaviour of certain members of the 
committee.  Let me state one principle.  Even granting that those 
things happened and without admitting anything for the sake of 
argument, let me say with respect to mistakes that two wrongs do 
not make a right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For future guidance, if we have a grievance against a process 
within a committee, let us still abide by the rules that cover 
all of us in the House.  That is my contribution to this debate 
at this point.  With respect to mistakes, two wrongs do not make 
a right. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member has said that it is important to follow the rules.  I 
believe it is indeed important to follow the rules and it seems 
to me that the rules indicated precisely that the absolute 
confidentiality of this committee needed to be guaranteed in 
order to ensure that its work might be carried out in keeping 
with the rules and respecting the evidence given in committee 
throughout the week, and sometimes more, sometimes two or three 
weeks.  It had to be guaranteed that the committee would be 
leak-proof, therefore, in order to avoid press reports which 
might, regardless of their possibly good intentions, influence 
certain committee members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important for these debates, the statements of position 
and the formulation of recommendations to be carried out in total 
objectivity. This is why I wish absolutely, and with no malice 
whatsoever toward the hon. member for Lakeland, for him to 
apologize to the House.  I believe we have already seen a step in 
the right direction on his part. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the present time, I believe that it is the confidentiality of 
the committee that requires us to refer this question to the

committees routinely leak reports?  We know that is true.  We 
have brought forward questions of privilege on this issue time 
and again and the Speaker has said that they really should not do 
that, that they are naughty and to go on with it from there.

committee to have the committee go in camera? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have two straightforward, simple questions and I would really

<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras: </B>Mr. Speaker, as I explained in my speech, 
it is my fundamental and total belief as an MP and a committee 
member that, when the draft report of the Standing Committee on 
Citizenship and Immigration was being examined, the session would 
be in camera. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said so, and expressed my wishes for this in my statement on 
March 2.  I would also point out that when I finished speaking 
that day, the chair's reply was “That is true.  Thank you”.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Fontana (London North Centre, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I look forward to perhaps a little debate here.  My 
colleague, in a very objective way, has tried to point out what 
all members of the committee are feeling regardless of political 
party, except for the member of the Reform Party, now known as 
the new Canadian Alliance.  Old name, new name; it is the same 
old stuff. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think he gets the point of what the chair already ruled 
on.  It is unfortunate that he does not appreciate what the chair 
said.  It has absolutely nothing to do with whether or not a 
meeting was in camera.  I look forward to the opportunity of 
putting that case to the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A standing order of the House protects the integrity and the 
privilege of every member of the House.  The point is that if 
there is a confidential document it cannot be reported to the 
public before it is reported here.  That is the issue.  That is 
what the Speaker ruled on, that you are in breach of that 
privilege.  It is not whether or not we had a meeting in camera. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I hate to interrupt, 
but particularly in a debate such as this one it is important 
that members address each other through the Chair.  This is an 
interesting question and comment as we are doing it kind of in 
the third person. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras:</B> Mr. Speaker, this must not turn into a two 
way debate between the Canadian Alliance and the Liberal Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fundamental issue that must be examined is whether there has 
been a breach of privileges. From what I understand, the meeting 
was being held in camera. Was a vote held or not? No, no vote 
was held on that issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, my interpretation is that the committee was sitting in 
camera. Out of respect for the members of the committee, it was 
fundamental that this draft report not be released, but some 
members of the House decided to do so.

regarding this issue.

I feel privileged to be able to stand in Canada's House of 
Commons once again in defence of democracy and in defence of the 
people whom we are here to represent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue before us this afternoon is a very serious one.  It 
has to do with an allegation that my colleague from Lakeland has 
disclosed a document which was marked confidential.  It was 
brought to the attention of the House.  The Speaker has ruled 
that in fact there was a prima facie case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result the chairman of the immigration committee has made a 
motion.  Since we have not heard it for a while, I will take this 
opportunity to read it so that we know what we are debating.  The 
member for London North Centre moved: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the matter of the premature disclosure of the committee 
report by the member for Lakeland be referred to the Standing 
Committee on Procedure and House Affairs. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the motion we are debating and the vote that will 
subsequently be held on this question is whether or not the issue 
should be referred to the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we vote against it then it is the end of the matter.  If we 
vote in favour of it then the issue will continue in the 
procedure and House affairs committee which, after hearing more 
evidence, getting down to the nitty-gritty and hopefully 
ferreting out the facts, will come back with a report to the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That report, if it finds the member guilty, will probably 
include some sanctions.  If the committee finds the member not 
guilty then it will so recommend.  When the report is brought 
back to the House there will be another motion that says we 
concur in the report. Whatever the report says, if that motion 
carries then the member will have to live by that decision.  It 
is a long, drawn out process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I would like to point out to the people who perhaps are 
a little fuzzy on what is exactly happening that a deeper 
principle is being attacked or debated here: the degree to which 
this place is democratic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I certainly concur with the fact that in order for us as the 
board of directors of the corporation called Canada to direct our 
affairs in a proper way, we must have rules which regulate our 
debate and regulate our work in committees.  It is absolutely 
important for all of us to agree with and to follow those rules. 
It must be done in an orderly fashion.  There is no question or 
debate on that part. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do find from time to time that while members of the Liberal 
governing party have a majority not only in the House but also in 
the committees, there are too many occasions in which the rights 
and privileges of members who are not part of the governing party 
are ignored, abused and sometimes trampled on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very interesting.  I happen to be a member who on one 
occasion did go to the procedure and House affairs committee.  It 
was one of these cases where we had a huge question on whether or 
not it was proper or improper to display a little flag on the 
corner of our desks.  Thinking that was fairly proper, I said 
that I would display my flag.  When the Speaker ruled that was 
not acceptable, I accepted that ruling strictly and totally 
because of my commitment to making this place work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the Speaker made the ruling.  I also know that by the 
rules, just like in a hockey game, I am not permitted to 
challenge the Chair.  We need some place of final authority.  We 
may not always like it.  I will tell you frankly, Mr. Speaker, I 
did not like it, but I did accept it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will notice that since that time some five years ago I 
have not displayed my little Canadian flag on my desk strictly 
out of respect for the process, even though I disagree with it.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I suppose I would do the same if I were falsely accused of some 
bad crime and landed in jail.  I would gladly spend my time there 
because I agree with the process even though I was improperly 
convicted.  I do not know how committed I would be to the cause 
at that time, but that is how it works in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think this member has expressed his frustrations in the 
committee.  I have experienced those same frustrations.  I 
remember one occasion when I was substituting in the committee. I 
guess I have a reputation, at least in our party, of always being 
available.  Whenever someone has to go away on other 
parliamentary business and there is a vacancy for a 
representative of our party in a committee, they will phone me 
and ask if I can go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was substituting in committee.  We got to the point where we 
were doing clause by clause consideration of a bill.  It was late 
at night.  It was one of those bills that the Liberals thought 
they had to get through.  It was probably 10.30 or 11 o'clock at 
night.  A strange thing happened.  The chairman said shall clause 
so and so pass.  My colleague and I said yes and no one said 
anything else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You know the rules, Mr. Speaker.  If you call for a vote and 
there are two votes in favour and none against, does the thing 
pass or fail?  The fact of the matter is that if two say yes and 
no one says no then it should pass. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I recall, in our motion we were trying to amend a particular 
clause.  Two of us having said yes and no one having said no, I 
was surprised when the chairman said that the motion was 
defeated.  I said that the chairman could do not do that.  He 
said “I just did”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must remember that this was a Liberal chairman of the 
committee.  I said “No, you can't, based on the rules of 
democracy”.  Every organization in this country is based on 
democracy.  When there is a vote, the vote must be declared 
according to what the members said.  Two of us had said yes. 
Nobody said no.  The motion had passed.  That is what I said to 
the chairman, and he said “No”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that time the sleepy Liberals woke up when we got into a bit 
of a shouting match.  I would not let it pass because it was 
wrong that the chairman could overrule the decision of the group. 
I objected, and I objected louder and louder.  I would not let 
him off the hook. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally he said he would call for a vote to see whether or not 
the ruling of the chair should be upheld.  By then the Liberals 
had awakened.  There were one or two more of them than the rest 
of us.  Even though they did not know what had gone on, since 
they were sleeping, they at that stage, on command, voted in 
favour and upheld the ruling of the chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consequently I rose in this place on a question of privilege and 
told the Speaker what had happened in committee.  I related the 
story.  I will frankly confess to you, Mr. Speaker, that I was 
very disappointed in the Speaker's ruling.  The Speaker ruled 
that the committee was champion of its own affairs.  It can do 
whatever it wants.  The ruling stood and our amendment stood 
defeated because the chairman declared it so, even though the 
majority of the votes in that particular meeting said it had 
passed.  That was the end of the matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the first time I have raised it since it happened a 
number of years ago.  The only reason I am talking about it now 
is that it fits in the context of what we are debating. Again, I 
did not like the ruling of the Speaker but he is the final 
authority.  I accepted it, and that was the end of the matter, 
but it is still wrong for a chairman of a committee to have such 
unilateral power.  That is not acceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson:</B>  Oh, come on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  It is not acceptable that the chairman can 
do things which are straight out and out undemocratic.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson:</B>  He did not do that.  He is the best 
chairman I have ever seen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have just related the story. 
I was there, the member was not.  I was there and that is exactly 
what happened, and there were other people who heard it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I will not listen to the heckling member on the 
other side who does not want to listen to facts.  I want to talk 
about the issue that we have before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is on issues like this on which democracy is trampled by a 
majority government.  I say this as kindly as I can to Liberal 
members.  They have an obligation, as do you, Mr. Speaker, to 
preserve the democratic process.  When there are decisions made 
which run roughshod over the opinions and the ideas of other 
members, the frustration level grows. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the instance that we have before us, I would say that it is 
not only because the member for Lakeland is in the riding 
adjacent to mine that I stand in his defence, but because of his 
proximity I frequently run across little things that he does in 
the riding.  Sometimes people come to me and say “We have such 
and such a problem” and I ask “Where do you live?” and find 
out that the person lives in the other member's riding.  So we 
have some dealings back and forth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the hon. member stands in the House and says “When I did 
what I did I thought I was doing what was correct because we had 
voted in committee that this was to be a totally public 
process”, my inclination is to accept that what the member is 
saying is in fact how he interpreted it at the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the other argument, which I will let other members 
make, that even though the committee voted that this was to be 
totally public, in fact the final report was not to be released 
before it was tabled in the House.  That argument could be made 
and I will let others make it.  It has validity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I have a very serious question to pose.  Every 
committee that I have been on since I was first elected in 1993 
has issued a number of reports and I cannot think of very many 
which actually remained secret until they were tabled in the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were a number of times when I was quite convinced that 
indeed Liberal members were talking to the press about specific 
issues which were in finance committee reports.  There were some 
things which were in the reports that were leaked to the press 
before they even came to the committee in the wording that was 
quoted in the press.  No other member even knew about it, except 
for the chairman of the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is almost impossible to prove and I can understand why the 
Speaker has been in a dilemma on numerous occasions when we have 
pointed it out.  Not being able to prove which individual leaked 
it, as there is no paper path, it is very difficult to follow it 
through.  The Speaker has, on every instance, until this one, 
ruled that that is the way it is.  This time that is not the way 
it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This time we are told the member for Lakeland must stand in 
front of a tribunal to defend his actions.  In his own words, the 
only difference between what he did and what the Liberal members 
have done over and over again is that he did it openly, in front 
of cameras, at a press conference, whereas they did it 
surreptitiously.  That is the only difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last budget is a perfect example.  How many reports were in 
the press in the weeks leading up to the budget?  It used to be 
that ministers of finance would resign if the budget was leaked, 
and that was not very long ago.  But in this particular round of 
government, with the Liberal finance minister that we have, all 
of these ideas are floated out there and then in the end we are 
amazed to find that the budget speech given on Monday was fairly 
accurately reported in the press the Saturday before.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are no repercussions any more.  It seems to me that the 
true lack of respect for this democratic process has come from 
the government on the other side because it enjoys a majority. 
Government members won the election.  They will not win the next 
one if I can help it, but they won the last election and they won 
the one before that, so they have more members than we do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appeal to them that in order to gain and to keep the respect 
of the Canadian citizens for this boardroom we must respect each 
other.  As I must respect government members, I appeal to them to 
respect those of us on this side and stop routinely defeating 
every amendment that we put forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were a lot of people who wondered about the long Nisga'a 
vote.  I have had conversations with people.  They asked me if 
that was the best we could do in parliament, to stand up and sit 
down for four days.  In my more jovial moods I said that maybe 
somebody recognized that I needed the exercise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, there is a deeper answer.  Yes, we did vote on many 
amendments to Nisga'a, not only because of members of our party, 
but because of the people we represent and in fact thoughtful 
Canadians right across the country who were very opposed to that 
bill in the form in which it was presented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had a few substantial amendments which would have ameliorated 
the concerns, but the Liberal government, with its majority, 
would have none of those.  We said that the issue was so 
important that one way or another we would spend at least a week 
of the time of parliament on the issue, not one hour or two 
hours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has the habit of using time allocation.  I have a 
list here.  There are several bills which have been before the 
House on which the Reform Party has only had maybe 30 minutes of 
debate before the government has invoked time allocation. 
There is no respect for it.  So I said to some people that when 
we have— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, please stop your stopwatch. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I cannot recognize 
the point of order because the member is not at his place, so 
there is no point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  I view that simply 
as a tactic to reduce my speaking time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said to many people on that occasion that our reason for 
voting was because we were going to spend a week on it.  It was 
an important issue for thousands of Canadians.  The Liberal 
government had the choice to decide whether we would use that 
time debating or whether we would use that time voting, because I 
believe it had advance notice that we would oppose that bill with 
every means possible.   We did that because the government said 
“Closure.  Time allocation.  This is finished”.  We had no 
choice but to spend that time voting because of the importance of 
the bill to members of our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I plead for better democracy.  I plead for giving our members an 
opportunity to really be heard and not to be ignored. I insist 
that all of us in the House, elected by the people in our 
ridings, are here to do a job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I would amend the motion that has been put by the 
hon. member.  I move: 
<A NAME="LINK190">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the motion be amended by deleting the word “premature”.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The amendment is in 
order.  Debate is on the amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK191"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I wonder if the member putting forward the amendment understands 
the word premature.  It seems to me that the word simply means 
something that came early, as in a premature baby.  How about 
that?  Something came before it was ready.  The fact that the 
report was released by the hon. member when it was only 50% 
completed might, although it is a stretch, qualify it as being 
premature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the member justify putting what is almost a comical 
amendment—even though it is in order, as you have ruled, Mr. 
Speaker—to delete the word premature, which obviously is the 
crux of the matter?  If the report was not prematurely released, 
then perhaps the member would not have been found guilty of 
releasing it prematurely by the Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I can answer that question. 
That is exactly why it was removed.  It presupposes the guilt of 
the person before it goes to committee.  That is why we would 
rather have the motion state that there was a disclosure and let 
the committee determine whether there was something untoward in 
that action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will answer his question.  Do I understand the word premature? 
Yes, I do. 
<P><A NAME="LINK192"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Fontana (London North Centre, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I want to take this opportunity on behalf of the committee to 
comment on the important work that we try to do as a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have spoken many times to the member for Lakeland and thanked 
him very much, not only for his questions in committee but for 
his approach to the subject matter, our refugee determination 
system, which is of concern to Canadians.  We must ensure that 
the system works well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee was working well together in dealing with this 
issue, which is important to all Canadians.  It is unfortunate 
that it has come to this procedural wrangling, and it is 
unfortunate that the member released a report that was still in 
progress and still being worked on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speaker has already ruled that there was a prima facie case 
of privilege.  At that time I could have moved a motion to 
censure the member, but I did not.  I said that I wanted this 
issue to move to the procedure and House affairs committee where 
it could be aired and where the member for Lakeland and other 
members could talk to the committee.  I sat on that committee for 
two years and had to deal with some of the issues which hon. 
members have talked about, such as the leaking of confidential 
reports by all members of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The procedure and House affairs committee found that to be an 
unacceptable way for members of the House to conduct themselves. 
At the end of the day, all we are trying to do in this place is 
the nation's business and the work as well as we possibly can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point that seems to be missed here, which the member for 
Lakeland is trying to confuse, is not whether it was appropriate 
to go into in camera meetings, but whether there was a motion 
duly put to the committee as to whether we ought to go in camera. 
We were discussing options.  We were discussing a summary of what 
the witnesses said.  We had yet to move to debate on the 
confidential document, and for that we all agreed that it should 
have been, and was, done in public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The moment we start to draft a confidential report with 
recommendations, at that point we must all respect the rules of 
the House.  We must respect one another.  We cannot sit on every 
committee.  Therefore, it is incumbent upon every member to do 
the nation's business in committee on behalf of all 301 members 
of the House, and only release information to the public after it 
has been reported to the House.  That will ensure that members of 
parliament will get to know and decide before the public as to 
what should be made public and what should be concurred in.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must admit that the member for Lakeland was upset so he 
decided to release the report which was confidential and in fact 
that is why it was contrary to the rules.  Perhaps he was upset 
because he thought the immigration minister had already written a 
piece of legislation without the input of the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We tried to point out that was not the case.  It was not the 
case.  A minister and the ministry over a period of time have to 
consult with Canadians, provincial counterparts and a number of 
people on a number of issues before a bill is put forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because he was so disturbed that perhaps all of the hard work 
that was done by the committee would be for naught, the member 
decided it was incumbent upon him to take a confidential report 
which was only half complete and call a news conference for the 
purpose of letting the public know what the committee was dealing 
with in regard to our refugee determination system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speaker earlier today heard all of the evidence put forward 
by me and the member for Lakeland, and in fact he found there to 
be a prima facie case of privilege.  I might be mistaken but I 
also heard that the member for Lakeland expressed an apology.  I 
hope that is the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some members are saying those are the rules of the House. We are 
trying to be helpful here.  We are trying to learn from one 
another.  We are trying to ensure that the House is respected, 
that we can move forward and work together as much as possible in 
a non-partisan way in doing the nation's business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the member has already apologized to the Speaker and to the 
House, I would suggest that the House would be best served if I 
withdrew my motion.  I ask for unanimous consent to withdraw my 
motion on the basis that the member has already apologized to the 
House for the breach of privilege. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I am sorry I was not 
paying close attention, but I have been informed that the member 
for London North Centre is prepared to withdraw his motion. If 
the member is prepared to withdraw his motion, then he would have 
to do it formally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Fontana:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to formally 
withdraw my motion. I do that on the basis that there has been 
consultation among the House leaders and that I heard earlier 
this afternoon that the member for Lakeland has apologized to the 
House for breaching the privileges of the House and for releasing 
the report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps you could ask him to confirm that he has apologized to 
the House. If that is the case, with the unanimous consent of the 
House I am prepared to move that I remove my motion to refer the 
issue to the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Because it is the 
amendment that is before the House, we would have to ask to 
remove the amendment and the motion.  Speaking for the Chair, it 
would be an elegant way to move beyond this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for London North Centre must request that the 
amendment and the motion be withdrawn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Fontana:</B>  Mr. Speaker, in the spirit of moving 
beyond this, I had asked whether or not the member for Lakeland 
was prepared to confirm that he had apologized to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just asked him personally while you were standing and asking 
me to do so.  He said that he was not prepared to confirm that he 
apologized to the House.  Therefore I am not moving that my 
motion be removed.

pointed out some concerns I have with the way the committee is 
operating.  I have also heard the ruling of the Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since I have examined the ruling of the Speaker, it is clear 
that the Speaker said that a motion should be put forth to refer 
the matter to the Standing Committee on Procedure and House 
Affairs because I had violated some rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of that ruling by the Speaker, I do apologize.  I would

On the basis of what the hon. member for Lakeland has just said,

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Jordan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, when the issue is stripped 
down what I am hearing is that the Reform member is arguing that 
the ends justified the means.  He expressed frustration at the 
rules of the House and then knowingly broke them, I guess to 
invite confrontation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When there is a document that is marked “confidential until 
tabled in the House” and a member has a press conference on it, 
I would say that the member has knowingly and deliberately broken 
the rules of the House.  I do not know how we could come to any 
other conclusion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member share that view?  Is this simply an 
argument of the ends justifying the means? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Fontana:</B>  Madam Speaker, I would hope that is not 
the motive of the hon. member for Lakeland or the game he wants 
to play. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very important issue.  The committee went in camera to 
discuss not the options paper but to discuss the draft report 
along with the recommendations. We spent the better part of a day 
looking at that discussion paper and recommendations.  The member 
participated.

</I></B></P><P align=left>He objected to the fact that he found in a brown envelope 
legislation that the minister had already drafted. We went to 
great lengths to point out to him that it was not a piece of 
legislation that was before the House or before a committee and 
in fact it was one way that ministries obviously look at 
consultation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before he held his news conference, I went over to him to plead 
with him not to release the hard work of the committee, that we 
still needed to do 50% of the work and we still needed to have 
two additional meetings. I invited him to attend the meetings. He 
refused to participate any further in the meetings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I told him that over the course of the six months that I have 
been Chair and he has been a committee member that he has done 
some very useful work.  I pleaded with him to respect the rules 
of the House, that when a committee is looking at something in 
confidence he ought to have respect for his fellow members of 
parliament and deal with it in a very conscientious and serious 
manner.  I said that if he had some procedure problems he may not 
agree with that belong to the House and to the committee, then 
perhaps he should put those concerns on paper to the Speaker so 
the procedure and House affairs committee could deal with them 
once and for all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ends do not justify the means.  The fact is the House wants 
to do some very good work and needs to do it. The standing orders 
say that if there is a confidential report, it cannot be released 
before it is tabled in the House.  To do so a member would find 
himself in breach of privileges.  That is precisely what the 
Speaker found this afternoon, a prima facie case of breach of 
privilege to the House and to all of its members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This kind of action is not to be condoned at all.  It is 
reprehensible when confidential committee reports are leaked by 
any member of the House, regardless of whether or not they are 
members of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are to respect the rules of the House.  That is what 
democracy is all about.  It is about respecting rules.  It is 
about changing the rules if in fact we feel they must be changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ends do not justify the means.  Just because members do not 
like the rules does not mean they call a news conference for the 
purposes of making public something that should remain in 
confidence until the House has had the opportunity to debate it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</B> Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to bring to your attention on page 140 of Erskine 
May a ruling of the Chair in a previous situation similar to what 
we are dealing with here today.  About halfway down the page in 
dealing with these complaints of breach of privilege it says that 
when the member accused has made a proper apology for his 
offence, the incriminating motion has usually been withdrawn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is exactly where we are right now.  The member for Lakeland 
has said that having examined the ruling of the Chair earlier, he 
has made an apology for his actions. He understandably has some 
problems with how the committee is run, but that fight is going 
to have to be fought in committee and will continue hopefully 
without rancour in the days to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nowhere does Erskine May say that the motion has to be withdrawn 
with unanimous consent.  It just says the motion has usually been 
withdrawn.  I would ask the Speaker to ask both the mover of the 
motion, and the mover of the amendment in this case, if they are 
prepared to withdraw their motions.  It seems to me according to 
Erskine May that should be acceptable and we could get on with 
the business of the House because I think that is really what we 
are all here to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  If I understand 
correctly, the hon. member is saying that such a motion which was 
presented earlier does not need the consent of the House.  I do 
not believe that is so. Any motion brought before the House needs 
the consent of the House. What I could do at this time is put the 
question again and see whether we have consent.

<P><A NAME="LINK195"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I believe the debate is now on the amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my pleasure to rise and debate this issue.  It is 
important that we have a chance to really talk about what is 
happening.  Despite what we have heard from the Liberals across 
the way, this is about more than whether my colleague did 
something that broke the rules of the House by releasing a 
document that was supposed to be confidential.  We already know 
that my colleague has very graciously apologized for anything 
that he did that may have violated the rules.  He has done the 
right thing.  This gives us an opportunity to talk about a larger 
issue and that is very important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A minute ago my colleague from across the way and, previous to 
him, another Liberal colleague, said that the ends do not justify 
the means.  I suggest that the rules that govern committees 
really are the means that justify the ends.  This is a situation 
where rules have been put in place that allow the governing side 
to do whatever it wants and that justify any decision it makes 
without really having to put up with the messy business of 
democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will explain exactly what I mean.  We have a situation where 
my friend has complained that the committee agreed that the issue 
of the draft report would be discussed only in public.  It then 
affirmed in a vote that the issue would not be discussed in 
camera.  It was to be discussed publicly.  What did it do?  It 
did not vote to go in camera, it just went in camera.  The chair 
said “We are in camera now”.  Apparently that is all that is 
required.  Mr. Speaker rose and said “That is the way it is in 
committees.  Committees govern themselves”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Fontana:</B>  Madam Speaker, we were gracious enough 
to put the motion to withdraw but there was no unanimous consent 
from this side.  I wonder if you could clarify this, Madam 
Speaker.  On the point of relevancy, it seems to me that the 
Reform Party is again challenging the Speaker— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I am afraid that is 
debate not a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Fontana:</B>  Madam Speaker, in terms of debate, there 
is a question of relevancy to the point.  It seems to me that 
what some members over there are talking about is challenging the 
ruling of the Speaker with regard to this prima facie case of 
privilege.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</B> Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  The member for London North Centre knows full well that 
is not a point of order.  It is a point of debate.  If he wants 
to debate he should get on during questions and comments.  Let 
the debate continue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I believe that the 
hon. member for Medicine Hat was using his time for debate 
properly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  Madam Speaker, the point I was making 
before my friend started to challenge the ruling of the Speaker 
was that this is a situation where the government has done 
everything that it can to ensure that the rules that govern 
committees favour the government.  There is no question about 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have already recounted what has happened to my colleague.  He 
admits that he violated the rules and, out of frustration, went 
to the lengths that he did, and that is absolutely relevant. It 
also points to the problem in general of a mouthing of a 
commitment to democracy in this place, but when it gets down to 
brass tacks as to whether we are really a democratic institution, 
I think the answer is no.  We are not nearly the democratic 
institution that we could be, and there are so many examples of 
that.  I am sure I could give a long list of examples but I do 
not want to scare people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want people to consider what happens when we select committee 
chairs in the first place.  The opposition comes in, the 
government members come in and not far behind them is the whip. 
The whip sits there— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill:</B>  The government whip. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  Yes, the government whip sits there to 
make sure that we have a democratic vote.  All the government 
people sit and vote in favour of a Liberal to be the chair of 
that committee.  That is democracy Liberal style.  If they do 
not, they will be punished.  That is why that government whip 
sits there every time and that is how that works. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember very well that when I sat on the Canadian heritage 
committee a few years ago the Bloc Quebecois was the official 
opposition.  This was a Canadian heritage committee protecting 
Canadian heritage.  It was of course Bloc members who were made 
vice-chairs of that committee because the government members were 
told that they had to support— 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I wonder if you might seek unanimous consent of the House to 
suspend debate on the motion and begin Private Members' Business 
at 5.30 p.m. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On a number of occasions now, for a variety of reasons, we have 
put off debate on the hon. member's bill on shipyards. 
He would be very happy if we could have unanimous consent to 
suspend debate on the motion and proceed with Private Members' 
Business. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Kilger:</B>  Mr. Speaker, given the intervention of my 
colleague from the Bloc Quebecois, I understand that there are 
some discussions going on among the leaders of the parties, and 
although we are getting close to 5.30, I would give advance 
notice that I would decline unanimous consent at this point to 
the request of the member.  Hopefully between now and 5.30 the 
matter might be resolved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The member for 
Rimouski—Mitis has put a request for unanimous consent, so I 
will put the request for unanimous consent before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is there unanimous consent of the House to go to Private 
Members' Business at this time? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I hope I can finish what 
I want to say.  People keep interrupting me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many examples of how the government mouths a 
commitment to democracy and simply does not follow through, and 
the rules allow it to do this.  As Mr. Speaker pointed out in his 
ruling, we have a situation where committees are really the 
masters of their own affairs.  When we have government members 
sitting in a majority position on these committees, it 
effectively means that they have carte blanche. There is no such 
thing as individual rights for members of parliament.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A minute ago I mentioned the situation a few year's ago when I 
was sitting on the Canadian heritage committee.  At that time the 
Bloc Quebecois was the official opposition, but there was some 
support for an opposition member other than a Bloc member to be a 
vice-chair of that committee.  Duly we saw the whip come in and 
ensure that the Bloc Quebecois became the vice-chair on that 
committee.  We see this over and over again on other committees, 
even the last time we put committees together.  I think that is 
wrong.  Canadians expect the highest legislative Chamber in the 
country to be the most democratic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Completely to the contrary, we have a situation where we see an 
elected dictatorship.  I hate to use that term.  My friend, the 
transport minister, says “Oh no, oh no”, but we have a 
situation where Canadians from coast to coast say exactly that 
and they correctly suspect that we have a situation where between 
elections Canadians are effectively gagged because members are 
not allowed to represent their constituents.  We have rules in 
place that impede that.

</I></B></P><P align=left>First I congratulate the shipyard workers who have worked 
together tirelessly with industry representatives to press the 
federal government to keep the commitment it made, upon coming to 
office, to put in place a shipbuilding policy for Canada and, I 
might add, to do it before it was too late. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do I say before it was too late?  Despite the proud 
tradition of our shipbuilding industry throughout the history of 
the country and despite its importance to our economy, our 
regional economies and our total national economy, it is 
unbelievable that through the 1990s the Canadian shipbuilding 
industry has been cut by more than one-half. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seven thousand jobs and over $250 million in annual wages have 
been lost to regions that desperately needed that infusion into 
their economy but, most important, they were lost to families who 
depended upon those jobs and those wages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take the opportunity to acknowledge the presence in the 
gallery today of a number of representatives of those hard 
working shipyard workers.  They have kept the campaign going, 
kept the issue before the Canadian public, and gained the support 
of municipal governments, provincial governments, industry 
representatives, labour representatives, and a very broad range 
of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In part, this debate is about how in the name of heaven we will 
win the support of the federal Liberal government to put in place 
the Canadian shipbuilding policy that is so badly needed. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to congratulate the member for 
Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière for introducing this bill.  It 
is very brief—only three pages long.  But I must say that if we 
could convince the federal government to establish a nationwide 
policy on shipbuilding, the impact would be enormous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be enormous for shipyard workers throughout Canada.  It 
would be enormous for the Canadian shipbuilding industry.  It 
would also be enormous for our coastal communities, those of the 
Great Lakes region and the St. Lawrence Seaway. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a way the fight for a national shipbuilding policy is about 
more than shipbuilding.  It is about thousands of desperately 
needed jobs in the least prosperous areas of Canada.  It is about 
skills that are crucial to our capabilities as a coastal and 
seafaring nation.  In that sense it can be said that this is a 
fight that is not just about shipbuilding but is about 
nation-building. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me say as a member of parliament who is privileged to 
represent a constituency that is one of those communities with an 
important shipbuilding component, I am very concerned about the 
future of shipbuilding in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be less than honest if I did not say that I am extremely 
angry at the federal government.  The federal government was 
given the privilege and the opportunity to govern.  It promised 
the people in Atlantic Canada and across the country that if it 
were elected in the 1993 election it would make Canadian 
shipbuilding a priority.  Some priority.  Seven years and people 
are still waiting, seven very lean years for shipbuilders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week I wrote to the Minister of Industry, as many people 
have done.  I pleaded with him to be willing, at the very least, 
to respond to the pleas of shipyard workers and industry 
representatives to convene a national summit on the future of 
Canadian shipbuilding in a global marketplace before the entire 
shipbuilding industry sank in the wake of Liberal neglect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the bill before us proposes is very practical.  It is 
concrete.  It is doable. 
They are measures that should comprise part of the Canadian 
shipbuilding policy.

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The aim of this bill is reasonable.  It could allow Canada to 
enjoy the same opportunities as our competitors. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This problem has not just developed over this decade.  The fact 
of the matter is that in the early eighties the then Liberal 
government removed some very important support to the 
shipbuilding industry.  Since that time we have witnessed a 
steady severe slide in shipbuilding, particularly so for anything 
but government purposes, defence vessels or patrol vessels.  The 
fact is that shipbuilding for commercial markets has been very 
limited because Canada has placed itself at a very severe 
competitive disadvantage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take one moment to look at what the situation is in the 
United States, our nearest neighbour and our largest competitor. 
The United States has put in place a comprehensive policy to 
support its own shipbuilding industry.  It actually succeeded in 
getting Canada to agree to grandfather the Jones Act in the 
flawed free trade agreement which had in place and kept in place 
very distinct advantages that made perfect sense for an economy 
to protect for its own benefit.  The Jones Act continues to apply 
and continues to require a very significant number of ships to 
carry the goods being transported in and out of the United 
States.  It is also supplemented by title 11 financing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is title 11 financing?  It is an aggressive industrial 
policy to build for rapidly growing new markets in shipbuilding. 
It is a policy that recognizes there needs to be a transition and 
in fact has put in place measures to ease the transition from 
military contracts to commercial vessels.  Surely Canadians 
deserve no less than a comprehensive national shipbuilding policy 
for Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me simply repeat the obvious and why it is so obvious to 
most Canadians and so obscure for the federal Liberals to 
understand.  We need to put in place a Canadian shipbuilding 
policy or we will not have the shipbuilding capacity or the 
shipbuilding jobs we need.  At the very least, we should convene 
that summit, face the challenges squarely and examine what our 
competitors are doing that makes it so difficult for us to 
compete. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate the member for putting forward the bill.  I hope 
Liberal members will see the wisdom and the importance of 
supporting it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  There are six 
members who would like to speak and we have 24 minutes left of 
debate.  I realize this is a little unusual, but if we try to get 
everyone to limit their interventions to no more than four 
minutes we will be able to let many more people speak.  We will 
do this with unanimous consent.  Otherwise we will go to 10 
minutes as we normally do and we will only get a few people in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask for 
unanimous consent that for the remaining 24 minutes of debate 
members will speak for only four minutes each. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé:</B> I rise on a point of  order, Mr. Speaker. I 
understand that members may be excited to speak on this issue. I 
find it difficult to object, in fact I am pleased, but we have the 
same time limit. I think each party should be allowed at least 
one speaker. It would be important that each party be able to

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  All parties have 
already had a number of speakers.  We either have this before the 
House or we do not.  We will do it or we will not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the House give its unanimous consent that the remaining 
members will be limited to four minutes, with the exception of 
the hon. member for Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière who already 
has five minutes? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK205"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat O'Brien (London—Fanshawe, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to respond to this private member's bill, put forward 
by the hon. member for Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière.  Frankly, 
the bill sounds a bit like a broken record and essentially 
repeats the same old demands for subsidies and tax breaks which 
our government has been hearing from the shipbuilding industry 
since 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The industry is asking for a tax haven, but the Canadian 
taxpayers are asking for tax breaks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are very clear.  They do not want government to 
artificially prop up industries through interventionist and 
costly financial measures like the one suggested in Bill C-213. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the second reading debate the hon. member for Elk Island 
argued that the bill's proposed loan guarantee program, similar 
to the American Title XI program, would be cost free.  He said 
“The American taxpayers have not shelled out one red nickel in 
order to implement the program”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me put this myth to rest right now.  Loan guarantee programs 
are not free of cost.  In 1998 costs to the American government 
were roughly $3 billion U.S. for contingent liabilities and 
almost $2 million on default payments.  Based on our neighbour's 
experience it is evident that such a program would be very costly 
to set up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member also contended that if ships built in Canadian 
shipyards were exempted from the regulations relating to lease 
financing, the existing depreciation rates for ships would apply 
without any restrictions.  Consequently, he argues, the tax 
disadvantage that prevents ownership or lease financing of ships 
would be eliminated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that the shipbuilding industry already has access to 
accelerated capital cost allowances.  These are more generous 
than for any other industry in Canada, and even more generous 
than tax credits in the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, Canadian taxpayers would never accept both an 
accelerated CCA and an exemption from leasing regulations.  If 
this were permitted the cost of a ship could be written off more 
than once and it would create a tax shelter.  That is what the 
current leasing regulations help us avoid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A third measure proposed in Bill C-213 is yet another demand for 
a tax break.  It would create on a national basis the same type 
of program that Quebec set up in 1996-97.  The tax measures 
proposed in the bill are not only costly to taxpayers, they are 
old, tired, interventionist tools from the past, the very tools 
which Canadians want us to stop using. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must take charge of the future, not by returning to the past, 
but by investing in innovation, by training smart workers and 
giving them upgraded equipment and production techniques to do 
the job, and by forging alliances that will lead industries in 
the pursuit of excellence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The policy instruments used by the federal government are modern 
instruments.  They concentrate on areas that can make a real 
difference and that use taxpayers' money wisely.  The acquisition 
of new builds in Canada by the federal government is done on a 
competitive basis and is restricted to Canadian sources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that we have agreed to a four minute limit.  There is 
much more I could say in explaining in detail why this is simply 
not a good suggestion in the private member's bill, however well 
intentioned.  Canadians simply do not want to return to those 
kinds of mistakes from the past.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am not unsympathetic to the private member's bill put 
forward by my colleague, because I understand his concern. 
Canada was once a great shipbuilding nation and there are niche 
markets in which we could probably still operate, given the 
opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, there is a severe overcapacity in the 
shipbuilding industry worldwide.  The origins of that 
overcapacity in shipbuilding relate directly to heavily 
subsidized operations in other countries.  Indeed, protected 
markets and subsidies are major obstacles facing Canadian 
shipbuilders.  Nonetheless, we do not help matters by slapping a 
25% duty on non-NAFTA imports ourselves.  I think that sets the 
wrong tone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The world is fraught with overcapacity and trade distorting 
subsidies, and the future is not bright for these industries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian government could help.  It could do something about 
this.  For example, we could take on the U.S. in trade 
negotiations and try to strike down the Jones Act, which is 
hurting Canadian shipbuilders to a great degree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could do other things.  We could try to get relief by having 
worldwide subsidies reduced through trade negotiations at the 
WTO. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could do something at home.  We could reduce taxes, not only 
to the shipbuilding industry, but to all industries in Canada. 
That would be a big help.  We could move to a different tax 
regime in which we would have accelerated capital cost 
write-offs.  Those are things which we could do something about 
in our own backyard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance believes that there needs to be a healthy 
shipbuilding industry as well.  Certainly there are things like 
ferries and tugs and special niche markets in which Canada could 
operate, given a level playing field.  Unfortunately, we do not 
have that level playing field, just like we do not have it in 
agriculture.  Other countries are subsidizing their shipbuilding 
industries.  Canada should not be the boy scouts in this kind of 
situation.  We should not stand by when our industries are being 
severely affected.  The agriculture and shipbuilding industries 
are severely disadvantaged.  We have to take a much stronger 
stance at trade talks and we have to protect our vital interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, I believe that our shipbuilding industry, 
along with other industries, has to operate within the confines 
of a market economy.  Once we are able to achieve those 
negotiations, if we are able to achieve them, then the industry 
should be able to stand on its own two feet and not receive 
subsidized loans from the federal government.  That is our 
position.  We should have a strong shipbuilding industry, but we 
have to put the proper environment in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  That would only take about 10 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson:</B>  I hear a magpie from the other end of 
the House.  I assume he will have his chance to talk sooner or 
later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My point is that Canada has to set the proper environment 
through tough trade negotiations to set some of these matters 
straight, and then we could have a strong industry.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in spite of 
the limited time at our disposal, only four minutes, I want to 
take a moment to congratulate the hon. member for 
Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière for his extraordinary work in the 
past two years to set up a coalition of employers and workers 
all across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During that period, our colleague managed to visit every 
shipyard in Canada, as well as some in Asia, including in 
Taiwan, and in the United States. He made numerous 
representations to the Minister of Industry and to the Prime 
Minister. He also had his bill signed by 100 members of the 
opposition, which allowed him to introduce it. 
Our colleague did an extraordinary job and the community in 
Quebec and Canada can never be too grateful to him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is to be hoped that, in spite of the comments made earlier by 
the Liberal member, the government will wake up and stop 
ignoring the perfectly legitimate demands of managers and unions 
on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Shipbuilding has traditionally been a key sector, and for good 
reason, since Canada is bordered by three oceans and  we have 
the St. Lawrence River and the largest seaway in the world. It 
is only normal and legitimate for Canada to have had, and this 
should continue to be the case, such an important naval shipyard 
industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière has had to face 
incredible apathy from the members opposite. We just had 
evidence of that earlier, once more. In spite of all his 
representations, our colleague's efforts have so far been in 
vain, unless some Liberal members, in private and behind the 
scenes—the Liberal excel at that—have shown some form of 
openmindedness in the recent past.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is most surprising and even vexing to hear such things as we 
just have, because in recent history the Liberals made 
commitments in the red book, as they had on the GST and NAFTA, 
saying that they would look after the shipyards.  I can read a 
resolution passed in a recent Liberal convention, one filled 
with whereases, which states as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Be it resolved that the Liberal Party of Canada strongly urge 
the Canadian government to immediately develop a national 
shipbuilding policy in order to provide assistance to that 
industry and thus to maintain and reinforce the level of 
excellence of the technologies that have earned us a high 
reputation we are now in danger of losing. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the words of the Liberal Party and yet the Liberal 
government will absolutely not budge on this matter.  There is 
nothing but total lethargy; it refuses to do anything.  To give 
an example, not only is it doing nothing, but as far as the 
measures are concerned which the hon. member for 
Lévis—Chutes-de-la-Chaudière is suggesting and which tax legislation 
can improve, loan guarantees and tax credits, the Government of 
Quebec has already established tax credits for Quebec 
shipbuilders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has the Liberal government done since then, despite its 
commitments in the red book, despite the proposals made at the 
Liberal Party's convention?  They are taxing the tax advantages 
Quebec shipyards have received because of the Quebec 
government's tax credits.  That is what collaboration and 
openmindedness means to this government, which is as lethargic 
in this matter as in others, a government the people are going 
to get rid of within a few months, perhaps. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are thousands and thousands of jobs at stake.  A few years 
ago, Canada's shipyards provided 12,000 jobs and now the figure 
is less than 3,000.  What is at issue here is international 
competition, with Asia for example, where there is a 30% 
subsidy, with Europe and its 9% subsidy, and the United States 
with its protectionist measures with which everyone is familiar. 
The Canadian government must bring itself up to speed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK208"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I am very proud to speak to this issue. I want to congratulate 
my colleague from the Bloc Quebecois. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very pleased to rise to speak in support of this bill. 
There was no hesitation whatsoever coming from Atlantic Canada 
and coming from the Progressive Conservative Party in lending our 
unfettered support for this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Shipbuilding has had a long and proud history in Atlantic Canada 
and throughout the country.  My riding of 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough has played a major role in the 
shipbuilding industry in Nova Scotia and around the world, 
particularly in the days of wood, wind and sail.  The tradition 
has been carried on through the recent efforts of MM Industra in 
Pictou, Nova Scotia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>MM Industra constructs some of the finest yachts in the world 
and is contributing greatly to the local economy in revitalizing 
the historic Pictou shipyard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Conservative Party of Canada has been clear and 
consistent in its call for a national shipbuilding program.  The 
government has yet to commit, in typical Liberal fashion, to 
Atlantic Canada, which led of course to its very poor showing in 
the election results of 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our party supports Bill C-213, an act to promote shipbuilding, 
which was introduced in the previous parliament as Bill C-493 by 
the hon. member for Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière.  The bill 
does not involve direct government subsidies, as has been 
previously suggested, but rather it proposes tax measures which 
would create jobs and move toward a more productive and 
co-operative business atmosphere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill essentially asks for three measures, which are called 
for as well by the Canadian Shipbuilding Association.  First, the 
thorough establishment of a program whereby a maximum of 87.5% of 
the money borrowed by a company from financial institutions to 
purchase a commercial ship which would be built in a shipyard 
located in Canada would be guaranteed by the federal government. 
Second, it would bear a rate of interest comparable to other 
available loans from financial institutions.  Third, it would be 
repayable on terms compatible with those usually granted by 
financial institutions to large and financially strong 
corporations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of very positive aspects to the bill.  It is 
aimed at enhancing the age old industry which has been very 
productive for Atlantic Canada and for other parts of the 
country.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many Canadians in coastal regions have wondered why Ottawa has 
done nothing in this regard after other countries continue to 
announce and reannounce their support for shipbuilding in their 
countries.  The government tries to rest on its laurels but the 
reality is that it does not have any to rest on.  The 
government's legacy, which is becoming very tired, stagnant and 
arrogant—we know the terms—shows no vision.  It rewards 
mediocrity.  It prefers to do nothing, which is what it is 
bringing forward now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is ironic that an Atlantic Liberal report entitled “Catching 
Tomorrow's Wave” tabled in November 1999 stated that the 
Atlantic Canadian economy is hitting an all-time low and part of 
the solution to the problem is to bring the shipbuilding industry 
back up to its potential and proven strength by adopting a new 
national shipbuilding policy. Not a single member from Atlantic 
Canada on the Liberal benches had anything to say about this 
private member's bill, not a word.  It is very curious that they 
have decided not to participate in the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister shrugs and says “Higher taxes?  Better jobs 
in the States?  Go ahead and leave”.  The same approach is taken 
when it comes to an important industry like shipbuilding. 
Shipyard workers are suffering and so are the spin-off industries 
and the Liberal government has chosen to do nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is like the Liberal promises on all kinds of other issues. 
It is like the dense fog before the election; after the writ is 
dropped and the election is over, it disappears.  It evaporates. 
That is what we have come to expect from the Liberal government.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
first like to express my gratitude to the member for 
Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière for all of his efforts on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For quite some time, for a number of years, he has formed a 
coalition of people from the shipbuilding industry, unions, 
builders and industrialists in the sector to draft Bill C-213.  I 
think the government should support it if only to help this 
major industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At one point, the industry was thriving in Canada.  It had 
considerable potential for creating good, high end jobs. 
To think that this government was elected on the promise of 
jobs, jobs, jobs, and that today, at least according to my 
colleague, the member for London—Fanshawe, it appears to be 
wanting to smother this industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-213 contains some extremely constructive proposals that 
have none of the wastage found at the Department of Human 
Resources Development and in other departments, as is being 
shown increasingly these days.  There is no wastage.  On the 
contrary, it is a framework, solid support, similar to what 
already exists in the United States under title XI, which, since 
its passage, has not wasted a single cent.  In fact, all the 
projects, all the programs set up in the United States in the 
context of title XI, the guaranteed loan, have paid off 
handsomely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why not institute a similar program here in Canada?  Because the 
government lacks confidence in the shipping industry and lacks 
vision and does not have its heart in the right place to want to 
create jobs of this calibre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that in a country such as Canada, which opens onto two 
oceans, which has a seaway among the finest in the world, the 
government does not want to go to the trouble to support this 
bill, I find quite deplorable.  I find it deplorable that the 
Liberals do not want to support this bill as it should be 
supported, because it is an excellent bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It could go a long way toward helping create jobs in this 
sector.  Once again, I would like to close by congratulating my 
colleague, the member for Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière on all the 
work he has done in preparing this bill.

pride to rise on behalf of my brothers and sisters in the 
shipbuilding industry, those hardworking people who build the 
greatest ships in Canada and around the world to speak to this 
very important and timely bill brought forward by the great 
member for Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière.  My party 
congratulates the member for his outstanding work in bringing 
Bill C-213 to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very happy that the member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough mentioned the Conservatives' 
report although we would like to know what Joe Clark would have 
to say about it.  We only wish that the Conservative government 
when it was negotiating the free trade deal, had included 
shipbuilding in that deal, similar to what the United States did 
when it protected itself with the Jones Act.  If that had been 
done we probably would not be having this debate right now. That 
is old history. I have a little more history for the Liberals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see one of my good colleagues and friends over there, a soccer 
player whom I admire greatly.  In the 1993 red book, their 
election promise was, “Vote for us.  Trust us and we will give 
the country a shipbuilding”.  It is seven years later and not 
one damn thing has been done about that, not one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government continually misleads the general public.  Its 
Atlantic caucus is saying very clearly to the government and to 
the members of the Liberal Party that in order to improve its 
electoral chances in Atlantic Canada it needs a shipbuilding 
policy.  What does the government do?  It ignores its own 
backbench members. It is absolutely scandalous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to give the Liberals who are here listening to this a 
lesson in election 101.  If they want to win any seats in 
Atlantic Canada, then put a shipbuilding policy in now. 
Organizations like the CAW, the Federation of Canadian 
Municipalities, the chambers of commerce, provinces and others 
are on side for a shipbuilding policy so that we can protect and 
preserve the thousands and thousands of well paying and skilled 
jobs that are in Atlantic Canada in Marystown, Saint John, my 
great city of Halifax and in other ports across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is absolutely insane that the government does not listen to 
the people of Atlantic Canada, western Canada, Quebec and 
Ontario. These people are not asking for handouts.  They are 
asking for jobs, jobs that other countries have.  Other 
governments support their workers and industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the greatest sins in the House of Commons is that the 
finance minister who runs Canada Steamship Lines Inc. has his 
ships built in other countries.  It is an absolute disgrace that 
he can stand up in the House and say that he wants to lead Canada 
in government, that he wants to be the prime minister, yet he 
turns his back on Canadians and those hardworking people of 
Atlantic Canada.  It is an absolute disgrace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tomorrow we are going to have a free vote on Bill C-213.  I only 
hope and pray that the government along with the Reform Party can 
actually see what has been happening in Atlantic Canada and will 
vote with their minds and their hearts in support of Bill C-213.

has been advocated by a number of members of parliament on both 
sides of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There will be a vote on Bill C-213. All the vote is about is 
whether the bill merits being sent to committee to be studied 
further.  If there are particular aspects of the bill that 
certain individuals do not advocate, it is their opportunity to 
use the parliamentary procedure that exists to amend it in 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are four initiatives in the bill put forward by the member 
for Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first initiative is to ensure that we re-establish bilateral 
trade talks with the Americans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second initiative is to ensure that we have accelerated 
depreciation within Revenue Canada leasing regulations, which is 
a tax cut and not a subsidy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third initiative is to have a loan guarantee program very 
similar to what the Americans have, known as title XI. This loan 
guarantee program ensures that potential purchasers both 
domestically and abroad have access to capital in the most 
prudent and cost effective manner possible.

allow me to respond and to conclude this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, I would like to thank all members who spoke to 
this bill, not just today, but also in the first two hours of 
debate.  I am truly grateful.  That goes for Liberal members as 
well.  We live in a democracy, and they expressed their views, 
which I believe is important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was very pleased to see that the leaders of the New Democratic

during the debate today.  Seeing the opposition party leaders 
speak during a debate on a private member's bill is a great 
honour for me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also wish to thank the 100 members who signed my bill last 
spring so that it could be given priority.  Had they not done 
so, I would still be waiting for the luck of the draw and there 
would be no debate today.  I therefore thank these 100 members, 
40 of them in the Bloc Quebecois, because not everyone could be 
present, all members of the Progressive Conservative and New 
Democratic parties, and 20 members of the Reform Party, now 
called the Canadian Alliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to pay tribute to the member for Elk Island, who came to 
support me at public meetings. 
The former Canadian Alliance critic attended a press conference, 
as did the leader of the New Democratic Party, the leader of the 
Bloc Quebecois, and a representative of the Progressive 
Conservative House leader.  Canadian Alliance members had 
supported the idea of this bill last year.  They wanted a debate 
to be held. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appeal to the Liberal members.  Because of the size of the 
majority, several have told me individually that they were 
sensitive to this issue.  I checked with the whip, and the 
position of the Liberal party is that there should be a free 
vote on a private member's bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am well aware that some members represented the Minister of 
Industry's view in the House.  In recent months, when the 
Minister of Industry began visiting people in the Atlantic 
region or elsewhere, we saw that he was becoming more sensitive 
to their problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also noticed that the Minister of Labour was concerned as 
well, as a member representing a riding in the Atlantic region. 
Unfortunately, I did not hear many members from the Vancouver 
region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To say no to this bill is to say no to 150,000 people who sent a 
postcard to the Prime Minister telling him that they support 
this bill. To say no to this bill is also to say no to all the 
provincial premiers. Twice during federal-provincial conferences, 
once in 1997 and again in 1999, in Quebec City, they urged the 
Liberal government to support a shipbuilding policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To say no to this bill is to say no to the Liberal grassroots 
who, at the Liberal convention, two years ago, passed a 
resolution in favour of such a policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To say no to this bill is to say no to a joint request from 
Canada's shipyard owners, the largest shipyards, and it is also 
to say no to all the workers who, through a labour coalition, 
reached a consensus and decided to support their employers and 
make the same request. 
Why?  Because, in 1993, there were 12,000 workers in Canada's 
shipyards.  There are barely 3,000 now.  Two great shipyards are 
facing closure.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Minister of Industry says there is an overcapacity 
worldwide, I suggest he read the London <I>Journal of Commerce</I>, 
which says that demand has revived and that, at present, 
Canadian shipyards, like the English shipyards, are capable of 
entering this field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I address my remarks to the members of the Canadian Alliance, 
who think there are grants where there are none.  There are no 
grants, but tax measures and a program of loans with automatic 
pay back like the one they have had in the U.S. since 1938. 
The American government has not lost one cent in a similar 
program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the tax measures, they come after construction.  When 
people are put to work, revenues, taxes and the GST enable the 
federal government and the provincial governments to recover 
their costs. All those who wanted to create “jobs, jobs, jobs” 
have their chance now.  We know that second reading deals with 
the principles of a bill, and the purpose of this bill is to 
help shipbuilding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I close by saying that a vote against this bill is a blow to the 
shipbuilding industry.

hon. members for co-operating in the debate tonight and moving it 
right along.  I think members will see that if people are 
speaking extemporaneously from their hearts, the debate is much 
more meaningful and works well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pursuant to order made earlier today, all questions necessary to 
dispose of the motion are deemed put and the recorded division 
deemed demanded and deferred until Wednesday, March 29 at the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, on February 22 I asked the Prime Minister why it was 
that the U.S. energy secretary could find 17 things to do to help 
Americans with respect to the energy crisis but that he could not 
think of one thing to help Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Secretary of State for International Financial Institutions, 
who is the brother of the former Liberal Premier of Ontario, 
David Peterson, responded.  In his response, as to whether or not 
the government had any kind of action plan to defend the Canadian 
economy from the OPEC oil cartel, he was so confused, so uptight 
and so upset that his brother was beaten by the NDP that he made 
an error.  I will quote from <I>Hansard</I>.  He said: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—when the NDP government was in power in Ontario and it raised 
the Ontario excise tax on fuel twice, taking it from 10.9 cents 
to 14.3 cents.  As well, it increased the provincial excise tax 
on gasoline twice, taking it from 11.3 cents to 14.7 cents. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That would make the provincial tax on fuel in Ontario 29 cents. 
It is of course only 14.7 cents in total.  Whereas the federal 
excise tax is 10 cents and the GST is about 4.9 cents right now. 
There are actually more taxes applied to oil in Ontario than in 
any other province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The supplementary question I asked was related to putting 
forward an action plan to protect Canadians and the economy from 
soaring energy prices.  Rather than getting a response from the 
secretary of state, I received a response from the Minister of 
Natural Resources who avoided the question entirely as did the 
secretary of state.  He said: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—to set the record clear...Canada is not a member of OPEC and we 
do not support that approach in the marketplace. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This had nothing to do with my question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wanted to know the government's plan.  The U.S.A., the land of 
free enterprise and capitalism, is establishing a 17 point action 
plan to defend its economy and its consumers from the OPEC oil 
cartel price fixing situation with respect to energy.  Canada has 
no such plan and no such action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wrote a letter to the Prime Minister asking him if he had a 
plan.  If he did not have a plan, I wanted to suggest one to him. 
He called the provinces and the major stakeholders in the energy 
business to an energy summit.  At the energy summit he locks the 
door, caps the energy prices and says, “Let us find a solution 
before I unlock the door”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have some suggestions.  Have his officials examine suspending 
the GST until the price of energy declines. He could look at an 
emergency fund for low income families who are under pressure 
with respect to the high costs of home heating fuel. He could 
look at a low interest loan to help truckers and small business 
through this high price energy situation.  He could examine 
regulating the industry as has been done in other parts of the 
world.  He could undertake to facilitate an energy conservation 
component.  He could toughen up the Competition Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are suggestions that his energy summit should be 
undertaking to review.  Instead we had the frivolous inane 
responses from two ministers which had no bearing or relationship 
to the questions that were asked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the parliamentary secretary tonight, what is the 
government's action plan to defend the Canadian consumer and the 
Canadian economy from the OPEC oil cartel price fixing situation 
as it applies to energy? 
<P><A NAME="LINK217"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cannis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I know when the member for 
Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre speaks on this issue he speaks from 
his heart.  He has good intentions to try to do the right thing 
not just for his constituents and the people in Saskatchewan but 
for all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is indeed a problem that we are faced with today. Sometimes 
we have to be responsible in what we say and how we respond. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member referred to the 17 point action plan and what the 
government was doing. He referred to regulations as well.  Let me 
point out very clearly that this issue has not just come to the 
forefront today. I remind the member and everyone in the House 
tonight that 47 Liberal members of parliament took on this issue 
quite some time back.  They exhausted the research and brought 
the data forward.  One of their main recommendations was to have 
an extensive study.  That is why the Conference Board of Canada 
has been selected to address this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the ministers have pointed out in the past in their responses 
to the questions in the House of Commons, the Government of 
Canada is greatly concerned with this issue for businesses and 
consumers.  The price of gasoline is not set by government; we 
all know that.  It is set by competitive market forces 
internationally, depending of course on demand. Many factors 
influence the price factor, how it is produced and how it is 
brought to market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me point out three things the government has done. First, 
Canada has joined its partners in the International Energy Agency 
in calling upon the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries 
and other crude oil suppliers to increase oil production in order 
to better balance global supply and demand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the federal government has contacted the provincial 
governments to determine what actions are being taken there 
since, I stress again as I have in the past, they have the 
authority to regulate prices at the pump should they wish to 
based on Canada's constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last, as I mentioned earlier, we have asked the Conference Board 
of Canada to do an extensive study on this issue.  This is an 
inclusive process.  It is not exclusive.  We want to engage in 
this discussion and the findings, not disengage.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> The motion to adjourn the 
House is now deemed to have been adopted. Accordingly, this 
House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m., pursuant to 
Standing Order 24(1).
