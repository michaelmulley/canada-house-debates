	The House resumed from June 10 consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Thalheimer (Timmins-Chapleau, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am responding to private member's motion M-205 
which seeks to provide further protection for property rights 
pursuant to the Canadian Bill of Rights.
<P>
	The Canadian Bill of Rights is part of this country's long and 
strong commitment to protecting human rights. With the coming of 
the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms in 1982, which 
duplicated many of the provisions of the Canadian Bill of Rights, it 
is important to understand how the bill of rights enacted in 1960 
fits into the larger scheme of human rights' protections in Canada.
<P>
	The Canadian Bill of Rights remains in force, but it is 
substantially different from the charter as it does not apply to 
provincial legislation or actions. It operates as a federal statute 
which is applicable to federal laws and actions. The charter 
expressly overrides any act that is inconsistent with it, while the 
Canadian Bill of Rights does not have an express provision which 
permits it to override other federal statutes.
<P>
	A noticeable difference between the bill and the charter is that 
the bill does not have a limitation clause as provided by section 1 of 
the Canada Charter of Rights and Freedoms. What does the lack of 
a limitation clause mean for the protection of property rights?
<P>
	It is important to understand that no rights are absolute. It is 
often necessary to limit rights to protect the widely shared values 
of the larger community.
<P>
	The hon. member for Comox-Alberni, in seeking to provide 
greater measures for the protection of property rights, has 
recognized that we cannot provide absolute protection for 
individual property rights.
<P>
	Many laws also recognize that others may have a legitimate 
interest in the property rights of another individual, including 
family law and environmental protection. Even provincial 
builders' lien acts recognize and impose limits on the individual's 
right to dispose of property.
<P>
	The bill of rights already contains a due process provision to 
protect property rights. The bill states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It is hereby recognized and declared that in Canada there have existed and shall 
continue to exist without discrimination by reason of race, national origin, colour, 
religion or sex, the following human rights and fundamental freedoms, namely,</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a) the right of the individual to life, liberty, security of the person and enjoyment 
of property, and the right not to be deprived thereof except by due process of the 
law-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	While there have not been many cases interpreting what this 
provision means, Walter Tarnopolsky, the noted scholar, in his 
commentary on the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms finds 
that the bill undoubtedly imposed a requirement of fair procedure 
and may also have imposed a requirement of fair compensation.
<P>
	The due process clause in the 14th amendment of the United 
States constitution, which protects life, liberty or property, has 
been held to impose a requirement of fair compensation for the loss 
of property. It can therefore be argued that the Canadian Bill of 
Rights continues to operate and provides sufficient protection for 
property.
<P>
	It should also be mentioned that some provincial bills of rights 
include protection for property rights. The Alberta bill of rights, 
now the Alberta individual rights protection act, protects the 
enjoyment of property by a due process clause. The Quebec charter 
of rights and freedoms gives some protection to the peaceful 
enjoyment and free disposition of his or her property to the 
deprivation of rights.
<P>
<B>(1105)</B>
<P>
	Why is it necessary to protect property rights? In a liberal 
democracy such as Canada, the protection of property is 
fundamental to encourage growth and development. For this reason 
our society recognizes and protects property in a number of ways.
<P>
	It is important to protect property. It is sufficiently protected 
through a host of common law statutes, including the bill of rights. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4830"> 4830 </A></B>
<P>
Our history is one of  recognizing and protecting real and personal 
property. As Canadians, we also value other rights as important.
<P>
	That is why I like the 14th amendment of the United States 
constitution which protects life, liberty or property. Section 7 of the 
charter of rights and freedoms protects the right to life, liberty and 
security of the person.
<P>
	Our primary concern is with protecting an individual's physical 
integrity. The issue of whether section 7 will be interpreted to 
include economic rights has not been determined. There can be no 
doubt that the drafters of the charter intended to protect the rights 
to life, liberty and security of the person as a primary right which is 
not to be deprived of, except in accordance with the principles of 
fundamental justice.
<P>
	We need to celebrate and be proud of our strong history of 
protecting human rights, including the right to own and dispose of 
property. Property rights in Canada are adequately protected. From 
a practical perspective, it is hard to think of a situation where the 
state would confiscate someone's property without providing for 
fair compensation. This amendment, to put it quite simply, is not 
necessary. It will not add anything to the numerous statutes and 
common laws that already protect the property rights of Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of M-205. I want to commend the work of my 
colleague from Comox-Alberni for bringing this motion forward 
and also to note the work done by the member for 
Yorkton-Melville who has brought in Bill C-284 which has a 
similar purpose to this motion.
<P>
	This motion is designed to strengthen and protect the property 
rights of Canadians. I wholeheartedly support M-205 for many 
reasons, which I will elaborate on momentarily.
<P>
	Let me review very quickly what this motion says. M-205 reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should provide a greater 
measure of protection for individual property rights by amending the Canadian Bill 
of Rights to read:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``1. Subject to such reasonable limits prescribed by law as can be demonstrably 
justified in a free and democratic society, every person has the right to the enjoyment 
of that person's personal and real property and the right not to be deprived thereof 
unless the person</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a) is accorded a fair hearing in accordance with the principles of fundamental 
justice, and</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(b) is paid fair compensation in respect of the property, and the amount of that 
compensation is fixed impartially, and is paid within a reasonable amount of time 
after the person is deprived of their property.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>2. Any person whose rights, as set out in section 1, have been infringed or denied 
may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction to obtain such remedy as the court 
considers appropriate and just in the circumstances''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It is my pleasure to speak today about this very important motion 
because I believe in the rights of Canadians, and specifically, the 
need to strengthen the protection of property rights.
<P>
	The motion would amend the Canadian Bill of Rights by adding 
two sections. The first section would protect Canadians' rights with 
respect to property. In any case where this right were to be 
restricted, this motion would guarantee the right to a fair hearing in 
accordance with the principles of fundamental justice. The second 
section gives individual property owners the right to fair 
compensation for their property and ensures compensation within a 
reasonable time period.
<P>
	What I find most surprising in this debate is that it has taken so 
long for the House to make a clear expression of its support for the 
protection of property rights. The importance of protecting 
property rights has long been recognized in Canada and around the 
world. Property rights are included in the 1948 United Nations 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, to which Canada is a 
signatory. Other democratic countries have already taken the lead 
in property rights' legislation, including the United States, 
Germany, Italy and Finland. Several Canadian provinces, including 
British Columbia, New Brunswick and Ontario have also initiated 
resolutions supporting stronger protection for property rights.
<P>
<B>(1110)</B>
<P>
	The debate about the protection of property rights is not new to 
the House either. In 1988 a motion to protect property rights 
received overwhelming support and was adopted as a resolution of 
the House. This was an example of cross-party support for the 
protection of property rights in Canada.
<P>
	The Deputy Speaker of the House at another time and in another 
capacity expressed the view of the importance of property rights 
and his concern with the adequate safeguarding of these rights in 
Canada. In his words: ``We must entrench the right to property in 
our Constitution. The right to hold and enjoy property provides one 
of the checks and balances against undue concentration of power in 
government at any level''.
<P>
	In fact, many members from the government side have in the 
past deemed there to be a need for stronger protection of property 
rights. In the early 1980s Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau who had 
originally written against property rights and the current Prime 
Minister both expressed the strong desire to strengthen the 
protection of property rights, so much so that the current 
government party wanted to go beyond this motion and entrench 
property rights into the charter of rights and freedoms.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4831"> 4831 </A></B>
<P>
	Back in 1980 the current Prime Minister said: ``In deciding 
which rights should be included in the charter, we have selected 
only those which we feel reflect the central values of our society. 
Each of the rights we have listed is an essential ingredient for the 
charter and all are rights which all Canadians should have 
regardless of where they live in our country''. This statement was 
made as part of his presentation to the provinces on the importance 
of strengthening the protection of property rights by entrenching 
them in the charter and they were included in his list.
<P>
	At the time several Canadian provinces as well as the opposition 
parties at the time frustrated the inclusion of property rights in the 
charter.
<P>
	While I am pleased to see that members of the government side, 
including their leader, have in the past recognized the need to better 
safeguard this important category of rights, entrenching them into 
the charter would require a constitutional amendment. This would 
be problematic, as we are all aware of the difficulty of amending 
the Constitution at the current time.
<P>
	The beauty of this motion is that it does not require an 
amendment to the Constitution. Because this motion targets the bill 
of rights as opposed to the charter of rights and freedoms, it is 
easier to amend and well within the jurisdiction of the House.
<P>
	Another advantage of M-205 is that the motion avoids concerns 
about encroaching on areas of provincial jurisdiction. In past 
debates on the issue concerns were raised about protecting property 
rights by including them in the charter. The objection was not about 
the importance of property rights, but rather about the 
encroachment of the federal government in areas of provincial 
jurisdiction through the charter.
<P>
	My colleague, in designing this motion deliberately targeted the 
bill of rights as opposed to the charter of rights and freedoms. The 
reason for this is that the charter applies to the provinces as well as 
to the federal government while the bill of rights applies only to 
areas of federal jurisdiction. By targeting the bill of rights this 
motion avoids intruding into areas of provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	I would like to add my personal voice as a citizen. I do not 
believe any level of government should infringe on property rights 
in an unjust manner.
<P>
	In the debate following the introduction of this particular motion 
on property rights, the government members who responded 
expressed their support for property rights. However, and there is 
always a but, they said they could not support the motion because 
they believed property rights already have adequate protection. I 
am pleased that the members opposite support property rights, but I 
would challenge them on their assertion that property rights are 
adequately safeguarded.
<P>
	The bill of rights makes mention of the right of Canadians to 
enjoy property. However, this is simply not enough. Section 1(a) of 
the bill of rights states: ``The right of the individual to life, liberty, 
security of the person and enjoyment of property, and the right not 
to be deprived thereof, except by due process of law''.
<P>
	Section 2(e) provides that no federal law ``deprive a person of 
the right to a fair hearing in accordance with the principles of 
fundamental justice for the determination of his rights an 
obligations''.
<P>
	While I think all members of the House would support the 
principles outlined in the bill of rights as they apply to property 
rights, there is a problem. Unfortunately, while the bill of rights 
mentions property rights, the guarantee of protection and 
compensation in cases where private property has been surrendered 
is not explicit. This weakens the level of protection for property 
rights. Because the bill of rights is a regular statute, it can be 
overridden by a new federal statute. Without the explicit mention 
of compensation, a new federal statute could rather easily restrict 
the right of Canadians to fair and prompt compensation. M-205 
would correct this by making explicit the government's 
requirement to provide fair and prompt compensation in 
circumstances where it is necessary for an individual to surrender 
property.
<P>
	I am quite surprised by the current government's opposition to 
this motion. While members of the government party previously 
advocated entrenching property rights in the Constitution, they 
now seem to believe the status quo is good enough. I fail to see 
what could have changed their minds.
<P>
<B>(1115)</B>
<P>
	We have had in Parliament the Pearson airport bill which 
provides a precise example of why we need this kind of protection. 
While this bill ultimately died, had it been passed it would have 
cancelled agreements to privatize and redevelop terminals 1 and 2 
of Toronto's international airport. Parts of the bill would have 
absolved the federal government of any liability associated with 
the cancellation of the agreements. As we know it would have gone 
further and even basically cancelled recourse to the courts. This is 
precisely the kind of example of why we need stronger protection 
of property rights in this country.
<P>
	No one is suggesting there are never occasions where it may be 
necessary for individuals to surrender property. The motion 
recognizes this possibility. The difference between the status quo 
and the amendments this motion would bring about is that Motion 
M-205 would ensure that the property rights of Canadians could 
not be infringed upon without due process and fair compensation.
<P>
	The existence of fundamental rights and the importance of 
fairness and justice are principles that Canadians have come to 
expect. If the government truly  does support the property rights of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4832"> 4832 </A></B>
<P>
Canadians and the principles of fairness and justice, I am confident 
it should have no reservations about supporting Motion M-205.
<P>
	Let me add in concluding that we cannot understate the 
importance of property rights in the maintenance of a free society. 
We all know that free society and freedom in human history have 
been a fleeting thing. Only under certain legal, cultural and 
economic conditions are we able to enjoy the benefits of a free and 
democratic society.
<P>
	We had an example of another kind of society in this century in 
the Soviet Union. We all know that the Soviet Union had one of the 
most democratic constitutions in the world in terms of its symbolic 
recognition of rights. What the people of the Soviet Union 
ultimately lacked was the right to own property. Without the right 
to own property and without iron clad guarantees that cannot be 
taken from you except by legal and just processes, all other rights 
are meaningless. That is precisely what happened in that society. 
All the other human rights, all the democratic freedoms enunciated 
in that constitution were absolutely meaningless because there was 
no fundamental right to property without which there is not a free 
society.
<P>
	There are numerous examples in this country of the unjust 
expropriation of property by governments, governments forcing 
people to sell land and other material without compensation, 
without alternatives or without recourse to the courts. I know in 
Calgary it happened in the establishment of a transportation 
corridor. There have been other examples. It is not true to say we 
have adequate protection of property. Until we ensure these rights 
to property in the bill of rights, the charter and many other pieces of 
legislation, our freedoms will always be in jeopardy.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sharon Hayes (Port Moody-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise on Motion M-205 of my colleague 
from Comox-Alberni.
<P>
	The defence of property rights is arguably one of the most 
worthy matters of debate in a democratic society. The weakness of 
property rights protection in Canada compels us to revisit this issue 
today.
<P>
	The 1982 charter of rights and freedoms which protects 
Canadians' right to life, liberty and the security of the person 
makes no mention of property rights. For Canadians that protection 
lies only in the common law tradition and in the bill of rights which 
guarantees ``the right to enjoyment of property and the right not to 
be deprived thereof except by due process''.
<P>
	Close inspection reveals the guarantees in the bill of rights are 
only marginal at best. Also, both of these protections which do 
exist can be overruled by any other statute law. Even the UN 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights states: ``Everyone has the 
right to own  property alone as well as in association with others. 
No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his or her property''.
<P>
	Canadians need stronger guarantees on their right to own private 
property. Motion M-205 opens up the debate on this issue by 
highlighting the weaknesses of the present system. It guarantees a 
fair hearing in accordance with the principles of fundamental 
justice. It guarantees fair compensation within a reasonable amount 
of time. It allows for the protection of the rights of others by 
prescribing reasonable limits to property rights demonstrably 
justified in a free and democratic society.
<P>
<B>(1120)</B>
<P>
	Historically, property rights have been fundamental in the 
interpretation of individual freedoms. Individuals and democratic 
nations have defended these rights through history and history has 
recorded not only the struggles but the consequences for those 
nations which choose to ignore these basic rights. Take for 
example, as my colleague has just mentioned, the record of the 
USSR where lack of property rights, due process and fair 
compensation left those citizens powerless in the face of an 
intrusive state.
<P>
	In short, there are many compelling reasons to discuss property 
rights. The government has argued against this notion. One of its 
objections is that property rights should not be unlimited. However 
this proposed legislation does recognize the importance of 
establishing parameters as well as offering recourse within the 
definition of reasonable limits as outlined in the motion.
<P>
	Thus the proposed legislation continues to protect society for 
instance against crime even if it is committed on one's own 
property. More fundamentally, it provides protection for 
individuals and families when competing interests arise, and it 
provides redress to ensure protection and consideration for all 
parties. This is important in a variety of situations including, as has 
been brought forth by other members, divorce property settlements 
and recourse in the case of neighbourhood disputes.
<P>
	Within these parameters however it does offer hope for families 
with protection against devaluation and confiscation of their 
property. For example, let us say the government needs access 
across personal property for a new road or power line. While the 
motion allows for such action, if it directly affects the family's 
investment or its very security and future, it also ensures just 
remuneration in the law. There is no such guarantee in Canadian 
law today.
<P>
	The fact that the Liberals have indicated they do not support such 
a fundamental principle of freedom is troublesome indeed, 
especially when considering their existing record of abuse of 
property rights. I can think immediately of Bill C-28 and Bill C-68. 
Bill C-28 of course revoked the former government's Pearson 
airport contract without providing due compensation to the 
contractual 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4833"> 4833 </A></B>
<P>
partners. Bill C-68, the gun control bill, has dramatically devalued 
possibly millions of pieces of private property again without 
guaranteeing due compensation.
<P>
	Let us examine in more detail another of the concerns submitted 
by the justice department. The parliamentary secretary said that 
environmental legislation must not be restricted by private 
property protection and alluded to problems in the U.S. over such 
concerns as protecting endangered species. But in the United 
States, despite the nation's strong record of private property 
protection, two pieces of environmental legislation, that is the 1972 
Clean Water Act and the 1973 Endangered Species Act, bypassed 
the constitutional protection of property rights and did so with 
some scandalous results.
<P>
	In one case a rancher made a lake on his own property; as a result 
it classifies as a wetland. Instead of encouraging this private 
initiative, the U.S. government warned him that he would be 
charged if he violated wetlands regulations. This included 
accessing his own property with his own truck.
<P>
	In another case a land owner was sentenced to three years in 
prison and a $202,000 fine for violating the Clean Water Act by 
dumping landfill on his own property without a federal permit. A 
stream bed that was dry all year except when it backed up briefly 
during the rainy season justified the reclassification of his property 
as wetlands. The existence of skunk cabbage and sweet gum trees 
helped build the government's case which was originated by an 
unrelated complaint of a disgruntled neighbour who did not like the 
noise of the trucks driving past his house.
<P>
	A vast amount of research in recent years has demonstrated the 
superiority of private property ownership over government 
regulations in resolving many environmental problems, not least 
the protection of animal species from extinction. A growing 
number of environmentalists are among those who are beginning to 
recognize this fact. Nevertheless, placing ideology before valid 
research, the environment minister refused to acknowledge 
competing evidence in a recent op-ed in the Ottawa <I>Citizen</I>.
<P>
<B>(1125 )</B>
<P>
	The plight of the buffalo has been blamed on the tragedy of the 
commons: the fact that no one owned the buffalo or the land on 
which they roamed. If they had been privately owned, the owners 
would have had a vested interest in ensuring that this resource was 
not destroyed. The illustration of the buffalo is often contrasted 
with the survival of horses or cattle which have been bred as 
valuable resources for centuries.
<P>
	Another illustration of this principle is the ivory trade. Most 
nations have argued for banning international trade in ivory while 
elephant numbers continue to decline due to poaching. However in 
Zimbabwe in the late 1980s and  early 1990s, the government 
transferred elephant ownership rights to regional tribal councils. 
This privatization made game ranching possible with substantial 
profits accruing to the property owners. This financial incentive 
has guided the behaviour of property owners such that the elephant 
population in Zimbabwe increased while it declined in the rest of 
the continent.
<P>
	Another example of the importance of property rights comes 
from western Canada. Here there is much debate over the large 
tree-cutting projects which largely exist on public lands. It is of 
interest to note that in Sweden not long after forest land was largely 
sold into private hands, the government had a forestation crisis, not 
a deforestation crisis, on its hands.
<P>
	The simple fact is that private ownership is wedded to the reality 
of sustainability. Forests owned either by individuals or by the 
companies which harvest them have been shown to fare much 
better than land purchased from governments at below market 
value as is done in Canada.
<P>
	The concept of property rights is evolving with new 
technologies. The Liberals argue that the protection of these rights 
should not be stricter so as to accommodate these new issues. One 
such area that has already been recognized as important and will 
continue to grow in its importance is intellectual property.
<P>
	Here again though the government's position appears 
questionable when compared to the way it uses the existing 
flexibility in property rights against Canadians. Just this month the 
front page of Ottawa's leading business paper, the <I>Ottawa Business 
Journal</I>, featured a story which revealed Industry Canada's 
violation of business owners' property rights over intellectual 
property.
<P>
	The study, which has been buried for a year, revealed that despite 
a Treasury Board policy that says intellectual property rights 
belong to the firms contracted by the government, bureaucrats have 
been claiming these rights for the government. According to 
testimony from some business owners, especially small business 
owners, these rights were often surrendered for fear that obstinacy 
would make it more difficult to win future contracts.
<P>
	It is this very insecurity, the fear of law-abiding citizens that they 
cannot appeal to a justice system to protect their basic freedoms 
and the results of their often many years of hard labour, that is 
anathema to a free society. Canadians must be assured that their 
property is protected from the arbitrary hand of government by the 
guarantees such as those proposed in Motion M-205.
<P>
	In conclusion, the principle of property rights is basic to the 
freedoms inherent in a democratic country. As the Liberals refuse 
to endorse the explicit protection of property rights in law, they 
perpetuate a troublesome trend of real and potential government 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4834"> 4834 </A></B>
<P>
intervention in  matters that I say belong not to the state but to the 
citizens of Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very 
pleased to be here today to support the member for 
Comox-Alberni on the motion he has brought before the House.
<P>
	This issue was probably one of the most important ones in terms 
of drawing Reformers from western Canada into the Reform Party 
in the first place. People recognized from one example after 
another of what had happened in their area that this was necessary 
and that property rights in fact should be enshrined in the 
Constitution. That is of course a Reform policy although it is not 
fully what we are dealing with here today.
<P>
<B>(1130 )</B>
<P>
	I will start by repeating what this motion is about for those 
watching or listening or for those who may read this in the future:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government provide a greater measure of 
protection for individual property rights by amending the Canadian Bill of Rights to 
read:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``1. Subject to such reasonable limits prescribed by law as can be demonstrably 
justified in a free and democratic society, every person has the right to the enjoyment 
of that person's personal and real property and the right not to be deprived thereof 
unless that person</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a) is accorded a fair hearing in accordance with the principles of fundamental 
justice, and</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(b) is paid fair compensation in respect of the property, and the amount of that 
compensation is fixed impartially, and is paid within a reasonable amount of time 
after the person is deprived of their property.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>2. Any person whose rights, as set out in section 1, have been infringed or denied 
may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction to obtain such remedy as the court 
considers appropriate and just in the circumstances''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is what we are debating today. I will talk a bit about the 
importance of having property rights clearly defined.
<P>
	Property rights are really the cornerstone of human freedom, as 
some of my colleagues have expressed. These rights mean freedom 
from arbitrary interference in one's life by government. Property 
rights depend on the notion that you own yourself and your labour.
<P>
	In 1690 John Locke wrote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The great and chief end of men-putting themselves under government, is the 
preservation of their property.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In 1790 Edmund Burke wrote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The power of perpetuating our property in our families is one of the most valuable 
and interesting circumstances belonging to it, and that which tends the most to the 
perpetuation of society itself. It makes our weakness subservient to our virtue; it 
grafts benevolence even upon avarice.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Burke recognized clearly the importance of property rights.
<P>
	A property rights guarantee ensures that government can only 
take your property under three very limiting conditions. First, the 
taking of your property must be for public use. Second, the taking 
of your property must be through due process of the law. Third, the 
taking of your property must be with just and timely compensation.
<P>
	Various polls and surveys have demonstrated clearly that 
Canadians support a property rights guarantee. A poll 
commissioned by the Canadian real estate board in 1987 found that 
81 per cent of Canadians considered property rights very or fairly 
important and that the Constitution should be amended to include 
property rights.
<P>
	In 1992 a Gallup poll demonstrated that 87 per cent of 
respondents characterized the fundamental right to own property as 
either very important or important, and 87 per cent said that it 
should be in the charter of rights and freedoms.
<P>
	To make this point stronger, a higher percentage of Quebecers 
supported a constitutional guarantee of property rights than 
supported a constitutional guarantee of distinct society. This issue 
is certainly important to Quebecers.
<P>
	The Prime Minister also supports a property rights guarantee. 
One of my colleagues brought this up and it is worth mentioning 
again. During a presentation to the provinces on including property 
rights in the charter of rights and freedoms he stated: ``In deciding 
which rights should be included in this charter, we have selected 
only those which we feel reflect the central values of our society. 
Each of these rights we have listed''-and that includes property 
rights-``is an essential ingredient for the charter and all are rights 
which all Canadians should have regardless of wherever they live 
in our country''.
<P>
	That was spoken by the Prime Minister a few years ago. It is 
interesting that now his government seems to be holding back on 
its support and is speaking against a first step toward providing for 
property rights in a meaningful way.
<P>
<B>(1135 )</B>
<P>
	There are other countries which have enshrined property rights 
in their constitutions. Canada is in the good company of the United 
States, Germany, Italy and Finland. The fifth amendment of the 
United States constitution limits federal powers and expressly 
provides for a right to compensation. The fifth amendment states 
that no person shall be deprived of life, liberty or property without 
due process of law, nor shall private property be taken for public 
use without due compensation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4835"> 4835 </A></B>
<P>
	The 14th amendment of the American constitution stipulates 
that no state shall deprive any person of life, liberty or property 
without due process of the law.
<P>
	Property rights were not included in our charter mainly because 
of the objections of the provinces of Saskatchewan, New 
Brunswick and Prince Edward Island. The reason is important to 
note. These provinces felt that it was an attempt by the federal 
government to intrude into provincial jurisdiction over property 
and civil rights granted to them by section 92(13) of the British 
North America Act.
<P>
	The Canadian Bill of Rights does include property rights, but the 
guarantee of protection is minimal at best. There is no requirement 
in Canadian constitutional law that removal of private property be 
covered by a fair procedure to deal with compensation to the owner 
and there is no guarantee of fair treatment by the courts, tribunals 
or officials who have the power over individuals or corporations. 
Without the rights of due process and fair compensation individual 
property rights are meaningless.
<P>
	The power of government in this area is unlimited. Any valid 
statute can expressly state that no compensation is payable when 
property is expropriated. That is the very thing which Canadians do 
not want.
<P>
	How would Motion No. 205, presented by my colleague from 
Comox-Alberni, improve the current situation? Motion No. 205 
proposes to amend the Canadian Bill of Rights by adding two new 
sections. The first section would allow citizens the right to their 
property unless the person receives a fair hearing in accordance 
with the principles of fundamental justice. The second section 
gives the individual property owner the right to fair compensation 
for the property within a reasonable amount of time.
<P>
	Since the Canadian Bill of Rights applies only to federal law and 
operations, this motion would avoid the provincial concerns raised 
during the debate on including property rights in the charter. 
However, since this legislation applies only to federal jurisdiction, 
clearly similar protection is needed at the provincial level. I would 
strongly support the provinces making similar changes in their 
legislation to protect property rights.
<P>
	I would like to give a couple of examples of things that have 
gone wrong because there is not proper protection of property 
rights. The first example would not be protected if the bill is 
passed, but I would like to mention it anyway. This is something 
which happened in Calgary. I have had this story related to me on a 
couple of different occasions, so I believe it is worth mentioning. It 
affected the people who mentioned it to me in a very negative way.
<P>
	Calgary had a green zone around the city which was protected by 
law. When this happened there was no compensation as a result of 
the damage to land prices. There was no expropriation on the part 
of government. It just declares that this zone would be a green zone 
and that caused property values to drop dramatically. People who 
had property within that zone in many cases, people who had talked 
to me, lost much of their life savings. It was clearly unfair and I 
think it is important that we have legislation that would protect 
against this.
<P>
<B>(1140)</B>
<P>
	The second very important example has been demonstrated 
already and explained by some of our members, although I think it 
would be worth repeating, and it has to do with the rights under Bill 
C-68 to take guns from people without any compensation.
<P>
	From the gun collectors I have talked to, in a couple of cases gun 
collectors had tied their life savings up in their collection. This law 
has destroyed the value of that collection with no compensation. 
These examples point out the need for this to pass the House. I ask 
all members in the House to support my colleague and to vote in 
favour of this private member's motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to rise today and 
support this motion brought forward by my hon. colleague for 
Comox-Alberni.
<P>
	I believe he should be commended for his tenacious attitude with 
regard to this motion. The issue of property rights has been debated 
in this House of Commons numerous times over the last 30 years 
and unfortunately for Canadians they still do not enjoy adequate 
protection of their individual property rights.
<P>
	The fact that my colleague has been diligent enough on behalf of 
Canadians to correct this alarming oversight by hammering away at 
this issue once again shows his dedication and the dedication of the 
Reform Party to fight for equity and justice.
<P>
	This issue reminds me of another battle that has been carried out 
on the floor of the House of Commons throughout the past 20 
years. Like property rights, capital punishment has maintained 
overwhelming support by Canadians. The reinstatement of capital 
punishment has been favoured by 70 per cent of Canadians since it 
was abolished 20 years ago. Throughout that time MPs such as me 
have introduced legislation to fulfil the wishes of the majority.
<P>
	Unfortunately too many MPs forget that it is their constituents 
they represent first and foremost. They forget that they are not in 
Ottawa to conform to the wishes of their political masters or to 
satisfy their own conscience. They are here to debate and vote on 
behalf of the people in their constituencies. Instead, as in the case 
of capital punishment, many have ignored this fact and so it is left 
to a few select members of this House to hammer away and 
reintroduce legislation until hopefully someday we will succeed 
and therefore ultimately Canadians will succeed.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4836"> 4836 </A></B>
<P>
	In the matter of property rights we are faced with a similar 
situation. A poll commissioned by the Canadian Real Estate 
Association in 1992 showed that 87 per cent of respondents 
considered the right to own and enjoy property of all kinds a 
fundamental right.
<P>
	Another poll by the Canadian Real Estate Board in 1987 found 
that 81 per cent of Canadians considered it either very or fairly 
important that the Constitution be amended to include property 
rights. A 1987 Gallup poll demonstrated that 87 per cent of 
Canadians supported increased property rights protection.
<P>
	Needless to say, this all indicates significant and overwhelming 
support and reflects Canadians' concern that their property rights 
can too easily be infringed upon. But still there is no guarantee in 
this country that private property will not be removed for public 
use and there is no provision that government must provide for fair 
compensation when it expropriates property for public use.
<P>
	This is despite numerous attempts by Canadian legislators to 
protect property rights. As has been mentioned, these legislators 
include John Diefenbaker and Pierre Trudeau. Mr. Trudeau enjoyed 
excellent support from his justice minister at that time, the current 
Prime Minister.
<P>
<B>(1145)</B>
<P>
	Unfortunately, these efforts have been impeded by, among other 
issues, constitutional concerns and protests from provincial 
governments worried that their jurisdictions were being invaded. 
For example, during constitutional debates in 1992, the province of 
Prince Edward Island strongly protested the inclusion of property 
rights in any constitutional proposals. The premier of P.E.I. at the 
time went so far as to inappropriately state: ``If we cannot control 
the destiny of land in Prince Edward Island, we will soon no longer 
be a province''.
<P>
	As we in the House are aware, the general sentiment among the 
majority of Canadians is that they are reluctant to see the 
constitutional can of worms opened at this time and it is easy to 
understand why. Fortunately, the motion recognizes this sentiment 
as well as the misguided fears of certain provinces. It strengthens 
property rights without constitutional change or the need for 
provincial consent. It applies only to federal law and the operations 
of the federal government.
<P>
	It dictates that the federal government uphold a reasonable 
standard of fair and just compensation in exchange for personal 
property. While it does not involve the provinces, it sets a standard 
to follow and a precedent for individual property rights in the eyes 
of the law. Regardless of jurisdiction, it will strengthen and respect 
the rights of Canadians who believe their private property cannot 
and should not be arbitrarily taken from them by the federal 
government without compensation.
<P>
	This is a simple and logical solution that does not infringe on the 
provinces and shows that the federal government is concentrating 
on cleaning up its own backyard.
<P>
	It also rises above partisan politics. As I mentioned earlier, 
former prime ministers from both the Liberal and Conservative 
parties have seen fit to support property rights and the current 
Prime Minister once spoke very strongly of securing them for 
Canadians.
<P>
	The Prime Minister's attempts at protecting property rights were 
unsuccessful. I hope he seizes this opportunity to support the 
motion which, as I have mentioned, accomplishes the task at a 
federal level in a relatively simple manner through the Canadian 
Bill of Rights.
<P>
	While reviewing the motion and the debate on it, I became 
concerned that some members were confused about its intended 
results. First and foremost, I would like to reiterate to all members 
that this motion does not involve constitutional amendments. I 
repeat the statement that my colleagues and I have already made 
today because in past debate the hon. member for 
Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead in Quebec expressed worry that 
the motion would limit the ability of a provincial government to 
legislate in the environmental sector if property rights were 
enshrined in the Constitution. This motion will affect neither the 
provinces nor the Constitution.
<P>
	Another point I would like to clarify with respect to that hon. 
member's statement from June 10, 1996 involves the importance of 
property rights to a person's identity. He does not seem to realize 
the fundamental importance that property rights hold for 
individuals. In the case of a home or a farm it often identifies who 
they are and who their ancestors were. It provides them with a 
heritage, a past, a sense of pride and a constant source of solace in 
times of difficulty. Certainly I can speak from experience about 
what has become known as the love of the land, being a farmer, and 
the pride that comes from the ownership of property.
<P>
	In the early 1970s hundreds of families in rural communities 
near Pickering, Ontario were surprised when they began receiving 
form letters telling them their homes and farms were going to be 
expropriated to make way for a new international airport. No 
consultations were carried out with the residents or even with the 
local municipalities. People were forced to sell homes and land 
which some families had occupied for nearly 170 years. The 
federal government expropriated 7,527 hectares for an airport it 
never built.
<P>
	Since they were expropriated the lands and homes of these 
Canadians have been mismanaged by Public Works Canada on 
behalf of the transport minister. The loving care that many owners 
put into their homesteads suffered vandalism and bulldozing. One 
of these homeowners, who is now in his seventies, said: ``I could 
not believe  the government's arrogance. It made me absolutely 
livid''.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4837"> 4837 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1150)</B>
<P>
	After suffering through the tragedy of having their homes and 
farmland taken from them and witnessing its destruction, these 
people were enraged at the federal government's declaration two 
years ago that 2,000 of these hectares were now deemed surplus. 
How could anyone bear the indignity, frustration and heartache of 
having their homes taken from them, then hear that part of their 
heritage was being declared surplus?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> Shame.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> That is right. Shame 
on government. With this motion, fiascos such as this would not be 
allowed to happen. The federal government would not be permitted 
to arrogantly, without consultation and fair process, expropriate a 
family's homestead for a project that would probably never 
happen.
<P>
	In the matter of other property, to have it taken away, also leaves 
an individual feeling violated and helpless. I agree to a point that 
these are only material goods and pale in significance to the 
well-being of loved ones or to freedom or to the other fundamental 
rights.
<P>
	Members have to keep in mind that we are talking about an 
individual's property being expropriated by the federal 
government. If that process is not done fairly and with due 
compensation, it can be traumatic and as consequential as losing a 
loved one, particularly in the case of a property that has been in a 
family for generations.
<P>
	In the case of freedom, can it truly be said that Canadians enjoy 
freedom when an individual is free to possess property only until 
the government has need for it or decides to take it away for some 
supposedly higher public purpose.
<P>
	As previously noted in the House by some of my colleagues, 
there is no doubt that the legitimate owner of a firearm does not 
feel he or she is a free citizen of Canada when the federal 
government can dictate whether he or she will be allowed to keep 
property.
<P>
	This is a frightening concept in what is supposed to be one of the 
leading industrialized and free nations in the world. It makes me 
feel as though we really have not come very far since the 
internment and expropriation of property from 22,000 Japanese 
Canadians during the second world war. At that time, the federal 
government said a higher purpose should supersede an individual's 
property rights. The federal government has a responsibility to its 
citizens and a responsibility to govern by example.
<P>
	This motion would not limit the federal government to never 
being able to expropriate land for public works projects. However 
it would ensure that owners are guaranteed that any expropriations 
would be carried out in a fair and reasonable way, consistent with 
the standard expected in a free and democratic society. It would 
also mean that there would have to be fair compensation for 
expropriation.
<P>
	There have been many embarrassing incidents in Canadian 
history that involve the unjust seizure of property by the federal 
government. As members of the House will acknowledge, we 
continue to grapple with the fallout of these injustices to this day.
<P>
	Motion No. 205 will ensure that future generations and MPs are 
not left to remedy any further violations the federal government 
might commit in the absence of property rights' protection. It is the 
least we can expect from a responsible government in a free and 
democratic society. Therefore, I urge all my colleagues on both 
side of the House to please support this motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
members of the House will know that I have used, from time to 
time, New Zealand examples to press home how important it was 
for us to get on top of our debt and deficit problems in order to 
create an investment climate that would create jobs. I have used 
these New Zealand examples not because New Zealand has done 
everything right but because we can learn from the experiences of 
other countries and choose the best things to implement here in 
Canada.
<P>
	There are lessons to be learned from history and the experiences 
of others in connection with property rights as well. We can easily 
see that by taking a look at the enormous amount of historical 
material available to us.
<P>
	We know the history of ancient Rome and Greece, China, Egypt 
and Mesopotamia. We know what happened in classical times, 
medieval times and in the industrial revolution right through to 
modern times. We know plenty about Britain, Canada, Australia, 
New Zealand, the United States, Russia, Cambodia, sub-Saharan 
Africa, you name it. By studying the historical records of those 
times and places we can quickly see that when governments do not 
respect property rights, the people eventually end up living in 
poverty and misery.
<P>
<B>(1155)</B>
<P>
	Perhaps it starts innocently enough. A government promises to 
regulate the economy for the common good, redistribute the wealth 
more fairly, make the rich pay their fair share, close the loopholes. 
I have a feeling I have heard this stuff somewhere before. It is a 
naive assumption that the government knows best and that the 
average citizen needs to be protected from himself.
<P>
	History is full of examples. Whether they are headed by madmen 
like Stalin or Hitler or by well-meaning dreamers like Nehru or 
Nyerere, they always fail. Along the way they produce conflict 
instead of peace, famine instead of plenty. Instead of more and 
better rights than  those we hold in the line that we receive from the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4838"> 4838 </A></B>
<P>
Magna Carta, they deliver fewer and lesser rights. They promise a 
gilded cage and they deliver only the cage.
<P>
	I challenge members to name one society that respected property 
rights where the people were not happier and better off for it. I 
challenge them to name one society that did not have property 
rights where the people are not more miserable as a result of that. 
The more protected the right to property, the better the living 
conditions and the better the societal order.
<P>
	History also teaches us that where property rights are not 
respected, neither are personal rights. Along with the loss of 
property rights comes loss of liberty, loss of freedom of speech, 
loss of decency in society.
<P>
	In her speech earlier today, my colleague from Port 
Moody-Coquitlam mentioned the benefits of transferring 
ownership of forests into private hands, for example. She gave an 
example of how sustainability was ensured by transferring the 
property rights to private hands. This same benefit can be seen in 
New Zealand which has transferred part of its forests to the private 
sector. It raised $2.5 billion to pay off the final portion of its 
foreign debt by doing so. What results from that is we have private 
investors who have to protect that property in order to recover the 
$2.5 billion investment and to receive an ongoing income. It is the 
guarantee of sustainability, it is the guarantee of replanting of those 
forests and it means that the government now is only in a 
regulatory role, instead of interfering in the marketplace.
<P>
	Similar experiments with ownership of lakes have shown that 
when a camp ground owns the lake it makes sure there is no 
pollution in that lake. It makes sure that fish are stocked in that 
lake. With private ownership comes the desire to protect the 
property.
<P>
	Property rights are the foundation of a decent and responsible 
society. They are the most important human right. It amazes me 
that we have a Constitution and charter of rights that guarantees the 
lengthy avoidance of deportation by known criminals and bogus 
refugees, but it does not guarantee property rights to law-abiding 
citizens. It amazes me that we have a Constitution and charter of 
rights that permits crimes to be committed without penalty by 
people who are under the influence of drink or drugs, but it does not 
guarantee property rights to law-abiding citizens. Canadians are 
supposed to feel good about their Constitution and charter but for 
the most part they are frustrated by it and with it.
<P>
	Motion 205 put forward by the Reform Party member for 
Comox-Alberni is an excellent one. I urge all members to support 
it for our own well-being.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to express my appreciation for the support I 
have received from my colleagues with regard to this motion. It is 
fundamental to freedom in our society and I think the point has 
been made adequately.
<P>
	In summary, it must be pointed out to the government that 
property rights are not adequately protected in Canada. Things are 
happening today that are not acceptable in a free and democratic 
society and the examples given clearly demonstrated that. We have 
to ask the question: Why would a government not want to protect 
them more adequately so that all citizens could go about their 
business with the freedom to which they are entitled?
<P>
<B>(1200)</B>
<P>
	In summary, there are three reasons property rights are good: 
they make a society richer; they protect the freedom of individuals; 
and they protect the environment. Those are the arguments we as 
Reformers have been trying to make.
<P>
	Property rights make society richer in that they spur the creative 
effort of individuals to improve their own circumstances. Property 
rights are a guarantee that we get to keep what we own, we can 
dispose of what we own, enjoy the fruits of our labour and our 
property cannot be arbitrarily taken from us even by government. 
These rights are important to an economy such as ours. For 
societies to flourish and for things to be as they should, countries 
need to guarantee those property rights.
<P>
	People should be free to make their own decisions about how to 
best use their possessions, including the fruits of their labour. For 
those not already enjoying material wealth, their labour is the most 
valuable thing they own. It is particularly important that everyone 
be guaranteed the right to improve their situation and benefit from 
the improvements they make. In the long run the right to make 
decisions about one's own life and work is the foundation of human 
dignity.
<P>
	My last point is that property rights protect the environment. The 
problem of pollution is not that people pollute their own 
surroundings, but that they pollute the surroundings of others 
around them, including air and water. Without property rights, a 
distant government rather than the afflicted individual makes a 
judgment about how much pollution should be allowed. 
Governments weigh the political benefits of such pollution against 
the political costs and most often favour the polluter.
<P>
	In conclusion, this debate highlights the fundamental difference 
between a Reformer and a Liberal. In order to maintain a free and 
democratic society, individual rights must be protected. This is 
something that must be fundamentally supported by every member 
in this House.

	<B>Mr. John Duncan (North Island-Powell River, Ref.)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House support British Columbia as Canada's gateway to the Asia Pacific 
and recognize British Columbia as a major economic power in the region, and as a 
consequence, this House condemn the federal government for impeding progress in 
Western Canada by its mismanagement of the affairs of the nation, exemplified by 
the government 's mishandling of the west coast fishery, Coast Guard services, the 
closure of military bases at Aldergrove and Chilliwack, B.C., the elimination of 
federal Ports Canada policing in B.C., the movement of grain to Prince Rupert, B.C. 
and other issues detrimental to the state of the nation.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to present this supply day 
motion on behalf of the Reform Party.
<P>
	This motion may speak to British Columbia issues, but it also 
speaks about Confederation and British Columbia's place in our 
national mosaic. If there is one way I could characterize what I am 
going to talk about today, it is a lack of vision on the part of the 
federal government; there are broken promises on behalf of the 
federal government; and there is a one way street between British 
Columbia and Ottawa.
<P>
	My colleagues will be discussing federal mismanagement of 
issues surrounding the Prince Rupert grain terminal, the fishery, the 
military bases, ports policing in B.C. and the coast guard. I will 
specifically talk about the recently announced downsizing 
proposals for the combined DFO/coast guard operations which are 
scheduled to take effect soon.
<P>
<B>(1205)</B>
<P>
	The federal government has displayed its inability to effectively 
manage or priorize sensibly and it has shown disregard for the 
public in its actions. Immediate corrective action is required to 
bring some sense to the discussions and to ensure that the public 
interest is represented rather than the interests of the bureaucracy 
or the minister.
<P>
	The B.C. chamber of commerce is on record as expressing 
serious concerns about federal government priorities in its recent 
cuts to coast guard services. Its letter of September 13 to the Prime 
Minister stated what many others have stated very well and what 
the people of British Columbia are saying. The letter reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We recognize the necessity of budgetary restraint but the responsibility of 
government to maintain public safety in marine channels must not be abrogated by 
the need to save money. We realize-that cuts may have to be made. We do ask, 
however, that your government prioritize allocations for public safety.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Your government is responsible by law not only for safety in marine channels but 
for navigational aids (lighthouses), small harbours management, and search and 
rescue. Even the recent assignment of responsibility for environmental cleanup to 
the organization responsible does not relieve the coast guard of environmental first 
response in potential disaster situations. Given the isolated nature of the west coast, 
cuts made without due care and attention can worsen an already dangerous situation. 
For example, mariners and fishers in the Hecate Strait near Prince Rupert already 
rely on the American coast guard in rescue situations due to the fact that the local 
coast guard helicopter is not fully equipped or always available for marine surface 
rescues.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Cuts we believe to be unwise include excessive reduction in the number of vessels 
and the subsequent reassignment of remaining vessels, resulting in units not fully 
capable of responding in search and rescue operations (reassigning <I>The Point Race</I>, 
for example, a vessel specially fitted to deal with the high speed, tidal currents in 
Discovery Passage near Campbell River to Port Hardy and replacing it with a vessel 
lacking its capabilities); destaffing lighthouses, which serve as important 
navigational aids for aviators as well as mariners, without providing an alternative 
for the essential services they provide; and reducing certain services to only a twelve 
hour standby when emergencies can happen at any time.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We believe it is the government's responsibility to provide Canadians with a 
reasonable opportunity to work and do business safely. Consequently, we strongly 
recommend that your officials re-examine the substance of the cuts to services and 
make a greater effort to exercise restraint in administrative areas. Where safety is 
concerned there must always be other options.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	On Saturday at McInnes Island, 40 miles west of Bella Bella, 
which is a very isolated area, a lightkeeper called in that a float 
plane was down. That was the immediate response which allowed 
the pilot to be saved by the search and rescue team.
<P>
	Today on Chrome Island, Merry Island and Entrance Island 
people are pouring pads to put in automated equipment. This 
situation has gone into overdrive. People are trying to stop the 
destaffing.
<P>
	There are other signs of revulsion coming from British 
Columbia. The Union of B.C. Municipalities had its annual 
meeting two weeks ago. On September 20 an emergency debate 
was held on this issue. A unanimous resolution was passed 
regarding the disastrous effect the proposed cuts would have on 
boating safety.
<P>
	The Coastal Communities Network sent a letter on September 25 
to the minister. The letter states that the minister has broken two 
promises to British Columbians regarding destaffing light stations 
before demonstration projects have proven the safety viability of 
automated equipment; and he has negated the December 1995 
national marine policy to ensure search and rescue operations are 
an essential service.
<P>
<B>(1210)</B>
<P>
	This motion is a wake-up call to a lethargic federal government 
that has ignored and dismissed B.C.'s contribution to the wealth 
and dynamism of the country.

	British Columbia has 12.9 per cent of the total Canadian 
population, over 3.8 million people. Federal statistics indicate that 
for a decade or more B.C. has averaged 6 per cent of total 
government procurement and capital spending, which is nowhere 
near its population base or contribution to the federal coffers.
<P>
	British Columbia's representation in federal cabinets has been 
characterized by weak ministers who have lacked clout at the 
cabinet table and who have been unskilled in how to play the 
federal influence game.
<P>
	B.C. is the only province which year by year continues to have 
increases in live births. Two-thirds of the new migrants coming to 
British Columbia every year are under the age of 35. Our 
demographics are such that we could very nicely carry CPP and 
medicare programs, unlike the rest of the country.
<P>
	British Columbians welcome downsizing of the federal 
government. We cannot afford the current contraption because of 
the combined Liberal debt which next year will cost us over $50 
billion per year in interest charges alone. What we want is fairness, 
good priority setting and true savings. Savings, not political 
transfers.
<P>
	The concerns of coastal communities are being virtually ignored 
as cutbacks in basic marine safety and navigation services for 
which the federal government is responsible continue.
<P>
	Information has been very hard to come by. To illustrate the 
arrogance of the senior bureaucracy, I have a timeline from the 
downsizing proposals which trickled out to the marine advisory 
groups in the last week of August: August 20 to August 30, client 
consultations; September 3 to September 6, assess client impacts; 
September 30, final funding decision.
<P>
	The communities and anyone else who has been involved in this 
initiative have not even had time to catch their breath. As Robert 
Mason Lee of the Vancouver <I>Sun</I> observed at the UBCM 
conference in Penticton, the government has essentially stopped 
seeking public advice and is desperately cost cutting with poor 
rationale.
<P>
	The minister from B.C. has not even represented B.C. interests 
when they have fallen into his portfolio. British Columbians are 
paying more and getting less.
<P>
	To show that the operations people from the federal bureaucracy 
do understand program delivery but cannot win the debate with the 
senior bureaucracy, I would like to quote from the content of a 
report which I received this weekend. It is a DFO operations branch 
impact analysis which was leaked to me.
<P>
	I will quote selectively: ``The ability of multitask vessels to 
deliver fisheries patrol duties remains unclear. All vessels tasked to 
fisheries patrol will have search and rescue as primary tasking. In 
the extreme there may be no vessels available for fisheries patrol 
during peak periods. Peak periods for fisheries patrol and search 
and rescue occur at the same time''.
<P>
	Second, ``the current proposal does not meet operations branch 
fleet mix requirements. There is the need for a much larger number 
of flexible inshore vessels''.
<P>
	Third, ``our ability to meet international commitments outlined 
in the Pacific Salmon Treaty, the free trade agreement and the 
Canadian shellfish sanitation program will be significantly 
reduced. Canada is required to collect data and enforce provisions 
of specific fisheries agreements in the Pacific Salmon Treaty''.
<P>
<B>(1215)</B>
<P>
	Fourth, the ability of vessels to remain away from home port on 
a regular and or sporadic basis is critical to both fisheries 
enforcement and management. This will not occur under this plan 
either.
<P>
	Fifth, uncertainty about vessel support for multitasked vessels 
and or insufficient vessels will result in fewer fisheries. The new 
initiatives implemented to rationalize the salmon fleet-known as 
the Mifflin plan, very controversial-will be compromised.
<P>
	Less precision in in-fishery catch information and escape 
estimates for salmon enhancement in the short term will result in 
over harvest or under harvest and in the long term stock collapse.
<P>
	A gradual reduction in the number of ships will have less impact 
in the sharp reduction plan for 1997. Considerable time will be 
required to train personnel in multitask duties.
<P>
	There is currently a demand for increased habitat investigation 
and monitoring of projects in remote areas as a result of the new 
oceans act, the Canada Environmental Assessment Act and 
agreements made with First Nations by aboriginals, fishery 
strategy and land claims initiatives.
<P>
	Initiatives to implement a community based strategy for 
fisheries management and enforcement in remote coastal 
communities will be compromised.
<P>
	This report goes on. This is a damning indictment of what is 
being foisted on British Columbia right now. These proposals for 
Pacific coast operations lack any vision or entrepreneurship. It is 
typical Ottawa policy making done in a void. It is a myopic, 
lacking long term strategy thinking of the kind that characterizes 
most of this government.
<P>
	Have these policy gurus thought about what the impact of these 
life threatening cuts will say to insurance companies and marine 
underwriters who cover the cruise ships or floating hotels which 
carry hundreds or thousands of people a trip? Have these policy 
gurus and our two esteemed ministers involved in this mess 
thought about Canada's liability for not providing adequate aids  to 
navigation, search and rescue, vessel traffic and control and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4841"> 4841 </A></B>
<P>
weather forecasting equipment to ensure safety for these visiting 
vessels, not to mention our own west coast fleet of private and 
commercial vessels?
<P>
	The fixation of cutting at the service level with no plan or 
strategic policy is a classic Ottawa closed loop philosophy. Around 
it goes and the dollars keep going in but they do not escape to serve 
society. We do deserve better.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I felt the 
speech given by the hon. member dealt very well with a number of 
the problems faced by the coast guard and light keepers on the west 
coast.
<P>
	I know the member is the critic for Indian Affairs and I wonder if 
he could give us the benefit of a few minutes explanation of some 
of the problems that have been created in British Columbia, which 
has the largest number of Indian bands of any province in the 
country; if he could expand a little on the problems that have been 
created by this government for the people of British Columbia by 
the actions and the policies that have been foisted on British 
Columbians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> Mr. Speaker, the time allotted for me to speak was 
20 minutes and I used my 20 minutes. If I were to address all the 
concerns this motion addresses just from my single perspective, I 
would need at least two hours in this House. There is a reliance by 
me on some of my colleagues which will happen today.
<P>
<B>(1220 )</B>
<P>
	In terms of the question that my colleague asked about 
aboriginal issues, I have several major concerns, one of which is 
that the federal treaty office in British Columbia in a growth 
industry and has shown a lack of discipline in terms of its posture, 
attitude, behaviour and fiscal responsibility at a time when all other 
departments and operations in the province which are federally 
funded have been very much squeezed and pressured. There have 
been several instances of lack of financial control and a lack of 
terms of reference which would be applied in any other federal 
department. I think those have been reasonably well covered in the 
major media.
<P>
	We do have an arrangement, an aboriginal fisheries strategy 
which is an allocation by the Department of Fisheries and Oceans 
which started in 1993. It allows aboriginal fisheries for commercial 
sale. This basically means that we now have a much bigger 
mandate in terms of enforcement and management. It is a much 
more complicated situation.
<P>
	It is no surprise to people that we have fought against the 
aboriginal fisheries from the beginning on the basis that we do not 
believe there should be two commercial fisheries, one based on 
race and the other an all-Canadian fishery.
<P>
	The document from the operations division of DFO I quoted 
from indicates that indeed those complications are ever more 
complicated by the downsizing and will very much put the stock at 
risk. Specific comments have been made about the lower Fraser 
River. There are 98 Indian bands in British Columbia on the Fraser 
system alone.
<P>
	The comments in this document deal with the lower Strait of 
Georgia, which I will cite. There are extensive delays in responding 
to fishing violations on the international boundary. American 
seiners and gill-netters often venture into Canadian waters to 
intercept Fraser River salmon stocks during the absence of 
Canadian fisheries patrol vessels equipped with modern tracking 
technology. The international consequences of not having an 
enforcement platform on the boundary in 1994 were highlighted by 
the press in Canada and the U.S.
<P>
	Commitments to the Pacific Salmon Treaty require specific 
information and enforcement activity in this zone. Reduced 
enforcement capability on the most extensive aboriginal sales 
fishery in the Pacific region and escalation in non-compliance in 
closed periods and mandatory landings will result.
<P>
	I appreciate the question from the member.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened with great interest to the comments of my 
colleague from North Island-Powell River on this very important 
topic today, the alienation that British Columbia has felt over the 
last few years. This has escalated over the last three years with the 
present Liberal government. There are many issues and examples 
of the neglect and ways the government has taken British Columbia 
for granted that it would take days to detail them.
<P>
<B>(1225 )</B>
<P>
	It is no wonder that particularly in the northern part of British 
Columbia there is a real sense of northern alienation and we are not 
just physically a great distance from Ottawa but certainly a great 
distance when it comes to the thinking of this government. It is 
exemplified by the fact that last December the government did not 
even deem it appropriate to consider that British Columbia might 
be a separate region when it was doling out vetoes for future 
constitutional amendments. That is how it manifested itself.
<P>
	I was reminded of this just this past weekend when I flew home 
to my riding of Prince George-Peace River to attend a very 
special event in the city of Dawson Creek. Due to the efforts of a lot 
of people we found that the Alaska highway was being dedicated as 
the sixteenth civil engineering wonder of the world, so to speak. It 
takes its rightful place with other engineering projects such as the 
Eiffel Tower, the Statue of Liberty, the Sydney Harbour Bridge, and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4842"> 4842 </A></B>
<P>
the Panama Canal. Quite frankly, I was absolutely appalled that 
there was no federal representation there.
<P>
	This is a transport issue. This government deemed it appropriate 
to have the Minister of Transport from British Columbia. He was 
not present at that ceremony. No designate was present. This 
exemplifies the attitude of the federal government toward British 
Columbia. This was such an important event and there was no one 
there representing the federal government.
<P>
	I wanted to bring it to the attention of the House as simply the 
latest example I am aware of where this federal government gives 
British Columbians a slap in the face. I say shame on this 
government.
<P>
	I ask the member if he can think of an example similar to that, 
perhaps in his riding, perhaps in southern British Columbia, to 
relate to the people of Canada who are watching today of how the 
thinking of this federal government ends at the Rocky Mountains 
despite the fact that we have at least one federal minister from 
British Columbia, whom we certainly dearly missed in Dawson 
Creek last weekend.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> I have only one minute, Mr. Speaker, and I can 
think of several issues but I cannot obviously talk about all of them.
<P>
	If I get down to riding specifics, the minister from British 
Columbia promised a community in my riding that the dock which 
burned down in 1989, which was uninsured because the federal 
government self-insures, would be replaced. That promise was 
made in 1995. I have pursued it with the minister and I have not 
received satisfaction. That is a clear broken promise.
<P>
	There are other issues locally. One that concerns me a lot which 
is a B.C. issue happens to involve an air crash in Campbell River 
which took eight lives. We have clear recommendations from the 
transportation safety board that the visual flight rules in effect in 
Canada which were changed in 1990 against its recommendations 
need to be changed back to pre-1990 or there will be more fatalities 
as a result.
<P>
	The senior bureaucrat responsible on the same day that 
investigation was announced after 11 months of study was quoted 
in the Vancouver <I>Sun</I> as saying they had no intention of changing 
the visual flight rules. The marginal weather in which these things 
happen is very much indicative of British Columbian weather. We 
are probably the major influence and I have not received any 
response from the minister to my representations in that regard.
<P>
<B>(1230 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to thank the Reform Party for once again 
providing an opportunity for the government to look good. Its 
members have worded its resolution in a  manner that is negative 
but, I assure you, Mr. Speaker, it gives us the opportunity of 
pointing what the facts are.
<P>
	The motion, although confused, deserves a straightforward 
response. This government over the last three years has put the 
right priorities in place for British Columbia. I would like to talk on 
that point in five specific areas.
<P>
	First, the economy and how the government is successfully 
following policies on the deficit and on jobs that fit well with the 
aspirations of British Columbians and, indeed, Canadians from one 
end of this country to the other. This the hon. member and his 
friends over the last three years have completely forgotten.
<P>
	Second, I would like to point out that the government's emphasis 
on Asia-Pacific is good news for all of Canada, but no part of 
Canada more than B.C. It is in British Columbia that this emphasis 
on Asia-Pacific context with the Pacific rim, trade with the Pacific 
rim, has benefited us enormously. I am sure my colleague, the hon. 
secretary of state for Asia-Pacific, will be speaking on that.
<P>
	The third point I would like to stress is what someone might call 
the political or constitutional-not that we are keen on the word 
constitutional these days-which is the government's historic 
recognition of British Columbia as a distinct region of this country, 
instead of simply being lumped with the prairies as has been the 
case when we used the term, the west, and included all four 
provinces. British Columbia is different. It is important that that be 
recognized. I am very pleased it has been recognized.
<P>
	Fourth, the Reform Party's motion refers to British Columbia's 
position as Canada's gateway to the Pacific. I would like to 
mention some of our policies in transportation and elsewhere that 
are making British Columbia, particularly the airport in Vancouver, 
not just the gateway of western Canada or even North America to 
the Pacific but the whole western hemisphere. I will be talking 
about that at some length.
<P>
	Fifth, I would like to mention several specific issues that relate 
particularly to British Columbia where we have had, thanks to the 
government's actions, B.C. priorities brought to bear on national 
decision making.
<P>
	The final point I would like to make is that in all these major 
areas of concern for all British Columbians, the Reform Party has 
been a non-factor. It has been invisible. It has been insensitive. It 
has been ineffectual. It has been incompetent and, generally, it has 
been in a tailspin. This is shown clearly by the polls that have them 
falling rapidly and steadily in British Columbia from the position it 
held at the time of the election.
<P>
	First is the debt, deficit, economy and jobs issue. In the last 
election campaign in British Columbia, British Columbians and 
Canadians across the country made it clear that the government had 
to get its fiscal house in order. The government promised that and it 
is delivering.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4843"> 4843 </A></B>
<P>
	Job creation and deficit reduction go hand in hand. With a 
balanced and prudent approach, the government set out not only 
to meet but to exceed the targets set in 1993 one after another. 
Remember that not too long ago, Canada was faced with a deficit 
annually of $42 billion. By 1997-98, that will have been cut to 
$17 billion, which represents a 60 per cent reduction over that 
period.
<P>
	We have worked hard on the government side to create a climate 
in which Canadians in business can expand, can grow, can hire 
more other Canadians and can provide the opportunities which 
result from that.
<P>
	In British Columbia, the results are encouraging. It has one of 
the strongest provincial economies in the country. In fact, in most 
of that period it has been the strongest. British Columbia has 
created 100,000 new jobs since 1993 and the provincial inflation 
rate has dropped on a year over year basis of 1.2 per cent in April 
1996. The employment growth is the highest in the country.
<P>
<B>(1235 )</B>
<P>
	We expect this to be exceeded in the future. Over the next 
decade, it is expected British Columbia will create approximately 
400,000 new jobs. It is not a question of the federal government 
doing this alone. However, the policies put in place allow the 
private sector to achieve the successes necessary for expansion and 
improvement in the job position.
<P>
	We also of course are extremely lucky because of our strategic 
position on the edge of the Pacific and in relation to the 
Asia-Pacific trade. British Columbia is also endowed with 
resources which contribute dramatically to its opportunities.
<P>
	However, the government has done its appropriate part to make 
sure British Columbians and British Columbia take advantage of 
those opportunities that I mentioned. We have the fundamentals 
right. The fundamental fiscal problem is being dealt with and we 
are getting the situation in the country as a whole, and in particular 
in British Columbia, into a far happier situation than it was three 
years ago.
<P>
	Interest rates have declined three percentage points in the past 12 
months. British Columbians know well, as do others across the 
country, that lower interest rates are the key to job creation because 
it encourages businesses to make investments and expand. It also, I 
might add, allows families to save thousands of dollars on their 
mortgage payments.
<P>
	The inflation rate is the lowest in 30 years. British Columbians 
know how important it is for attracting foreign investment. Cutting 
the deficit, lowering interest rates and controlling inflation mean a 
stable economic climate in which foreign investment can be 
attracted and the economy can grow.
<P>
	My second topic is Asia-Pacific. Canada is a Pacific nation and 
the government has brought that fact to life more than any previous 
government in recent history. The Pacific advantage is an 
advantage for all Canadians wherever they live, but it is 
particularly important in British Columbia.
<P>
	The province of British Columbia is showing the way by taking 
advantage of the opportunities in the most economically vibrant 
region of the world. We are trying to work together with our fellow 
Canadians to make sure we benefit by the opportunities provided 
on the Pacific rim.
<P>
	APEC, the Asia-Pacific Economic Conference, will be held in 
Vancouver, which is in my view the premier international city now 
and a jewel on the Pacific rim. As a British Columbian, I am 
pleased to see this city develop into a major commercial, cultural 
and tourism centre for the Pacific rim but also for the world. Its role 
as the gateway for the Asia-Pacific market will be showcased when 
the Prime Minister hosts the heads of state for the APEC leaders' 
summit in November of next year.
<P>
	Our active participation in APEC over the last three years 
ensures that the interests of British Columbia and Canadians are 
fully taken into account in any decisions which strengthen 
trans-Pacific trade. We are in constant contact with other nations of 
the region in all sectors, private and public, so that the trade, 
economic and cultural objectives in Asia-Pacific can be realized.
<P>
	There will be a series of other meetings taking place next year 
with respect to APEC. We have indicated that 1997 will be 
Canada's year of the Pacific. I, for example, as Minister of 
Transport, have invited my counterparts to a transportation 
ministerial meeting to be held in British Columbia in June 1997, 
the theme being ``transportation supporting trade and growth in 
APEC''. I believe the involvement of the government in APEC is a 
pretty clear indication that when it comes to looking to the future 
and expanding opportunities we are doing what we can and doing it 
well.
<P>
	Team Canada has been talked about frequently. The trade 
missions have been outstanding successes. Members will recollect 
that the emphasis of those trade missions has been the Pacific rim. 
In the red book we made a commitment to strengthen our trading 
relationship with the Pacific rim and those trade missions were a 
direct result of that red book commitment.
<P>
	We have had Team Canada trade missions to China, India, 
Pakistan, Indonesia and Malaya and they have proved to be 
extremely successful in providing opportunity for British 
Columbia and other Canadian businesses to obtain entry into other 
markets.
<P>
<B>(1240 )</B>
<P>
	The figures of billions of dollars of trade have been explained at 
other times in the House. I need not go into them again. All I can 
say about the specific British Columbia component is that the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4844"> 4844 </A></B>
<P>
increase in trade with the Pacific throughout the country inevitably 
benefits the  city and the province best suited to take advantage of 
its geographic position on the Pacific rim.
<P>
	We are not, however, resting on our laurels with respect to trade. 
We intend to have a further mission. The Prime Minister in January 
will lead another trade mission to Asia. Once again I confidently 
expect that British Columbian entrepreneurs and business people 
will be among the most active of the people who accompany him.
<P>
	The recognition of British Columbia as a fifth region of the 
country is important.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> Belatedly.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Anderson:</B> The hon. member says ``belatedly''. I wonder 
where they were when this issue was being debated.
<P>
	Last December a bill was introduced which indicated how the 
federal government would approach the constitutional amending 
formula. It outlined a regionally sensitive formula, but it did not 
include British Columbia. As a result of representations from 
myself and my colleagues in the British Columbia caucus-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Anderson:</B> The peanut gallery is making comments. They 
did absolutely nothing to achieve the recognition of British 
Columbia as a distinct region of the country. They did nothing at 
all. Months later their complaints start.
<P>
	The Prime Minister listened to our caucus. The result, for the 
first time, was that British Columbia was recognized as a distinct 
region for constitutional purposes. We are no longer lumped with 
the other western provinces.
<P>
	I would like to go back about 50 years and quote from Bruce 
Hutchison's book <I>The Unknown Country</I>. He said: ``Crossing the 
Rockies you are in a new country, as if you had crossed a national 
frontier. Everyone feels it. Even the stranger feels the change in 
tempo, in outlook and in attitude''. That was 50 years ago. Fifty 
years later it was recognized by the Prime Minister. That is what 
leadership is all about.
<P>
	I would like to speak on transportation, tourism and 
Asia-Pacific. The Reform Party's motion refers to British 
Columbia's position as Canada's gateway to Asia-Pacific. I would 
like to mention some of the policies, which are apparently 
unknown to Reformers, in transportation and in other areas which 
are helping to make British Columbia not only Canada's gateway, 
but, as I indicated earlier, the hemisphere's gateway to 
Asia-Pacific.
<P>
	We are making it a priority to maximize the blessings of 
geography, for example, with respect to Vancouver's airport. The 
Reform Party is proposing today that we recognize B.C. as the 
gateway to Asia. That has already been done. As the saying goes, 
better late than never. It is better that the Reform Party recognize 
now what has  gone on over the last three years rather than continue 
in the ignorance which its members have displayed to date.
<P>
	Sweeping and bold changes were introduced by the government 
which are liberating business in B.C. from red tape and 
bureaucratic clutter. They are allowing businesses to compete 
successfully with the very best of European, Asian and American 
businesses. They are strategic, forward looking and they are 
helping to position British Columbia as the international gateway.
<P>
	Let me cite a few examples. The Vancouver international airport 
is fast becoming the hub for passengers and cargo travelling 
between Asia, Canada, the United States and Latin America. The 
Vancouver international airport served more than 11 million 
passengers in 1995. Its growth in that year out performed the 
national averages in every single sector. Indications are that 1996 
will be even better, with the airport reporting a 21 per cent increase 
in passenger handling as of the end of July. This is not happening 
by chance. Policies laid down by the government are making it 
possible. Open skies, signed in February of 1995, is an excellent 
example of how policy helps the private sector.
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
	It is not the impediment to growth that the Reform Party is 
indicating today. Rather, it is a landmark new initiative which gives 
Canadian air carriers unlimited route rights from any point in 
Canada to any point in the United States. It provides reciprocal 
rights for American carriers across Canada except with certain 
limitations in Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal where there is a 
phase-in period.
<P>
	Vancouver, as much as anywhere in the country, has seized the 
opportunity this government created with the open skies accord. To 
date, approximately 25 new routes between Vancouver 
international airport and the U.S. have been introduced. That is a 
massive leap in traffic at a time when most airports are 
experiencing far slower growth.
<P>
	Air Canada has added services from Glasgow, Osaka, Paris, 
Seoul and Zurich to Vancouver over the past three years, as well as 
the Canadian international flights which are long established and 
better known.
<P>
	In addition, we have been negotiating with many of the countries 
of the Asia Pacific region to establish new services. These include 
Japan, Hong Kong, Malaysia, the Philippines. The Philippines only 
two or three weeks ago established a daily service to Vancouver.
<P>
	The distance from Hong Kong to Chicago is almost 1,000 
kilometres shorter when you use Vancouver instead of San 
Francisco as the gateway. We are making sure those advantages are 
realized.
<P>
	The advantages of the new airport policy have again been seized 
enthusiastically by Vancouver. We now have in Vancouver one of 
the most successful modern airports in the world. I toured it 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4845"> 4845 </A></B>
<P>
recently with the American secretary of transportation and it was 
pleasant to hear his compliments on this score.
<P>
	The port of Vancouver is another extremely important element in 
the transportation system. In terms of tonnage it is among the top 
three ports in North America and is the major generator of jobs, 
growth and economic benefit in Vancouver.
<P>
	The port's activities generate more than 10,700 full time jobs, 
and that is directly. The government looked at ports, looked at 
Vancouver, looked at the other ports of the country and then asked 
how can we make this better. And in fact, we did.
<P>
	We want to ensure more local control, more businesslike 
approaches and less red tape. All this is taking place under the new 
marine policy. We will have greater efficiency, cut costs and we 
will give communities more control over their ports. That will 
allow Vancouver to further take advantage of its geographical and 
ice free port position.
<P>
	Last year the port of Vancouver handled approximately 71.5 
million tonnes of cargo from over 10,000 foreign and domestic 
vessels. Cargo worth more than $29 billion went through the port's 
20 major terminals to and from more than 90 different countries. 
With the introduction of Bill C-44 by this government, the 
subsequent years are likely to be a great deal better and stronger.
<P>
	The cruise passenger industry is another area of great success. 
Once again positive policies of the government have contributed to 
that success.
<P>
	Among other examples I will mention is the customs accord 
which was signed at the same time as the air accord in February 
1995. We are expanding and improving the facilities at the border, 
thus making travel easier, thus making cross border trade a great 
deal better.
<P>
	I could give figures on tourism but I think they are well known. 
Tourism has dramatically expanded. The gain from this tourism 
increase to the Canadian and British Columbian economies has 
been dramatic.
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	I might add that the party opposite certainly did not support the 
Prime Minister when he tripled the amount of federal funds that 
went into tourism promotion; indeed it opposed it. Now it sees the 
results, a greatly expanded economy, and naturally it is trying to 
swim on board.
<P>
	Specific B.C. issues have made British Columbia's economy 
more effective, more competitive and more stable for investment 
from overseas. As my time is limited, let mention three examples: 
softwood lumber, B.C. Tel and the Triumph decision.
<P>
	Softwood lumber is an area where we heard next to nothing from 
the Reform Party and yet a critically important issue to British 
Columbia. We have had over the last 10 years constant 
U.S.-Canadian bickering over softwood lumber exports, and 
Canadian exporters posted approximately $800 million worth of 
bonds and cash as countervailing duties just to get their products 
into the United States.
<P>
	This government brought an end to all of that and we now have 
the U.S.-Canada Softwood Lumber Agreement, announced in April 
of this year. The U.S. has now made the unprecedented 
commitment not to launch any trade actions on softwood lumber 
exports from Canada for the next five years. Thus stability for the 
industry, thus an industry which is nowhere in the country more 
important than in British Columbia, a definite economic gain.
<P>
	Softwood lumber exports are 65 per cent from British Columbia 
to the United States. The remaining provinces have the remaining 
35 per cent.
<P>
	On the quota, province by province, British Columbia lumber 
companies receive the initial allocation of 59 per cent, which was 
welcomed by the industry both publicly and in private 
communications. I think the Reform Party probably now 
understands that and once again would like belatedly to get on 
board.
<P>
	With regard to the B.C. Tel issue, an exception was made for 
British Columbia telephone which allowed the national policy to 
work effectively and which satisfied the important considerations 
of British Columbia at that time.
<P>
	Similarly for Triumph, the research facility at the University of 
British Columbia, once again steady funding over the period, an 
opportunity for that to do its very best and to expand the economy 
of our province.
<P>
	In summary, we have a clear example here of government 
policies which have led to improved economic conditions, an 
improved position for British Columbia. Our only problem we face 
in this House is that we have 24 Reform MPs from British 
Columbia who do not seem to understand the importance of 
working constructively to make sure these advantages are made 
even greater by working collectively in the years ahead.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will try to keep my question very short because I know a 
lot of my colleagues would like to ask a question of the minister. It 
is not often that we get the opportunity.
<P>
	My question deals with a specific case which I referred to a few 
minutes ago in the House. What we have seen this last weekend is 
the Alaska highway achieve its rightful place in world recognition 
as the 16th international historic civil engineering landmark. It is 
now in the company of the Eiffel Tower, the Statue of Liberty, the 
Panama Canal, et cetera.
<P>
	This minister did not deem it important enough to show up. This 
minister did not deem it important enough to even send a letter. 
This minister did not deem it important enough to send even a 
message that could be read at the ceremony on Saturday. I wonder, 
if this is an example of how he treats the importance of British 
Columbian issues?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4846"> 4846 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Anderson:</B> Mr. Speaker, it shows the difference between 
Reformers on that side and the Liberals on this side. They are 
concerned with pomp and ceremonies. We are concerned with 
actual concrete results to achieve an improved economy for British 
Columbia. It is a simple example of the difference between our two 
parties. They go for show, we go for substance on this side of the 
House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
minister says everything is just wonderful in B.C. and everything 
that has gone right is because of his personal intervention.
<P>
	The minister seems to avoid any public accountability in B.C. 
for the actions of his party. He was a guest on the David Mitchell 
radio show a couple of weeks ago, but he only took one phone call 
from the public on the open line. That one phone call was 
extremely critical of his government and its policies.
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
	There is another major talk show host in Vancouver, Rafe Mair, 
who constantly requests the minister to come on the show to 
answer questions and take an open line to the people of B.C.
<P>
	I would like the minister to answer why he will not go on the 
Rafe Mair show or whether he will give a commitment in the 
House today that he will go on the Rafe Mair show and take open 
line in order to be accountable for the actions of his party in 
government.
<P>
	I would also like the minister to comment on an article that was 
written by Barbara Yaffe in the Saturday edition of the Vancouver 
<I>Sun</I>. That article mentions a special report prepared for the 
intergovernmental affairs minister by the member for Simcoe 
North who recently travelled throughout B.C. and discovered that 
``the people in B.C. are feeling a sense of alienation and are 
mistrustful of Ottawa''.
<P>
	The minister was called for comment by Ms. Yaffe and he 
declined to return the calls. Sure there is a feeling of alienation and 
miscommunication. The minister is responsible for it.
<P>
	Why did he not return the call and could he please comment on 
the report prepared by the member for Simcoe North which 
indicates clearly that there is major alienation in B.C.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Anderson:</B> Mr. Speaker, with respect to Mr. Mitchell's 
hotline program, the hon. member is apparently unaware in his 
innocence of these matters that it is the host who determines how 
many questions go on the air, not the guest. That deals with that 
issue.
<P>
	With respect to Mr. Mair, for whom he appears to be the agent, I 
have been on that program at least twice. I do not object to going on 
<P>
there again, but there is a certain predictability of that program. 
There is a certain predictability of the audience which makes me 
feel that I am not truly speaking to ordinary, average British 
Columbians when I am on his program.
<P>
	The Reform Party, which is sinking so rapidly in the public 
opinion of British Columbia, should begin to understand the 
message I am giving it. Wake up. Find out where the real majority 
of British Columbians stand. They are not restricted to the audience 
of one or another hotline radio program.
<P>
	With respect to Barbara Yaffe, I have not read her column. I do 
not recollect receiving a call from her on Friday. I will check my 
file. There may be dozens of calls a day from the press at particular 
times when there are issues such a WestJet and others which take 
the time of a minister. However, I will check. The normal course of 
events for Barbara Yaffe as a columnist in Vancouver is that the 
calls are all returned to her.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Duncan (North Island-Powell River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I noticed the minister likes to take credit for a lot of issues 
with regard to the deficit. We should perhaps talk about the record 
of the government.
<P>
	Indeed the deficit has gone down by $25 billion during this term. 
However, new government revenues received from the taxpayers 
have gone up $25 billion. So what are all these government 
cutbacks about? They are about paying more interest on the debt. 
The Liberals do not want to talk about the debt, but it will exceed 
$600 billion next month and will be by their own estimates $619 
billion next year.
<P>
	If the Reform Party's platform had been adopted by this 
government we would have already balanced the books and we 
would be starting to see no more cuts in program delivery. The 
program delivery cuts we suggested, you are in many cases 
exceeding in what you are doing and we very much question the 
priority-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I remind members to direct 
all interventions through the Chair, not directly to one another 
across the floors. I will allow the hon. member for North 
Island-Powell River to conclude his comments and his question, 
please.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> Mr. Speaker, I regret that. I lost myself there.
<P>
<B>(1300 )</B>
<P>
	The minister talked about the veto situation in British Columbia. 
It is very clear that British Columbians did not want a veto for 
anyone when it came to constitutional change. If the minister wants 
to know why half of the British Columbian Reform members voted 
against a veto for British Columbia it was because we were 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4847"> 4847 </A></B>
<P>
opposed to the whole concept of vetoes which in the long run is 
going to make constitutional change very difficult indeed.
<P>
	I was personally involved in the softwood lumber dispute. I got 
into a debate in the media with the member for Kenora-Rainy 
River in Ontario. I assure the minister that we were talking to 
industry. We were taking an active interest. We were putting some 
Ontario members on notice that British Columbia had a strong 
agenda. All the government did was to do what was correct and 
fair, which is unusual. Some things have been done which have 
been fair. They were done that way simply because there are 24 
Reform members from the province of British Columbia.
<P>
	A further observation is that the minister certainly enjoys taking 
credit for some of the initiatives that were carried forward by the 
previous Minister of Transport, the best minister this government 
has had.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Anderson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not know quite where to start.
<P>
	Let us start with half of the Reformers voting for the veto and 
half voting against it. The hon. member explains why half voted 
against it, but he does not explain why half of his colleagues voted 
the other way. That is as mixed up as the Reform Party usually is on 
most important issues affecting British Columbia.
<P>
	With respect to the debt and deficit, let me explain again to the 
member that revenues are up. Why? Because the economic 
situation is better and revenues go up at times like that. This is a 
lesson in economics which apparently has missed the hon. member 
and indeed the whole Reform Party.
<P>
	Had we adopted Reform's policies, we would not have had that 
increase in economic activity. We would not have had that increase 
in revenue and we would not have been able to cut the deficit as this 
government has done. It is perfectly clear that he had better 
understand a little better what the issue is with respect to deficits 
and how one can tackle it effectively without creating a 
recessionary situation which would put millions more Canadians 
out of work, which was their policy.
<P>
	With respect to softwood lumber, I am glad to hear what he has 
said about his party being in favour of what happened because we 
did not hear it when it counted, which was before the decision was 
made. Now he has corrected the record. We say: ``Fine. Thank you 
for joining with us in making sure that we got that particular matter 
dealt with''.
<P>
	The basic problem, if I may point this out to the House at this 
time, is that in the Reform Party, British Columbia members 
simply do not get a fair shake. They have four times as many 
members in this House as the Liberal caucus which has six from 
British Columbia, but Reform's Alberta members are constantly 
dominating what goes on in that party.
<P>
	An article in the Edmonton <I>Journal</I> talks about the B.C. 
members being left out in the cold in the assignment of duties. It 
talks about a specific member, the chairman of the B.C. caucus, 
who said that finance, criminal justice matters and the future of 
social programs are the most important items on the national 
agenda for the next few years. They are key issues where Reform 
hopes to score points and Alberta Reformers were awarded all of 
these prestige critic positions by the hon. member from Calgary, 
the leader of that party.
<P>
	The chairman of the B.C. caucus went on to say that it is needed 
to make the hon. member from Calgary, the leader of his party, 
realize the need for more regional balance. ``We do not want to be 
run by one province. Appearances in politics is everything''.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	This is one of the basic problems that we from British Columbia, 
all 32 of us, as a group face in the House of Commons. There are 
six on the government side and 26 on the opposition side, 24 of 
whom are in the Reform Party, the third party. Those Reform 
members do not get a look in when the Alberta people are dividing 
the critic's positions or the opportunities for questioning in this 
House. I have here all the information on issue after issue affecting 
British Columbians where they have sat silent because the Alberta 
members dominate their caucus.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, first of 
all, I would like to commend my colleague from North 
Island-Powell River for putting forward today's opposition 
motion on behalf of the Reform Party.
<P>
	We will use the time allocated to the official opposition to show 
how, at the eastern end, on the Quebec side, the federal 
government's malfeasance and attitudes have also impeded 
progress, especially in Quebec.
<P>
	For the benefit of the people listening to us, I will read this 
motion:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House support British Columbia as Canada's gateway to the Asia Pacific 
and recognize British Columbia as a major economic power in the region, and as a 
consequence, this House condemn the federal government for impeding progress in 
Western Canada by its management of the affairs of the nation, exemplified by the 
government's mishandling of the west coast fishery, Coast Guard services, the 
closure of military bases at Aldergrove and Chilliwack, B.C., the elimination of 
federal Ports Canada policing in B.C., the movement of grain to Prince Rupert, B.C. 
and other issues detrimental to the state of the nation.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	You will agree with me that, in several instances, if the word 
``Quebec'' were substituted for the words ``Western Canada'' or 
``nation'', one could come to practically the same conclusions as 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4848"> 4848 </A></B>
<P>
the hon. member for North Island-Powell River. I will address the 
part of his  motion dealing with the Coast Guard, which could lead 
to other federal issues that have hurt Quebec and its economy for 
some 30 years.
<P>
	I am very happy to participate in this debate on the Coast Guard, 
among other things, as an associate member of the fisheries and 
oceans committee, as the member for Trois-Rivières, which is a 
port city, a maritime city, and also as the official opposition's critic 
on regional development.
<P>
	The Coast Guard has launched a full-scale attack against what 
could be called Quebec's overall economy. It is leading a frontal 
attack against St. Lawrence Seaway, its ports and those who use 
them and it is also carrying out an assault that is more deceitful, 
hypocritical and irresponsible in economic terms against ordinary 
citizens, ordinary Quebec consumers unlucky enough-as we will 
see in a moment-to own a pedal-boat, a kayak or a rowboat and to 
use it on one of Quebec's lakes or little rivers in their free time.
<P>
	We will start our review of these two issues by looking at the 
Coast Guard's plan to charge users of the St. Lawrence River and 
the St. Lawrence Seaway. A decision was made a few months ago, 
at the beginning of the year, to charge users of the St. Lawrence in 
three ways: first, for the use of navigational aids such as beacons, 
buoys and telecommunications, most of which are managed by the 
Canadian Coast Guard; second, as early as this fall, for ice 
removal, for the use of icebreakers and: third, for the dredging of 
the ports on the St. Lawrence and the channels leading from each 
port to the St. Lawrence.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	The project was the subject of what is termed consultation at the 
Coast Guard. The IBI report, according to all those who appeared 
before the Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans, involved 
bogus consultation; it is not even worth the paper it is written on, 
for all its irresponsibility and biased questions responses.
<P>
	That was the position at Fisheries and Oceans and at the Coast 
Guard, but following strong representations made by the official 
opposition, the minister finally had to admit that the fisheries and 
oceans committee should be consulted and users invited to at least 
express their views publicly, which was done.
<P>
	About fifty users from across Canada came to testify, 75 per cent 
of whom requested a moratorium, in part because, the IBI study did 
not include an impact assessment to determine how a decision to 
impose a tariff would affect the users. In many cases, the 
shipowners using the St. Lawrence River are foreign shipowners, 
and they will now be charged for the use of the river, which will 
seriously jeopardize the competitiveness of ports along the St. 
Lawrence.
<P>
	There has been no impact study, although the industry 
concerned, the stakeholders were prepared to participate in a joint 
government-user study. Instead, the government took a unilateral, 
arbitrary approach, deciding to impose, as a first step, new tariffs 
for navigational aids.
<P>
	Governments, and not the least significant ones, namely the 
governments of Ontario and Quebec, reacted very strongly against 
this. But as far as I know, while the Quebec Minister of Transport, 
Mr. Brassard, who is responsible for this issue, has repeatedly 
asked to meet the federal minister responsible. No meeting has 
taken place. This goes to show the arbitrary way this government 
goes about things and the true extent of its willingness to 
co-operate.
<P>
	Another decision was made later on. Contrary to the decision 
made at the time when a uniform tariff was being considered, that 
is to say a single tariff applied throughout Canada, from coast to 
coast, the government gave in to lobby groups from across the 
country and decided to divided the country in three regions.
<P>
	There is a specific objective: user fees. The Coast Guard has a 
mandate to come up with X millions of dollars as its contribution in 
the fight to bring down the Canadian government's deficit. Nobody 
has come right out and said so-it is the Coast Guard's share.
<P>
	With all of Canada facing a real problem, they decided to carve 
up this vast, wonderful, united country into three large regions: the 
West; central Canada, meaning the St. Lawrence River and the 
Great Lakes; and the East, that is the Maritimes, with the Port of 
Halifax obviously being the focal point. They have carved Canada 
up into three large regions with three kinds of user fees.
<P>
	There is one fee for the West, one for central Canada, and one for 
the East. As if by chance, the central region, including Quebec and 
Ontario, the St. Lawrence Seaway and the Great Lakes, is being 
asked to contribute the most. Forty-eight per cent of the revenues 
from these fees will come from the central region, 30 per cent from 
the East and 22 per cent from the West.
<P>
	The concept of user fees being proposed, furthermore, is truly 
astonishing. Not only were there no real consultations, but it has 
been decided that people travelling on the St. Lawrence use the 
services of the Coast Guard.
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	In not one case has it ever been shown that any services are 
actually provided, but the Coast Guard has decided to charge fees 
anyway.
<P>
	The result is that, for North Shore ports, such as Baie-Comeau, 
Sept-Îles and Port-Cartier, a single buoy, an aid to navigation, will 
cost users $5 million. This is a small example of what happens 
when the powers that be fail to consult the client where the concept 
of user fees is involved.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4849"> 4849 </A></B>
<P>
	The overall result is that, without any impact study, it seems 
that, according to users, there is a serious danger, given the very 
fierce competition that exists, that the competitiveness of ports on 
the St. Lawrence, and even in the Great Lakes, but especially ports 
on the St. Lawrence, will be jeopardized by the additional costs 
resulting from these new rates, which will put St. Lawrence ports 
at a disadvantage compared to ports in eastern Canada, particularly 
Halifax, ports on the American eastern seaboard, and even ports 
on the Mississippi.
<P>
	There is talk in certain sectors, and not the least important ones, 
and this view is supported up by SODES, the Société de 
développement économique du Saint-Laurent, that the existing fees 
could double with the introduction of this new scheme.
<P>
	Do you know what SODES is? It is not some little backwater 
special interest group. It has 110 members. They come from 
practically everywhere in Canada, although mostly from Quebec, 
given the name. Its members include: the Association de l'industrie 
de l'aluminium du Québec-all the aluminum smelters in Quebec 
belong to SODES-the Association des armateurs du 
Saint-Laurent, the Association des industries forestières du 
Québec, all the pulp and paper industries, and the Business 
Development Bank of Canada. The federal government belongs to 
SODES, and SODES feels that there is a likelihood of the fees 
doubling. Canada Steamship Lines is a member-and I hardly need 
draw you a picture to show that its federal connections are not very 
distant ones. St. Lawrence Cement, the entire Quebec City Urban 
Community is a member, as is the Quebec-Cartier Mining 
Company, Trois-Rivières grain elevators, in my riding, le Groupe 
Desgagnés, le Groupe Océan. Industry Canada is also a member of 
SODES.
<P>
	SODES is, therefore, very concerned about the effects which are, 
to use its members' own words, potentially devastating for the 
economy of Quebec, the cities and ports along the St. Lawrence. 
Industry Canada is a stakeholder in the SODES evaluation. The 
Quebec Maritime Institute, Lavery &amp; de Billy-a major law 
firm-, Logistec Corporation, MIL Davie, Oceanex. Fisheries and 
Oceans Canada is also a member of SODES. The consistency of 
this government is quite evident.
<P>
	Irving Oil too is a member. No less than Irving, of the fine 
province of New Brunswick, whose owner, let me remind 
you,-there must certainly be an element of family trust in this 
story-threatened to cut his children out of the will if they did not 
move out of Canada to avoid paying tax, to avoid his estate's 
ending up in Canada's tax coffers. Irving Oil is a member of 
SODES, in brackets, and is also threatened by the federal plans. 
The central St. Lawrence pilots, the port of Montreal, the port of 
Sept-Iles, the port of Trois-Rivières, the port of  the Saguenay, to 
name just a few. The Shipping Federation of Canada, the Société du 
parc industriel et portuaire de Bécancour, Transport Canada-also 
a member-, Ultramar, the City of Montreal, Quebec City. I could 
go on and on; there are 110 in all.
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	So this is just the first step. We are talking about navigational 
aids only, because more information is available on this particular 
subject. It will be necessary to recover $20 million in 1996, out of 
projected $180 million to be recovered between now and the year 
2000: $20 million this year, $40 million in each of the two 
following years, and then $60 million annually, the other items 
being deicing, the use of icebreakers and dredging of harbours.
<P>
	Another source of irritation to users is the fact that, contrary to 
what was called for, there was no cost cutting by the Coast Guard 
itself, which might have reduced fees to users.
<P>
	According to our information, the Coast Guard has never 
embarked on an exercise to streamline its operations, which would 
have made its case more convincing. We must realize that putting 
the burden on the shoulders of users weakens the competitive 
position of St. Lawrence ports and makes it less attractive for 
shippers to do business with us. The cost-cutting exercise never 
took place. As I pointed out earlier, there was no explanation of the 
actual services the Coast Guard offers its users on a day to day 
basis.
<P>
	One of the points that, in my opinion, illustrates the disastrous 
consequences of lack of co-operation between Fisheries and 
Oceans and users concerns the way fees are charged, which is a 
very important aspect. A decision is made to charge fees, but how 
will this be done? Apparently there were two methods known to 
those in the industry. The first one is based on the size of the ship. I 
will give you a fictional tonnage: a ship that has a tonnage of 
30,000 always has a tonnage of 30,000, wherever it may be.
<P>
	The other method is according to the tonnage of cargo unloaded, 
which makes all the difference and is a sore point between ports of 
destination and ports of call. In this case, we have a major port of 
destination, the port of Montreal, and a major port of call, the port 
of Halifax. If we take the method based on the size of the ship, all 
ports are equal, but if the fee is based on tonnage unloaded, this 
works out to the advantage of the port where the unloading takes 
place.
<P>
	So of course the port of Halifax has an advantage if the fee was 
based on the tonnage of cargo unloaded. So what was the Coast 
Guard's decision? It decided that fees would be based on the 
unloaded cargo tonnage, thus obviously favouring the port of 
Halifax at the expense of Montreal. Another good decision 
designed to favour Quebec's economy, right?
<P>
	An additional consequence is that, again according to 
calculations made by SODES, which I mentioned earlier, these 
costs could reach one dollar per ton. There was so little 
consultation-and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4850"> 4850 </A></B>
<P>
SODES is a responsible organization, as we saw earlier-that, 
according to the Coast Guard, these additional costs could result in 
an increase of ten cents per ton.
<P>
	There is therefore, as we can see, a huge gap between the 
estimates of two organizations that are supposed to be responsible, 
competent and capable of issuing an opinion. Someone may be 
wrong, but this discrepancy definitely shows that there was no 
co-operation.
<P>
	A direct consequence of this is that, should things remain the 
same, the north shore region, including Baie-Comeau, Sept-Îles, 
Port-Cartier and other ports, not using icebreakers since there is not 
enough ice build up in that area, will be charged a fee for the use of 
icebreakers, even though there is no need. This will be the case 
because it was decided that, in such and such regions, under such 
and such conditions, it will cost so much money for the use of 
icebreakers. People are very concerned because, again, this 
situation will adversely affect these ports, in terms of their ability 
to compete with other ports.
<P>
<B>(1325)</B>
<P>
	What the Coast Guard did last spring shows that it did not know 
where it was going. For example, over two weeks, from the end of 
February to the middle of March, its overall fee schedule rose from 
$3.40 to $4.48, an increase of $1.08 or 33 per cent per gross ton. 
This is very important as it, in my opinion, contributes to this 
whole exercise's lack of credibility with users, because every time 
the Coast Guard is pressured by a lobby group into changing its fee 
schedules or procedures, it just so happens that the changes are 
made at the expense of Quebec's management and infrastructure. A 
$1.08 increase over two weeks is quite impressive when we are 
talking about three or four dollars.
<P>
	Another practical consequence is that, according to what we 
have learned, a 25,000-ton ship will have to pay $112,000 a year 
just for navigational aids. Users will eventually also have to pay for 
ice breaking and dredging operations. Do you not think that this 
represents a serious threat to us all, at least in Quebec? Since all 
this is being managed from Ottawa, since Quebec has no say in 
these decisions, Quebec's overall economy may be seriously 
compromised by such actions if we fail to mobilize more against 
them.
<P>
	Since I have only two minutes left, much to my surprise, I will 
quickly move on to the other decision made by the Coast Guard, 
which is a beauty. I am talking about recreational boaters.
<P>
	The government has in the works an elaborate mandatory 
registration process for small craft: canoes, kayaks, rowboats and 
pedal boats. The fee will vary from  $5 to $35 per craft and covers 
training courses and a penalty system. Again, the consultation was 
bogus-that is what we were told-strangely similar to the 
consultation process involving the users of the St. Lawrence River.
<P>
	The great excuse given for meddling in this area is public safety. 
But how will paying a $25 fee before they set foot in their boats 
make recreational boaters more safety conscious? I think this is a 
relevant question. How will this make pleasure boaters more safety 
conscious, especially since this is based on the principle of user 
fees?
<P>
	Fisheries and Oceans is responsible for lakes. It is pretty 
outrageous, in fact, for Fisheries and Oceans to look after the lakes 
and small rivers in Quebec, while the Coast Guard has jurisdiction 
over the St. Lawrence River, the Richelieu River, the Ottawa River 
and the Saguenay River. Those who vacation in Quebec, who spend 
money in Quebec and Canada, who take a rowboat or a pedal boat 
along any small river or lake in Canada are being obliged to pay up. 
They are being charged a fee while the owners of sumptuous boats 
are not being bothered. They have to register their boats, but can do 
so for free. Yet, they are the ones really who make the most use of 
the buoys, communications facilities and locks.
<P>
	Do you know how much it apparently costs to move a 30-footer 
through a lock? The rate is 50 cents per foot. This means a mere 
$15 to get a lock opened. But they want to tax the individual who 
enjoys a ride on a pedal boat along the shore of a small lake. That is 
what it is, a tax, a disguised tax, which-and I say this as the critic 
for regional development-penalizes Quebecers and Canadians 
who vacation in Quebec and Canada. Perhaps some thought should 
be give to that, to how this affects those who spend at home instead 
of abroad. They are being penalized by this anti-regional 
development measure, among other things.
<P>
	I could go on about this, but my time has expired.

<P>
	<B>Mr. John Duncan (North Island-Powell River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I thank my colleague from the Bloc for his speech. There 
is some commonality in some of the things my colleague is 
speaking about.
<P>
	One of the concerns is the whole question of user fees. It has 
been identified that Canadians are paying more now in user fees for 
government services than they are paying for GST. We are dealing 
with a level of government, the federal government, that basically 
collects one dollar in two of all taxes in Canada. To me these user 
fees appear to be a new form of taxation that is not called taxation 
in some cases. It is easy to buy into the user fee principle as long as 
the fee is used for appropriate purposes.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4851"> 4851 </A></B>
<P>
	One of the concerns that has been identified in British Columbia 
is that we now have a commercial marine industry that as of June 
is paying commercial marine fees in a major way. There is the 
recreational fee the member was also referring to which will be 
coming into play probably next year. It has been deferred. We 
know from insiders that this is another tax or revenue grab. It will 
be packaged in such a way that this is a necessary user fee in order 
to ensure that recreational boats and recreational boaters are 
appropriately licensed and controlled in some measure. Is that how 
the member sees it?
<P>
	Another thing that concerns us is the sense of priorization that is 
coming forward. The safety aspects in the Pacific region that deal 
with public safety, the cuts that are being made that have serious 
ramifications are the rough equivalent of $7 million annually. I am 
not talking about fisheries management here. I am only talking 
public safety, the coast guard, search and rescue. At the same time 
we see the minister of heritage spending an unbudgeted amount but 
what is reported to be $23 million to give away Canadian flags. I 
would ask the member to comment on that.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rocheleau:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
question. I think that, in the case of recreational boaters, this is 
indeed a disguised tax. It is ill-advised to implement such a 
measure. In the case of Quebec, it might make sense if, at least, it 
only applied to those waters, including the St. Lawrence River, 
where the Coast Guard is present.
<P>
	However, supposedly for reasons of public safety, this applies to 
areas where the Coast Guard never set foot and does not provide 
any service. There is something which I did not mention earlier, but 
which I find very annoying. I am referring to the purported benefits 
mentioned by the Coast Guard to justify the registration of boats 
and the implementation of user fees. As regards these benefits, the 
Coast Guard issued the following press release on April 30, 1996:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Benefits: The establishment of a computerized system to store up-to-date 
information on boats allowing the organizations responsible for search and rescue 
operations and for implementing the act, to have quick access to reliable data, 24 
hours a day. This system would greatly increase their effectiveness during 
investigations relating to theft and other offences, and to search and rescue 
operations. All those who use Quebec waters would benefit from this improvement.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
	I am certainly in favour of law and order, but I see imminent 
dangers in letting everyone, including Fisheries and Oceans and the 
Coast Guard, monitor the public. Every Tom, Dick and Harry is 
giving himself a mandate to oversee the public and, if we let it 
happen, there is a risk that we will find ourselves in a quasi-police 
state, where any stakeholder with any kind of power can, given  the 
current sophisticated technology, find out a great deal about his 
neighbour's private life.
<P>
	It will be possible, thanks to the rowboats and pedal boats, to 
follow the comings and goings of citizens around the clock. The 
intention may be good but, as we know, there are a lot of people 
who can manipulate this sort of information. Some people know 
how to make lists. Therefore, a debate should be held regarding this 
issue. As a parliamentarian, I am increasingly annoyed by this type 
of behaviour.
<P>
	This is a tax, hypocritically disguised. We are witnessing, as 
with gun control, a tighter control over the public. There should at 
least be a real public debate to find out what kind of society we 
want to live in, given the existing dangers. As we know, studies 
show that some dangers exist because of sophisticated means 
involved in this issue.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to start my debate today with a question: How does the 
Liberal government feel about B.C.? I would also like to answer 
that question from the perspective of a B.C. member of Parliament.
<P>
	The government likes our taxes and it likes to be able to use 
them, with B.C. as a have province, to provide equalization 
payments to the have not provinces. It seems to like to hold its 
conventions in Vancouver, I think for very obvious reasons, and it 
likes to visit us in the winter. In fact, the Prime Minister is 
attending an international conference in Vancouver in November of 
this year.
<P>
	How does the government repay us? Well, among other things, it 
mismanages our fishery. I will refer to the 1996 spring hearings 
which were really a charade. I would like to read into the record a 
letter from the sports fishing industry in Victoria, British Columbia 
to the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans. Referring to those 
hearings, the fishermen said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>There is no satisfaction in this outcome, only regret that the concerns brought 
forward by the sport fishing community were not taken more seriously by senior 
DFO officials. While we appreciate the audience you gave to our concerns last 
spring, the outcome was a rejection of the alternatives which were presented to you. 
In addition, no other options were considered by your ministry which could have 
mitigated the economic impact for the sport fishery and ultimately the consequences 
that British Columbia and its coastal communities are suffering.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The Liberal government has a habit of situating its hearings. It 
seeks to have people appear before its committees who are on line 
with Liberal policies and therefore will follow the strategy that the 
Liberal government has already determined. There are a number of 
instances of this but I will leave it at that for now.
<P>
	The Liberal government has also moved to remove the last 
regular army presence in British Columbia. I will speak more to 
that in a few moments.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4852"> 4852 </A></B>
<P>
	Despite the fact that Vancouver is recognized and acknowledged 
as one of the major ports through which drugs and contraband are 
imported into Canada and thence to the United States, the federal 
government has decided to do away with the port police at the 
port of Vancouver. We question the wisdom of that.
<P>
	The government has replaced manned light stations, or are in the 
process of doing so, with automated stations. I would like to refer 
to the views of a tugboat captain, Robert D. McCoy, who said: 
``Having spent the best part of 52 years sailing on this coast, 30 of 
them as a tugboat master, I feel I am well qualified to speak on this 
subject. I am as protective toward my tax dollars as any Canadian. 
Automated lights cannot give visual reports on sea conditions or 
the visibility in the vicinity of the stations. These alone are of 
paramount importance to mariners and bush pilots. They cannot 
see flares nor can they render assistance of any kind. My personal 
experience with reports from automated buoys is that their data are 
sporadic and at times unreliable. To put the Canadian marine 
community at the mercy of a satellite system operated by the U.S. 
department of commerce is to me questionable at best''.
<P>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
	Of late the word is that we are going to reduce the coast guard 
presence on the west coast. Again, this is another reduction which 
will dramatically impact the safety of the citizens of the west coast. 
I will have more to say on that in a moment.
<P>
	My time is restricted and therefore I will limit my comments to 
light stations, the coast guard and the military.
<P>
	With regard to light stations, Reform is in support of 
economizing but certainly not at the price of people's safety and 
welfare. The B.C. coastline is unlike any other in the world, save 
possibly the coastline of Norway.
<P>
	We cannot compare the B.C. coastline to that of Washington, 
Oregon or California. We cannot compare it to the coastline of 
Quebec, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick or Newfoundland. Its deep 
fiords, steep descents into the water and rocky coastline is unique. 
Other than perhaps Alaska and Norway, there is no comparable 
coastline in the world. Therefore studies which show that other 
areas have divested themselves of manned light stations are 
interesting but not relevant to B.C.
<P>
	The coast of B.C. has extremely heavy traffic. I will deal more 
with that in a few moments as it bears on the subject as well. A 
human presence is required. I can think of two recent incidents. 
One was last spring at the north end of Vancouver Island where a 
ship was foundering with two people aboard. The only way the 
message got out and assistance was rendered was the observation 
of the light station keeper at the north end of Vancouver Island.
<P>
	My colleague has referred to a second incident which happened 
this past weekend. I would like to read from the <I>Globe and Mail</I> 
report on it: ``Bella Bella, B.C. U.S. pilot John Hilliard has a 
lighthouse keeper to thank for being plucked from the wing of his 
sinking aircraft after he crashed near this community on the central 
B.C. coast. With some direction from the Canadian Coast Guard 
and a lighthouse keeper on McInnes Island, he was rescued 
unharmed''.
<P>
	It has been plainly obvious that there are alternatives available. 
The B.C. government has offered to become involved and it is my 
contention that the federal government has not taken this 
intervention seriously and considered it enough. The policy to 
unman the light stations needs to be re-examined promptly.
<P>
	I would like to move now to the Canadian Coast Guard. The 
coast guard budget was previously reduced, as were all government 
departments. We are not fighting against that. Now the government 
is proposing even further cuts to the coast guard in the Pacific 
region. It is talking about a 35 per cent reduction, or about $31 
million and 360 staff, over the coming four years.
<P>
	For the 1997 year commencing on April 1 the fleet budget will 
be reduced by $7 million, reducing the coast guard vessels from 39 
to 22. That is a reduction of 17 vessels out of the coast guard fleet 
on the west coast. There are also plans to multitask and cross train 
the crews to provide support to both coast guard and DFO programs 
and the reassignment of coast guard vessels to fisheries duties. We 
will not argue with any of that. Cross training people and double 
tasking them if it does not affect their prime capability is a good 
program.
<P>
	We are concerned about the safety of air and marine traffic using 
west coast corridors. In my own case, and I will be referring to it in 
a bit more detail later, we are concerned about the safety of 
students, residents and tourists which is in question as a result of 
this policy.
<P>
	The coast guard is responsible for many programs. Every one of 
them is affected by these cuts. My chief concerns today are in the 
area of search and rescue, environmental response, that is pollution 
from shipping, and direct spill response management or 
supervision of private sector clean-up. Last, the area I am 
concerned about is the loss of coast guard influence on boating 
safety; that is, to provide information, advice, inspections and 
demonstrations. The coast guard is also responsible for providing 
navigation aids, buoys, beacons and other conventional marine 
aids.
<P>
<B>(1345)</B>
<P>
	The decision has been made to discontinue visual aids based on 
the presumption that the GPS, the global positioning system, will 
overtake them and make them redundant. However, our neighbours 
to the south have had GPS in place for a number of years and they 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4853"> 4853 </A></B>
<P>
have made no such move. They have left the visual buoys, the  
visual shore markers and the long range navigation system in place.
<P>
	In my region many U.S. boaters who come up to sail in the Gulf 
Islands, one of the most beautiful spots in the world, are navigating 
on Esso road maps. I guess we could say they are not taking enough 
precautions, but surely we cannot ignore the fact that they are in 
Canadian waters and it is our responsibility to provide support to 
them if an emergency should arise.
<P>
	The reductions result in an increased response time for search 
and rescue emergencies, an increased response time and reduced 
capability in the case of oil spills and a reduced effective response 
area for the coast guard in general.
<P>
	The total staff reduction has not yet been explained in detail. My 
concern is how much of the reduction will take place at the tail and 
how much will take place at the tooth. Surely we could do away 
with some bureaucrats and keep the coast guard at the sharp end, 
available to do the job.
<P>
	Local government and citizens have provided me with very 
strong and very irate feedback. The letters protesting the relocation 
of the Ganges station, which is on Saltspring Island, come from the 
capital regional district, school district 64, which is the Gulf 
Islands district, the British Columbia Chamber of Commerce, the 
Gulf Islands Teachers Association, the Saltspring Island fire 
department, Local 788 of the Canadian Union of Public Employees 
and many more from individuals on Saltspring Island and other 
affected B.C. coastal areas.
<P>
	Yearly traffic in B.C. waters surrounding the Gulf Islands 
consists of a quarter of a million pleasure craft, which is increasing 
every year, 6,000 fishing vessels, more than 3,000 merchant ships 
and increasing traffic from our neighbours to the south. On an 
average summer weekend there will be 30,000 pleasure boats in 
B.C. waters. Added to this are chartered seaplanes, or float planes, 
bringing in tourists from a number of areas.
<P>
	I do not want to lobby for a local coast guard on Saltspring 
Island, but I do know that these cuts have had a detrimental impact 
on the presence of the coast guard on the west coast.
<P>
	This is an area of very heavy traffic. It is the heart of the ocean 
playground. There is a plethora of ocean and tourist traffic in the 
area. There is an abundance of sport fishing. Yachts love it. Tourists 
and float planes are present at all times. Shipping lanes run through 
the area and many deep sea vessels anchor in and around the Gulf 
Islands waiting for authority to enter the port of Vancouver.
<P>
	The area also houses the Victoria international airport. There are 
twelve ferry terminals. Ferry traffic between the mainland and 
Vancouver Island alone consists of more than 20 million 
passengers annually. There are  innumerable marinas and yacht 
clubs. The area is teeming with boats the year round.
<P>
<B>(1350 )</B>
<P>
	The area around the Gulf Islands and Powell River have become 
two of the most popular scuba diving destinations in Canada. 
Unhappily, in the case of decompression sickness in scuba divers 
minutes count. It is vital that the coast guard be there to provide 
immediate response if an incident does occur.
<P>
	Unlike many communities in the rest of Canada, students 
attending the high school in the Gulf Islands on Saltspring Island 
use school boats rather than school busses. There are three school 
boats operating out of Ganges, the <I>Scholarship</I>, the <I>Graduate</I> and 
the <I>Ganges Hawk</I>. They operate twice a day over 190 days a year, 
starting at 6.45 in the morning when they pick up the students and 
deliver them to school and returning at 3.30 in the afternoon, taking 
them back to the islands where they live. Obviously during the 
winter the return journey takes place after dark. Therefore there are 
added hazards.
<P>
	Our gulf enjoys a Mediterranean climate but the water 
temperature is not very variable. It goes from about 4 degrees in the 
summer to about 2 degrees in the winter. Estimates are that an 
individual in that water will lose consciousness in between 30 
minutes to a maximum of 45 minutes. This depends on the 
condition of the individual, the attitude and the what the individual 
is wearing at the time. Additionally, the area is subject to strong 
tides, rocky shores and shoals, and in winter the waters are subject 
to fog, storms and darkness. It is a lovely area, but one which 
people need to respect rather than simply take lightly.
<P>
	The Gulf Islands school district also depends on the coast guard 
locally for safety training of students travelling by the water taxi 
and for doing safety inspections on those taxis. The requirement is 
that they be there in case of an accident.
<P>
	There is talk that the Ganges station will be relocated to Victoria. 
When that happens it will reduce the response capabilities 
substantially. This is an issue of cutting the sharp end rather than 
the wagging tail.
<P>
	When this happens the proposal is to replace the present coast 
guard vessel <I>Skua</I> in Ganges with an roving vessel called the <I>Atlin 
Post</I>. The <I>Skua</I> is capable of speeds up to 24 knots. The <I>Atlin Post</I> 
is an 8 knot vessel. It is going to journey between Nanaimo and the 
Gulf Islands. If it should be at the northern end of its sweep when 
an emergency happens there is just no way the vessel is going to be 
able to respond in time. It may take two and half to three hours for 
the coast guard to get from that position to where it is required.
<P>
	Moving the <I>Skua</I> to Victoria is placing the vessel and its crew in 
danger. The <I>Skua</I> is designed for inter-island operations. The area 
down to Victoria exposes them to open waters in which the seas and 
the storms will be beyond the capacity of the vessel. In point of 
<P>

<B><A NAME="4854"> 4854 </A></B>
<P>
fact, the vessel will be replaced in the winter with a 44 foot ship 
from Port Hardy.
<P>
	The Ganges coast guard at the moment is on call 24 hours a day 
with a 15 minute launch window, even during standby hours. This 
has been depended on to maintain the safety standards in the area. 
The removal of this unit from that area will definitely degrade its 
ability. It has responded to requests from the fire department. It has 
taken equipment and emergency calls from the various islands 
around. There is a certain safety in numbers. However, we cannot 
always count on someone being there to help a vessel in distress. 
We can stay beside a broken down car on the road. But if a boat 
breaks down it is likely to be washed on to the rocks and be in 
extremely serious trouble before help can arrive.
<P>
	Michael Turner, the deputy commissioner of the coast guard, has 
said that the merger between DFO and the coast guard will have a 
minor impact on users. Some jobs would be lost but most would be 
at the admin end and not the pointy end. The closure of Ganges 
station proves this is not so.
<P>
<B>(1355)</B>
<P>
	With the move of the coast guard from Ganges, unit 36 of the 
coast guard auxiliary will be involved in providing assistance to 
boaters with problems.
<P>
	This is a super outfit. There are thirty active members who have 
units in Sidney, Mill Bay, Oak Bay, Victoria and Sooke. They serve 
the Saanich Inlet to the San Jauns and throughout the gulf islands. 
They have done an excellent job. They have been called out 69 
times since April of 1995 and they have highly trained volunteer 
crews on call. They accept the requirement to be on 10 minutes call 
from their boats 24 hours a day.
<P>
	But they are in trouble. The two vessels are located at Sidney and 
Brentwood Bay. They receive coast guard tasking money for fuel, 
maintenance, which is based on the size and power of the vessels 
and the number of hours on the water for extra funds. But they 
require extra funds, which are not provided and they have to raise, 
for weather cruiser suits, for life jackets, for hand held radios. They 
presently have one hand held radio, which cost about $400, and 
they require six.
<P>
	It costs about $10,000 to keep that unit operational for six 
months. Currently it has $1,000 in its budget, so those cuts will hit 
that auxiliary unit hard.
<P>
	The federal Emergency Preparedness Act states that every 
minister accountable to Parliament for the administration or affairs 
of a government institution is responsible for identifying civil 
emergencies that are within or related to his or her area of 
accountability and for developing a civil emergency plan for such 
situations. I contend that lowering the coast guard presence on the 
<P>
west coast, particularly in the Gulf Islands and on Vancouver 
Island, is not accepting that as a realistic requirement.
<P>
	I also point out that the Deputy Prime Minister in her position as 
minister of heritage has managed to give away $23 million and 
counting on flags. The coast guard cuts are $31 million. The money 
the minister was able to find for the flags might have been better 
applied to the coast guard.
<P>
	The base closure at Chilliwack is probably the worst case of 
ignoring B.C. problems that I have seen. I have a personal 
acquaintance with that base. It has real estate, it has plant, it has a 
climate that is incomparable and irreplaceable anywhere else in 
Canada. The reason the engineering school was moved there from 
Dundurn was climate. That cannot be replaced. It is a mistake and 
that policy should be reconsidered.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Colleagues, I see you are standing to put some 
questions to the hon. member, but I think that with the shortage of

	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was

finding tour of area farmers last Friday.
<P>
	Agricultural sales are second only to the automotive sector in 
total economic production in Durham. Farmers engaged in the 
production of beef, eggs, milk and wine were part of our stops 
where they could voice their concerns to federal, provincial and 
municipal representatives.
<P>
	Farmers are part of small business as well, which is why the 
Scugog Chamber of Commerce hosted a subsequent dinner which 
also included small business operators. Reinventing government 
means government, farmers and small businesses working together 
to solve common problems.
<P>
	I would like to thank the Durham Federation of Agriculture as

	<B>Mr. Gilles Bernier (Beauce, Ind.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the white 
elephant known as the Cosmodôme in Laval is another fine 
example of wasted public funds. It has already swallowed up $31 
million and there is talk of another $10 million being needed to 
keep it going.
<P>
	I am in no way questioning the educational value of the 
establishment, but I think there is a serious management problem. I 
urge the provincial and federal governments to resist the 
temptation to pour more money into this losing concern and I hope 
that the City of Laval will get its act together and quit thinking that 
the solution to its problems lies in our pockets.
<P>
	This reminds me of something former federal minister André 
Ouellet said a few months ago about the Mirabel airport. ``After 
twenty years'', he said, ``it can be concluded that Mirabel was a

	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, melatonin burst 
on the alternative medical scene with a flourish. Produced naturally 
in the brain of humans it has claimed to have benefits for jet 
lag-something MPs know about-and aging, which no politician 
needs worry about.
<P>
	The health protection branch in Ottawa says this natural product 
has not been studied enough to guarantee that it is safe. No 
evidence of direct harm, mind you, after millions of doses.
<P>
	Its solution is to ban the sale of melatonin in Canada. However, it 
allows the purchase of three month's personal supply from the U.S. 
Recently health food stores in B.C. have been charged for this 
infraction.

from the U.S., let it be sold by Canadians. We thought jobs, jobs,

economy and is vital to the economic well-being of Canada. A 
great number of jobs have been generated from these businesses, 
and now, more than ever, Canadian small and medium sized 
businesses are seeking export opportunities abroad.
<P>
	In Etobicoke-Lakeshore we have many success stories which 
include the LifeTech Corporation, a scientific research company 
that has developed technology to sterilize blood products; 
Harmony Printing, a high quality computer printer; the local Great 
Lakes Brewing Company, and the new state of the art European 
bakery and food production facilities of the Future Bakery and

	These are but a few of the businesses contributing to the growth 
of our local economy. Not only are these small businesses creating 
jobs, they are at the forefront of the innovation necessary for 
survival in today's competitive economy.

develop programs encouraging growth for small and medium sized

<P>
	For close to 30 years, the Canada Games have given athletes

means more support for the young athletes.

<P>
	He also stated that he was in continuous consultation with the

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, with the passage of time, the government becomes 
increasingly confused about its decision to stop  a future 
referendum in Quebec by asking the Supreme Court's opinion on 
Quebec's 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4859"> 4859 </A></B>
<P>
right to determine its own future. None of yesterday's allies on the 
no side are on side of the Prime Minister as he makes this clumsy 
attempt to get all of Canada up in arms against Quebec, as he did so 
successfully in 1982 and 1990.
<P>
	What kind of answer does the Prime Minister of Canada have for 
Daniel Johnson, the leader of the Quebec Liberal Party, who has 
invited him to resign and run for a seat in the Quebec National 
Assembly if he wants to draft the referendum question?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, Mr. Johnson is entirely correct in saying that the 
National Assembly is free to ask any questions it wants. But when 
such a question involves negotiations on an issue as serious as 
secession, the question must be such as to elicit a clear response 
from the people. What is needed is a clear question. And to have a 
clear question, we need a clear process. To have a clear process, 
there must be a commitment to make it that way.
<P>
	So far, however, the Quebec government has given us no 
guarantees to that effect. We are asking the Supreme Court to 
clarify matters, and the Quebec government does not want to go 
before the Supreme Court. Why? Because it knows that confusion 
works to its advantage. The forces of division gain from confusion; 
the forces of reconciliation gain from clarity.
<P>
	And if we must quote Mr. Johnson, I will quote him, in 
concluding: ``Mr. Bouchard and other sovereignists, who for three 
or four years have been telling us that international law is clear on 
the subject will have a forum to explain why it is clear. If the train 
is there, they can always get on board and tell Quebecers what their 
theories are about'', but they will not go, because they know they 
are wrong.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, you will allow me to point out to the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs that, on the subject of clarity, he is the 
one who has constantly contradicted himself. He and the Minister 
of Justice are sending two completely different messages. He is 
certainly in no position to talk to us about confusion. He is creating 
confusion.
<P>
	Seriously, I realize the Prime Minister wants to give his Minister 
of Intergovernmental Affairs a chance to make his mark in the 
House, but my question was directed to the Prime Minister.
<P>
	I would appreciate it if the Prime Minister would tell us whether 
he realizes that, by insisting on his reference to the Supreme Court 
and by wanting to assume the powers of the National Assembly, he 
no longer enjoys the support of any of his federalist allies who were 
with him during the last referendum? Does he realize he is isolating 
himself, even from the Quebec federalists who supported him 
during the last referendum?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.): 
</B>Mr. Speaker, I repeat, the Leader of the Official Opposition in 
Quebec urges the Quebec government to come and argue its case 
before the Supreme Court. He does so, using the same arguments 
that the Minister of Justice of Canada used to invite his counterpart, 
Mr. Bégin, to argue his case before the Supreme Court.
<P>
	The reason they are not going there is that they now realize, after 
being told by two judges of the Quebec Superior Court, as well as 
by all the experts, including some U.S. experts last week, that 
international law provides no basis for a unilateral declaration of 
independence, that this gospel they believed, because their 
separatist leaders, Mr. Parizeau, and Mr. Landry kept preaching it 
all the time, is not true, and that if they want to bring about 
something as serious as secession, for the sake of the people of 
Quebec in particular, it must be done within a specific framework 
that is acceptable to all concerned, and not unilaterally.
<P>
	The problem is that they now realize that Quebecers and other 
Canadians will never give up their ties of solidarity in a clear 
situation. That is why they need confusion, stratagems and other 
tricks.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs should be 
careful because, when he was a university professor, he wrote that 
in Quebec people would never let the federal government draft the 
referendum question. To create a diversion, it was necessary to 
appeal to the Supreme Court so that Quebecers would then agree to 
let Ottawa be involved in the drafting of the question. So they are 
not in a position to teach us anything.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister realize that by wanting to draft the 
question for the next referendum, to determine the percentage 
required for the results of the referendum to be considered positive, 
and to set the rules for holding this referendum, he is usurping the 
role of the Quebec National Assembly, which is an attack on 
democracy? We know he is familiar with this strategy, and we wish 
he would stop this exercise before launching another attack.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, first of all, since I entered politics, I have never had to 
back down from anything I wrote as a university professor and I am 
prepared to take up the gauntlet.
<P>
	Second, the official opposition would do well to study foreign 
cases and international law. It will see that in many democracies, 
the very concept of secession has  been excluded from public 
debate. In the United States, Italy, Spain and other democracies 
including France, which the official opposition treats as a good 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4860"> 4860 </A></B>
<P>
friend, in fact in section 2 of the French constitution it says that the 
French Republic is one and indivisible.
<P>
	Here in Canada we are actually more democratic than average, in 
this area as in others. We are more conciliatory. We accept the idea 
that our country can break up if part of our population no longer 
wishes to remain in the country. However, we have the right to 
ensure this is done according to the rule of law, in a clear context, 
since this is a very serious decision which cannot be made if 
confusion reigns.
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	Yesterday, the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs stated: ``It 
is not reasonable for Prince Edward Island to be able to block 
Quebec's departure from the federation, because that is not 
democratic, not Quebecois, not Canadian''.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister share the opinion of his Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, there are polls, there are statements made by the 
moral authorities of this country, by various public figures. 
Obviously in Canada there is a convention that a population is not 
to be forced to remain against its will. The Minister of Justice has 
explained this in his speech.
<P>
	We are, however, entitled to the assurance that this is what a 
given population wants, and in that connection, yes, PEI is entitled 
to its say.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, talk 
about total ambiguity-I thought the minister was at least in 
agreement with himself, but even that is not the case. I will 
therefore direct my question to the Prime Minister.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister agree with what his Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs had to say yesterday, or today, 
depending on which version one chooses: that it is not reasonable 
or democratic for a single province to prevent Quebec from leaving 
the federation? Which version is the right one?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for providing me with the 
opportunity to repeat my statement. Perhaps then she will 
understand that we in this country have accepted the idea that the 
country could break apart, if a population were to indicate very 
clearly that it no longer wished to remain in the federation.
<P>
	There will, however, have to be assurances that this is clear and 
fair for everyone. Prince Edward Island, therefore, is entitled to 
assure itself that the people of Quebec have been consulted in a 
clear process, acceptable to all, with terms of negotiation that are 
also acceptable to all.
<P>
	It is clear that the decision to break up Canada would have 
serious consequences for the people of Prince Edward Island. I am 
very confident that Quebecers and other Canadians will to avoid 
negotiations as painful, lengthy and difficult as those on the 
breakup of this country would be.

	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, today's 
<I>Globe and Mail</I> reports that members of U.S. special forces teams 
wore Canadian uniforms in covert operations in Somalia, and one 
of them ordered a Canadian soldier to ``fire at a guy, shoot him, 
drop him, take the guy out''.
<P>
	Is this report true and if so, when did the minister become aware 
of this covert operation?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member should realize that the specific allegation contained in the 
newspaper report to which she referred occurred during the 
Canadian forces deployment to Somalia in 1993. Therefore it 
would only be reasonable that the commission may wish to look at 
this matter to see whether it is true.
<P>
	With respect to the concept of sharing equipment and uniforms, 
there are a number of joint exercises that are taken on an annual 
basis between Canada and our allies. But the kind of thing that has 
been described in the article is something unusual. The chief of 
defence staff is going to look into it on a conceptual level. But on 
the specific level, because it does relate to Somalia in 1993, this 
may be of interest to the commission.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I

uniforms? Certainly these people have their own uniforms to wear. 
We do not do a complete swap on that, heaven help us.
<P>
	Canadian forces have not been under foreign command since 
World War I. The terms of the 1992 memorandum of understanding 
of orders, signed by former Chief of Defence Staff John de 
Chastelain, clearly state that the complete operational control of

this was in 1993 long before he was elected. What is he going

to look into this and investigate it?
<P>

<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is the 
toleration of this kind of behaviour. We have had somebody admit 
on the news nationally here already that he ordered that this person 
take him out, drop the guy and shoot him. I hardly think that is 
something the minister needs to look into a great deal more.
<P>
	Jean Boyle said: ``We were aware that the Americans were 
working with Canadians jointly in terms of intelligence and support 
in Somali'' and added to nobody's surprise that he had no 
knowledge of any behaviour outlined by a former Green Beret.
<P>
	This is a pattern we are seeing develop with this minister, 
blaming things off on cuts and blaming it off to a subordinate. Also 
with Jean Boyle, again and again say ``hey, I had absolutely no 
knowledge about it''. Why did Jean Boyle have absolutely no 
knowledge about it? Just what does he have any knowledge about?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and

<P>
	First of all, General Boyle was not the chief of defence staff in 
1993. Second, she talks about a pattern. The only pattern I see is the 
pattern of her party not allowing the commission to do its work.
<P>
	This party in opposition called for the inquiry. We set it up. We 
want the inquiry to do the job. I believe Canadians want answers. 
They do not want answers from the Reform Party because they

<P>
	We were astounded to learn today that U.S. army soldiers 
belonging to commandos sent to Somalia apparently deliberately 
represented themselves as soldiers of the Canadian armed forces. 
According to the <I>Globe and Mail</I>, a U.S. army captain even ordered 
a Canadian forces soldier to kill a Somali, which he did.

	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and

answered to earlier questions, this is an allegation that has come to 
light today. It is something that obviously concerns everyone, but 
to get to the truth of the matter I think we should perhaps wait and 
see if the inquiry wishes to pursue it because it does raise certain 
troubling questions.
<P>
	With respect to the whole concept of joint exercises and as to 
whether there is exchange of equipment and that type of thing, the 
chief of defence staff is looking into it. I will be able to have 
something more to say at a later date once we look at the

would be the first requirement.
<P>
	My supplementary is for the Prime Minister. While his chief of

assure us or not that such practices did not take place under his

	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and

under Canadian control. There is some sharing of individuals on 
specific missions, and those are bilateral agreements with our 
NATO allies, specifically with the United States on air crews. That

<P>
	On another constitutional front we are equally adamant that the

pass a provincial referendum. I can assure you that in British

Mr. Speaker, what strikes me is the absence of any argument to 
support the idea that the distinct society clause or whatever you 
may call it is against Canada. I think it is a great thing to do for 
Canadians to recognize that in an anglophone North America there 
is a strong francophone society and we are proud of it.

<P>
	A report by the member for Simcoe North, a member of the

leaked to Barbara Yaffe of the Vancouver <I>Sun</I>, states: ``British

Mr. Speaker, I spent much of my professional life at university, 
fighting the claim of many of my Quebec colleagues who said ``we 
in Quebec think this, we in Quebec think that''. I know Quebec is a 
pluralistic society. And I am sure that British Columbia is a 
pluralist society.
<P>
	The hon. member does not have the right to say ``we in British

question: How responsible is it to blow away $23 million on flags 
while cutting $7 million from the coast guard? The Liberals are 
also proposing a $3.5 million lighthouse staffing budget cut to save 
money. Of course that is necessary because the heritage minister's 
unnecessary expenditures are driving it. An example is her Canada 
Information Office. There are information after information after 
information offices available to Canadians right now; $4 million on 
Inquiries Canada alone.
<P>
	I ask again: What are this government's priorities when it gives a 
free hand to the heritage minister to blow money as she sees fit yet 
makes cuts that put people's lives at risk on the waters around

<P>
	Last spring, in order to justify cutting off federal funding to the

that the sale of the CANDU reactor to China would generate

hundreds of additional jobs. The main enterprise to benefit from 
the spinoffs from this sale, CANATOM, has lost the main contracts 
related to the construction of the CANDU reactor sold to China.

several years ago national defence announced that the Nanaimo 
army camp would close. Since that time the city of Nanaimo, 
Malaspina College and the local school board have been trying to 
get an agreement out of Ottawa for the use of the land. They have 
been trying without success. Yet when there is a base closure in the 
maritimes or Quebec, it seems to be quite a different story: they not 
only get the land quickly, they get money to go with it. Why the 
double standard?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, there is no 
double standard.
<P>
	The hon. member has written to me about this matter on a 
number of occasions and I have explained the process to him. Once 
an amicable arrangement can be made by the department, Treasury 
Board and the city of Nanaimo, then obviously the land could 
certainly be given to the city for its uses.
<P>
	We follow the same disposal procedure of land across the 
country whether it is on the east coast, on the west coast or 
anywhere else.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
there are other examples. When land was given away in Chatham, 
New Brunswick, they got $15 million to go with it. In St. Hubert, 
Quebec, they got an extra $1 million plus the land. In Cornwallis 
they got the land plus $7.5 million. Obviously there is a difference 
in criterion between the east and the west.
<P>

Liberal members in the area or what is it?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, when the Royal 
Roads Military College closed a  couple of years ago, a very 
favourable arrangement was made with the Government of British 
Columbia. As a result those lands have been kept for educational 
use. Not only was there a transfer of lands, there was a cash 
settlement. That shows fairness. It is the same principle which is 
applied across the country.
<P>
	What the member is talking about is not an actual closure. He is 
talking about land which is surplus to DND's requirements. It is 
certainly different from closing the whole facility.
<P>
	The member knows the answer. He knows that negotiations have 
to conclude. We want them to conclude very favourably. Why is he 
bringing the question on the floor of the House of Commons? Why 
does he not go back to the city of Nanaimo and tell them to 
negotiate in good faith?

Speaker, the hon. member for Brampton has as I understand it a 
number of companies in her riding which are obviously interested 
in this issue.
<P>
	It is right that my predecessor put an interim order against 
opening the border last fall. It was the right thing to do because the 
United States Environmental Protection Agency had not given 
Canada a copy of the regulations by which any PCBs would be 
destroyed. Not only have those been provided to the Canadian 
authorities since the interim order, we have also been able to 
convince the American authorities to improve and enhance those 
regulations. As a result, the government and the cabinet felt 
assured that for thermal and chemical destruction only, not land 
filling, the systems in the United States were compatible.

opening the border to thermal and chemical destruction should be 
made around the end of this year. This will allow for the timely

significant particularly for fiscal years 1996-97 and 1997-98. 
Thereafter moneys will be provided under a population health 
strategy. Over the next number of months I will continue my 
consultations with AIDS activists. If there is to be a change in that 
policy, I will certainly take the House into my confidence.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, since 
activists, persons living with AIDS and medical researchers 
unanimously called on the minister in Vancouver at the 10th 
International Conference to set aside funds for the fight against 
AIDS, can the minister tell us when he intends to announce phase 
III of the national AIDS strategy?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I have attempted over the last number of months to explain to AIDS 
activists that for the seeking of finances for the year 1998-99, our 
budgetary process does not allow for that.
<P>
	I also suggested to community activists and AIDS activists that 
they would be much better off if they were to outline across the 
country the various successes the federal government and the 
provincial governments have made co-operatively in terms of 
fighting this terrible disease.
<P>
	I say to those who raise this question: yes, AIDS is a very serious 
issue; yes, the Government of Canada takes it very seriously. I 
would hope that AIDS activists instead of protesting, instead of 
thrashing Health Canada booths and things of that nature, would 
stand up and let the country and Parliament know the successes 
they have had in co-operation with governments and all others.

	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, page 22 of 
the Liberal red book reads as follows: ``A Liberal government will 
be committed to the elimination of interprovincial trade barriers 
within Canada and will address this issue urgently''.
<P>
	The Churchill Falls conflict is an issue of one province 
controlling the resources of another province. Does the Prime 
Minister recognize that Newfoundland's inability to access U.S. 
markets obstructs its ability to utilize its own resources?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I answered this question last week.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, that is a 
noteworthy answer.
<P>
	The Prime Minister is fully aware that the energy section of the 
agreement on internal trade is literally a blank page. The type of 
urgency the Liberals talked about in the red book really 
demonstrates how ineffective this government is.
<P>
	Newfoundlanders and Labradorians have been denied the jobs 
and prosperity that a new Churchill Falls hydro development would 
bring. The Quebec government will not allow the transmission of 
electricity across its territory.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister address this issue urgently by 
committing himself to the elimination of this interprovincial trade 
barrier and establish a power corridor through Quebec so that 
Newfoundlanders can finally reap the benefits of any new project at 
Churchill Falls?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I said last week and I repeat that it is a contract between 
private parties.
<P>
	I know there is a problem. I said that it is for the two 
governments to sit down and find a solution. Quebec and Labrador 
have a lot of potential. They have to work together. I am sure that if 
they sit down they will find a solution. But they signed a contract 
and under the rule of law in any country a contract between parties 
has to be respected. That is exactly the position of this government.
<P>
<B>(1500)</B>
<P>
	I know the premier of Newfoundland and the premier of Quebec 
can sit down and find a solution. If the member had listened he 
would have understood that 10 days ago the spokesman for Hydro 
Quebec said that they are willing to sit down and they understand 
that some changes could be made. And if the atmosphere is proper 
they will find a solution.

	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is to the minister of agriculture.
<P>
	Wet weather on the prairies for the last three weeks and snow 
yesterday have threatened a very good harvest of a very good crop 
on the prairies.
<P>
	Is the minister of agriculture considering any contingency plan 
should the revenues expected from that harvest do not materialize?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the weather conditions over the 
last couple of weeks, at least in some parts of the prairies, are most 
definitely a matter of concern to many farmers. Hopefully this fall 
will still materialize in such a way that the weather person will 
co-operate and we will see that in due course.
<P>
	Naturally the Government of Canada is concerned. We are 
watching the situation closely. Of course, we have a rather 
elaborate safety net system already in place to deal with production 
and marketing problems that affect agriculture from time to time. If 
necessary, we do have special provisions for special advances 
under government legislation which we would consider invoking if 
that should become necessary.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="THELATEBERTHARGRAVE">THE LATE BERT HARGRAVE</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today with some sadness to speak on behalf of the Progressive 
Conservative Party of Canada to pay tribute to a former member of 
this House from the riding of Medicine Hat, Alberta, Mr. Bert 
Hargrave, who passed away last week.
<P>
	Aside from being extremely well known and liked in his 
province and in his riding, Mr. Hargrave selflessly devoted a large 
part of his public and private life to the promotion of agriculture in 
Canada.
<P>
	Aside from being a graduate of the University of Saskatchewan, 
Mr. Hargrave also served in World War II as a captain in the tank 
brigades. Following the end of  the war he returned to Canada and 
took over the family farm in Walsh, Alberta in 1945.
<P>
<B>(1505 )</B>
<P>
	In 1972 he ran and was successfully elected a member of 
Parliament. As a side note to his victory back then, he defeated the 
person who was then the minister of agriculture in the government 
of Mr. Trudeau. He then took his seat in the House as a Progressive 
Conservative member until his retirement in 1984.
<P>
	He spent his whole career in opposition, except for the brief term 
in government in 1979 under the leadership of Mr. Clark where he 
served, as members probably have already guessed, as 
parliamentary secretary to the minister of agriculture.
<P>
	Following his career as a parliamentarian he served as president 
of the Walsh Cattle Marketing Association, the Western Stock 
Growers Association and the National Cattlemen's Association, to 
name a few. He was also southern Alberta chair of the Farm Debt 
Review Board until the late 1980s and early 1990s.
<P>
	His tireless and constant dedication to agriculture was 
recognized when he was inducted into the Alberta Agriculture Hall 
of Fame.
<P>
	Mr. Hargrave was a true gentlemen and was well respected, I 
understand, on all sides of the House of Commons. He was 
unquestionably considered one of the most informed and 
knowledgeable parliamentarians on all sides in the realm of 
agriculture. Although I did not have the opportunity or the 
privilege of knowing him personally, I am told he was recognized 
as being someone who was tough, sincere, but most of all a very 
generous man.
<P>
	He passed away last Tuesday at the age of 79 and will be laid to 
rest today in Medicine Hat, Alberta.
<P>
	On behalf of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada, I 
would like to pay tribute to Mr. Hargrave today for his years of 
service to Canada, to his community, to his province. I want to 
offer my personal condolences on behalf of my party to his family 
members and wish them well. But most of all, I would like them to 
know that this place, this Parliament, his province and his country 
will forever remember him as being a statesman.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to join 
with my colleagues in the House in expressing our sorrow and the 
sorrow of the Government of Canada at the passing of Mr. Bert 
Hargrave.
<P>
	I spent one term in the House of Commons from 1974 to 1979 
serving with Mr. Hargrave. Although we were not on the same side 
of the House, we shared a strong commitment to Canada, 
particularly to its agricultural concerns where beyond all doubt 
Bert Hargrave was an expert.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4868"> 4868 </A></B>
<P>
	Anyone who had spent any time with Bert would come away 
with a far better understanding of agriculture, most especially the 
cattle business. Bert, a fourth generation cattleman, was tireless 
in his efforts to promote and defend his fellow cattle producers. 
Whenever the subject of beef came up in the House one could be 
assured that Bert Hargrave would be on his feet supporting his 
industry.
<P>
	Bert, who served his constituents from 1972 until 1984, fought 
most of his battles from the opposition benches. He fought very 
well. I recall one incident during my time earlier in the House in 
1977 when a five year lobby by Bert Hargrave ended in success 
when 90,000 acres of the Suffield, Alberta defence research station 
were opened to cattle producers for grazing purposes. These were 
not the kinds of victories that create great national headlines, but 
they are the kind that truly help one's constituents.
<P>
	Mr. Hargrave did get to spend a brief period of time on the 
government side in the House of Commons in 1979. As the leader 
of the Progressive Conservative Party has pointed out, he was 
during that period appointed parliamentary secretary to the 
minister of agriculture, a recognition of his commitment to the 
agricultural sector.
<P>
	During that time the government further demonstrated its 
confidence in the former member for Medicine Hat by naming him 
chair of its beef consultative committee.
<P>
<B>(1510)</B>
<P>
	Let me join with others in paying tribute to the late Bert 
Hargrave, one of those who took the concerns of his friends and 
neighbours in the most direct way possible, the electoral process. 
Through that process he served with great distinction. We extend 
our sincere condolences to the Hargrave family.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on behalf of 
the Reform Party I would certainly like to pay tribute to someone I 
thought was a great man, Bert Hargrave, a man respected by all 
people who knew him.
<P>
	I was personally involved with Mr. Hargrave on a number of 
occasions, at a variety of meetings, a variety of delegations and a 
variety of presentations not only in the provincial legislature but in 
other meetings across the province dealing with agricultural issues.
<P>
	Bert's constituency of Medicine Hat overlapped with the 
constituency of Little Bow, my provincial constituency, and as two 
elected persons, although not of the same political party, we often 
dealt with issues together.
<P>
	One of the qualities of Bert Hargrave was that he was able to step 
over partisan barriers and deal with issues in a very common sense 
way. In my memories of Bert Hargrave that will be the marquee of 
his gentlemanly, sophisticated and rational way of dealing with 
responsible matters for his constituents in southern Alberta.
<P>
	If we recall part of Bert's history, he was born in 1917 in 
Medicine Hat and attended school in that city. He received a 
bachelor of science in agricultural engineering from the University 
of Saskatchewan in 1942. Bert served the country in World War II 
in the Canadian army RCEME corps from 1942 to 1946, serving in 
northwest Europe.
<P>
	After returning he married Amy Reinhart and they lived near 
Walsh, Alberta. Often in our conversations we talked about the 
beautiful rolling hills, that gem of the southeastern part of our 
province of Alberta.
<P>
	Bert was an active member of the agricultural society, in 
particular the cattle industry. Once in a while I would say to Bert: 
``You come to meetings and you are so proud that you would even 
wear a little bit of that on your shoes for us''. He was known for 
that. He was certainly an active member of the Canadian 
Cattlemen's Association and gave that organization good 
leadership.
<P>
	Entering politics was something that Bert had not really thought 
about until the early 1970s when he became increasingly concerned 
over Canadian agricultural policy. Thus at that time he sought the 
Progressive Conservative nomination for Medicine Hat. He never 
looked back, winning in 1972 by a margin of 5,600 votes, and won 
re-election in 1974, 1979 and 1980.
<P>
	In 1979 he was appointed as the parliamentary secretary to the 
minister of agriculture where his firsthand knowledge of 
agricultural issues and his common sense shone through. He fought 
for the average farmer, whether it was urging tax relief for drought 
stricken farmers or fighting for the rights of cattle farmers against 
U.S. beef bans or the injustice of the Crow rate.
<P>
	Bert retired from Canadian politics in 1984, citing his own 
failing health and the loss of his beloved wife one year earlier. He 
returned to his farm which was never far from his heart but kept 
abreast of federal politics. Bert served as a member of the senate of 
the University of Lethbridge during the period when my wife 
Ingrid was the chancellor. He made a common sense contribution 
to the institution's success.
<P>
	In 1993 he was inducted into the Alberta Agricultural Hall of 
Fame. He lived on his farm until this past June when he moved to 
the Central Park Lodge in Medicine Hat. He passed away in his 
room on Tuesday, September 24, 1996. Bert is survived by his son 
and his daughter and four grandchildren.
<P>
	On behalf of the Reform Party of Canada I would like to extend 
my sincere sympathies to his family and his friends. Our thoughts 
and prayers are with you as you remember Bert this afternoon.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
to what my colleague in the Reform Party said. He went out of his 
way to make the point that he is very unhappy that the government 
is making cuts in certain areas, such as in the defence sector and in 
some other sectors in his province.
<P>
	I want to go on the record as saying that the area which I 
represent, the national capital region, has seen its share of cuts. 
Many of my colleagues have experienced cuts in their ridings. The 
government has been downsized by approximately 45,000 public 
servants. Agencies and crown corporations have been shrinking on 
a regular basis.
<P>
	I share my colleague's concerns, however, it is a fact of life. The 
government takes no pleasure in making the  cuts. It does not want 
to see people on the street. The cuts were part of an overall strategy 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4871"> 4871 </A></B>
<P>
to stimulate the economy, to streamline services across the country 
and to eliminate duplication of services.
<P>
	I am sure my colleague will agree with me that the government 
has done a bang on job of ensuring that inflation is at an all time 
low. It is the lowest it has been in 20 years. Canadian interest rates 
are lower than those in the United States. Also, in a matter of three 
years the deficit has decreased by approximately $12 billion. That 
is something of which my colleague should be taking note. He 
should be congratulating the government on a job well done.
<P>
	With respect to job creation, the government should not be 
satisfied until the last person who is seeking a job finds a job. 
However, I am sure he would agree with me that the record on that 
front is excellent.
<P>
	We cannot have the syndrome of ``not in my backyard''. Last 
week Reform members were on their feet attacking the government 
on the Newfoundland issue. They were trying to pit one 
government against another. This week they are trying to pit the 
government of British Columbia against the federal government.
<P>
	Reform members are here day in and day out calling on the 
government to introduce cuts. When the government takes action 
they turn around and say: ``Yes, but not in my backyard''. I want to 
tell my colleagues that they cannot sneeze and breathe at the same 
time.
<P>
	Why would the hon. member not tell the government that it is 
doing a great job in handling the economy and in dealing with 
complicated, cumbersome issues?
<P>
	The hon. member is condemning the government for some of its 
actions, one of which has to do with the movement of grain to 
Prince Rupert, B.C. When the vote was taken in the House of 
Commons my colleagues in the Reform Party were not out in full 
force trying to defend the interests of the farmers. In fact, only 11 
Reform members showed up for that vote.
<P>
<B>(1530 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Frazer:</B> Mr. Speaker, the reason I am not about to 
congratulate the government on its fine job is that I tell the truth 
and I do not believe that to be the truth.
<P>
	With regard to the government's having to pare the defence 
department to some degree, what I am talking about are sensible 
reductions that reflect the reality of the situation.
<P>
	What the minister of defence has shown is a lack of knowledge 
and understanding of military requirements. He closed the base at 
Chilliwack against the recommendations of the military itself.
<P>
	I happen to have some personal knowledge of the base at 
Chilliwack. I was stationed there for three years. Chilliwack has 
unique qualifications. It has a good climate that allows year round 
training; it has real estate available that is irreplaceable anywhere 
else in the country; and it has plant that will provide the training 
facilities that are badly needed.
<P>
	Over the last five years $40 million has been spent upgrading the 
plant at Chilliwack. The minister is about to walk away from that. 
Even at this moment there are engineers who have been moved to 
Edmonton who are back training in Chilliwack because they cannot 
do their training in Edmonton.
<P>
	It does not seem logical to me that we would deliberately close a 
base that is required for the support of Canada's third largest 
province with a known danger from earthquakes. It is not if an 
earthquake is going to come, it is when. I understand from reading 
some recent scientific articles that the earthquake is likely to 
measure nine on the Richter scale, far stronger than any other 
earthquake that has occurred until now. They are talking about the 
west coast of Vancouver Island dropping one metre and moving 
three metres westward when the plates slide under one another. 
This will create cataclysmic damage to the plant and property 
there.
<P>
	The minister said: ``Oh, we will look after you from Edmonton. 
We will fly people and equipment in''. I have got news for the 
minister. If the weather is at all inclement, every control tower in 
B.C. will be out of action. The minister will simply not be able to 
meet his promise and he does not appear to care.
<P>
	There are three million people on the lower mainland and the 
Vancouver Island area. The minister is letting them hang out to dry 
because he has taken away the support that was readily available in 
Chilliwack and has moved it 1,000 miles to the east.
<P>
	The same thing applies to the unhappy prospect of a civil 
disturbance of major proportions in the province. This means that 
there is no regular force left within the province of British 
Columbia to respond. We can expect or anticipate that such might 
arise in the near future. The equipment and the regular force 
personnel should be available to respond. Not doing so in my 
estimation is irresponsible on the part of the minister.
<P>
	Lastly, the closure of base Chilliwack does not meet the fairness 
principle between the federal government and the provinces. The 
defence department has reported that B.C. is under-represented 
financially by $700 million by virtue of our population.
<P>
	The minister seems to have no interest whatsoever in achieving a 
fair distribution of resources, financial and otherwise, between 
Canada and British Columbia.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Raymond Chan (Secretary of State (Asia-Pacific), 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very sad that the Reform Party has again 
decided to pit Canadian regions against regions. Last week it was 
Newfoundland against Quebec with Churchill Falls and this week it 
is B.C. against everybody else in Canada.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4872"> 4872 </A></B>
<P>
	Does the hon. member think that our government has ignored 
B.C? Does he recognize the government's effort in the 
Asia-Pacific region? The government agenda has been beneficial 
to the province of British Columbia. B.C. alone gained the most 
from this agenda.
<P>
	Can the hon. member tell us if he understands the impact of our 
Asia-Pacific agenda on economic development in B.C.?
<P>
<B>(1535 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Frazer:</B> Mr. Speaker, there is no question that B.C. figures 
very strongly in the Asia-Pacific region for trade. The fact is that 
B.C. has succeeded in increasing the Asia-Pacific trade in spite of 
the federal government, not because of it. It is because there are 
good people there.
<P>
	British Columbia is under-represented in the House of Commons 
by the Liberal members from B.C. They do not carry B.C.'s 
message to Ottawa; rather they carry Ottawa's message to B.C. 
They do not accurately represent the needs and requirements of the 
people of British Columbia.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Jon Gerrard (Secretary of State (Science, Research and 
Development)(Western Economic Diversification), Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise to speak on the motion of the member for North 
Island-Powell River.
<P>
	One thing which is very important is that the government has set 
the stage for a major thrust to increase trade in the Asia-Pacific. My 
colleague the Secretary of State for Asia-Pacific has been at the 
forefront of this effort. The Prime Minister has been at the forefront 
leading trade missions to various countries in the Asia-Pacific. 
When we look at the trade statistics, clearly we are making major 
progress in Canadian trade with the Asia-Pacific region. Right up 
front is the presence of British Columbia as the gateway to the 
Asia-Pacific.
<P>
	Next year is the year of the Asia-Pacific. I would like to point out 
to the hon. member that this January, Canada assumes the chair of 
the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation. I would also like to point 
out that the government is well under way at this point in planning 
events throughout the year and that these activities will culminate 
in our hosting the APEC economic leaders meeting in Vancouver in 
November next year.
<P>
	As all members of the House know, British Columbia is indeed 
Canada's gateway to the Pacific. This is becoming more and more 
important, not just for British Columbia but for the whole of 
Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	To mark this meeting of Asian and Pacific leaders, Foreign 
Affairs and International Trade Canada also inaugurated the year of 
the Asia-Pacific. Cultural, academic and trade activities, as well as 
other related events, will take place throughout Canada in order to 
showcase the solid relations that exist between Canada and its 
Asian and Pacific partners, and to raise their profile.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The Department of Foreign Affairs, working in close 
co-operation with other federal departments and the province of 
British Columbia, has already opened an office in Vancouver to 
support the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation activities which 
will highlight British Columbia as the gateway to the Pacific rim.
<P>
	The government recognizes that British Columbia has a strong 
and growing economy. We know well that this economy relies on 
small business and trade and on exports, and that the growth in the 
Asia-Pacific is very important to the growth of the economy and 
the well-being of people in British Columbia.
<P>
	Our government is making sure that businesses throughout 
Canada have the information they need to grow, to expand and to 
participate in these new markets in the Asia-Pacific. As an 
example, in British Columbia the Canada-British Columbia 
Business Service Centre responds to thousands of queries every 
month from people all over the province who are starting or 
expanding their businesses or expanding their markets. The centre, 
which has been developed under the tenure of our government, is 
an excellent example of how the federal government can work in 
partnership with provincial governments. It shows how we make 
use of innovative technology to meet the needs of those businesses 
that create the jobs in the current economy.
<P>
<B>(1540)</B>
<P>
	I should point out that just two weeks ago the Internet web site 
run by the Canada-British Columbia Business Service Centre won 
the Distinction 96 Gold Award for renewing services and program 
delivery. Each month this web site helps more than 50,000 visitors 
find the practical information they need to start and expand their 
small businesses. This is very important for British Columbia and 
it is very important for small business in British Columbia.
<P>
	Our government has also worked in new ways to develop a 
program called Strategis which we have put onto the worldwide 
web so that businesses can find the information they need, the 
information they want when they want it. On Strategis there are 
thousands of new technologies which are available. On Strategis 
there is the ability to connect up very easily with business partners 
across Canada. Indeed for foreigners interested in doing business 
with Canada, Strategis is a virtual marketplace for Canadian goods 
and services. It is but one component of what we are doing as a 
government.
<P>
	Let me point out another effort which is helping British 
Columbia to participate as the gateway to the Asia-Pacific. This is 
the international trade personnel program. My department, western 
economic diversification, is delivering this program. It is helping  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4873"> 4873 </A></B>
<P>
companies in British Columbia and across western Canada to hire 
recent graduates to help them develop their export market.
<P>
	The program has been very successful and its reports already 
show significant market penetration as a result of the activities of 
these eager young graduates. Many of the markets that are being 
penetrated are in the Asia-Pacific region, and this means jobs for 
young people, for recent graduates in British Columbia.
<P>
	Growth in British Columbia and in the Asia-Pacific relies on 
these small businesses, the emerging industries. This is where we 
are putting a considerable effort.
<P>
	My department, western economic diversification, has also 
recently created investment loan funds in co-operation with banks 
and other financial institutions. These loan funds provide access to 
capital on fully commercial terms for small businesses in new 
growth sectors like biotechnology, health, environmental 
technology, information technology, telecommunications, tourism 
and other knowledge based industries. This is a further example of 
what we are doing in partnership with financial institutions to 
provide loans in areas where the risks are higher and where the 
needs are great.
<P>
	Not only do small businesses need access to financing but they 
need help in knowing how to expand and grow their businesses. 
Western diversification officials in British Columbia are working 
with firms in the emerging economy to help with their business 
planning as well as responding to calls from entrepreneurs who are 
seeking advice. Members of the third party from time to time have 
found western diversification so useful to small businesses that 
their offices are now regularly referring clients to the western 
diversification office for help and advice.
<P>
	Throughout British Columbia, WD supports a network of 32 
community futures development corporations. These CFDCs are 
run by volunteers who work hard to create jobs and to help with the 
growth of small businesses in their communities. Let me give a few 
examples.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	In Powell River the CFDC has helped to develop the waterfront. 
The Strathcona CFDC in Campbell River on northern Vancouver 
Island has helped to solve a pollution problem caused by fish waste 
and at the same time helped develop a local industry, turning 
organic waste into marketable compost. It was able to do this with 
financial help provided through western diversification to make 
sure that we have a strong on the ground organization.
<P>
	In the Campbell River area of northern Vancouver Island nine 
loans totalling $316,000 using the working opportunity fund have 
been made to local small businesses. This is another example of the 
CFDCs working and helping locally in economic development.
<P>
	In the Terrace area of northwestern B.C. we recognize the 
importance of aboriginal businesses to the development of a strong 
economy. Here the CFDC is making loans to businesses run by 
aboriginal people to foster the creation of badly needed businesses 
and services in the First Nations communities.
<P>
	The government believes that in the future it is the young people 
in particular who are important to growth and it is opportunities for 
young people of which we need to be most aware. In April of this 
year western diversification provided $200,000 in new loan capital 
to each CFDC to provide financial assistance to British Columbia's 
young people to create their own businesses.
<P>
	I have visited with several of these CFDCs and talked to many of 
the young people who have benefited. The experience has been 
excellent with this program and the response from young people 
and from the CFDCs to this program and this funding have been 
very rewarding.
<P>
	Western economic diversification has also established the 
women's enterprise initiative, recognizing that more and more of 
small businesses are being operated by women. In British 
Columbia the Women's Enterprise Society is working hard to bring 
more and more women into the economy as entrepreneurs, sharing 
and participating with other entrepreneurs.
<P>
	The hon. member says he is concerned about the closure of DND 
bases in British Columbia. Let me remind him of the government's 
commitment to assist communities during these times of economic 
adjustment. In areas where the downsizing of a facility will have a 
major effect on the local economy the government has stepped in to 
help. In the communities around CFB Masset, responsibility for 
solutions to economic adjustment has been delegated by the 
government to the community. The community is charting its own 
future with financial support from the Government of Canada.
<P>
	Similarly, through the infrastructure works program local 
communities have identified needs. Over 400 projects have now 
been approved in British Columbia with the federal share 
exceeding $220 million or one-third of the total cost. These 
projects are expected to create or maintain more than 9,000 short 
term and 400 long term jobs. Eighty-five per cent of the program 
funding is allocated to water, sewer and local transportation 
projects. These will not only enhance the local infrastructure but 
they will also improve health and the environment.
<P>
	We are looking to the future to build a strong base of science, 
research and technology in British Columbia. The federal 
government is contributing $167 million over five years to the 
Tri-University Meson Facility at the University of British 
Columbia in Vancouver. TRIUMF is one of the world's leading 
facilities for subatomic particle research. The applied research 
conducted at TRIUMF has already resulted in the creation of new 
commercial 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4874"> 4874 </A></B>
<P>
products in biomedical, radiopharmaceutical and medical isotope 
research, products like PET scanners and pion therapy beams.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	TRIUMF generates economic activity for western Canada 
through its purchase of products and services, and through 
technology transfer and commercialization. In addition, some 700 
scientists from around the world come to British Columbia to 
conduct research and attend scientific conferences organized by 
TRIUMF.
<P>
	The hon. member should also know that the federal government 
has supported many networks of centres of excellence 
headquartered in British Columbia. British Columbia is home to 
the networks for research on telelearning, on bacterial diseases and 
on genetic diseases. In addition to that, the federal government has 
invested some $600 million in the Centre for Advanced Wood 
Processing and $3 million in the Biopharmaceutical Innovation 
Resource Centre Fund.
<P>
	The good news is that these investments in critical research and 
development, coupled to their commercialization, are likely to 
have very substantial benefits for the British Columbia economy 
for many years to come.
<P>
	In partnership with the provincial government, the federal 
government has provided $5 million over the last two years under 
the agreement on communications and cultural industries. This 
money has been invested in over 45 projects to promote culture and 
technology development in British Columbia.
<P>
	To make sure that people in communities throughout British 
Columbia have access to the information highway, the government 
created a community access program and to date 34 rural and 
remote communities in British Columbia have been hooked up to 
the Internet and even more will be connected over the coming two 
years.
<P>
	The government has been active in making sure that there is 
information available for small business, that communities have 
support for economic development, that science, research and 
technology in British Columbia have solid support. It has also 
negotiated open skies agreements with the United States to increase 
tourism in British Columbia. It has successfully managed the 
infrastructure works program in partnership with the provincial 
government and local levels of government.
<P>
	The government has done a substantial amount for and with the 
people of British Columbia as part of the partnership which is this 
country of Canada, people working together to make things 
happen.
<P>
	British Columbia is a major contributor to Canada, not only from 
an economic point of view but, more important, through the 
contribution of all its citizens. It contributes to the strength of our 
country culturally economically, scientifically and to the unity of 
our great country.
<P>
	The hon. member should also know that in the time I have been 
here the Liberal members from British Columbia have spoken 
strongly, loudly and forcefully for the province of British Columbia 
and that is one of the reasons why British Columbia and British 
Columbians are doing very well at the moment.
<P>
	I ask that my time be shared with my colleague, the hon. member 
for Vancouver Quadra.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. secretary of state will appreciate 
that to do that he cannot speak for 18 minutes and then ask to share 
two minutes with his colleague. It has to be indicated at the outset 
of an intervention.
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to ask the hon. parliamentary secretary the 
following question. I listened quite attentively to his 18-minute 
dialogue about how great a job the federal government has done 
with the economy in British Columbia and about the tremendous 
involvement of western diversification, and I wonder if he could 
answer a question in connection with the department for which he 
is responsible. It has to do with the initiative called community 
futures which WED is now looking after.
<P>
	I have asked this question before. Why do we have these 
community futures enterprise centres throughout British Columbia, 
and indeed across the country but I am speaking specifically about 
B.C. today, and there is now a duplication in having women's 
centres? There are a couple in the province that specifically deal 
with aboriginal issues.
<P>
	I support the idea that there is a role to be played to assist small 
entrepreneurs who cannot get assistance, especially in the area of 
training and helping them to put together a business plan, but I 
would think that the criteria for something like that would cross all 
boundaries. If people is going to a resource centre or a community 
futures centre and looking for assistance, it should not matter if 
they are male or female or whether they are aboriginal or 
non-aboriginal. I wonder what justification there is for having these 
separate centres based on either gender or race. I cannot see that.
<P>
	I have heard the argument before that the difficulty is that some 
women have felt intimidated when they go to a community futures 
and have to deal with a male loans officer. I would assume that the 
natural chain of events would be to ensure that there are women 
working at these centres. I know the one in my home town has all 
women working in it now and I certainly do not have a problem 
with that. Why have separate programs set up just for women or 
just for aboriginals?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gerrard:</B> Mr. Speaker, this gives me an opportunity to 
explain what is happening with the situation in British Columbia.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4875"> 4875 </A></B>
<P>
	The Community Futures Development Corporation, where it is 
responsible for a region, deals with men, women and anybody who 
lives in that region, on an equal basis. However, it was discovered 
that the needs of women historically have not been sufficiently 
met. Therefore, the Women's Enterprise Societies have been set 
up in the four western provinces.
<P>
	In order to make sure, in British Columbia in particular, the 
Women's Enterprise Society and centre have an agreement with the 
Community Futures Development Corporation so that there is a 
partnership. They work together to make sure that men and women 
are both very well served.
<P>
	Certainly the experience in all four western provinces has shown 
that the Women's Enterprise Centres targeting women are badly 
needed. The example we have in British Columbia of a very strong 
partnership between the Community Futures Development 
Corporation and the Women's Enterprise Society is an example of 
how we can deliver services to all effectively and without having 
duplication.
<P>
<B>(1600 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley, 
Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be splitting my time with the member for 
Fraser Valley East.
<P>
	I am delighted to have this opportunity to discuss a topic that 
seldom gets mentioned in the House by the Liberal government, 
British Columbia. Perhaps it is the time difference, perhaps it is the 
mountain barriers, but in any event B.C. is not a big deal here in 
Ottawa. That is usually okay with British Columbians; we feel that 
is just fine.
<P>
	I have listened with a lot of amusement but some distress at the 
Liberal members taking full credit for the economic well-being of 
the province of British Columbia. It is making a mockery and 
undermining the sacrifices, the investments, the time and effort of 
the business community in the lower mainland, which is 
responsible for the economic development. If anything, it is in spite 
of the government that these business entrepreneurs have been able 
to withstand the high taxes, the rules, the regulations and the red 
tape. The only thing I have seen Liberal government members do is 
travel overseas and wine, dine and schmooze. I have not seen 
anything more concrete than that. It is the business community 
which takes the responsibility for the economic well-being.
<P>
	We are glad that years ago the federal government quietly 
transferred the ownership of Vancouver's international airport to a 
local non-profit authority. Without the interference of Ottawa 
politicians and bureaucrats, Vancouver international airport has 
transformed itself into an elite international airport. It has 
successfully been able to handle the phenomenal growth in the 
travelling public and is now able to look ahead to even more 
expansion.
<P>
	I was at a Vancouver morning club the other day where they were 
toasting and roasting David Emerson, the CEO of the Vancouver 
airport authority. I did not see the Minister of Transport, the 
minister responsible for B.C., at that function honouring the 
individual who has led the airport authority into tremendous 
success.
<P>
	Contrast Vancouver's quiet airport success with the Pearson 
airport disaster that this government has led us through. Since the 
day this Liberal government got elected it has been consumed with 
the Pearson airport deal. The best thing the government is hoping 
for now is that this deal will cost Canadian taxpayers tens of 
millions of dollars instead of hundreds of millions of dollars. 
Meanwhile in Vancouver the amount of money that the federal 
government has received from the airport authority has more than 
doubled.
<P>
	That is the way we do things out west. Ignored by the federal 
government, we keep adding great amounts of money to the federal 
treasury while in the rest of Canada the Liberal government keeps 
sticking its nose into issues that it should not and keeps costing the 
taxpayers millions of dollars.
<P>
	For the most part, British Columbians do not look to Ottawa for 
the big government projects or government handouts. The attitude 
in the west is that we can be successful on our own and we only 
hope that Ottawa does not screw it up for us.
<P>
	In the last 1970s representatives from the British Columbia 
provincial government were hard at work trying to get one of the 
big Japanese auto manufacturers to set up an assembly plant in 
B.C. Toyota showed a fair amount of interest and formal 
negotiations began. Then in the early 1980s the federal government 
entered into its own negotiations with Toyota at the exclusion of the 
British Columbian representatives.
<P>
	Soon the big announcement came that Toyota would be building 
a new North American assembly plant in Ontario. As a thought to 
B.C. Toyota did announcement that it would build a wheel 
assembly plant in Richmond, B.C. This plant has proven to be very 
successful for Toyota and we welcome the jobs. However, it 
probably would have been more appropriate if Toyota had set up a 
drive train plant in B.C. Then the Liberal government of the day 
could have announced that Toyota would open up a major assembly 
plant in Ontario and at the same time British Columbia would get 
the shaft.
<P>
	We have heard about the big projects that the previous 
government threw our way to try to get our votes. And we are still 
waiting for the Polar-8 icebreaker to rejuvenate our shipbuilding 
industry. We are still waiting for Kaon linear accelerator to make 
B.C. a leader in atomic research.
<P>
	In reality we are not really waiting. British Columbians know 
that these projects were just cheap political promises by the 
previous Tory government. Now that the  Tories have disappeared 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4876"> 4876 </A></B>
<P>
from B.C.'s political map things must have changed with the 
Liberal government, right?
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
	The Liberal government is not making any outrageous promises 
or creating any megaprojects to get the voters' attention. Not yet 
anyway. It is still working on its election platform. Instead, the 
Liberal government has taken an entirely new approach. Rather 
than promise us projects which it has no intention of delivering, it 
is simply removing any vestige of the federal government out of 
the province. Lighthouse keepers, coast guard officials and the only 
military base on the mainland of British Columbia are on their way 
out.
<P>
	Let us look at the lighthouse keepers. On Saturday an American 
pilot was flying from Alaska to his home in Washington state when 
his plane went down near Bella Bella. However, due to the 
diligence of the lighthouse keeper on McInnes Island, a fishing 
boat was dispatched precisely to the crash site and was able to 
rescue the pilot. Of course this lighthouse is scheduled for 
automation.
<P>
	What would have happened without a human lighthouse keeper? 
Perhaps the Minister of Transport would like to tell the House what 
would have happened to him that day when he needed a person to 
rescue him when he got into distress in his boat. On second 
thought, maybe we do not care.
<P>
	The cutbacks to lighthouses and the Canadian Coast Guard are 
going to cost lives. The problem is the government's priorities. The 
priorities of the Liberal government are all mixed up. It is cutting 
the coast guard at a time when those services are desperately 
needed.
<P>
	There was a case in my riding where there was a crab boat in the 
bay that was on fire. If not for the United States coast guard coming 
to the rescue, the crew of the crab boat would have perished.
<P>
	The powers that be at the coast guard headquarters here in 
Ottawa think they can save money by closing down a few coast 
guard stations in B.C. and by having the main stations manned only 
during certain hours. The message to B.C. boaters is do not get into 
trouble in B.C. waters unless you are around a major city during 
working hours.
<P>
	This type of policy would appear to have been dreamed up by 
some bureaucrat whose idea of high sea adventure is taking a ferry 
across the Ottawa River.
<P>
	All of this is in an attempt to save money. Why does the 
government not cut some of the bureaucrats in the offices instead 
of those on the front lines who deliver the services?
<P>
	How will the coast guard spend the rest of its money? While the 
coast guard is going to close down stations in B.C. and put lives at 
risk, it will use some of the money it saves to send 170 senior 
bureaucrats to Cornwall next month to ``meet and have fun''. That 
is how the  government memo reads. It will be a great relief to B.C. 
boaters to know that while the coast guard is cutting back on rescue 
services, senior bureaucrats will still have the opportunity to meet 
and have fun.
<P>
	It is not just the coast guard which is cutting back. Our military 
is doing it as well. By closing CFB Chilliwack the government is 
closing the only military base on the mainland of British Columbia 
against the recommendations of senior military officers still 
capable of independent thought.
<P>
	This move by the Liberal government is costing hundreds of 
millions of dollars in building facilities in Edmonton to receive the 
base from Chilliwack. This is after having just spent hundreds of 
millions of dollars on new facilities in Chilliwack. It just does not 
make any sense.
<P>
	It made sense to have Canada's military engineers stationed in 
the province with the most difficult terrain in the country as well as 
near a major urban centre which has the highest probability of a 
major earthquake. However, because it did make sense, the 
government is closing the base and shipping the engineers across 
the country.
<P>
	Who will British Columbians have to rely on in the event of a 
major earthquake? Certainly not Ottawa. If the greater Vancouver 
area suffers a major earthquake and needs military assistance, the 
only people in a position to help will be our friends south of the 
border.
<P>
	That is why most British Columbians think north-south more 
than they think east-west. That is why most British Columbians are 
quite familiar with the concept of Cascadia. When I mentioned 
Cascadia in the House a couple of years ago nobody knew what it 
was. The library had to phone my office to find out how it is even 
spelled. British Columbians are strong supporters of the Canadian 
ideals of fairness and equality. They are still waiting for this 
government to understand the concept.
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	Last month the federal government quickly came up with an 
extra $6 million for Quebec after that province complained it was 
taking on over half of Canada's refugees.
<P>
	Never mind that Quebec already receives $90 million a year or 
over 35 per cent of all the federal moneys spent on settlement of 
immigrants despite the fact that Quebec only takes 13 per cent of 
these immigrants and despite the fact that 77 per cent of economic 
immigrants to Quebec leave that province.
<P>
	Contrast this reaction to how this Liberal government treated 
B.C. when it cut of welfare payments to people who had not lived 
in the province for three months because of a dramatic increase in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4877"> 4877 </A></B>
<P>
numbers when other  provinces started giving their welfare 
recipients bus tickets to B.C.
<P>
	The Liberals responded by withholding $45 million in federal 
funds to British Columbia. Fairness and equality are what British 
Columbians are looking for. That is what we have learned not to 
expect from this Liberal government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the speech we just listened to in the House. I am 
wondering whether I should change the emphasis of my speech 
from how disappointed we are about the lack of attention we are 
getting from the feds and maybe take the hon. member's advice. 
Maybe we are better off without them.
<P>
	Be that as it may, we raise this issue today not because we think 
B.C. issues alone are important in Canada. The Reform Party has 
been a national opposition party. We had supply day motions on 
Churchill Falls and on the Canadian Wheat Board. Today we are 
talking about issues that affect British Columbia specifically.
<P>
	I would like to spend a little time talking specifically about CFB 
Chilliwack. It has been mentioned by previous speakers. The 
announced closure of CFB Chilliwack, the move to Gagetown and 
to Edmonton, Alberta of the men and equipment previously at CFB 
Chilliwack is something that has added another log on the fire of 
the feeling of western alienation.
<P>
	Today during question period I mentioned the hon. member for 
Simcoe North, the Liberal government member who toured B.C. on 
behalf of the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs. There was a 
document leaked to Barbara Yaffe of the Vancouver <I>Sun</I>. Much to 
his surprise, he found out that there was a profound sense of 
alienation in British Columbia from our masters here in Ottawa. 
There is a profound sense of distrust toward what goes on here in 
Ottawa. They ignore this at their peril.
<P>
	There is no separatism movement in British Columbia per se. 
However, what is smouldering right under the surface is a growing 
discontent, alienation and feeling that we are not going to put up 
with this much longer.
<P>
	We have the move of CFB Chilliwack, taking the last land forces 
base in all of British Columbia and sprinkling it across the country. 
Imagine what would have happened if this had been in another 
province, perhaps Quebec.
<P>
	Imagine the reaction that would have occurred if someone said 
``there are no more armed forces bases in Quebec, we are pulling 
them out''. Many people would argue we should not be building 
infrastructure in Quebec at a time when things there are so 
uncertain politically.
<P>
	Be that as it may, the Liberal government thought nothing of it. It 
pulled it out. It was a lousy decision. It was a poor decision then 
and it is a poor one now.
<P>
	The reasons it should have been retained are obvious, to protect 
Canada's infrastructure in British Columbia. The value of that 
property and buildings was $470 million. That will be lost. They 
will recoup a small portion of that when they sell. That is what the 
value of the property and infrastructure was.
<P>
	They should have maintained a military forces presence in 
British Columbia. I tried to explain to the ministers. Imagine what 
this is doing when people in the military are told that their tour of 
duty will go from Gagetown, through Edmonton, forget B.C, back 
to Gagetown and around we will go. British Columbia has been cut 
out of that. If the government thinks that is a good way to increase 
our feeling of being part of Canada and part of the decision making 
process it is sadly mistaken. There is ample evidence that we 
should have had CFB Chilliwack in place in case of the need for aid 
to the civil power.
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	CFB Chilliwack was formed in 1946 because it is Canada's only 
year round ice free training facility. It was put in place because the 
engineers said they needed a place like that to train. As a matter of 
fact, they have been transferred to Edmonton and they are in 
Chilliwack right now to practise their bridge building as we speak. 
It cost $100,000 worth of damage to the bridge when they moved 
their equipment in, which is the only bridge over the Chilliwack 
River, because they should have been there all along. They are back 
because they know this is the kind of facility they need.
<P>
	Major General Clive Addy, now retired, on July 29 spoke to the 
Pan-Pacific Hazards Conference in Vancouver: ``We suffered quite 
a compromise from the closing of Chilliwack. Chilliwack is 
closing and I have lost the regular force presence in British 
Columbia, which I find a military risk. It is a civilian risk as well 
because our presence there was in my view necessary''.
<P>
	What about the claims from the defence minister that the base 
was closed on the advice of his officials? He got all the advice from 
land forces command and it was the thing to do. Here is what we 
got from our access to information request some time ago. From a 
memo dated October 14, written by Colonel Daigle who at that 
time was in land forces command: ``It is estimated that only about 
60 per cent of the savings that the minister is projecting would be 
actually materialize. CFB Chilliwack should be retained. Some of 
the dollar savings anticipated by the program review could easily 
be eaten up by the up front costs of relocation and reconstruction 
needed for reinstallation elsewhere, and potentially significant 
costs at the new location must also be taken into account''.
<P>
	It is no wonder that British Columbians feel a sense of alienation 
from the federal government. National policies seem to be con-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4878"> 4878 </A></B>
<P>
ceived somewhere in the halls of power here in Ottawa. They are 
dictated down to the furthest  provinces and they are carried out in 
this case without consequences to what it might mean to British 
Columbia.
<P>
	What about the costs of CFB Chilliwack? I said time and again 
to the minister: ``Come up with the dollar figures that show how 
you are going to save money. I am with the Reform Party and I 
have made a lot of noise about saving money, about doing the right 
thing fiscally. You show me on a piece of paper where you are 
going to save the money and maybe I will have to support you''.
<P>
	Here is what is actually going to happen. According to DND in 
1995, the cost of closing CFB Chilliwack would be $230 million. 
That included everything. That included new construction, 
severance for staff who were going to be let go, environmental 
clean-up, moving costs, miscellaneous. The total was $230 million. 
Total savings were supposed to be $66 million a year by moving 
our facilities out of Chilliwack.
<P>
	Last October we released access to information documents that 
showed that the government could only realize 60 per cent of these 
savings, and that nearly doubles the payback period that the 
minister has been bragging about that he will get a return on his 
investment.
<P>
	Since then we have received other documents and it is now 
estimated that for construction alone the cost would be $93 million 
in Edmonton, $17 million in Gagetown and the cost of moving 
CFB Calgary, which is part of this reorganization, would be another 
$27 million. That is $137 million just for the costs there.
<P>
	Our access to information documents show that construction 
contracts already awarded to reconstruct CFB Edmonton and CFB 
Gagetown total $204 million. The total cost of the whole package 
was going to be $230 million, and just the construction now is $204 
million. It is impossible to say exactly how much was actually 
spent on each of these places because of the way the government 
gives us the information. There appears to be a $67 million 
discrepancy so far.
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
	On September 11, the Calgary <I>Sun</I> announced that DND would 
spend yet another $42 million on CFB Edmonton for a new rifle 
range and all the other facilities that already exist at CFB 
Chilliwack. In total, the Calgary <I>Sun</I> article points out that changes 
to the Edmonton base alone could approach half a billion dollars. 
Two hundred and thirty million to a half a billion dollars is the 
inflation in one year.
<P>
	The closure of CFB Chilliwack was the wrong decision from a 
military point of view. We have heard that. It was wrong from an 
emergency planning point of view and now we see that it was also 
wrong from an economic point of view.
<P>
	There is obviously something wrong with the federal 
government. It is not listening. If the minister does not  want to 
listen to me, I accept that. The minister does not listen to anybody 
from British Columbia so why should he listen to me? But he 
should be listening to the needs of British Columbia. He has closed 
his ears to any arguments and has said that it will be done, do not 
confuse me with the facts.
<P>
	It begs the question why is the government really moving CFB 
Chilliwack. Is it politics? Is it partisan politics? This could be 
military politics, pure and simple. It could be that somebody in the 
general staff decided they did not like to come out to British 
Columbia so just get rid of them. It could have been, but it is 
increasingly becoming obvious that partisan politics has played a 
role in closing the last armed forces base in British Columbia.
<P>
	General Boyle was in our town not too long ago. He told officers 
at CFB Chilliwack I have since talked to that whoever is going to 
close this place down must be nuts. He was not in command at the 
time the decision was made. It does not matter whether your from 
Gagetown or the chief of defence staff; it is a wrong decision to 
close the base, and anybody who goes out there will see it at a 
glance.
<P>
	It has been asked if it was nasty partisan politics, military 
politics or just a bad decision. It has been said never to attribute to 
malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity. I am not 
sure to what we can attribute the closure of CFB Chilliwack but on 
wither count, whether malice or stupidity, I believe the Liberal 
government is guilty of a gross mismanagement of public funds.
<P>
	The people of British Columbia will hold it to account for it 
years from now and even in the next general election. People are 
already starting to line up and say that if CFB Chilliwack was 
closed for partisan politics-and the proof is starting to roll 
in-then they will never again be able to support a Liberal 
government.
<P>
	The last five base commanders in my riding, now living in 
Chilliwack, have all given me the same story, that CFB Chilliwack 
should have been retained. CFB Chilliwack is an integral part of 
the Canadian Armed Forces and certainly plays a key role in any 
engineering efforts by our armed forces.
<P>
	The decision to close it is another decision that I think years 
from now this federal government or successive federal 
governments will live to regret.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Harvard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened to the hon. member attentively. I find his remarks about 
partisan politics in the decision with respect to Chilliwack to be 
offensive, and I really mean offensive. This is not partisan politics.
<P>
	The announcement to close air command was made well over a 
year ago. I think it was in the 1995 budget. Where is air command? 
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4879"> 4879 </A></B>
<P>
It is in the riding of Winnipeg St. James, which I have the honour of 
representing. It has nothing to do with partisan politics whatsoever.
<P>
	Sometimes we have to make tough decisions. Sometimes they 
come down hard and these decisions are difficult for members of 
Parliament, be they Liberal, Reform, Bloc or whatever.
<P>
	In addition to air command being closed, naval command was 
closed. And where is naval command located? It is located in 
Halifax, Nova Scotia. As far as I know there are not too many 
Reform MPs from the province of Nova Scotia. In fact, I do not 
think there are very many Conservative or Bloc MPs. They are all 
Liberal.
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
	The fact is this government has a responsibility to run the armed 
forces and sometimes that means there has to be reorganization. 
Sometimes it means closing air command, sometimes it means 
closing naval or army command in the province of Quebec. This 
has nothing to do with partisan politics.
<P>
	I suggest the viewers watching this program, having listened to 
the hon. member from British Columbia make that kind of charge, 
will be very upset hearing those kinds of allegations because they 
are totally without foundation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Mr. Speaker, the government does have a 
responsibility to run the armed forces and it is running them into 
the ground, as we have seen week after week here in the House of 
Commons.
<P>
	I started out with a different attitude. I begged the minister to 
show me the documentation on how he could save some money. I 
said: ``If you can save some money and you lay it out for me in a 
document, and I am not talking about a one-page press release, I 
am talking about showing me how you can save the money, if you 
can save the money and still fulfil the role of the armed forces then 
hey, I am a Reformer and I will go for it. Let us do it. If that will 
save some bucks I am all for it''.
<P>
	This is not about saving money. That is why Colonel Daigle said 
in his analysis, the memo sent to the minister on which bases 
should be closed, that CFB Chilliwack should be retained. He went 
on to say they will not save money shutting down CFB Chilliwack.
<P>
	General Clive Addy said you cannot do your job if you shut 
down CFB Chilliwack. The last five base commanders, all of them 
engineers, all who have seen the development of CFB Chilliwack 
and realized the role it plays in the greater military, the whole 
engineer training school and so on, have written to me and have all 
said the same thing, that this base should not be closed.
<P>
	It should be retained and you cannot save money by sending 
people to Gagetown or to Edmonton and ask them to use ground 
engaging equipment in December. You cannot ask them to practice 
their grading techniques  in January. You cannot ask them to build a 
road or practice their bridging techniques on February 5. You 
cannot ask them to build Bailey bridges and to practice their rafting 
on March 4 in Edmonton.
<P>
	Right now they are trucking all our guys from Edmonton back to 
Chilliwack to practice their bridging and rafting. As a matter of 
fact, to move their equipment in they damaged the bridge and it is 
going to cost $100,000 just to fix the bridge. It is not a good move. 
It is not a good move militarily. We heard that from General Clive 
Addy and others.
<P>
	It is not a good move economically. We have heard that from our 
own access to information documents and from the government's 
own analysis. It is not a good move even right down to the idea-I 
do not want to make this into a national unity issue-of 
understanding what is going on in the regions of the country. It is 
important that the military have some institutional knowledge of 
British Columbia.
<P>
	It is interesting and I hate to say it is typical but as an aside they 
changed the boundaries of my riding. It is now going to be called 
Fraser Valley. I phoned Elections Canada in Ottawa and I said I 
needed some maps to let me know exactly what it is I am looking 
at. The response from the people in Ottawa was: ``Fraser Valley. 
Where in Alberta is that?''
<P>
	I get the same feeling from this government when it comes to 
issues related to British Columbia. It is like the official who phoned 
me up one time on a speaking tour and asked if they went to 
Vancouver Island could they drive the George Massey Tunnel to 
get back to the mainland by quitting time. I deal with this all the 
time.
<P>
	On my phone consistently are messages saying: ``I am sorry I did 
not catch you in the office, Strahl, what is the matter with you?'' Of 
course the message is 6.30 a.m. Why? Because they do not even 
understand there is a stupid time change in this country. On that 
side of the House they do not understand that the country does not 
end at the Rocky Mountains.
<P>
<B>(1630)</B>
<P>
	On military endeavours the Liberals are making a serious error. 
They recognize that B.C. should have a constitutional veto because 
it is a separate region. I do not want to get into a whole national 
unity debate. But they seem to understand at least that there is a 
region called British Columbia and it is separated by the Rocky 
Mountains. It is a hard doggone thing to get across in the middle of 
a landslide or an earthquake or in the case of a natural disaster.
<P>
	However, the Liberals do not have clue one when it comes to 
understanding that the military needs an institutional knowledge of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4880"> 4880 </A></B>
<P>
what takes place on that side of the Rocky Mountains. They are 
going to pay a price for this. I hope that Canadians and British 
Columbians  do not pay too big a price for the ignorant decision of 
this federal government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this has been an 
interesting if somewhat unresponsive debate. I will raise some of 
the key points that have emerged as I have listened to the various 
orators.
<P>
	It is charged that it is a grievous crime that there are not enough 
Liberal members from B.C. That can be corrected in the next 
election. But I would raise the basic point that it is not the number 
of members, it is the quality of the representation. I made the point 
in another context with the former Conservative government, 
which I think was historically well accepted, that they had more 
effective representation of B.C. in the period 1984 to 1988 with 
only one powerful minister than in 1988 to 1993 when there were 
four or five ministers, one being a prime minister in waiting. It is 
the quality of the advice and whether the people work together as a 
team that counts.
<P>
	Let me run through some of the achievements of which B.C. 
people can be proud in this period of office of B.C. members. One 
is the TRIUMF facility. Does anyone know how many hours of 
work that represented, carrying it to the cabinet, discussing it 
bilaterally with a minister, discussing it with the western caucus, 
persuading other regions of the country to waive their claims? We 
made the case that B.C. leads in these areas of fundamental 
scientific research and there is a significant spin-off to export 
industry. We brought forward the statistics: $200 million export 
contracts in foreign trade spun off from TRIUMF, in order to retain 
TRIUMF. Give us the money for that. B.C. leads. $167.5 million 
spread over five years is a significant gain. That took some 
hundreds of hours of work from my office and that of other 
members.
<P>
	Canadian Airlines. We made the point to the cabinet that it is 
vital to have two national airlines in Canada and that it should use 
its power as a federal government to control the international air 
routes, which were given under the foreign affairs treaty making 
power. Use that to persuade one of the parties to cease aggressive 
litigation. The result of another few hundred hours of work, 
discussion in the western caucus, discussion in the national caucus 
before a Prime Minister who listens was 7,000 jobs retained in the 
greater Vancouver area. That is an achievement. A minister who 
listened and a minister who said the work was there and who said 
he had been persuaded.
<P>
	B.C. as a distinct society, the notion that we should be 
considered as distinct a society as any in Canada, but with the 
important constitutional implications. B.C. is a fifth region and if 
there is to be any constitutional veto, we are entitled to that as 
much as anybody else. That was accepted again. It took arguments 
with ministers, arguments with cabinet, the case presented in the 
caucus. That is teamwork.
<P>
	Softwood lumber. My colleague, the member for Vancouver 
South started this. But the argument that historic rights were a key 
part of federalism in Canada and should be respected were key in 
maintaining B.C.'s historical quota. That argument was made by 
the B.C. members and it won and the results are there. Not 
everybody was happy with this. In fact, some of my colleagues 
from other provinces have asked: ``Have you not managed to get 
too much''? We said: ``We have made the case. If you have a good 
case, carry it forward''. That is the essence of a good MP carrying 
the case for his or her province in Ottawa. It is the not the number 
of MPs but in fact the quality of their representations and whether 
they do their homework. Somebody was referring to the media and 
its power. I have appeared frequently on CFNW. I have been there 
for 20 years off and on with my old combatant and good friend, 
Rafe Mair. I was on his program and was congratulated on what we 
had managed to do on the airlines. Someone asked: ``What have 
you done about the francophonie Olympic games?'' I said: ``Look, 
I am working on softwood lumber. It is a full time job. Give me 
some extra colleagues and maybe we can delegate to them the 
francophonie Olympic games''. This is not to say that it is not an 
important question but there is a limit to our physical capacity to 
handle many jobs together.
<P>
<B>(1635)</B>
<P>
	On the record, I believe we have done well. It reflects the basic 
condition in British Columbia. We are the fastest growing area of 
the country but it is more than that. It is more than the influx of 
population. It is the new dynamism. It is the feeling that Canada is 
moving and we are moving more quickly than anybody else.
<P>
	It is one of the reasons why, in this repeated discussion of 
constitutional change, that we have said we would like a larger 
vision. It is mistake to jell the status quo. We want to build a 
Canada for the future.
<P>
	Is British Columbia opposed to Quebec? Not on your life. I know 
no reasonable, responsible British Columbian who is opposed to 
Quebec, to French Canada or the French language and culture and 
its influence on our society. If it is simply a matter of repeating 
what is already international law and constitutional law by virtue of 
the military agreements of 1759, the Treaty of Paris 1763, the 
Quebec Act of 1774 and the Supreme Court Act of 1875 so far as it 
relates to Quebec representations in the Supreme Court of Canada, 
there is no problem in British Columbia. In fact, there is no 
particular constitutional obstacle.
<P>
	It is when we get into the specifics of constitutional change that 
we face the basic issue that we have been in some respects in a 
constitutional straitjacket since 1982. We have pointed out that 
some matters for change require 10 out of 10 provinces to agree. 
Other matters require only seven out of ten but it may take a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4881"> 4881 </A></B>
<P>
Supreme Court decision to say which is which. In the meantime, 
we have to recognize that politics is the art of the possible.
<P>
	That is why I and others welcome the agreement, in which we 
have played some part, between the Government of British 
Columbia, which is not of the same political ideology as the 
present Government of Canada, and the Government of Canada, 
the memorandum of understanding to study together the future of 
the west coast fishing industry.
<P>
	If we want to change the Constitution, we are into this basic 
problem, section 91.12. It is section 91 and 92. On many views 
change in section 91.12, by formal amendment, is a 10 out of 10 
question. It is at least a seven out of ten and with every 
constitutional change involving British Columbia's consent, we 
have to have the prior approval of the people in a referendum. 
Former Premier Van Der Zalm's government introduced it and it is 
the law. It is respected by everybody.
<P>
	However, there is nothing to say that we cannot change the 
Constitution in other ways, that we cannot reach co-operative 
federalism by a joint understanding of principles and policies for 
future development that we would work out together. This is 
changing the Constitution in a practical way if it works, and the 
best energies of the British Columbia government we are assured 
and certainly the federal government are devoted to this.
<P>
	I will repeat again that the Constitution is changing. British 
Columbians welcome the change in the Constitution. Probably at a 
certain point we will be suggesting the simplest of all methods, a 
constituent assembly. However, it is a country still in growth and, 
as we know from the experience of the 19th century codification, to 
act too early is frankly to jell social change prematurely. We are 
looking at this, but in the meantime we are doing our best to change 
the Constitution in practical ways.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	The decision of the federal cabinet on softwood lumber is a 
vindication of the classic principles of federalism. The intervention 
of the British Columbia caucus was very positive and very direct.
<P>
	I respect the problems to which hon. members opposite have 
referred. I understand the concern of members of the Bloc in 
relation to the marine service fees. There has been reference to the 
fact that 75 per cent of the witnesses took one view and only 25 per 
cent the other. Have they considered the reality that in British 
Columbia we work collegially? It is much better to have one or two 
solid pieces of testimony from British Columbians in favour of the 
differential fee for the main services fee, the principle of user pay, 
if they represent the same number of people as the 75 per cent. In 
other  words, the numbers game does not work. It is the weight of 
the testimony which is crucial.
<P>
	I would remind members of the official opposition who raised 
this issue that the matter is still open to examination as the 
experience with the marine service fees is worked out.
<P>
	With respect to the closing of military bases, I argued the case 
successfully for extending the Chilliwack base by a year. I argued 
the case in relation to Royal Roads. The difference in the two cases 
is that in Royal Roads the provincial government and the local 
communities came up with alternative plans which were accepted.
<P>
	I regret the closing of Chilliwack, but I accept the notion which 
all opposition members have raised. If we want to balance the 
budget and reduce external debt, then something has to give. The 
sacrifice, as long as it is equal, is something which we can share.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Raymond Chan (Secretary of State (Asia-Pacific), 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, before beginning I would like to draw the 
attention of the House to the fact that the Reform Party is once 
again trying to pit some regions against other regions in Canada. 
Last week it was Quebec against Newfoundland with the Churchill 
Falls issue. This week it is trying to pit British Columbia against 
other regions of the country. It is sad.
<P>
	I would like to suggest that the reason the Reform Party is 
playing politics this way is because it is continually dropping in the 
polls which are taken in British Columbia. In September the Gallup 
poll showed that it only has about 21 per cent support in B.C. I 
would like to advise the third party that doing politics this way will 
not earn it any more brownie points.
<P>
	During Question Period I asked the Reform member if he 
understood the Asia-Pacific agenda of the government and, in 
particular, as it pertains to B.C. He said no. He said that trade in 
British Columbia is thriving in spite of government efforts.
<P>
	I would like to take this opportunity to share some information 
with him. The Prime Minister and the Liberal government in 
November 1993 recognized how important the Asia-Pacific region 
is and how important it is to British Columbia. It is no coincidence 
that Canada's first Secretary of State for Asia-Pacific is from 
British Columbia. I want to share the efforts which the government 
and I have made over the last three years for British Columbia.
<P>
	One of the reasons the Asia-Pacific region is so important for us 
is because of the job and economic growth agenda which is a 
priority of the government. We led Team Canada missions into that 
region: China in 1994, and India, Pakistan, Indonesia and Malaysia 
in January 1996. These missions have led to some $17 billion in 
new business deals and follow-up activities. Other missions led by 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4882"> 4882 </A></B>
<P>
other Canadian ministers and  myself have also promoted our 
commercial interests and through them, jobs and growth at home.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	It is estimated that every billion dollars of exports in Canada 
which are exported through British Columbia generate about 
11,000 jobs for Canadians. In British Columbia alone, 50 per cent 
of our exports are to the Asia-Pacific region. I can share with the 
members some of the successes from British Columbia.
<P>
	Innotech Aviation of Richmond, a company in my riding has 
recently signed an agreement with the Chinese General 
Administration of Civil Aviation Authority to complete a major 
maintenance project for Chinese Cessna Citation jets. Sun-Rype 
Products of Kelowna signed a memorandum of understanding that 
is worth $13 million while on a recent trade mission. Chai-na-ta 
Corporation has two projects worth $27 million which will sustain 
100 jobs in its Langley operation. Kryton Technologies of 
Vancouver will create 10 jobs as a direct result of its joint ventures 
in Asia through participation in Team Canada.
<P>
	Improving Canada's trade performance and links between 
countries is one of the best moves we can make to create jobs in 
Canada. Another way of linking Canada and the countries of the 
Asia-Pacific is through the open skies agreement. We understand 
how important the open skies agreement is to Canada and how the 
overall transportation system on the west coast is so important to 
British Columbia. It is no coincidence again that Canada's 
transport minister is from British Columbia. The Minister of 
Transport has done a great job.
<P>
	I still remember that when we first got elected, the first thing I 
did was to meet with the airport authority to talk about how 
important the open skies agreement was. The former Minister of 
Transport and the present Minister of Transport, who is an hon. 
member from British Columbia, have done a tremendous job in 
implementing that policy. In February 1995 the agreement was 
signed.
<P>
	How important is the open skies agreement for British 
Columbia? It has made Vancouver the gateway to the Asia-Pacific. 
The reason the tourism industry has flourished and so many airlines 
have started using us is that we have the open skies agreement. 
Talking about high tech industries in British Columbia, because of 
that agreement, Richmond will no longer be at a competitive 
disadvantage because of poor airline connections.
<P>
	I am proud to announce that Vancouver has been chosen as the 
site where Canada will host the Asia-Pacific Economic 
Co-operation conference in November 1997. It is no coincidence 
the Government of Canada decided that Vancouver should be the 
site. We recognize it is important for Vancouver to have that 
opportunity, to showcase Vancouver, British Columbia and in fact, 
the whole of Canada to the Asia-Pacific region. This is also why the 
Prime Minister will announce later that 1997 will be the year of 
Asia-Pacific for Canada. This is all because we want to put 
<P>
emphasis on helping Vancouver and British Columbia and Canada 
to do much more in the Asia-Pacific region.
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	Talking about the technology industry, I would like to remind the 
member that in the 1995 budget we planned $165 million for 
TRIUMF, which is one of the flagships of the high technology 
industry in Canada and indeed in British Columbia. This was done 
at a time when a lot of research and development projects in other 
parts of the country were being cut back.
<P>
	The reason we managed this is that all six caucus members of the 
Liberal Party from British Columbia worked very hard to convince 
our colleagues in the rest of the country that it is important for 
British Columbia to continue with the TRIUMF project. It is 
important that those scientists and technologists who are so 
important for this country stay in the lower mainland to continue to 
provide a lot of spin-off benefits for the high technology industries 
in British Columbia.
<P>
	It is no coincidence either that because of the hard work of the 
Liberal caucus members from British Columbia as my colleague, 
Mr. McWhinney, has mentioned-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> This mistake has been made repeatedly 
this afternoon, colleagues. We are not to refer to a sitting member 
of the House by his or her name and only by his or her constituency.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chan:</B> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Earlier my colleagues 
mentioned the efforts we have put forward to make sure that we 
kept our entitled quota on softwood lumber. It is because we all 
worked so hard that we were able to convince the ministers in 
charge that softwood lumber is critical for the future of British 
Columbians. We finally won what we set out to do.
<P>
	Talking about the deficit, whenever I go back to my riding to 
meet with British Columbians they all talk about the necessity of 
keeping our irons in the fire to make sure that we do a good job to 
maintain our target goals on our deficit reduction project. Even 
though the agenda we put forth on the deficit reduction process has 
a great deal of impact on the other regions of Canada, and at the 
same time British Columbians have less of a burden in this process, 
the cabinet and the Prime Minister have been able to pursue and 
continue with-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member's time has expired. 
Questions and comments, the hon. member for Vancouver North.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to ask the member some questions about his representation in 
B.C.
<P>
	My first question is: Why did the member ignore the input from 
two, not just one but two public meetings in  his riding which told 
him not to support any recognition of distinct society for Quebec 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4883"> 4883 </A></B>
<P>
when he voted for the government's initiative against the wishes of 
his constituents?
<P>
	The second question is: Is it true that the member mentioned that 
he would not be a minister if it was not for the fact that he was 
Asian? If that is true, how widespread is this problem of racism in 
the Liberal Party?
<P>
	My third question is. On the issue of astronaut families, the 
member comes from a riding that contains a high percentage of 
Asians. I have an article here from the Vancouver <I>Sun</I> of September 
25. It states: ``In the past two months dozens of high-end homes on 
Vancouver's west side have been listed, including four priced at 
$2.5 million or higher, that went on the market the same day 
because Asians are fleeing the country, because they are going to 
be required to pay taxes on their worldwide incomes by the new 
provisions introduced in the budget last year''.
<P>
	To link the article, it describes reports from KPMG Accountants 
and a number of others who estimate this astronaut family problem 
to be a major problem. That is certainly the experience that came 
from New Zealand when they clamped down on this tax evasion. 
Three years ago Reformers were called racist for even trying to 
bring this subject up. Now it is clearly a major, major problem here. 
I would like the member to tell me, does it affect 10 per cent, 20 per 
cent, 30 per cent or 40 per cent of his riding? How many tax 
evaders are there in his riding?
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chan:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have no apologies to make. If the 
distinct society clause is what will keep Canada united, then that is 
exactly what I believe was necessary at the time of the referendum. 
The Prime Minister came out boldly to support that cause and 
carried through with the legislation to honour his promise to keep 
Canada together.
<P>
	As an immigrant who came to this country-and I love this 
country-I came here for freedom, but I want a united Canada. I 
have no apologizes to make to support the initiative to keep Canada 
together. On the contrary, I would ask the Reform Party: Where 
were you in the referendum? Where were you to be seen? During 
the referendum I went into Quebec three or four times-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Will the hon. member please put his 
comments to the Chair rather than across the floor.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chan:</B> Mr. Speaker, I get excited when it comes to the unity 
of the country.
<P>
	I was in Quebec three or four times to urge Quebecers to vote no 
in the referendum. I have no apologies to make in that regard.
<P>
	Speaking as the minister for the Asia-Pacific, right after the 
report was made in the <I>Vancouver Sun</I> I made a  strong statement to 
tell the public that it was not true. Indeed the fact that I as an 
immigrant of Asian origin am able not only to share the wealth and 
well-being of Canada because of the generosity of Canadians but 
also to share in the political power of the Canadian establishment is 
a true indication of how generous Canadians are, how open our 
society is. The statement was false and I make that very clear. I 
thank the hon. member for giving me this opportunity to clear those 
points.
<P>
	On the astronaut family issue, this is where we differ with the 
Reform Party. Mr. White suggested that every immigrant that 
comes into-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. minister has been here now for 
three years and I think he should know to address members by their 
riding rather than by their names.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chan:</B> The hon. member opposite who asked a question 
suggested that all immigrants who come to this country should 
report to the customs officers at the border whether they have paid 
taxes or not. How could the Canadian government treat immigrants 
differently from Canadians? I do not think it is practical to treat 
every immigrant as a criminal before they come into this country.
<P>
	For the hon. member opposite to ask me how big the problem of 
astronaut families is, I do not know. I do not think any one of us 
would know. I do not think it is a big problem because most 
immigrants from Asia are no different from immigrants from any 
other part of the world. Most of them are law-abiding citizens and 
most of them have contributed greatly to the success of this 
country. I look at myself as a great example. I came to Canada with 
$20 in my pocket. I completed my education here. I have built a 
family and a career and I am contributing to the country. I am an 
Asian immigrant.
<P>
	I hope that the Reform Party and the members opposite will not 
continuously attack Canadians or immigrants because of their 
ethnic origin.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, you 
will, of course, permit me to comment on the discussion that took 
place between the member of the Liberal Party and the member of 
the Reform Party, earlier, when they were speaking about distinct 
society. On a number of occasions today, we have heard our 
colleagues in the Reform Party berate the Liberals for supporting 
this concept.
<P>
	That being said, government members have on each occasion 
been at pains to make it clear that they were supporting the concept 
only in so far as it meant as little as possible and that absolutely no 
power was involved. One minister even told us this during question 
period.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4884"> 4884 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1700)</B>
<P>
	This is a clear illustration of the fact that distinct society means 
different things to different people. Today, during the debate 
between government members and members of the Reform Party, 
the government took the trouble each time to make it clear that this 
concept did not involve any specific or additional power. In that 
sense, they supported it. It is very worrisome to hear such things. 
These people are saying that they have promised to recognize the 
concept of a distinct society, and that they will keep their promise, 
as long as it does not mean anything. We could doubt their good 
faith and sincerity when they come selling us all sorts of promises.
<P>
	That being said, let us return to the motion proposed today by the 
Reform Party. This debate always leads us back to the 
constitutional debate, because there are many problems associated 
with the division of powers in this country.
<P>
	Today, the Reform Party is complaining that the federal 
government is impeding progress in western Canada through its 
mismanagement of the affairs of the nation. It gives a series of 
examples: discontinuation of Coast Guard services, the closure of 
military bases, the elimination of federal Ports Canada policing, 
and so on.
<P>
	I will take the few minutes allotted me to draw a parallel with the 
situation in Quebec regarding the federal government. One of the 
problems, and the problem that will eventually lead to the 
reconfiguration of Canada without Quebec, in which Quebec will 
simply be one of Canada's trade partners, is this centralizing 
tendency that has always dominated thinking over the years here in 
Ottawa.
<P>
	We see there has always been a movement in western Canada 
that favours decentralized government, a movement that never 
found favour with a government that has always been at the mercy 
of the bureaucracy or the bureaucratic inertia of the people who 
make the real decisions here in Ottawa.
<P>
	That also led to the current situation: excessive debt. It also 
means that we have a federal government that is responsible for 
spending more than $160 billion annually, which is 
disproportionate to the role government should play if we had a 
real confederation instead of a federation. What the Reform Party 
proposes today brings us back to the crux of the problem, where 
there are certain choices we will have to make, choices that will be 
made in the years to come.
<P>
	As I said earlier, I will discuss the similar situation that exists in 
Quebec, without necessarily commenting on the situation in British 
Columbia, with the exception of a few areas for which I have some 
figures. I will start with defence spending.
<P>
	I find that ridiculous. We often hear people, especially on the 
government side, harp on the fact that unemployment levels are 
higher in Quebec. They get all  excited, they are in fact delighted, 
and they think it is just one more weapon to fight the sovereignists, 
and they told us that to our face.
<P>
	I say this because last night I was watching a news feature on 
RDI, I think it was ``Le Point''. In this program they explained, 
using statistics and interviewing an economist with Statistics 
Canada, why there was a difference of about 3 per cent between 
unemployment levels in Quebec and Ontario. With the automotive 
industry removed, we could see it clearly accounted primarily for 
the difference. If the automotive industry had been transferred to 
Quebec, Ontario would have had 3 per cent more unemployment 
than Quebec.
<P>
	The same sector is responsible for the fact that the level of 
investment in Canada is higher in Ontario than Quebec. 
Historically, who made the decision that the automotive industry 
would be concentrated mainly in Ontario? These are political 
decisions that were made here in Ottawa.
<P>
	This, together with spending on research and development, on 
which I will say more later, means that the interests of the province 
of Ontario have always come first. Ontario, in the final instance, 
has had the advantage of an economy that attracted productive 
investment, often at the expense of Quebec and perhaps of other 
regions as well. All this has made one region stronger 
economically, while other regions have been able to improve their 
economies thanks to other factors.
<P>
	We have heard a lot about British Columbia today. The main 
economic advantage of this province is based on a growing Asian 
market that will continue to grow in the years and perhaps decades 
to come. They have managed to position themselves strategically 
between the Asian economy and the U.S. economy.
<P>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
	However, when we consider the situation in the Maritimes 
which, up to a point, has been similar to that in Quebec, we see that 
the federal system has not been very favourable for partners other 
than those who control the decisions here and are located mostly in 
Ontario.
<P>
	The Reform Party members mentioned the defence aspect, 
because they have lost a major infrastructure in British Columbia 
as a result of what they consider to be unfair distribution of federal 
spending. Let us look at the expenditures per province, and more 
specifically per capita, for the Department of National Defence. 
The provinces benefiting most are, in order: Nova Scotia, New 
Brunswick and Manitoba, with Ontario ranking fourth, PEI fifth, 
and Quebec sixth.
<P>
	I can, of course, understand the Reform Party members' 
disappointment with this, since they are not the ones to benefit 
most from these expenditures. But the situation in Quebec speaks 
volumes: $316 per capita, on the average, compared to $1,200 for 
Nova Scotia, for  instance, or four times more; $1,050 for New 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4885"> 4885 </A></B>
<P>
Brunswick; $471 for Manitoba; $420 per capita for Ontario; $365 
for PEI, and $316 for Quebec.
<P>
	There has, moreover, been a study saying that the federal 
defence underinvestment in Quebec had deprived Quebec of $650 
million in economic fallout every year for 15 years. Just think, 
these are considerable amounts which, when recirculated into the 
economy, increase the development of the service sector, as well as 
investments in other sectors. They generate economic activity, and 
we are not talking of a pittance here, but of $650 million annually.
<P>
	Now, for some other figures. Personnel expenditures account for 
15 per cent of the budget. I am referring here to the 1992-1993 
budget. There may have been some changes to the figures, but 
nothing drastic. Personnel expenditures, therefore, represent only 
15 per cent, while the figure for DND infrastructure investment in 
Quebec was 13 per cent.
<P>
	Other things that have happened have also triggered strong 
reactions. In August 1995, for instance, the federal government had 
a major contract to award, relating to personnel carriers. It will be 
remembered that this was awarded without a bid process-and 
where? To Ontario, of course, GM to be precise.
<P>
	Yes, there was a contract for parts and so on to be awarded to 
Quebec, but it did not come at all close to generating the same 
economic activity, and certainly was not of the same magnitude as 
what went to Ontario without a bidding process.
<P>
	Once again, this was an arbitrary decision, one which has 
always, over the years, favoured the same area. How, after that, can 
one wonder why in Quebec certain sectors have a higher 
unemployment rate than elsewhere?
<P>
	There is no doubt that, when the federal government decides to 
be an active player, it comes and takes billions of dollars in revenue 
from each of the provinces, $30 billion from Quebec, and spends 
them in a rather arbitrary manner, often with questionable 
judgment. Obviously, this leads to distortions. Some lose, and 
others gain.
<P>
	Furthermore, Statistics Canada officials are doing some very 
interesting studies, although they are not known to be sovereignists 
or to have any political association, and they said that Quebec's 
share of federal investments, and they had studies to back them up, 
was clearly below the percentage for its population. They said that 
Quebec's contribution to Gross Domestic Product was 18.6 per 
cent, while we represent 23 per cent of the population. There are 
those who may say that 5 per cent is no big deal, but when you are 
spending billions of dollars, each percentage point adds up to 
hundreds of millions. So when you are talking 5 per cent, obviously 
that is a lot of money not invested in a province like Quebec that 
should have been invested there.
<P>
	Obviously, I fully expect to hear members from the Reform or 
Liberal parties say: ``Yes, but, on the other hand, you benefited 
from equalization payments, you received transfer payments for 
more than your share of the population, for example, for 
unemployment insurance, welfare and so on''. That is true, but 
because of an infrastructure that was not well enough developed 
and was distorted by political choices made outside Quebec, we 
ended up with a higher rate of unemployment and a higher jobless 
rate, leading inevitably to greater numbers of people on 
unemployment insurance and welfare, as well as additional costs.
<P>
<B>(1710)</B>
<P>
	We are compensated, less and less I might add, through transfer 
payments and told: ``Quit whining, we pay a sort of social 
assistance to the provinces and you should be happy with that''.
<P>
	But never in a month of Sundays does this make up for all the 
political decisions that led to this situation. I would much prefer 
that we receive a fairer share in research and development, in 
procurement and in all these sectors that help us take control of our 
economy.
<P>
	I will give you an example. During the last referendum 
campaign, I had the opportunity to visit a plant involved in the 
purchase of goods and services-this time by the Government of 
Quebec, but the example still shows how important an issue this is. 
This company had obtained a government building maintenance 
contract which enabled it to develop a computer-controlled system 
for ventilation, air conditioning, electric power and so on. Thanks 
to its government contracts, the company was able to develop an 
extraordinary technology, which it is now exporting throughout the 
U.S. for use in a large number of buildings.
<P>
	But, first of all, they received the necessary jump start from 
having obtained a government contract, which added to their 
credibility. Of course, when the federal government does not give 
Quebec its just dues, contracts like this, with their significant long 
term economic fallout, are not obtained. The obvious results of this 
are less research and fewer investments in such a province.
<P>
	I do not want to get carried away, to overdo it, blaming the 
federal government for everything that is wrong in Quebec. Far 
from it, but we do have to face reality. They talk about not wanting 
to make a connection between the economic debate and the 
political one, but one is possible. I am not afraid of doing just that. I 
am a sovereignist, and a great economics enthusiast, and I can tell 
you that, while there are cultural and historical reasons which cause 
me to opt for sovereignty, there are also some very pragmatic ones 
which are linked to the economy. If one looks at the situation, one 
cannot reach any other conclusion.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4886"> 4886 </A></B>
<P>
	Now, moving on to research and development. This is another 
sector in which, over the years, Quebec has not been overwhelmed 
with federal expenditures. For example, in 1990-91, Quebec 
received 19.5 per cent of federal expenditures, compared to 
Ontario's share of 53 per cent. Once again, these are Statistics 
Canada's figures.
<P>
	In 1990-91, 13.8 per cent of federal R&amp;D expenditures in federal 
laboratories went to Quebec. Here again, Ontario was the big 
winner. Between 1979 and 1989, in a study over the longer term, 
Quebec received an average of 18.5 per cent of the federal 
government's total R&amp;D spending. For those ten years alone, this 
represented a loss of $2 billion in R&amp;D spending.
<P>
	I can give you more figures. There are plenty of statistics. 
Ontario has 73 federal research centres. This works out to one per 
150,000 inhabitants. There are 50 in western Canada, 30 in Quebec 
and 24 in the Maritimes. If we compare Quebec and Ontario, we 
have a ratio of 30 to 73.
<P>
	I remember that in university I had a chance to do a study on 
research and development, and it was clear that the way spending 
was distributed was most unfair. There was a definite bias in 
laboratory expenditures in Ottawa or in the Outaouais, where 3 out 
of 41 centres are in Quebec. Hull, Gatineau and Aylmer are not that 
far away, so it would not have been a problem to have more, which 
would have made for more balanced statistics on research and 
development.
<P>
	It goes on and on. Look at what happens with procurement. Here 
again, Quebec has never received more than 19.1 per cent of 
spending on goods and services. That was in 1981. A long time 
ago. This percentage has varied between 15 and 19 per cent. I 
repeat, we always get several percentage points less in procurement 
and research and development than our population sends in taxes to 
Ottawa. About 23 per cent of taxes collected come from Quebec, 
but we never get more than 17 or 18 per cent of investment 
spending.
<P>
	It should come as no surprise today to see more people drawing 
conclusions about the positive impact of political systems like the 
one we have now. This government has had ample opportunity to 
change its power structure, to limit its spending powers and 
decentralize its jurisdictions, but it has always failed to produce a 
positive response, even when at times western Canada showed an 
even stronger political will to demand some level of 
decentralization.
<P>
<B>(1715)</B>
<P>
	Today, we see practically everyone on the Canadian side rallying 
behind Ottawa's strategy, which is to go for broke. It has taken a 
very hard line and painted a threatening future for Quebecers. They 
say there will be total chaos, legal chaos and economic chaos, 
uncertainty, and so forth.
<P>
	However, they offer no alternative because they are incapable of 
defining one. They do not want to. Deep down they probably think 
that fear of the unknown will lead people to opt for the status quo. 
Surprise. Since last October, we see more people drawing different 
conclusions, and next time, there will be even more.
<P>
	Before I finish, I may recall the program I watched 
yesterday-very well presented and very objective-on the 
economic situation. The program explained the difference in 
unemployment levels in Quebec and Ontario.
<P>
	With figures to prove his point, an economist with the Bank of 
Canada explained the variables: investment, the unemployment 
rate, the importance of the automotive industry in Ontario. These 
are the reasons why today we have the kind of differential in the 
unemployment rate that we see between Quebec and Ontario. The 
difference is about 3 per cent. It has always existed. This is not 
new. This has been going on for 25 or 30 years.
<P>
	I would like to send a message to our federalist friends opposite, 
especially those from Quebec. They should take another look at the 
statistics they are spreading around left and right and stop getting 
excited because jobs were lost in Quebec for two consecutive 
months. I urge them to start digging, to see what is behind all that, 
instead of always blaming everything on political uncertainty, 
which is being used as an excuse for just about anything today. Let 
them look at how political decisions made over the years have had 
a negative impact on the development of Quebec.
<P>
	I am not talking about the situation of the airports in Montreal or 
the Borden line or the rest, I am simply talking about a few major 
sectors. I am talking about how decisions made over the years by 
the government for which they work, where their tax money is 
administered, to the tune of $30 billion coming from Quebec, how 
those decisions have had a negative impact on Quebec's 
development.
<P>
	I would ask them to take a realistic look at the situation. If they 
want them, I will be glad to provide the statistics and discuss the 
issues with them to get the right picture and find out how to get this 
economy on the road to recovery. They will want a federalist 
solution, of course, but that being said, they should convince the 
people here in Ottawa to check the imbalance in investment which 
has grown over the years, but I doubt they will succeed.
<P>
	In concluding, people are complaining about the situation in 
British Columbia, for instance. I want to provide a picture of the 
situation in Quebec which is scarcely better, a picture that the 
federal government has certainly not helped to improve.

	One interesting thing about Prince Rupert and the people who 
live there is that there was a certain degree of isolationism not just 
from the government in Ottawa but from their own provincial 
government in Victoria. I think the problem in our country is that 
many rural communities feel dislinked, for whatever reason, from 
our urban centres.
<P>
	It is very important that we as a government find ways to bring 
those people together in a common cause. There has been a great 
deal of stress in our country because of a traumatic shift away from 
an east-west based economy to a north-south one. This is no less so 
for the people of Prince Rupert. I spent a good deal of time with 
these people and I have discovered that Prince Rupert has 
tremendous potential. It is clearly 35 hours closer to the Asian ports 
of Korea and Japan.
<P>
<B>(1720)</B>
<P>
	Many people spoke to me about the cost of shipping through the 
port of Prince Rupert and that grain could be shipped cheaper 
through the port of Prince Rupert except for a number of economic 
determinants which belittled that.
<P>
	I was able to bring back some of the issues to Ottawa to have 
them addressed by the government. I am happy to see that as part of 
that process the minister responsible has recommended a task force 
to deal with the whole issue of Prince Rupert and the northwest 
transportation routes.
<P>
	I spoke to some of the good friends I made in Prince Rupert and I 
discovered today that the task force has been travelling to places 
like Prince Rupert, Terrace, Smithers and that there has been little 
or no representation by the Reform Party.
<P>
	It would appear to me that the Reform Party is not particularly 
interested in the process of renewal but rather wants to focus on 
regionalism and wants to try to divide the country by pitting region 
against region. That is not good enough. That is not the policy of 
the government because it sees the importance of linking all our 
communities together.
<P>
	Members of the Reform Party talk incessantly about dismantling 
the Canadian Wheat Board. If that happens  it will be the port of 
Prince Rupert and the people of that area of British Columbia who 
will be most devastated by that process. It will fractionalize the 
marketing of grain in this country. Right now the preference is to 
go through the port of Vancouver for a variety of economic reasons 
which I will get into. By breaking down the structure of the 
Canadian Wheat Board it will be even more devastating to the 
people of Prince Rupert.
<P>
	The port of Prince Rupert grain handling system was partially 
closed down last year. I am happy to report that the terminal on 
Ridley Island and the Prince Rupert grain authority has opened 
again with an expected larger crop this year from the west.
<P>
	It is interesting that the ability to load freighters in the port of 
Prince Rupert is a lot faster than at any other terminal on the west 
coast. We then end up with many ships waiting in the port of 
Vancouver to fill up when they could be moved more efficiently 
through the port of Prince Rupert. There are a number of reasons 
why this happens under the Crow rate system and also the 
rationalization of how CN charges freight rates.
<P>
	They often do not properly account for the cost of grain cars 
which are held in storage prior to being unloaded. In fact, I believe 
there is a very nominal rental fee in their accounting system which 
works against the port of Prince Rupert. Even though the port of 
Prince Rupert technically is somewhat further away from the main 
transportation routes it can move the cars through the port much 
more quickly. The ships can be loaded and unloaded much more 
quickly which means that the shipper does not face demurrage 
charges and other charges by ships being anchored in the port 
waiting to be filled.
<P>
	From all accounts the port of Prince Rupert should be the 
preferred port for grain shipments from the west. Why is it not? 
Because of the things I spoke of earlier. In addition, there is an 
ownership structure which exists within that terminal that is owned 
by the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool and Cargill and a number of other 
owners. Many people in the region note that one of the larger 
terminal shippings is owned by the same consortium in Delta. 
Some people wonder whether a different ownership would provide 
more competition in the area and create more business for Prince 
Rupert.
<P>
<B>(1725)</B>
<P>
	The Reform Party has been totally silent on this issue. It does not 
seem to be addressing these problems of major concern to the 
people of Prince Rupert and the hinterland of that area.
<P>
	Coal is another big shipping item from the port of Prince Rupert. 
Much of that coal comes from Alberta. A lot of it could be shipped 
more efficiently through the port of Prince Rupert. Once again I do 
not hear the members from those parts of Alberta represented by 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4888"> 4888 </A></B>
<P>
Reformers talking about how they could more efficiently move 
coal through the port of Prince Rupert. Indeed it would appear to 
me that the representation from the members in this area is almost 
silent.
<P>
	I had some other interesting things happen to me when I was out 
there. People would talk to me about government problems and I 
was able to help some of those people. One of the issues was in a 
town called Port Edward. Mayor Wampler was having significant 
problems with the infrastructure spending program. The House will 
recall that the Reform Party never liked the infrastructure spending 
program. These people thought it was an excellent program.
<P>
	The town of Port Edward is a town very close to Prince Rupert 
but it basically had no sewage treatment system. It was dumping its 
raw sewage into the ocean. It has wanted to deal with that for years 
and years to find some way to treat the sewage so it would not be a 
pollutant. The town had an arrangement with the local pulp mill. 
The pulp mill would allow it to use part of its sewage treatment 
system and upgrade it so it could treat the whole town. It made 
application for infrastructure spending money for that very 
purpose.
<P>
	By the time I got there it was of some concern. The pulp mill had 
decided for one reason or another that it did not want the liability 
that went with that project and had withdrawn from the application. 
People in the town were very concerned. They thought that even 
though they had made an application under the program it was 
going to fall back to the bottom because the nature of it would 
change.
<P>
	They wanted to create their own unique system and not use the 
pulp mill's facilities. They had found a way to do this for equal or 
less cost than in the original application. Because of the way the 
applications were, they felt that the province of British Columbia 
for whatever reason was going to not only delay their application 
but also put it at the back of the pecking order and therefore they 
would not be able to develop the system.
<P>
	I was able to talk to some of the B.C. people who were dealing 
with the infrastructure spending program to get this rectified. I am 
happy to say that the mayor has come forward and thanked me for 
representing that area and getting the problem solved.
<P>
	What I am saying is there is a real question about the issue the 
Reform Party is bringing forth today, which is basically that these 
people are not being represented by their own representatives. It 
seems to me that is the bottom line of what they are saying.
<P>
	People in Prince Rupert and others on the west coast are very 
much part of this country. They want to continue to be part of this 
country. They want to share in what we have to offer as a 
government and they want to be plugged into the system.
<P>
	There are many other problems that concern the people of Prince 
Rupert. As I said, with the grain handling aspect they have a 
tremendous potential. It is a port that is under utilized. As a 
government, we need to do more to recognize that our markets are 
in southeast Asia. The whole issue of trading with southeast Asia is 
an important feature and our government is very focused on that.
<P>
	That is why we have implemented a task force to do just that, to 
go around and ask the people how they see their community and 
their economy evolving in the years ahead. I am happy to say we 
have had many many fine suggestions. I believe that the task force 
is to report very shortly on how to regenerate the economy of 
Prince Rupert and the whole northwest transportation route.
<P>
<B>(1730)</B>
<P>
	For the Reform Party to come here and say that we are ignoring 
the west is just two-faced. The reality is that in some ways it is not 
doing its own job of representing its own people.
<P>
	I would like to thank all the people in Prince Rupert and on the 
west coast for their kind hospitality when I was there. They are 
some of the nicest people I have ever met and we continue to have a 
great friendship. I look forward to helping them in any manner I 
can in dealing with their government which is very much 
concerned about their issues, about their problems, about their 
continuation and about the underpinnings of their economy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Duncan (North Island-Powell River, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I have a couple of comments about the speech of 
the previous speaker. First, we are going to talk about Prince 
Rupert. Our next speaker will do that.
<P>
	Second, when it comes to the infrastructure program and the 
various dealings with the infrastructure program, as the member 
knows, that was a federal-provincial initiative. The provincial 
member who represents Prince Rupert also overlaps with my 
riding. The federal member for Skeena is not here today and so I 
feel some obligation to talk about how that infrastructure program 
works in British Columbia and about how there has been much 
co-operation with the provincial MLA in terms of expediting 
projects.
<P>
	In my case my overlap is in the Bella Coola area. Indeed we have 
co-operated and we have created a good project with their 
waterworks program. I know that type of thing would be very 
possible with the influential member of the provincial legislature 
who is a cabinet member. This is not a unique thing that the 
member talks about and it is not foreign to the British Columbia 
members.
<P>
	Third, the mayor of Port Edward and many of the other 
municipal politicians from that area of the province met in 
Penticton from September 19-20. They all have common concerns 
with Reform members of Parliament  in British Columbia. We did 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4889"> 4889 </A></B>
<P>
indeed have conversations and areas of common concern, many of 
which were brought up earlier today in addressing our motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Shepherd:</B> Madam Speaker, I was very interested in the 
member's comments. The motion before the House today is 
basically criticizing the government for not taking into account and 
failing to recognize the people of the west coast generally. It also 
mentions the movement of grain. It talks about the movement of 
grain to the port of Prince Rupert.
<P>
	I remember sitting in this House on a Sunday about a year ago 
when we had a rail strike in this country. The issue was that we 
were not going to move grain through the port of Prince Rupert 
because the rails were going to be strike bound. There were only 11 
members of the Reform Party in this House at the time. Are they 
going to tell me that is a commitment to the west coast? I am afraid 
not.
<P>
<B>(1735)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, in rebuttal to the last point of the hon. member, if the 
government had listened to Reform, there would not have been a 
rail strike. We wanted some pre-emptive legislation that would 
have prevented that very thing from happening. The hon. member 
talks about this type of nonsense.
<P>
	He is questioning the representation of Reform members from 
northern British Columbia on the issue of the port of Prince Rupert. 
I will quote from a letter I sent to the previous minister of transport.
<P>
	I sent this November 17, 1995 and detailed three issues dealing 
with grain transportation, for the hon. member's information. That 
is almost a year ago. One dealt with the allocation of grain cars in 
my region of northeastern British Columbia.
<P>
	The second issue dealt specifically with the pricing policy 
dealing with the grain transportation rate, the differential between 
the Peace River country to Vancouver versus Prince Rupert, how it 
was damaging to the port of Prince Rupert, what could be done 
about it and some suggestions on that.
<P>
	The third dealt with the differential, the inequity between the 
domestic and export grains, the transportation rates in this country 
along with the demise of the Federal Freight Assistance Act and 
what that would mean for the domestic transport of grains.
<P>
	They were three very important issues dealing with grain 
transportation. I sent that on November 17, 1995. The new Minister 
of Transport responded finally on March 1, 1996 totally 
inadequately.
<P>
	He said-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> I am sorry, 
hon. member. Resuming debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (North Vancouver):</B> Madam Speaker, I rise on a 
point of order. I could be corrected, but I understood that the 
government side was using the 20 minutes plus 10 minutes 
questions and comments, which would mean that time is not up. 
Am I incorrect in that?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> The hon. 
member used only 10 minutes, therefore we have 5 minutes for 
questions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, in any event, let it be very clearly understood that I am 
sharing my time with my colleague, the member for North 
Vancouver. I am not sure that point of sharing was clear previously.
<P>
	As a British Columbian, I would like to point out that 
governments over our history in Canada have not totally 
understood British Columbia. People cannot do so without a bit of 
appreciation of our geography and history.
<P>
	Geography is terrifically important. We know about the Rocky 
Mountains, of course, going north and south. We know, more or 
less, there are other mountain ranges in there: the Purcells, the 
Selkirks, the Monashees, the Cariboo Mountains farther to the 
north and the Coast Range. All these mountains going north-south 
have had quite an effect on the history and economy of British 
Columbia.
<P>
	There are only four passes that have been used for rail or road 
traffic through the mountains. There again, it is an integral part of 
the history and development of the province. There is the Crow's 
Nest, Kicking Horse, Yellowknife and even the one I was 
unfamiliar with, the Pine, farther to the north. These are important 
bits of what makes B.C. the province it is.
<P>
	The rivers that flow through B.C. are just as important as are the 
fiords on the coast. Our history is a function of that in part, the 
geography. Our history starts really on the coast of B.C. It can go 
back 6,000 to 8,000 years with the native population having been 
recorded as being in that area. In latter years, only the last 200 
years really apply.
<P>
<B>(1740 )</B>
<P>
	We are talking about the Spaniards who travelled here in 1774. 
We are talking, after that, of British sailors, Captain Cook and 
George Vancouver. We are talking about enterprises such as the 
Hudson's Bay Company with its fur trade. We are talking about 
explorers who came here as recently as 1793 such as Alexander 
Mackenzie, who went overland through the mountains to reach the 
west coast. All of these things are part of the make-up of British 
Columbia.
<P>
	There was the gold rush of 1857. Prior to that there was the 
American influence. They said they would claim land to 54<I>40. 
They had the campaign slogan ``54</I>40 or fight'', which was finally 
settled by the Oregon Treaty.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4890"> 4890 </A></B>
<P>
	All of these things have shaped British Columbia. There is 
inadequate feeling or knowledge of all of the history and 
geography of British Columbia in central Canada.
<P>
	Transportation, when we come down to it, is one of the most 
important things still today. We will get around to Prince George 
and Prince Rupert on this matter.
<P>
	In 1867 people in eastern Canada were joining Confederation. 
Four years later British Columbia finally agreed to join, provided 
there was a railway. It took 15 long, agonizing years for the railway 
to get through. The railways are still important.
<P>
	I heard the Crow arrangement mentioned today. The Crow's Nest 
Pass agreement goes back to 1897. It said that there would be an 
adjustment of rail tariffs to accommodate settler supplies going one 
way and grain the other. That continues to be important. As long 
ago as 1897 we were talking about the Crow. We are still talking 
about it today.
<P>
	Then we come to the Trans-Canada Highway. When was there 
pavement in B.C. which went from east to west? Not until 1962. 
Prior to that those of us who travelled through British Columbia 
had to dip down into the United States if we did not want to go over 
dicey gravel roads.
<P>
	All of that, I suggest, is lost on a lot of the establishment of 
central Canada.
<P>
	Let us move on to talk about the Prince Rupert grain terminal 
within the context of the history and geography which I have laid 
out. In doing so, I would like to pass on congratulations to my 
colleague, the hon. member for Skeena. He has done a lot of work 
not just with respect to the port of Prince Rupert but to all of the 
northern area, integrating the knowledge that is up there and 
making it available to people such as me.
<P>
	The points my colleague has made I would like to make again. I 
acknowledge, at the very least, that the hon. member for Durham 
has visited Prince Rupert and has come away with some good 
points. I was happy to hear him mention them.
<P>
	First, the Prince Rupert grain terminal is one of the most 
efficient terminals in the world, but it is under-utilized. Prince 
Rupert is a day and a half in shipping time closer to the Pacific rim 
markets than is the lower mainland of B.C.
<P>
	Compared with most other terminals in Canada, the Prince 
Rupert terminal turns around its grain cars in a fraction of the time 
it takes other terminals.
<P>
<B>(1745 )</B>
<P>
	When a ship comes into Prince Rupert to take on grain it only 
has to go to one berth whereas other terminals require ships to 
move to different berths, up to four times, before getting their full 
load. There are lower pilotage costs and lower berthing costs; that 
is berthing as  of ships not of babies. Maybe there are lower 
birthing costs of babies in Prince Rupert, I do not know. However, 
business is there to be done. The facilities are there but we are not 
taking sufficient advantage of them.
<P>
	The member mentioned the amount of operating time that this 
port has been under. Before July 14 of this year there were two 
shifts operating in Prince Rupert but from July 14 to September 29 
it was closed down. Just last week it received word that it would 
open up again to two shifts starting today.
<P>
	Maybe the member for Durham, with all of the information that 
he has been able to glean from his visit to Prince Rupert, would be 
able to tell me what has been happening. Why is this? We 
encourage the use of Prince Rupert much more than has been done. 
Why is it suddenly coming back on stream? Will we go to three 
shifts at Prince Rupert to fully utilize the facilities there? I would 
like to know.
<P>
	I would also like to know on the point where the member said: 
``Oh yes, I have been there and I was certainly very helpful to the 
folks around Prince Rupert and Port Edward''. That is great, but did 
the member come down and talk to our minister of agriculture and 
our current minister of transportation? That is the sort of help that 
is needed.
<P>
	I am going to quote from a letter from the Prince Rupert 
Chamber of Commerce addressed to the Minister of Transport and 
the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food. It states: ``The Prince 
Rupert and District Chamber of Commerce is very concerned over 
the current and suggested status of the Prince Rupert grain 
terminal''.
<P>
	This letter is dated September 3. Madam Speaker, you are 
standing?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> It is because 
you are sharing your time and your 10 minutes are done. I will give 
you 30 seconds to close your comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ringma:</B> Madam Speaker, I will try to wind it up. I have not 
been keeping tabs on the time. I thought it was way under 10 
minutes but I have to accept your ruling.
<P>
	The Prince Rupert Chamber of Commerce letter continues: ``We 
urge that your ministry, in conjunction with your colleague, the 
minister of agriculture, appoint a co-ordinator as outlined in the 
enclosed report. We believe minor concessions by each of the 
parties involved could put the terminal back on a firm footing while 
some of the more complex problems facing the grain transportation 
industries are resolved''.
<P>
	All the chamber has had in response to that is an 
acknowledgement-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> Questions or 
comments.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4891"> 4891 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Beryl Gaffney (Nepean, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I want 
to thank the member for Nanaimo-Cowichan for the brief 
geography lesson he gave us on British Columbia. I must admit 
to the member that there were some things that I did not know 
and I appreciate him expounding on the history of British 
Columbia and how it was developed.
<P>
	I was a bit disturbed when he said that we in central Canada, 
which is where I come from, do not understand British 
Columbians. I wonder if the reverse could be said also, that he, as 
the member for Nanaimo-Cowichan, does not understand central 
Canada?
<P>
	I grew up in Prince Edward Island. I must admit that when I 
came to the big province of Ontario to live I did not remember that 
Toronto was the capital of the province of Ontario. I assumed that 
Ottawa was the capital of everything here. I hear from members of 
the Bloc Quebecois that Quebec is very special to them. As 
individuals each province is very special to us wherever we live 
across the country. To say that we do not understand one another 
seems to come right down to the point where we are talking about 
national unity in this country.
<P>
<B>(1750)</B>
<P>
	Why do you think I as an Ontarian do not understand you as a 
British Columbian? I hope I do. I recognize you as a brother from 
B.C. and I hope that you would look on me as a friend from 
Ontario.
<P>
	Do we need to navel gaze quite so much? Can we not recognize 
what happens in other provinces and recognize that we are each 
unique in what we do and where we live? Can we not try to respect 
each other without saying we do not understand you or you do not 
understand us. I would like to hear your comments in relation to 
national unity in this country in that regard.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ringma:</B> Madam Speaker, I am delighted to respond to that 
question.
<P>
	I happen to be from British Columbia but I have lived in 
Manitoba, I have lived in several parts of Ontario, I have lived in 
several places in Quebec, in New Brunswick and other parts of the 
world. I think I have picked up an appreciation of what Canada is 
all about and having travelled continually back and forth I have a 
reasonable appreciation.
<P>
	I have given the history and basic geography lesson by way of 
pointing out that all of this understanding of the mechanics out in 
B.C. are not understood. We get people like Allan Fotheringham 
writing in <I>Maclean's</I>. He does it in a jocular way but he is always 
talking about the lotus eaters or those of us from lotusland. Fine. 
He does it in a jocular way but underlying it is sort of a sense that 
we are different out there. I guess we are different but it is these 
physical and economic circumstances that make us different.
<P>
	To address the member's last question, where I would love to see 
us get together is here in this House and in the committees of the 
House. There should be much less confrontation, much less of the 
old line party politics dictating this is the way you are going to go. 
There should be an open atmosphere, of saying let us discuss things 
toward a solution for all of Canada or for its various regions. 
Perhaps that is what we should work on first. Eradicate some of our 
ignorance of other areas of the country and build on some sort of 
atmosphere where we would dialogue easily and not in a 
confrontational way.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, with 
regard to this motion I am going to concentrate on accountability 
from the government with respect to B.C.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, if you were in business and your partner took 
50 per cent of your income, you would surely want to be able to 
question any actions the partner took which affected that income, 
especially if the partner never did any of the work.
<P>
	Today in Canada the average family is paying close to 50 per 
cent of its income in taxes to various levels of government, so it is 
really not a surprise that the average Canadian wants more input 
into the running of its government. They are not happy with the 
lack of accountability that we see from the partner that takes 50 per 
cent of their income.
<P>
	Mismanagement of the country's affairs by this Liberal 
government affects all of Canada but we are certainly perceived by 
the public and particularly in B.C. to spend a disproportionate time 
focused on the affairs of Quebec, that it really affects everything 
we are doing here because of the political situation. This feeling of 
alienation from the governing processes is especially strongly felt 
in B.C. because of the natural barriers of the Rockies and the time 
zone differences, and because there is hardly any representation on 
the government side from that province.
<P>
	Even the government knows that there is a serious 
communication problem between the federal government and 
British Columbians. That is a quote from a report written about by 
a local commentator in B.C., Barbara Yaffe when she wrote in 
Saturday's newspaper about a report prepared for the 
intergovernmental affairs minister by the MP for Simcoe North, the 
parliamentary secretary to the minister. He had travelled the 
province, asked questions, had meetings with British Columbians. 
According to his report there is a perception in B.C. that the 
national agenda is controlled by separatists and that there is a real 
sense of alienation, that all of the decisions are being made 
elsewhere. British Columbians feel that Ontario and Quebec are 
dominating the agenda. This is a very strong feeling. It is right 
there in a report to the minister by a member of the government 
side.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4892"> 4892 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1755)</B>
<P>
	We saw the reaction of the transport minister in the House this 
morning when I asked him why he would not appear on a local 
radio talk show to answer questions from the public of B.C. about 
his conduct. He insulted the people of B.C. with his answer. He 
espoused the old line party system of: ``Basically they are too 
stupid to understand, so I am not wasting my time going on the 
show''. These ministers are obviously part of the problem. They 
just do not want to hear what we Reform members have been 
telling them in the House for three years.
<P>
	There is another minister who is a big source of irritation in 
B.C., the Minister of Canadian Heritage. My office, as I know are 
the offices of my colleagues, has been receiving a steady flow of 
calls and letters complaining about the minister's free flag 
program. There is nothing in government that is free. The 
minister's giveaway is consuming the entire amount of taxes 
remitted to Ottawa by 1,600 families this year. One thousand, six 
hundred families are paying taxes for that program.
<P>
	I would also like to mention another minister who is a source of 
significant irritation in B.C., the Minister of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development, who like the Prime Minister and the 
Minister of Transport, refuses to make himself accessible to the 
people of B.C. on the most listened to radio station in the province. 
There is no accountability.
<P>
	Let me quote from an editorial by Rafe Mair on the morning of 
January 16 of this year.
<P>
	``Well, Mr. Minister of Indian Affairs, you are not the first to 
come up with this evil ``pied piper'' theory which has me appealing 
to the baser instincts of my stupid, insensitive audience. I heard this 
during the 1992 referendum from John Crosbie and, indeed, Prime 
Minister Mulroney and I have heard it from your colleague, the oh, 
so humble Minister of Transport.
<P>
	``You have betrayed the same rock-headed notions held by all 
Ottawa politicians, Mr. Minister. The public are stupid, ill read, 
unable to think for themselves and easy prey to anyone who can 
talk a good game.
<P>
	``What is wrong with the public, Mr. Minister, or dare I say it, is 
governments which are utterly unable to lay any facts supported by 
any evidence before the public on the excuse that it is all too 
complicated to understand''.
<P>
	He goes on to say: ``The fact is, Mr. Minister, that the courts, that 
is to say the Supreme Court of Canada and the B.C. Court of 
Appeal have said with astonishing clarity that there is no aboriginal 
title in land. There is no aboriginal title to a commercial fishery and 
there is no aboriginal claim to the inherent right to 
self-government. Whatever you may say, sir, that is indeed what 
the cases say.
<P>
	``I have consistently stated that there are aboriginal rights in 
land, rights as opposed to title, Mr. Minister, an important 
distinction. These rights must be honoured and where possible 
restored where they have been impaired or taken away.
<P>
	``Why then do the senior governments constantly say that there 
is an unextinguished aboriginal title to land, that there is an 
aboriginal right to a commercial fishery and an inherent right to 
self-government? If we are going to ignore the law of the land, why 
bother going to court, Mr. Minister? And you can hardly say that 
you are using these court decisions as a guide to your decision 
making, when you are telling the public that they say just exactly 
the opposite to what they actually do say''.
<P>
	The problems that I have illustrated talking about three different 
ministers are really examples that I have chosen to illustrate how 
different the vision of this government is to what the people of B.C. 
feel and want done in their province.
<P>
	We have 98 Indian bands in our province. Land claims are 
tremendously complex negotiations. There have been specific 
court rulings which set guidelines for us to start negotiating. For 
some reason our senior level of government chooses to go on its 
own way ignoring all of the guidelines, ignoring the wishes of the 
people and wanting to give away our province without due 
consideration and discussion with the people of the province.
<P>
<B>(1800)</B>
<P>
	One of the things Mr. Mair said in his commentary on January 16 
I think is worth mentioning here: ``Mr. Minister, I have consistently 
agreed that land presently held by your government should be 
turned over immediately to the tribes and bands occupying those 
lands as reserves. Put your money where your loose lips are, Mr. 
Minister, and transfer your land before you snipe at me for not 
being too quick to give up mine''.
<P>
	There is another minister who creates some irritation in B.C. and 
that is the minister of immigration. There appeared in the <I>North 
Shore News</I> on September 6 the results of a survey taken in the 
ridings of North Vancouver and Capilano-Howe Sound. The 
survey indicates that 85.2 per cent of those surveyed want criminal 
refugees and bogus refugees deported immediately. What does the 
minister do about it? Nothing. We heard the answer which she gave 
in the House today to the question from the member for 
Surrey-White Rock-South Langley. It was a joke. It was no 
answer at all.
<P>
	There are 1,300 people in the Vancouver area under deportation 
order today. It is a disgrace. I have people in my riding who have 
been convicted of passport forgery, bogus refugee claimant; bogus 
refugee claimant with drug trafficking; bogus refugee claimant 
with breaking and entering and sexual assault. I have five criminal 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4893"> 4893 </A></B>
<P>
cases  in my riding under deportation order and I cannot get rid of 
them because the minister will not act.
<P>
	The minister does not listen to the message from B.C. She is 
quite happy. The province of Quebec gets more money per 
immigrant than anywhere else in the country. Here we are in B.C. 
with the biggest problem and getting no attention at all.
<P>
	In winding up, I do need to make one correction to an earlier 
statement I made. I did say that B.C. has 98 Indian bands. It is 
actually 198, so the House can see that the problem is twice as big 
as I portrayed.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I sat here quietly, but after 
listening to the Reform Party members, it is difficult not to stand up 
in this forum to respond and question.
<P>
	What the Reform says is more a reflection on democracy, that 
they have the right to speak, than the substance of what they are 
saying. They are saying that we do not know B.C. The member for 
Nanaimo-Cowichan says that we do not know B.C. I just came 
back from spending four days in British Columbia. I was in his 
riding at a big event at which there were ministers, provincial 
politicians and to which he was invited. He did not even bother 
showing up or sending his regards. That is not ancient history; that 
was Friday.
<P>
	The member for North Vancouver quotes from the paper and 
calls the conduct of a minister a disgrace. He talks about the misuse 
of public funds on flags going for unity which was done above 
board. Everybody knows the way it is done in a democratic forum.
<P>
	I will give him a quote. The Reform Party has an expert called 
Thomas Flanagan. Maybe the member can give us reflection on 
Mr. Flanagan. He wrote last week on misuse of public moneys, that 
the leader of the Reform took tax money and used it to go to 
Hawaii, which he says-this is Reform's expert-breaches their 
democratic constitution.
<P>
<B>(1805 )</B>
<P>
	The member talks about disgrace and how we treat aboriginal 
people. Yet it was a member from the Reform Party who said of 
ethnic minorities that in our society we can send them to the back 
of the shop.
<P>
	I sat here one day and heard Reform members talk about native 
people living in a south seas environment, and they know. This is a 
member who has never been to a reserve but comes here full of the 
whatnot of the Reform Party and says that he knows native people: 
``I know these people. The men sit around and they burn the 
women''.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Irwin:</B> The Reform members laugh but they said that and 
that is a disgrace. If we want to talk about disgraceful conduct, I 
suggest the Reform members  should look in the mirror. They 
should view what they have said on the record in this House over 
the last three years. To me that is the biggest disgrace that the 
taxpayers of this country are paying for.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (North Vancouver):</B> Madam Speaker, I am not going 
to deal with Mr. Flanagan in this reply because Mr. Flanagan is 
from Alberta. I will be pleased to deal with that on a day when we 
talk about Alberta.
<P>
	I would like to concentrate on the issues in B.C. I have never 
heard such a load of rubbish in my life as what has come from the 
minister. I have two Indian reserves in my riding, and the member 
who is in the riding next to mine, the riding of Capilano-Howe 
Sound, also has a reserve.
<P>
	I can see on a daily basis what happens to them. I am the one who 
gets the calls from the Indians on reserve saying that because there 
is no democracy down there they are suppressed by their 
leadership.
<P>
	A lady called me from the reserve. For 30 years she has been 
trying to get a house, but because she is not related to somebody in 
high places she is ignored and she is living in a trailer home. I 
wrote twice to the chief. I phoned the chief three times. I never got 
a letter back, I never got a phone call. Nothing was resolved.
<P>
	In another instance a lady called me. She had received a special 
grant from the province to open a corner store on reserve land on a 
main road in north Vancouver. The chief nixed it because it would 
compete with his sales of cigarettes from his back door.
<P>
	I could go on with a list of infringements on democracy that 
occur.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sue Barnes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Revenue, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I rise to speak on this 
motion concerning a province that I consider one of the 
cornerstones of Canada's future prosperity and economic 
development. I refer of course to British Columbia, a province 
which in the past few years has been a leader in economic growth 
and expansion in the all important area of the Pacific rim.
<P>
	In the Liberal red book there was a commitment to focus on the 
Pacific. Other hon. members today have dealt with various 
accomplishments such as Team Canada missions to Asia which 
have brought home new business deals and jobs for British 
Columbians. Nationally, Canadian businesses announced business 
deals worth $20 billion. These trade missions show how much can 
be accomplished when governments and businesses work together.
<P>
	Revenue Canada has also played a key role in partnership with 
the private sector and other government departments to make 
Vancouver the gateway to Asia and the Pacific. We are proud of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4894"> 4894 </A></B>
<P>
this role because in doing so we are participating not only in the 
creation of jobs and  the enhancement of the economy of British 
Columbia, but for Canada as a whole.
<P>
	We have to talk about Canada as a whole. Let us make no 
mistake about it. The prosperity of one part of the country is 
something in which all parts of our country should rejoice, not 
bellyache, rejoice.
<P>
	In a modern, integrated economy where goods travel across a 
continent in the space of hours and information in a fraction of a 
second, the prosperity and the economic activity of one part of the 
country cannot but help be beneficial to Canada as a whole. That is 
what being a country is all about, not pitting one region against 
another. Whether it is any of our provinces, we are a united country 
and we want to stay that way.
<P>
	Canada is not only an Atlantic nation but a Pacific nation. Across 
this vast ocean which occupies half of the world's surface are some 
of the most interesting and promising trading partners we could 
imagine.
<P>
<B>(1810 )</B>
<P>
	We have Japan, a nation which in the space of a century went 
from being a very closed and medieval society to one of the world's 
leading economic engines. We have countries like China, a nation 
old in years but whose economy has been growing at an incredible 
double digit rate. We have resource rich countries like Australia. 
And let us not forget the growing economies that we have to the 
south, Mexico and countries in western South America, which are 
also Pacific rim countries.
<P>
	What role can Revenue Canada play? What role can our 
government play in such a scenario? The proper role for any 
government in a free enterprise system, which is to facilitate the 
creation of wealth, to regulate only as much as is necessary for the 
common good and to act as the partner of business so that we have 
a strong economy.
<P>
	I will now explain how Revenue Canada has translated this 
philosophy into concrete programs and initiatives, such as the 
accord on our shared border, and programs such as ACROSS, 
CANPASS and a host of other initiatives, all which are beneficial 
across this country, particularly in B.C.
<P>
	Revenue Canada has played the key role in developing a new 
terminal at Vancouver International Airport. This airport is 
strategically placed to become North America's premier gateway 
between Asia-Pacific and the United States. From 1992 to 1996 the 
Vancouver International Airport Authority undertook a $400 
million four-year development program to add a new international 
terminal building.
<P>
	Revenue Canada tripled its customs terminal area. The largest 
one we now have in any province of Canada is in B.C. The 
department added more inspection lines and doubled the baggage 
carousels. It added 30 new customs staff which means it can 
process 40 per cent more  passengers per hour than it did before, all 
in B.C. I might add.
<P>
	Revenue Canada is working to facilitate the flow of more 
tourists, more travellers and more trade through its open skies 
agreement and its shared border accord with the United States. 
Through the smart border concept the department is taking 
advantage of its new agreements with the United States and helping 
to position British Columbia to take advantage of these 
agreements.
<P>
	Revenue Canada is discussing with the Americans a one stop, in 
transit preclearance process at the Vancouver International Airport 
to make travel through Vancouver more attractive and to promote 
Vancouver as Canada's gateway to the growing world of the Pacific 
rim.
<P>
	If British Columbia is strategically located on the Pacific, it is 
also strategically located north of one of the most populated and 
dynamic rapidly growing areas of the United States, namely 
California and the great Pacific northwest. California has become 
America's most populous state, while the states of Washington and 
Oregon are also two of the most rapidly growing areas of our 
neighbour to the south. That is why Revenue Canada's initiatives 
have also been of immense benefit to improving service at the land 
border crossings between British Columbia and the United States.
<P>
	Revenue Canada's initiatives are of importance to B.C. both in 
terms of facilitating the movement of travellers but also in the 
facilitation of the movement of commercial goods.
<P>
	The importance of facilitating the movement of travellers can 
hardly be underestimated. We know that tourism is B.C.'s second 
largest industry, contributing over $4 billion to the provincial 
economy and providing 80,000 jobs. We do not want to harass 
people at the border. We want them into Canada. We will target 
high risk travellers, but we will facilitate low risk travellers to 
Canada. A cornerstone of facilitating the movement of travellers is 
the CANPASS program.
<P>
	This program, which exists in the form of CANPASS airport, 
CANPASS highway, CANPASS private boats and CANPASS 
private aircraft, is designed to streamline customs and immigration 
clearance of low risk travellers at select border crossings. I am 
proud to inform members that all these forms of CANPASS, except 
for the initiative relating to private aircraft, were initiated and pilot 
tested in British Columbia.
<P>
	The precise operation of CANPASS varies from one part of the 
program to the other. For example, at an airport, a traveller uses a 
smart card and a hand print to identify themselves at a machine that 
is very similar to an automated bank teller machine. At highway 
crossings CANPASS participants are identified through a decal on 
their windshields. Other procedures are used in the case of private 
boats and private aircraft, but whatever type of  CANPASS is used 
the principle remains the same. The vast majority of travellers can 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4895"> 4895 </A></B>
<P>
be trusted to self-declare, making their travel easier and freeing up 
our valuable resources for concentration on high risk areas.
<P>
<B>(1815)</B>
<P>
	CANPASS is a refinement and an enhancement of an earlier 
customs clearance program known as the Peace Arch crossing 
entry program, called PACE, which was successfully piloted at the 
customs border point at Douglas, British Columbia. Now under the 
name CANPASS Highway, this program is available at Douglas, 
Boundary Bay, Pacific Highway and Huntingdon.
<P>
	Concentration on high risk areas and preventing the illegal 
importation of drugs, weapons and other contraband is indeed 
important for all Canadians, but especially for British Columbians. 
We all know that along with the increase in population and 
prosperity urban areas of British Columbia are suffering hard times 
because of the social plague of illegal drugs, a plague which affects 
all Canadians. It is hard to over estimate the individual suffering 
and cost to society of drug addiction which certainly exists in all 
parts of Canada but which has been particularly acute in areas of 
western Canada.
<P>
	That is why Revenue Canada is proud of new contraband 
technology which has been installed at Pacific region border 
services at airports and land crossings. In this connection I would 
mention the vivid x-ray unit which was installed at Vancouver 
international airport in 1994. This equipment has the unique 
capability of specifically targeting organic materials, various types 
of drugs and explosives.
<P>
	There are also the ion mobility spectrometer units which detect 
minute particle residues of cocaine and heroin on surfaces of 
documents, currency, boxes, luggage and clothing. This equipment 
has been installed at the Pacific Highway border crossing and at the 
Vancouver marine terminal.
<P>
	These are but two technological advances that also include 
contraband detection kits and narrow beam laser range finders that 
help to detect the presence of false walls in marine or truck 
containers without the requirement of unloading the contents.
<P>
	These are important measures which Canadians now have at 
their disposal for the protection of our economy and the protection 
of Canadian citizens.
<P>
	In addition to making things easier for travellers, on the 
commercial side Revenue Canada has initiated the ACROSS 
system countrywide to speed up the release of commercial goods. 
The department has taken part in designating an international 
commercial centre in Vancouver. This is a bonded warehouse 
where value added operations are permitted by Revenue Canada to 
level the playing field for small and medium size companies.
<P>
	Border protection and facilitation is not the only area in which 
Revenue Canada has been working to better serve British 
Columbians. Another important initiative, designed to facilitate 
and simplify our dealings with business, is the business number, 
which the department has piloted and introduced on behalf of the 
federal government. The business number is designed to replace 
the multiple account numbers which businesses have needed to 
deal with the federal government. British Columbia has expressed 
an interest in using the business number for provincial business 
programs.
<P>
	On April 18, 1996 British Columbia began a one year pilot of six 
one-stop business registration work stations. This allows 
businesses to register for a series of federal and provincial 
programs by visiting one office and using the self-help work 
stations to complete the forms necessary for their programs, both 
federal and provincial.
<P>
	Another way Revenue Canada has been able to benefit British 
Columbia has been by administering the British Columbia family 
bonus program, something which is very important to the families 
of British Columbia.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (North Vancouver):</B> Madam Speaker, I rise on a 
point of order. It seems to me that perhaps the member's time is up, 
since we are on the shorter time for the government side now.
<P>
<B>(1820 )</B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> This is not a 
point of order. The hon. member has 20 minutes and 10 minutes of 
questions. The hon. member may continue.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Barnes:</B> If I may, I will continue with my 20 minute 
speech.
<P>
	I was talking about the British Columbia family bonus program 
in which Revenue Canada is applying the programs on behalf of the 
provincial government. This program is entirely funded by the 
province of British Columbia but is being administered on a full 
cost recovery basis by Revenue Canada using information that the 
department maintains for the child tax benefit program as well as 
information from personal tax returns.
<P>
	The Revenue Canada tax centre at Surrey, British Columbia has 
been equipped and is ready to respond to inquiries generated by this 
program. This example of co-operation, a word I think we all need 
to understand, reminds us that while we may have provinces and a 
federal government with different agendas and different programs, 
there is only one taxpayer who must pay for these programs, who 
expects to be served by them and served by them well and also by 
their representatives.
<P>
	Any form of co-operation that decreases costs and improves 
services is welcome. I am sure all members of this House can at 
least agree on this point.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="4896"> 4896 </A></B>
<P>
	What is the future? Revenue Canada has accomplished a great 
deal through its partnerships with businesses and the provinces and 
a lot more can be done. For example, the new national revenue 
agency, which was supported by the western premiers during their 
June 1996 conference, is something we can talk about. The B.C. 
government has expressed support for the federal government's 
desire to reduce overlap, duplication and compliance costs for 
businesses and to increase efficiency in revenue collection.
<P>
	As I said earlier, the prosperity of one part of the country is of 
benefit to all of us. Revenue Canada is proud to be a partner in the 
development of British Columbia with programs that facilitate its 
economic development.
<P>
	In the last century Canada built its industrial base mainly in 
connection with the Atlantic world, the industrialized countries of 
Europe and the United States. Now the Pacific world is rapidly 
being added to the equation. This is a challenge of the future and it 
has to be faced not only by Revenue Canada but by every 
department of government, by the federal and provincial 
governments and by Canadians from coast to coast. I am sure that 
those parties representing the province of B.C. will be there to help 
us in developing these programs that are good not only for British 
Columbians but for all Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
was particularly interested in the member's comments in reference 
to the wonderful job she claims the government and especially the 
department of revenue is doing on checking the smuggling problem 
in this country.
<P>
	I have to be in Vancouver a lot. I have talked to many police 
officers and many agencies along the border of British Columbia 
and they have a major problem. In fact, the problem is so great 
when it comes to drugs that it is now filtering into the rest of the 
country.
<P>
	The government's answer to the problem of drugs in B.C. is to 
disband one of the more dedicated police departments in the 
region, the ports police. The ports police have made it clear that 
there is a serious problem with organized crime and that 40 bikers 
and associates have been engaged in criminal activity on the 
waterfronts. Most of that activity is of course in drugs. It was the 
ports police who identified that group of people.
<P>
	There have been somewhere in the neighbourhood of $3 million 
in drug seizures over the last several months and the problem 
grows. The problem is so great that many people are dying from 
drug overdoses. In 1989 there were 67 people who died from heroin 
and cocaine overdoses. In 1990 it was 82, in 1991 it was 124, in 
1992 it was 154, in 1993 it was 358, in 1994 it was 311 people. That 
is a total of 1,100 people in a very short period of time.
<P>
<B>(1825)</B>
<P>
	The Liberal government's answer to that problem is to cut back 
on enforcement at the borders and at the ports. I would like to 
inform the government because it does not seem to want to listen to 
the police agencies in this country, and so we will say it here in the 
House. Crime results from drug abuse and abusers. Heroin addicts 
and cocaine addicts commit more crime than anyone else because 
that is how they feed their habit.
<P>
	Now the problem is coming through the port of Vancouver and it 
is growing to such a degree that heroin addicts and cocaine addicts 
are being developed right inside our prisons because of the free 
access to that particular drug. It is coming through the port of 
Vancouver. As a matter of fact, the port of Vancouver is the central 
point of distribution for heroin in all of North America.
<P>
	What does the Liberal government say? It says: ``Cut back on 
enforcement, let us not do anymore enforcement in that region, the 
matter is not a problem''. It is a major social problem in the 
province of B.C. What does the government do again? It cuts back 
on the numbers, it keeps decreasing them until what?
<P>
	I would like to know what the Liberal member who spoke prior 
to me thinks of the CLEU report that clearly indicates what hacking 
away at enforcement agencies on our waterfront will do to the 
country. What is it going to do as far as organized crime is 
concerned? What is the hon. member's answer to the problem of 
enforcement in criminal activity, organized crime, if you are going 
to pull the port's police?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Barnes:</B> Madam Speaker, I am very pleased that we have 
some eyes open from our member across the way here and he 
agrees that there is a drug and smuggling problem in British 
Columbia. That is why Revenue Canada has the responsibility for 
customs. It is a responsibility that we take very seriously.
<P>
	I must tell the member about organized crime. They do not 
exactly open their books to Revenue Canada and that is why it is 
very necessary that we have intelligence. The intelligence that we 
have is not only from our own resources within customs Canada 
but between our border crossings, between those different points 
where Canadians, Americans and other world travellers enter and 
depart our city.
<P>
	We have the RCMP under the responsibility of the Solicitor 
General of Canada. We work very closely in Revenue Canada 
through our customs agents and customs department in making 
sure that we have the best intelligence. We co-operate not only with 
the RCMP but police forces across this country. We make sure we 
are getting the use of and putting our resources into the highest and 
best technology available. We are putting in extra money, not 
decreasing. We have added 30 customs officers, for instance, in the 
Vancouver airport alone.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="4897"> 4897 </A></B>
<P>
	We are also involved specifically with drugs and I have been 
with RCMP members when they have brought the drug dogs 
along. We use dogs not only in our airports but in our vessels and 
we use them because they are an effective method. We are going 
to continue to train our personnel because we think it is important.
<P>
	Last year the minister of revenue was in Halifax where there was 
a new marine facility established so we could better train our 
officers in search. These are very important issues. They should not 
be taken lightly. They are important issues to Canadians to make 
sure that when we target our high risk we put the appropriate 
resources in the right places and with the right magnitude. This is 
not something we are going to announce here in the Chamber that 
we are going to be somewhere tomorrow because it does not work 
that way with organized crime. Drug smugglers do not send us a 
telegram saying they are going to bring their shipments across.
<P>
	Unfortunately the other side fails to understand this. There is not 
only intelligence needed in this House on the other side, we also 
need it to do our job effectively and properly. We will continue to 
do so despite what the other side says.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
have a short question for the member.
<P>
	I listened to her saying what a wonderful job Revenue Canada 
had done but she did not mention the high taxes of Revenue 
Canada. I would like to ask her a question.
<P>
	It is estimated that about 40,000 jobs have moved across the 
border from Vancouver to Bellingham, which is in the United 
States for those who do not know anything about B.C. Forty 
thousand jobs have been forced across the border. Canadians own 
companies in Bellingham because of the high taxes in B.C.
<P>
	Is the member quite happy to take the credit for that as well?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> The hon. 
parliamentary secretary has one minute left.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Barnes:</B> Madam Speaker, unfortunately with only one 
minute I have to advise the hon. member opposite that tax policy is 
done by finance. Revenue Canada is the administrative arm and we 
do our job well. We make sure that taxes are collected in a fair and 
equitable way across the country.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> It being 6.30 
p.m., it is my duty to inform the House that proceedings on the 
motion have expired.
<P>
	Therefore, the House stands adjourned until 10 a.m. tomorrow, 
pursuant to Standing Order 24 (1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 6.30 p.m.)
