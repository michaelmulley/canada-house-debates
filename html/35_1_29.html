	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board 
and Minister responsible for Infrastructure):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
today I present the 1994-95 main estimates for the Government 
of Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I have the honour to table the first Estimates of this 35th 
Parliament, which contain the government's expenditure plans, 
department by department, program by program, for the next 
fiscal year.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I take pride that these estimates reflect the commitments we 
made to Canadians in the election last fall. They reveal a 
balanced approach in which the government supports growth 
and creates jobs while taking steps to reduce the deficit.
<P>
	The main estimates set out the details of $160.7 billion in 
planned expenditure in the next fiscal year. This includes the 
$112.1 billion in statutory expenditure that flows from 
legislation that Parliament has previously approved and $48.6 
billion in expenditures for which we are seeking parliamentary 
authority at this time.
<P>
<B>(1010 ) </B>
<P>
	The main estimates are the first step in carrying out the 
expenditure plan amounting to $163.6 billion set out in the 
budget of two days ago delivered by my colleague, the Minister 
of Finance.
<P>
	However, unlike the budget, the main estimates do not include 
reserves and they do not anticipate the impact of proposed 
legislation. In other words, if legislation has not yet been passed 
then the dollar figures would not be in the main estimates.
<P>
	The main reason total spending is up is the increase in public 
debt charges. Program spending, which is our total spending less 
public debt charges, is virtually flat, increasing by only 0.7 per 
cent. Spending on most programs is down.
<P>
	Old age security and aboriginal programs account for a large 
part of the increase in program spending. That is because of an 
increase in the population in those two categories which are 
drawing on the programs.
<P>
	As the Minister of Finance made clear two days ago, this is a 
budget that sets in motion the most comprehensive reform of 
government spending policy in a decade. The budget tabled on 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1758"> 1758 </A></B>
<P>
Tuesday and the main estimates that I table today provide a 
framework for the future delivered by a government for the 
future.
<P>
	One of the clear policy planks of this government is that we 
are going to do what must be done and we are going to do it in a 
fiscally responsible way.
<P>
	In the main estimates we have set a course of action for each 
component of the agenda in ``Creating Opportunity'', better 
known as the red book. Canadians have told us that job creation 
is a high priority and in the red book we have said that a national 
infrastructure program would be a key element in job creation.
<P>
	Since we have come to office, I am proud to say that we have 
made this a reality by signing agreements in every province 
across this country. In the main estimates we are asking 
Parliament to appropriate more than $700 million in the coming 
fiscal year for the implementation of this program.
<P>
	Also in the red book we said we would impose further cuts in 
operating budgets by some $400 million in 1994-95, increasing 
to $620 million in the following two years. The main estimates 
reflect the commitment. We hope that we can generate a lot of 
these savings through efficiency gains, but we realize that it may 
also require having to set priorities.
<P>
	Of the $400 million just mentioned, the largest part will come 
from savings on professional services. These are services that 
we contract for. We will shortly be asking Parliament to look at 
this whole area of contracting out.
<P>
	However, this was not enough. Solving our fiscal problem 
required taking more restraint measures in the operating 
budgets. We looked at different options available to us. We 
looked at what other governments and the private sector were 
doing. We consulted with our public service unions in this 
process. In the end we did what we believe is best for Canadians, 
best for public service employees and for the economy.
<P>
	As the Minister of Finance stated in the budget, we extended 
the freeze on the federal public service for a further two years 
and we suspended annual increments for two years beginning in 
1994-95. We also provided for the opportunity, working with 
our employees and working with their bargaining agents, to be 
able to shorten that period of time by finding other efficiencies 
in government spending so that we could in fact end that freeze 
at an earlier time.
<P>
	We believe that under the circumstances this was the best 
course to follow. It allows us to better protect jobs while 
minimizing the impact of our ability to deliver quality services 
to Canadians at the lowest possible cost.
<P>
	The reduction in the defence budget reflects reality. We had a 
defence structure that reflected the priorities of the past. The 
world order was changing and we had to adapt. The result will be 
an armed forces that will meet our future needs.
<P>
	Reductions in our international assistance funding is a 
statement of our fiscal capacity rather than a reflection of what 
really is the need. We will nonetheless continue to spend $2.6 
billion on international assistance as is shown in the main 
estimates.
<P>
<B>(1015) </B>
<P>
	Canadians told us that grants to business were not getting the 
best value for the tax dollar. We made it clear in the red book we 
would cut grants that were not of value in helping small and 
medium sized business and we have done that.
<P>
	Canadians were vocal in expressing their desire to reform the 
unemployment insurance program because it was more than 
taxpayers could afford. The payroll tax required to pay the 
benefits was putting us in an uncompetitive position vis-à-vis 
our trading partners. We had to take action and we have.
<P>
	In the main estimates 16 per cent of the total spending is in 
payments to other levels of government and 25 per cent is in 
payments to persons such as the old age security and 
unemployment insurance. The government will spend about $62 
billion on social programs and $4.8 billion on natural resource 
based programs, $3.9 billion on industrial, regional and 
scientific programs, $2.8 billion on transportation programs, 
about $3 billion will go to cultural and heritage programs, $3.3 
billion for justice and legal programs, and $6.4 billion for 
general government operations.
<P>
	My colleague the Minister of Finance made it clear in his 
speech this is only the beginning of reform. He announced that 
over the next year we would make service delivery more 
efficient and effective and we will do that.
<P>
	As a result of the course set out in the budget, program 
expenditures will decline in real terms between now and 
1995-96. Even now, as I said earlier in my remarks, 
expenditures are virtually flat with last year.
<P>
	Our annual deficit is on a downward curve, a very important 
downward curve, and we have set our sights on the fiscal 
objective of a deficit which amounts to no more than 3 per cent 
of all the goods and services we produce in Canada in a given 
year.
<P>
	This is the true sign of a government that listens to the 
electorate, shows leadership, takes decisive action, consults its 
partners, and sets a clear vision for the future of each and every 
Canadian.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Richard Bélisle (La Prairie):</B> Madam Speaker, what 
strikes me upon reading the 1994-95 Estimates tabled by the 
Minister responsible for Treasury Board is that, compared with 
the 1993-94 budget, there is a 0.5 per cent reduction in transfer 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1759"> 1759 </A></B>
<P>
payments and a 3.2 per cent reduction in other program 
spending, while at the same time the cost of servicing the debt 
has gone up 3 per cent. This means that budget cuts are being 
made to  accommodate an increase in the cost of servicing the 
debt.
<P>
	The government's policy in the years to come will be to cut 
transfers to individuals and transfer payments to the provinces. 
However, as we postpone these cuts, the debt increases 
accordingly, as shown in the budget, which means even larger 
cuts will be necessary in the future, always to accommodate the 
cost of servicing a debt that will soon be out of control. We are 
fast approaching the breaking point.
<P>
	As the debt increases and transfers to individuals are cut back, 
the gap between rich and poor widens. The gap between the 
various levels of our society has never been greater, and is 
getting wider. Ironically, the cumulative debt of the past 20 
years was the result of a desire to redistribute wealth across the 
country.
<P>
	When servicing the debt means transferring tens of billions of 
dollars from taxpayers to investors, this will create even greater 
gaps between the rich, the middle class and the neediest in our 
society. Is this the failure of the Canadian model of a just 
society, an echo from another era?
<P>
	Total budget expenditures are forecast at $163.6 billion, an 
increase of 2.1 per cent. We are told that more than 75 per cent of 
this increase, or 1.6 per cent, is due to the cost of servicing the 
public debt. The impact of the debt on the estimates will get 
worse over time because the government's spending cuts are not 
enough, as was illustrated by the minister's speech this morning.
<P>
<B>(1020) </B>
<P>
	The cost of servicing the public debt is $41 billion, compared 
with $38.5 billion last year. Program spending is estimated at 
$122.6 billion, compared with $121.8 billion last year, a 
difference of only 0.7 per cent, while debt charges are 6.5 per 
cent higher than last year.
<P>
	This year, cuts in operating costs-departmental 
budgets-amount to $413 million, out of a total $2.1 billion in 
cutbacks. My point is that departmental budget cuts represent 
only 19 per cent of the total reduction in operating costs. The 
$725 million cut in unemployment insurance, however, 
represents 33 per cent of total reductions. Reductions in 
business transfers add up to $117 million or 5.3 per cent of total 
cuts. I think it is clear where this government's priorities are. It 
uses the unemployed to get the cuts it cannot make in its own 
operations.
<P>
	Cuts in the departments represent less than 2 per cent of the 
government's operating costs, of which a substantial 19 per cent 
is generated by defence. There was no disciplined item by item 
assessment by the government, as the Bloc Quebecois had 
requested.
<P>
	However, there is still fat and waste in government 
operations. The Auditor General estimates that if the 
government stopped the waste, the potential savings would 
amount to several billion annually. A reduction of $400 million 
in operating costs, less than 2 per cent, is certainly not enough 
when the cost of debt servicing increases by $2.5 billion during 
the same period.
<P>
	The government has failed to make the necessary reductions 
in spending. Only a reduction in expenditures achieved by 
eliminating waste and poor management procedures will in the 
long run reduce the tax burden on the middle class that has 
caused the underground economy to flourish, as we have seen 
repeatedly during the past few months.
<P>
	Although so-called spending cuts were announced with a 
great deal of publicity, government program spending will 
increase again this year, by another $800 million. This amount 
corresponds to statutory programs such as equalization.
<P>
	Instead of coming down hard on the unemployed and senior 
citizens, whose age credit has been cut, the government should 
have acted immediately to streamline government operations by 
getting rid of the duplication and overlap that costs the 
government between $2 and $3 billion annually. This is nearly 
eight times the cuts made in this government's budget plan.
<P>
	Second, the government should make further reductions in 
defence spending. A 12 per cent cut is planned over five years, 
while the Bloc Quebec asked for a 25-per cent cut. The Collège 
militaire royal in Saint-Jean should not be closed until Quebec 
has received its share of national defence spending, on a per 
capita basis. This closing does not make sense, especially since 
the college had just been renovated at a cost of several million 
dollars.
<P>
	In concluding, I would like to add that the government should 
have made further spending cuts and invested half of this 
spending room in job creation and the other half in reducing the 
debt. Most analysts agree that the infrastructure program does 
not do enough because it creates only 45,000 temporary jobs and 
is, in the final analysis, the employment recovery program the 
government announced with so much fanfare.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
appreciate the opportunity to speak to the resolution before us 
and certainly in recognition of the tabling of the estimates. As 
we examine the presentation today and the budget which was 
given to us on February 22, we have some very major concerns. 
They are concerns that reflect the attitudes of Canadians.
<P>
	The first concern is that the debt of the country is going to be 
our downfall and we must recognize that. The second concern is 
that along with the debt is the annual debt or the deficit which 
continues to hang over our heads, not only as taxpayers but 
members of Parliament. We have to deal with it. It is very basic. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1760"> 1760 </A></B>
<P>
We cannot afford  in the next three years to accumulate $100 
billion more of debt.
<P>
<B>(1025) </B>
<P>
	The estimates of 1994-95 start that process. They place 
before us $39.7 billion as the deficit. That is the best the 
government could do in its budgeting process. It could not do 
any better and it is not good enough. We have to sit here as 
parliamentarians and face that.
<P>
	The government tried to tell us it has a plan to cut in the 
future. It is going to use studies to bring about the cuts. From my 
experience any time a group of legislators and private citizens 
work together, any recommendations that come back to the 
assembly usually demand more money.
<P>
	I do not think any terms of reference went to those 
committees, particularly terms of reference with regard to social 
programs. The Minister of Human Resources Development said 
he would like to see the cost of social programs reduced but that 
those programs be targeted. I did not hear that in the terms of 
reference. Those should have been the initial terms of reference 
for those kinds of programs. That was not there.
<P>
	The government is continuing a pattern of spending more. All 
of the deficit reduction in this budget, the amount of money 
applied to the deficit, comes from revenue growth. None of it 
comes from substantial, deliberate, priorized reductions of 
spending across government.
<P>
	Nothing in these estimates presented to us today really deals 
with the fat of government, the overlap of government, the 
inefficiency of government, the bloating of government that 
occurred between 1975 and 1982. There is nothing in these 
estimates that represents significant changes from the trends of 
that period of time. The government is continuing the way it is.
<P>
	I would like to say something with regard to the reductions. 
First, the government claims that it has made some major 
reductions and will make major reductions in expenditures over 
the next three years. The projections are $11 billion.
<P>
	In the estimates before us the reduction is $3.7 billion. If one 
examines the budget book that was presented to us on February 
22, 25 per cent of the reductions came from Tory policies, not 
from Liberal initiatives. That is the first item. Therefore how 
can the government take much credit for the reductions in the 
estimate expenditures?
<P>
	Second, let us talk about the estimates for 1994-95. The 
reductions are $3.7 billion which is not much in a major budget 
of some $163 billion. New initiatives is $2.2 billion which 
leaves us $1.5 billion to apply to the deficit. That still leaves us 
with $39.7 billion. That is not much. Why did the government 
not look at the reductions and say it should apply all of the $3.7 
billion to the deficit and do something with a little more 
significance?
<P>
	Many of the funds were reallocated internally without 
consulting Parliament. We as parliamentarians should be able to 
ask the questions. For example, when certain programs are 
being cut, what is being cut out? After a program has been 
reallocated we should be able to ask the cost of the new priority, 
is it necessary, where will the money come from and can we do it 
for less. We really did not get a chance to do all of that in the 
process. We will possibly have that opportunity in the estimates.
<P>
<B>(1030) </B>
<P>
	I have a last point to the government in the time I have left. I 
hope that the government will really make a serious 
commitment, in the words spoken by the Minister of Finance 
yesterday, so committees will be able to review these matters, 
make recommendations and that the government will listen to 
those recommendations and implement them. I hope during this 
35th Parliament that will be a major change. If government is 
that open and able to allow that, we will have a tremendous 
Parliament and one that is really democratic.
<P>
	I recommend to the government not to become political and 
terminate that process through which a committee recommends 
decisions that are a little difficult to initiate. Committee reports 
and recommendations are number one to an effective process of 
dealing with the estimates.

is my duty and honour to rise and present a petition duly 
certified by the Clerk of Petitions from over 400 concerned 
citizens in the beautiful Chilliwack River valley of my 
constituency of Fraser Valley East.
<P>
	The petition states that incidents of flooding, related 
problems with roads, utility lines and residential homes and 
businesses are becoming more and more frequent since the 
disastrous floods of 1989 and 1990. Each such incident threatens 
public safety, devalues property and hinders the ability of 
residents to obtain mortgages and home insurance.

	As a result the petitioners humbly pray and call upon 
Parliament to implement the Chilliwack River valley hazard 
management plan through the Government of Canada's 
infrastructure program.

	The House resumed from February 23 consideration of the 
motion that this House approves in general the budgetary policy 
of the government; the amendment; and the amendment to the 
amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands):</B> Madam Speaker, 
subsequent Reform Party speakers will be splitting their time, to 
10 minutes and five minutes for questions and comments.
<P>
	This morning I would like to address the budget from the 
point of view of the defence department and first of all to 
congratulate the government on some good measures it has 
taken. I have noted it is looking at reducing the rank structure in 
the Canadian forces and thinning out the level of middle 
management. Both these items are long overdue and will 
provide more people at the pointed end and fewer in the 
administrative support tail.
<P>
	It is looking to amend its management practices, to delegate 
and lower the responsibility level to base commanders and other 
unit commanders, to do away with bureaucracy. This will make 
the process much more efficient and more cost effective.
<P>
	It is looking at off the shelf purchases. For far too long 
Canadians have tended to put in special frills and things that 
required additional engineering which wound up costing more 
and taking much longer to implement. I think the off the shelf 
purchases are a very good idea.
<P>
	We are looking at contracting out some of the things that 
Canadian forces personnel currently do. This as well is a step in 
the right direction.
<P>
<B>(1040 ) </B>
<P>
	I understand from the defence document that we are going to 
look at contracting out flight training at Moose Jaw. I know this 
has worked very well at Portage la Prairie in basic training and I 
must admit I have some personal misgivings about putting the 
training of our air crews into other than military hands. 
However, certainly it has worked at Portage la Prairie and we 
should definitely investigate it at Moose Jaw.
<P>
	I also note that group headquarters has been combined for 
efficiency and moved air combat, which used to be fighter group 
headquarters, from North Bay to Trenton. The same will be done 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1763"> 1763 </A></B>
<P>
with 10 tactical air group headquarters from St. Hubert to 
combine with air  transport group at Trenton. Again, this is a 
refining and efficiency measure which will pay dividends.
<P>
	The government also mentioned some infrastructure 
reductions, some $850 million over five years by the 1997-98 
timeframe. By that time savings will be $350 million a year. I 
will be speaking to this from the other point of view in a few 
moments. However, I think all people who have looked at the 
defence department have been aware that there has been an 
overabundance of infrastructure in that force and it was time to 
reduce it.
<P>
	However, I do think that defence has become an easy target. 
All parties in the last election, with the exception of the Reform 
Party, were aiming very strongly at large cuts in defence. I think 
this may be premature and that people do not appreciate the 
current state of the defence force.
<P>
	Basically it has been underfunded since 1972 when Mr. 
Trudeau made dramatic cuts. He was reminded of the 
inter-relationship between defence and trade when he tried to 
make the cuts in NATO and very shortly found out that it would 
impact dramatically on Canadian trade. He reversed his decision 
on the cuts he was proposing.
<P>
	The world situation has changed, without question. The 
relationship between the two superpowers has evaporated. 
However, rather than providing us with a more stable world, this 
has provided a much more volatile world, one which is must less 
predictable and, I would say, more dangerous.
<P>
	Currently Canada has more troops deployed on operational 
missions than at any time since the Korean war. The current 
strength of the Canadian forces is 75,000 in round numbers. The 
government is suggesting that this should be reduced to 67,000 
in round numbers by 1998. I question the wisdom of these cuts, 
particularly before we have completed a defence review to 
establish what we want the Canadian forces to accomplish.
<P>
	I am not certain at the moment that 75,000 is a sufficient 
number to do the jobs Canadians will be asking their forces to 
do. I believe it really is premature to suggest that we should be 
cutting this number even further.
<P>
	I am glad to see the reserve force staying constant at 30,000, 
although I believe there may be some need to expand its uses if 
we go to the total force concept and it is found to be workable.
<P>
	Regarding budget cuts, over the period from 1989-97 the 
previous government had programmed in $14 billion in defence 
budget reductions. This government has now implemented an 
additional $7 billion deduction in the defence budget between 
1994 and 1999. This is a total of $21 billion over 10 years, a 
substantial reduction in a budget of only $12 billion. This again 
has been done before we know what we are going to be asking 
the defence forces to do. I think this is premature.
<P>
	These defence cuts have reduced the operations and 
maintenance budget so that operational and training activities 
have had to be reduced by 25 per cent. In plain words, this means 
that the navy has and will continue to sail less. The air force has 
and will continue to fly less and the army has and will continue 
to train less. This means less well trained and less capable 
sailors, soldiers and airmen, and that means a reduced 
operational capability. There is no question that the training 
required by the forces increases its ability to do the job we ask it 
to do. Reducing its training reduces its operational capability.
<P>
	The government has said that one half of the $7 billion 
reduction over the five years in the defence budget will come 
from the cancellation of the EH-101 helicopter project. I remind 
hon. members that the EH-101 was a 13-year program 
extending to the year 2002 with the heaviest spending occurring 
in the years 1998 and 1999. The $5.8 billion to which the 
government is referring is based on 2002 dollars rather than the 
original cost for the EH-101 which in 1991-92 dollars was $4.3 
billion. I suspect its number is not accurate, its $3.5 billion 
saving.
<P>
<B>(1045) </B>
<P>
	Also missing from the figures totally is the cost of the 
cancellation of the EH-101 program, payments to contractors 
who had already invested substantial sums in the program. This 
is estimated to be anywhere between $500 million but more 
likely close to $1 billion. This appears nowhere in the budget.
<P>
	The Minister of National Defence said yesterday that this 
would not be coming from the defence budget, but if it is going 
to be paid it is paid out of our own budget. Since it is not 
identified that means it is in addition to the $39.7 billion the 
government has already estimated.
<P>
	In addition, the minister points out on page 2 of the budget 
impact document:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Department will still have to find the money for replacement helicopters 
should the requirement be confirmed in the defence policy review.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said also, and I agree with him, that the likelihood was that 
the need for these helicopters would be confirmed in that 
defence review.
<P>
	Depending on the helicopters that are chosen to be bought, we 
can spend as much or even exceed the cost of the original 
EH-101 program. The Canadian environment provides an 
atmosphere that is perhaps among the most challenging for 
flying operations the world knows.
<P>
	Canada is a beautiful country. It is one I have chosen over a 
many other countries, having visited them. It has many 
advantages but we have long and rather severe winters. When we 
have winter weather we have icing conditions. When we have 
icing 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1764"> 1764 </A></B>
<P>
conditions we have problems for flying machines, particularly 
helicopters.
<P>
	Whatever airplane we buy it should have the ability to fly in 
icing conditions. I point out that when the Ocean Ranger went 
down off the coast of Newfoundland it took 36 human lives with 
it. Both the Sea King and Labrador helicopters were grounded in 
Halifax at that time. They were unable to fly because of a 
combination of icing conditions and fog.
<P>
	The EH-101 helicopter could have operated in those 
conditions and may very well have saved those lives on the 
Ocean Ranger. Any helicopter we buy to operate in Canada 
whether it be from ships or in search and rescue should be able to 
have the range, the speed, the capacity and the ability to fly in 
icing conditions.
<P>
	Let me move on to another cost saving measure, the reduction 
of infrastructure. The government has announced that it will 
close four bases: the base at Cornwallis, the base at Chatham, 
the base at Ottawa, and the base at Toronto. A total of $185 
million is identified in the defence document as the cost of those 
closures. I do not think they are going to include termination 
training, allowances for civilians or transfer costs for military 
personnel.
<P>
	The gift of the station at Downsview to the city of Toronto as a 
gift in perpetuity, a park, is a super thing. Is my time up, Madam 
Speaker?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> The member's time has 
expired. Could he conclude please.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Frazer:</B> Basically there are some good things in the 
budget, but there are many things which are incomplete and 
have not been thought through. Budget day in 1994 was not only 
a disappointing day for Canada; it was not a good day for 
Canada's defence force.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Richardson (Perth-Wellington-Waterloo):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I listened with great interest to the hon. 
member for Saanich-Gulf Islands. He made some very good 
points in his speech.
<P>
	I know from his experience the infrastructure was like an 
albatross around the neck of the forces in terms of budgets for 
the past 10 to 12 years. The move was seen by all professional 
officers as an excellent one, as a way to free up money for the 
needed things he mentioned in his speech. The government 
should be applauded for taking the stand to depoliticize the 
nature of bases. I certainly go along with that.
<P>
<B>(1050) </B>
<P>
	I agree with him that we should not be tailoring the future of 
the forces based on the budget. A lot of thought has to go into 
that matter. I hope the committee that is put together will come 
up with a forward thinking program and task the armed forces 
appropriately. I look forward to working with him on that future 
project.
<P>
	There are other points I would like to make. The British 
announced today a very serious cut in defence expenditures. As 
the member just noted, they have gone to a ratio of total force. 
They call it a one army concept, a one navy and one air force 
concept. Here we call it total force. They are putting more 
resources into upgrading the quality of the reserves as a method 
of rapid expansion in case of need.
<P>
	As the member appropriately indicated, we may probably 
have to look at it in the future as a way to bring the people of 
Canada into the armed forces by having the reserve component 
enlarged and increased in competence to take on the roles they 
do in the German air force, the American air force and the 
reserve programs, as well as in the army and navy components.
<P>
	Overall he made some very good points. I want to make clear 
that the cut in infrastructure was applauded throughout the 
forces because it was a drain on both financial and human 
resources. It will release that hopefully for the future growth of 
the forces.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Frazer:</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to address the 
problem of infrastructure. I agree with the hon. member that 
obviously there was a military hand in the cuts that were made. 
These were not done for political reasons. I appreciate that. I 
think it is a step in the right direction.
<P>
	I would question the wisdom of closing either of the two 
defence colleges, Collège militaire royal in Saint-Jean or Royal 
Roads Military College in Victoria. The total capacity of the 
production of the defence colleges has not been sufficient to 
provide the Canadian forces officer corps with sufficient 
graduates.
<P>
	I can speak for Victoria. The University of Victoria does not 
have the capacity to absorb additional students. By taking this 
productivity from Royal Roads the number of qualified 
graduates that will be available has been cut. If these are 
supplanted by armed forces training prospects it will cut other 
people out of the program. It is my understanding the university 
training given at Royal Roads is very slightly more expensive 
than that given at any civilian university. I suggest the 
government was premature in shutting down these two 
universities.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robichaud:</B> Madam Speaker, it has been agreed that hon. 
members on this side of the House, in other words, the Liberal 
members, will share their 20-minute speaking time, which 
means two periods of 10 minutes, with the exception of the 
ministers who will use the full 20 minutes.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound):</B> Madam 
Speaker, the Government of Canada is like a person who has a 
weight problem. Overspending is like overeating. The deficit is 
like the fat that stores the excess calories consumed. The 
dangers for Canada are the same as for  the overweight person. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1765"> 1765 </A></B>
<P>
Ultimately the fat will clog the arteries and some vital functions 
will fail.
<P>
	Like those with weight problems our government always 
makes resolutions to do something about the problem: just 
enough calories today to sustain the fat and a more serious diet 
next week.
<P>
	The excuses for procrastination are always the same. We need 
the calories to sustain the living tissue otherwise there will be 
pain: unemployment. Another excuse is that we are about to 
discover a method for losing weight without pain: an 
infrastructure spending program, some grand redesign of social 
programs, more efficient government operations or the closing 
of tax loopholes.
<P>
<B>(1055 ) </B>
<P>
	This budget has put the patient on a diet which slows the rate 
of growth of the debt. It does nothing to stop the debt from 
growing. Certainly there is no indication that we can ever expect 
a slimming of the debt. Promises for a more restrictive diet 
following the redesign of social programs are no longer 
believable. There are no painless ways of losing weight. No 
studies will uncover them.
<P>
	More important, it makes no sense to keep on saying that all 
slimming procedures are health threatening. Canada had full 
employment and rapid economic growth when budgets were 
balanced. The restoration of balanced budgets really restore 
these favourable conditions, just like people feel healthier and 
more vigorous who have dieted successfully and have returned 
to their normal weight.
<P>
	The cure for Canada's disease is known. It needs to be applied 
soon or the patient will be seriously ill. All it takes is to say no to 
additional helpings of food. We need to cut spending drastically. 
During the election campaign the bulk of people I had contact 
with were concerned about the size of the deficit and debt and 
wanted dramatic action to reduce it. They believed that the 
overweight person, the Government of Canada, must be made to 
slim down to where there is no more fat. They believed that a 
crash diet was worth the pain in the knowledge that health would 
be restored.
<P>
	My constituents put one important condition on their 
willingness to make sacrifices for the sake of the country's 
fiscal health: the pain must be shared by all Canadians. Our 
basic system of public health care and pensions must be 
preserved. Social spending programs must be restructured to 
serve only those in need. The budget does not share the burden.
<P>
	The people in the defence industries, civil servants, elderly 
taxpayers, business, entrepreneurs with capital gains and the 
recipients of UIC have been singled out. Worse, these Canadians 
are asked to make sacrifices while excess spending is 
maintained. There are 18 new spending programs which in the 
aggregate match the cuts. These new programs are motivated by 
the desire to pursue ideological goals stemming from the liberal 
world view about the ability of government to solve all problems 
of society.
<P>
	There is the promise to increase the number of day care spaces 
once economic growth has reached 3 per cent. The forecast is for 
such a growth rate during the next two years. What will this 
promise cost? The budget is silent on this potentially very 
expensive program.
<P>
	There is much known fat in current government spending 
programs. No studies are needed to identify it. It could have 
been cut to reduce the deficit significantly while resulting in 
much more equitable sharing of the burden.
<P>
	First, there is the unemployment insurance system. The 
proposed changes in eligibility requirements are a step in the 
right direction but they are not enough. By most international 
and our own historic standards the benefit rate of 55 per cent for 
single persons is too high. Lowering it by two percentage points 
is symbolic rather than economically effective, especially when 
at the same time the benefits to others are raised to 60 per cent.
<P>
	Second, old age security benefit payments are slated to rise 
7.5 per cent from the current $20 billion in two years, primarily 
because there are more eligible Canadians and because of the 
indexing of the benefits. Yet, it is well known that a very 
substantial part of OAS payments are going to families with 
high incomes. It was never the intent of the program for families 
in the top decile and earning $100,000 to receive annually over 
$2.5 billion under this program while they are retired, without 
family obligations and fully insured against health care 
expenditures.
<P>
	Third, the most rapidly growing expenditure category is 
grants to Indians and Inuit. It is slated to rise a full 17 per cent in 
two years. Many people who have been asked to make sacrifices 
are wondering why spending in this program is slated to increase 
$300 million every year for the next two years.
<P>
	More generally this budget claims to make savings of $8 
billion in two years. It should be noted that these savings are 
relative to spending levels slated to increase according to the 
budgets made a number of years ago. Half of them are due to 
what is called securing savings from previous budgets which 
requires no measure of political courage. In effect all the 
so-called savings amount to nothing more than the reduction of 
previously announced spending increases.
<P>
	The bottom line for Canadians is that the level of program 
spending is slated to remain unchanged at $122 billion during 
the next two years. This is not the kind of diet the overweight 
patient needs.
<P>
<B>(1100) </B>
<P>
	There is legitimate reason to be sceptical about the realism of 
the projected size of the public debt charges. They are slated to 
rise only $3 billion over the next three years. The expected 
deficits of this period are about $100 billion. The interest on this 
additional debt alone is $6 billion. Therefore the government 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1766"> 1766 </A></B>
<P>
must expect to enjoy large savings of $3 billion on debt service 
charges on the already existing debt of $504 billion.
<P>
	This is a very risky forecast. Economic growth is predicted to 
be 3 per cent and 3.8 per cent in the next two years. This will 
create inflationary pressures which will be compounded by the 
delayed effects of the depreciation of the Canadian dollar during 
the last year.
<P>
	The forecast of the inflation rate of 1.3 per cent for 1995 is 
very low and so is the related forecast for interest rates of only 
6.1 per cent on long term bonds in 1995. Adding to my 
scepticism about interest rates is that the U.S. economy is 
booming and rates there have already begun to rise. Canada 
cannot afford to have a significant gap in favour of U.S. interest 
rates.
<P>
	I also have my doubts about the forecast for economic growth 
in the next couple of years, doubts which are not shared by the 
majority of economists. I believe the main reason consumers are 
reluctant to spend and therefore are extending the recession is 
that they are worried about the country's deficits and debt. They 
worry whether they will experience the collapse of government 
services and entitlements suffered by the people of New 
Zealand.
<P>
	Until they are sure that our government has taken courageous 
steps to reduce the deficit, they will continue to spend 
cautiously. As a result, economic growth may well remain more 
sluggish than has been forecast in the budget.
<P>
	Let me close by noting that the international capital markets 
are giving the government breathing space for this budget, 
however disappointing are the figures on the level of spending 
cuts. Several people in close contact with the financial 
community have told me that we may expect serious capital 
flight and a financial crisis unless the announced redesign of the 
social programs this fall produce significant savings.
<P>
	I therefore urge the government to make the redesign of the 
social services a serious effort. If there are no tough decisions 
made and credible savings generated, Canada may find itself in 
the same position as did the country's largest real estate empire.
<P>
	Rumours and predictions about a financial crisis were denied 
and banks kept on extending credit until suddenly and upon one 
extra slight provocation the crisis started and the entire empire 
began to collapse. The diet was too late and too little.
<P>
	Let us hope that Canada will not face the same problems. The 
decision is in the hands of the government.
<P>

Speaker, I am delighted at the opportunity to beat all of my 
colleagues to the floor. I was certain that the speech would 
provoke an immediate reaction. Certainly it reminds me why I 
am here.
<P>
	I would suggest to the member for Capilano-Howe Sound 
that the objective of social programs is not to save money. The 
objective of social programs is to help people. To set out with an 
immediate objective that is based on the need to save money is 
incorrect in the spirit of those programs.
<P>
	The 18 new programs that the budget is financing were 
presented to the population of this country last fall and accepted 
and supported in big numbers. I think to do anything but to 
support those programs is to ignore the democratic wishes of the 
people in this country.
<P>
	The idea that the UI reductions did not go far enough I find 
mind boggling, that the way we would try to save money is to 
take it from the hands of people who are just getting by so that 
people who are getting by more comfortably will be more 
comfortable in their support for these programs.
<P>
	Finally I would say, in keeping with the member's analogy in 
terms of diet, there is a big difference between dieting and 
starving people to death.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grubel:</B> I thank my hon. colleague for his comments. 
They are clearly partisan. This is what divides people. I look 
forward to seeing how many letters he will get from the people 
who have been singled out to make sacrifices so that other 
people can get benefits. I find that the kinds of programs 
initiated by his government are not popular with my 
constituents.
<P>
<B>(1105) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Eugène Bellemare (Carleton-Gloucester):</B> I would 
like to comment on the remarks of the tough-talking, 
self-proclaimed crash diet expert from Capilano-Howe Sound. 
He says we are not going through enough pain in dieting and that 
we should be on some kind of crash diet. I am not too sure if he 
confuses the word diet with what my friend just mentioned to 
me, starvation.
<P>
	The hon. member said that the Liberal Party is now going into 
excessive new spending. Then he attacked the system for day 
care we want to introduce. He talked about overweight 
Canadians. I react to that with a smile.
<P>
	He says that the UI changes are not enough, that we should 
have been more courageous and we should have cut, cut, cut 
further. I wonder if the member for Capilano-Howe Sound 
would have further cut the UI.
<P>
	He talks about letter writing from Canadian citizens. I wonder 
if he would care to write an open letter to the newspapers in the 
Atlantic provinces on the UI changes which he would propose. I 
am waiting with bated breath to hear what his proposals would 
be.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1767"> 1767 </A></B>
<P>
	On old age security he says that we are giving out too much 
money. I wonder if he has read the budget and if he has had 
reactions from people who are now seniors and will be paying 
much more in taxes due to the thousand dollars they will be 
losing from now on.
<P>
	He talked about the 17 per cent increase to natives, $300 
million a year. I wonder if he could expand on his views 
regarding the treatment of natives.
<P>
	I will stop at this point because I believe the member for 
Capilano-Howe Sound, the tough talking, self appointed crash 
diet person, probably has a lot on his plate right now.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grubel:</B> Madam Speaker, I will be very brief in 
commenting on the wonderful reiteration of the ways in which 
this government is preserving this wonderful country which is 
going down the drain because we are facing a financial crisis. 
One hundred billion dollars more added to the debt in three 
years. It alone will add $6 billion to the current deficit. I do not 
understand how this can continue.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (St. Paul's):</B> In this, my first speech in 
the House of Commons, I would like to congratulate the Speaker 
on his election and you, Madam Speaker, on your appointment.
<P>
	I would also like to express my sincere thanks to the people of 
St. Paul's riding in Toronto who have entrusted me with the 
honour of representing them in this Parliament. I accept this 
responsibility in all humility.
<P>
	St. Paul's riding is in many ways a microcosm of Canada. It 
defies easy characterization. It is a place of contrast. It is a 
riding of tenants and home owners, business executives and 
building contractors, new Canadians and people who have been 
here for generations. Successive waves of immigrants have 
called the southwest part of my riding home and supplanted one 
another in this neighbourhood as each group has prospered and 
moved on, the Canadian way.
<P>
	Among the residents of St. Paul's are many of our best known 
business, cultural, political, labour, educational and community 
leaders, and many thousands of hard-working people who 
through their efforts keep Toronto and Canada growing.
<P>
<B>(1110 ) </B>
<P>
	As I went door to door during the last election, I was 
continually moved by the diversity of Canada and how it is 
reflected in my riding. In representing St. Paul's, I have 
wonderful role models to look to: John Roberts, Mitchell Sharp 
and Walter Gordon who represented voters in this riding in the 
past. These people of great vision and deep commitment to 
Canada shared a fundamental belief in the virtue of public 
service.
<P>
	In carrying out my responsibilities I shall very much have in 
mind their example, people who served, and in the case of 
Mitchell Sharp continues to serve, with integrity and devotion to 
their country.
<P>
	I must pause to say thank you to my family, the unsung heroes 
in any politician's life. I am grateful to my wife Debra, who 
holds things together in Toronto while I am here, and to my two 
sons, Matthew and Jeremy.
<P>
	My parents taught me that we each have a responsibility to 
give back to our community. Whatever our personal 
circumstances we have the same responsibility to roll up our 
sleeves, get involved and try to make a difference. I shall always 
be grateful for that lesson and their support.
<P>
	Over the last year I have had the privilege of meeting 
thousands of people in my riding. They voiced concerns about 
jobs and the economy. Many are deeply troubled about the 
future and perplexed about the role of government in our time.
<P>
	St. Paul's has not been spared the ravages of the recession. For 
many, optimism has given way to frustration and despair. 
Economic stagnation has taken its toll. However, our spirit is 
strong. The people in my riding are not apathetic. They have 
channelled their frustration and anger into action and 
involvement within their community, their city and their 
country.
<P>
	Politics is serious business in my riding. St. Paul's is the site 
of Montgomery's Tavern where William Lyon Mackenzie 
planned his rebellion of 1837. One cannot help but notice 
parallels between those days and our own. The rebellion resulted 
from widespread public anger directed at a government which 
was disinterested, self-absorbed and out of touch. The bold 
actions of 1837 paved the way for responsible government.
<P>
	One hundred and fifty-seven years later the Canadian people, 
angry with a disinterested and out of touch government, again 
rebelled the way we do in modern society: at the ballot box. The 
message they sent was loud and clear. Canadians want 
responsive and responsible government.
<P>
	The people of my riding are unforgiving of politicians. They 
do not forget if we fail to keep our promises. That is why I am 
proud to be part of a government which is proceeding with this 
budget to do exactly what it said it would do. We are funding 
every major commitment in the red book. When we keep our 
promises we go a long way to restoring the confidence 
Canadians must have in their government.
<P>
	Among the many noteworthy budget initiatives are the 
infrastructure program, the youth service corps, prenatal 
nutrition programs, the restoration of the court challenges 
program, the technology network and the residential 
rehabilitation assistance program.
<P>
	There are two different visions for Canada. Some believe, and 
we have heard it today, in a Canada of winners and losers, of we 
and they, of us and them. They believe government is the 
problem, that government has no role to play except to stand 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1768"> 1768 </A></B>
<P>
aside and let the chips fall. Their theory is that the economy will 
adjust, that we will all be better off in the long run if government 
simply gets out of the way.
<P>
	In the meantime, and it is a mean time, slash and burn 
economic policies have a terrible impact on the social fabric of 
society.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I learned a few things when I was working for the monetary 
fund in Washington.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	One of the things I learned is that slashing expenditures alone, 
what we call shock therapy, leads inevitably to serious costs to 
society and fails to restore fiscal health. We must control 
expenditures and foster growth. That is the course we have set. 
We should beware of those who would prescribe quack diets.
<P>
[Translation] 
<P>
	Our vision is different. We cannot define Canada in terms of 
winners and losers. What matters to us is improving the quality 
of life of all Canadians so that they can all be winners.
<P>
	The government has a role to play in revitalizing the economy 
and in preserving the social fabric. Canada has always been a 
land of prosperity and Canadians have always prospered under a 
government which could play that role, even in times of fiscal 
restraint. As the budget indicates, our government must take an 
active part in the economic, social and cultural life of this 
country.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This budget demonstrates that this government understands 
its responsibilities to the people of Canada. For Canada and for 
Canadians to prosper, government must neither stand aside nor 
stand in the way. Government must stand alongside Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1115 ) </B>
<P>
	I know the government cannot do everything. There are 
worthy things we simply cannot afford to support. We have 
made tough choices in this budget but I believe we have made 
the right choices. We were listening to Canadians in the 
pre-budget consultations.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	As a member of the Standing Committee on Finance, I look 
forward to listening to the views of Canadians on the thrust of 
the economic policy.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The government understands the reality we are faced with 
today and is prepared to do that which is necessary to be fiscally 
responsible. Controlling spending is a priority for this 
government. This budget begins the long and difficult task of 
reversing the debt and deficit spiral. The budget incorporates a 
more ambitious deficit reduction plan on the expenditure side 
than any budget in the last decade.
<P>
	We will not blame the previous government for the sorry state 
of Canada's financial affairs. We are prepared to be judged by 
how we deal with the hand we have been dealt by the world we 
find. This budget is a first step in a longer process which began 
on October 25 to restore fiscal health and preserve the social 
justice which defines Canada.
<P>
	The government will not solve Canada's problems by creating 
a permanent underclass in this country. Those who need help 
most will always have the assistance they require. I will work 
with the government to identify and support the role that 
government can and should be playing.
<P>
	Government can and should bring people together, set goals, 
provide leadership, make sure the job gets done fairly and 
effectively. That is what this budget is all about. The 
government understands it has a role to play in helping people 
find decent work, in helping restore their confidence. Even in 
difficult economic times government must respond to the needs 
of Canadians and Canadians need jobs.
<P>
	The budget accomplishes this in two ways. The infrastructure 
program is putting people to work now. In looking to tomorrow, 
to tomorrow's workers and the jobs they must have, the budget 
establishes a national literacy program, a youth service corps, 
internship and apprenticeship programs, and innovative 
programs for small business.
<P>
	I am confident that together with the people of Canada we can 
solve the riddle of the 1990s. We will be able to have a caring 
society, a vital cultural life, and a viable economy. We are up to 
the challenge.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We, as members of Parliament, must do our job, but 
Canadians too must do their share and keep on believing in what 
we can accomplish together. All citizens of our great country 
must recognize and accept their responsibilities towards this 
society and do their share. We must regain confidence in our 
common future.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I was rather surprised by the speech of my colleague, 
because my vision of the budget is entirely different from his.
<P>
	How can he say that we are going to improve the quality of life 
in Canada, when the qualifying period for unemployment 
insurance has been raised from 10 to 12 weeks at a time when 
people are experiencing a very difficult economic situation in 
the regions of Quebec and Canada? How can he say that 
reducing the number of weeks of insurable employment for an 
individual to be eligible to UI benefits will improve the quality 
of life of Canadians? I believe that Liberals will have to admit, 
at the very least, that their budget is a conservative one.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1769"> 1769 </A></B>
<P>
	What should we think about this budget, when the government 
is reaching into the wallets of senior citizens. They have paid 
their share all their lives and now that they are retired, all they 
deserve is to see their income cut back. I think the media were 
very clear on this. I would be pleased to hear the hon. member 
explain to me how this is going to improve the quality of life of 
Canadians.
<P>
	Also, how can he say the deficit is under control, when it is the 
highest that any government dared make public? I am willing to 
make a bet with the hon. member that, next year, when we get the 
figures for the fiscal year, the deficit will be $45 billion rather 
than $39 as forecast, because the Liberals were not willing to 
take their responsibilities and reduce the duplications.
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
[English] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Campbell:</B> Madam Speaker, I want to thank the hon. 
member for his question.
<P>
	The budget is very much about the quality of life. It contains 
numerous programs, many of which I have focused on, that are 
all about the quality of life: our youth, the jobs they must have, 
the retraining that must take place and the preservation of the 
social programs that he referred to in a sensible way which 
contributes to getting people back into the workforce.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
appreciate some of the comments the member made in reference 
to the response of people to a government that does not listen. I 
keep wondering how things are changing right now when we are 
faced with that very situation. Government is not listening to the 
people.
<P>
	Many have expressed concerns about the massive debt that 
keeps building up. The budget has just been released and it 
amounts to a situation now where in the next three years we will 
have an additional $100 billion in debt. That certainly does not 
reflect what the people are demanding. A threat hangs over the 
head of every taxpayer in the country. There is now going to be a 
service charge to be paid, again on the backs of the taxpayer.
<P>
	What is going to happen? Are we going to have additional tax 
burdens again affecting the quality of life? How caring will the 
government be when forced by lenders to curtail its spending? If 
we do not get a handle on it now, what is going to happen in the 
next three years when the lenders say that enough is enough?
<P>
	I would appreciate the member responding to how caring the 
government will be after failing to take immediate action. It will 
be a much greater crisis in the future.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Campbell:</B> Madam Speaker, I want to thank the hon. 
member for his question.
<P>
	There are no tax increases in the budget and I have every 
confidence, unlike the hon. member and some of his colleagues, 
that we are up to the challenge. I am not sitting on the edge of my 
seat waiting for the total  collapse of this country. I am 
shouldering my burden along with my colleagues on this side of 
the House and the few who are over there in getting on and in 
getting the job done.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Serré (Timiskaming-French River):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I want to thank you for giving me the opportunity to 
address the House this morning on this important matter of my 
government's first budget.
<P>
	For the past few weeks, I have sat in the House, listening to 
the many statements, questions and speeches made by my 
colleagues on both sides of the House. I was struck by one fact. 
No matter how different our approaches and methods and no 
matter which region of Canada we originate from, we all share 
something in common: a strong sense of duty to our 
constituents.
<P>
	For me my riding will always come first. I want to thank the 
people of Timiskaming-French River for putting their faith in 
me. I want to tell each and every one of them how proud and 
honoured I feel to be their voice here in Ottawa.
<P>
	Many of my colleagues on both sides of the House have 
addressed specific issues in relation to the budget speech today. 
I would like to restrict my comments to two areas which I feel 
have more direct consequences to my riding: mining and 
agriculture.
<P>
	My riding of Timiskaming-French River is largely a rural 
riding. It is vast in size and stretches from Matheson and 
Kirkland Lake in the north to the French River of Alban and 
Noelville in the south. It is a riding that has been developed by 
the forestry, mining and agricultural sectors. Although tourism 
offers great potential it remains relatively undeveloped.
<P>
	Unfortunately as a result of the poor mining policy of the 
previous government and the cancellation of mining incentives 
by the Conservatives in 1987, for the first time in its history 
Cobalt has no operating mine. The Adams mine in Kirkland 
Lake and the Sherman mines in Temagami, two iron ore pellet 
producing mines, closed in 1990. Dofasco through very 
questionable circumstances now buys its iron ore pellets in the 
former Prime Minister's riding.
<P>
<B>(1125 ) </B>
<P>
	Permit me to state a few facts and statistics on the mining 
industry in Canada. The first big myth is that mining is only 
important to a few remote areas of the country. This could not be 
further from the truth. The mining industry is the cornerstone of 
our economy, accounting for approximately 16 per cent of total 
exports, 4.6 per cent of gross domestic product and 100,000 high 
paying, skilled jobs. More jobs are created in urban centres from 
services and supply to the mining industry than in the actual 
mining communities.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1770"> 1770 </A></B>
<P>
	Mining is a mainstay of employment and industrial activity in 
more than 150 communities across the country with a total 
population of about one million people. Urban areas also benefit 
as they are home to international mining head offices, support 
industries including banks, stock markets, insurance 
companies, suppliers, legal services and consultants.
<P>
	This is why I am so pleased with our initiative to establish a 
reclamation fund mechanism for the mining sector. I intend to 
continue my consultation with the Minister of Finance and 
cabinet to ensure that other initiatives, as set out in our mining 
policy, such as a single window environmental process and an 
incentive program for exploration, be implemented as soon as 
possible.
<P>
	The second big myth is that mining is environmentally 
damaging and irresponsible. Well-intentioned 
environmentalists have virtually declared war on our resource 
based industries like mining, forestry and trapping. Yet the total 
mined acreage in the country is smaller than metropolitan 
Toronto.
<P>
	Although I recognize that forestry and mining practices of the 
past cannot be repeated, we must guard against extremes which 
would result in the death of our resource based communities and 
thus do great harm to the Canadian economy as a whole. We 
must do more to educate the general public, especially from the 
urban areas, on the importance of mining in the Canadian 
economy.
<P>
	In the last five or six years our ore bodies inventories in this 
country have been reduced to dangerously low levels. The lack 
of consistency and the duplication in environmental processes, 
the lack of incentives and a reclamation fund mechanism, land 
accessibility because of native land claims and parks are but a 
few of the problems facing the mining industry.
<P>
	The Liberal Party in the last election was the only party which 
developed a comprehensive mining policy. These policies 
received tremendous support from the mayors and reeves of the 
mining communities across the country, most of which are 
single industry towns. These policies were also endorsed by all 
major mining associations in Canada. I praise the finance 
minister for acting expeditiously to implement some of those 
policies.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Agriculture remains an economic sector which is essential for 
the security, the prosperity and the sovereignty of our nation. On 
December 15, Canada signed the GATT Agreement in Geneva. I 
want to congratulate the Minister of Agriculture, the Minister 
for International Trade as well as the 60 members of the Liberal 
caucus who worked hard to defend the interests of the Canadian 
farmers in Geneva.
<P>
	Together we have succeeded, under those very difficult 
circumstances and in spite of though time constraints, in 
maintaining our marketing system and an effective control over 
import quotas through an appropriate  pricing method. Those 
measures will allow our family farms to survive in the short and 
the long run.
<P>
	We still have a very thorny problem to settle with the 
Americans, the cream and yoghurt issue. I am confident that the 
Minister of Agriculture will be quite capable of negotiating with 
them a bilateral agreement which will satisfy our Canadian 
dairy producers.
<P>
<B>(1130) </B>
<P>
	However, we will have to be very careful not to give in to the 
constant pressures of the Americans who are asking us to lower 
those import tariffs. We will have to maintain the viability of our 
family farms at any rate.
<P>
	A country that cannot feed its own people is not a sovereign 
nation. Therefore, I am very proud that the Minister of Finance 
maintained the major safety nets for farmers, including the 
Gross Revenue Insurance Plan and the Net Income Stabilization 
Account.
<P>
	I would like to make a few comments to my colleagues from 
the Official Opposition, in particular to their leader. First, I wish 
to say a few words about my background. My ancestors arrived 
in the beautiful city of Quebec around 1658. I am very proud to 
be a descendant of one of the greatest Canadians, Sir Wilfrid 
Laurier. My family moved to Ontario around 1889 to work in the 
logging industry and clear rocky lands. I am extremely proud 
that we were able to preserve not only our language but also our 
French culture, despite all the challenges and fights we had to 
face in Ontario.
<P>
	Last year, my family was designated the Francophone Family 
of the Year by the ACFO Nipissing.
<P>
	My riding is made up of about 30 per cent of francophones, as 
well as Canadians of Ukrainian, Polish, Italian and other 
origins, and 45 per cent of anglophones who came to work on the 
land, sometimes a very difficult land to develop. I intend to 
defend the rights of all these minorities equally.
<P>
	I am doubly proud to be the first francophone elected in the 
Timiskaming-French River riding, with the biggest majority 
ever seen there, since the riding includes six municipalities 
which declared themselves unilingual anglophone, even before 
Sault Ste. Marie went that way.
<P>
	That is why I listened to the opposition leader's speech with 
great concern and apprehension. I had the impression that, 
during the election campaign, he promised Quebecers that he 
would concentrate first and foremost on job creation and 
economic renewal. I think it is the reason why many Quebecers 
voted for his party. However, nearly all his speeches have been 
very negative and mostly devoted to his separatist agenda. 
Quebec constituents are not any different from those in 
Timiskaming-French River. They want to be able to earn a 
decent living and put food on their table.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1771"> 1771 </A></B>
<P>
	Consequently, I would like to warn the opposition members 
that if they do not set aside their separatist option and start 
working with this government to put Canada back to work, as a 
party, they will end up paying a huge political price.
<P>
	Moreover, for the Leader of the Opposition to consistently 
refer to the rest of Canada as English Canada is an insult to the 
millions of francophones outside Quebec, as well as the millions 
of Canadians of other origins.
<P>
	I had the opportunity and the pleasure to visit beautiful 
Quebec City and other areas in Quebec where I felt at home. 
They are as much part of my heritage as of any Quebecer's. 
Thus, I would like to invite my colleagues from the Bloc 
Quebecois, especially those who come from Northwest Quebec, 
to work with us to implement our mining, forest and farm 
policies, extend the Ottawa seaway, and jointly develop our 
tourist industry, so that we can stimulate the economy and create 
jobs.
<P>
	Let us look for what unites us rather than what divides us and 
together, let us put our country back on its feet.
<P>
<B>(1135) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé):</B> Madam Speaker, I want to 
congratulate my hon. colleague from Timiskaming-French 
River. I must say, however, that I do not agree fully with his 
comments. He speaks of sovereigntists. Well, I am proud to be a 
sovereigntist, but I am even more proud of the fact that our 
leader addressed the sovereignty issue during the election 
campaign. Another distinguishing feature of Bloc Quebecois 
members is that they are realists.
<P>
	The budget brought down this week is an assault on existing 
social benefits. We have proof of this. We have listened to our 
constituents and seen the impact of cuts, of lower 
unemployment insurance premiums, of the increase in the 
number of weeks of work for UI eligibility and of other reform 
measures which have either been announced or are being 
planned for them by the Minister of Human Resources 
Development. We are confused and worried. And we are rightly 
proud that we are sovereigntists and realists.
<P>
	We are not trying to be divisive, to start any arguments or to 
score political points at the expense of Quebecers and 
Canadians. We have before us a budget about which my 
colleague spoke at greater length. I fail to see why one would 
seek out divisive issues. But, since we are talking about this, I 
would like to reiterate that the second distinguishing feature of 
sovereigntist Bloc members is their realistic approach in saying 
to Canadians: Be careful, you voted for the Liberals, the ones 
responsible for this budget. We have always maintained that 
there is very little difference between the Liberals and the 
Conservatives. During the election campaign, we used the 
expression ``six of one, half a dozen of the other''.
<P>
	If we had to start another campaign tomorrow morning, in 
referring to the difference between the Conservatives and the 
Liberals, I would say that the Liberals are just Tories wearing 
red ear muffs. That is all I wanted to say.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Serré:</B> Madam Speaker, on one side we have the Reform 
Party claiming that we did not cut deep enough, while on the 
other side, we have the Bloc Quebecois that says we were too 
ruthless. They want us to reduce the deficit, but they do not want 
us to make any cuts or increase taxes, as we did on corporations 
and wealthier Canadians.
<P>
	A well-known Quebec comedian and philosopher by the name 
of Yvon Deschamps summed it up quite well when he said that 
what these people want is an independent Quebec within a 
united Canada.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I must say that one cannot have it both ways. One cannot have 
one's cake and eat it too.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Madam 
Speaker, governments come and go, but nothing changes. At 
least, that is the distinct impression one gets from the February 
22 budget, once the veil of pretence has been lifted and the many 
statistical pirouettes have been figured out.
<P>
	Yet, the members opposite claimed they had understood a few 
things: first, the urgent necessity to drastically reduce the 
federal budget to reverse the debt spiral which is spinning out of 
control; second, the price to pay in terms of credibility for 
padding forecasts for future economic progress; and third, the 
need for openness and transparency to win people over, as they 
are the ones who pay and do not appreciate being mistaken for 
something they are not.
<P>
	There was also a fourth thing, which the government seemed 
to distance itself from more and more as the fateful moment to 
table the budget drew near. The federal government is 
unquestionably responsible for creating the debt spiral, and 
therefore the budget crisis that Canada is currently facing. 
Logically, it should make some sacrifices and clean up its own 
act.
<P>
	Given that the federal government had recognized in 
December, at the premiers conference, that overlapping 
jurisdictions and policies were a problem, some were 
nevertheless hopeful.
<P>
<B>(1140) </B>
<P>
	Alas, on all four fronts, the budget is a surprising 
disappointment, especially since the government has, at the very 
beginning of its mandate, a wide-open window of opportunity, 
both politically and economically. Any recovery, however 
slight, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1772"> 1772 </A></B>
<P>
still gives more leeway than a recession. This golden 
opportunity was missed.
<P>
	Let us look at the substance. The billions in cuts announced 
left and right combined with the spectacular increase in federal 
revenues would have led any person unfamiliar with the 
vocabulary used by successive finance ministers to believe that 
the trend in the federal deficit would finally be reversed as early 
as next year. Nothing could be further from the truth.
<P>
	We will go from a deliberately inflated $45.7 billion deficit in 
1993-94 to an almost $40 billion deficit for the coming year. 
The government's budget plan tells us that the 1993-94 basic 
deficit, excluding non-recurring factors, will amount to $42.1 
billion and that, without any political change, next year's deficit 
will go down to $41.2 billion.
<P>
	Let us compare this $41.2 billion figure with the $39.7 billion 
deficit announced by the Minister of Finance. We must conclude 
that all this figure shuffling by the government results in a very 
modest deficit reduction of $1.5 billion. The Minister of 
Finance wants to convince us that he deserves a gold medal in 
deficit reduction. In fact, he deserves a paper medal.
<P>
	Why paper? Because a paper medal has two sides, one for 
recording revenues and the other for recording expenditures. 
When we look at it more closely, we see that the finance 
minister's alleged achievement is entirely based on a revenue 
increase so large that we are taken aback, especially since his 
economic forecasts for 1994 are both realistic and modest. But it 
is pretty useless if we do not arrive at the right conclusions. 
Even if we exclude non-recurring factors, revenues only went 
up by 1.2 per cent between 1992-93 and 1993-94, while the 
GDP grew by 3.3 per cent in nominal terms.
<P>
	With a wave of the finance minister's magic wand, revenues, 
excluding increases due to a broader tax base, will suddenly 
jump by 4.6 per cent with a GDP nominal growth of 3.9 per cent.
<P>
	We must ask the question that the Minister of Finance has 
been avoiding: What would be the impact of a more realistic tax 
revenue increase of, say, 3 per cent? The deficit would amount 
not to $39.7 billion but to $42.9 billion. The basic deficit for 
1994-95 would stay the same as that for the fiscal year ending in 
one month. At first sight, this outcome would seem the most 
likely.
<P>
	The government backed down after the general outcry caused 
by the trial balloons on RRSPs and employer-financed health 
insurance plans. But it will still take $1 billion from the pockets 
of the middle class over the next three years, while some tax 
shelters reserved for the wealthiest stay in place. They told us 
about making taxes more equitable, but that will have to wait.
<P>
	If the government wants its revenue forecasts to materialize, 
it must allocate additional resources to create jobs by making 
further cuts in less sensitive federal expenditures. There would 
then be a real deficit reduction with, as a bonus, a beneficial 
effect on long-term interest rates and, in turn, on consumption 
and investments.
<P>
	The government is acting as though Canada was not facing a 
structural economic crisis. The year 1994 did not start well on 
the employment front as 38,000 jobs were lost last month so 
that, nearly two years after the recession ended, 47 per cent of 
the jobs lost during the recession in Canada have still not 
reappeared. The 143,000 jobs created in 1993 were not even 
enough to absorb new arrivals in the workforce. Quebec still has 
to recover 60 per cent of the lost jobs. The Canadian economy is 
still performing well below its potential. The Minister of 
Finance himself predicts that 173,000 jobs will be created in 
1994, which is barely enough for the new arrivals and is not 
enough to continue making up lost ground.
<P>
<B>(1145) </B>
<P>
	One of the obstacles to a real recovery of the Canadian 
economy is the level of longer-term interest rates, which are 
still high, especially because of this huge debt hanging over 
Canadians like a sword of Damocles. Historically, long-term 
interest rates did not exceed 4 per cent in real terms. Today, they 
are still 6 per cent and, even worse, have started to rise again in 
the last few weeks under pressure from the U.S. economy.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The only way of bringing back the momentum of lower 
long-term interest rates is by substantially reducing the federal 
deficit. When we have a debt of $511 billion, a one point decline 
in rates represents more than $5 billion less in interest 
payments. Half the federal debt is of a short-term nature and 
half is of a longer term nature of is more than one year. This 
momentum can feed on itself but it has to be sustained and 
propelled by a government that knows where it wants to go. This 
does not seem to be the case.
<P>
	As things stand now the prediction of the Minister of Finance 
on long-term interest rates seems too optimistic. In a few 
months the federal deficit will appear to be still out of control 
and significant economic growth will again be postponed. Job 
creation was supposed to be the rallying cry of the Liberals. The 
Minister of Finance predicts a real boost in job creation but 
unfortunately not this year. It will be next year only.
<P>
	I am reminded of the metallic plaques in a few French cafés 
and brasseries bearing the inscription: ``Tomorrow free beer''. It 
is tomorrow only and we read it today.
<P>
	In the meantime what are we supposed to make of a budget 
that acknowledges one of the first measures of the new 
government enacted last December was and is a job killer. It is 
written in black and white on page 2 of the backgrounder on the 
proposed changes to the unemployment insurance program. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1773"> 1773 </A></B>
<P>
Referring to the rollback in the premium rate from $3.07 to $3 
next January it says:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-will provide significant financial relief to businesses. By the end of 1996 there will 
be 40,000 more jobs in the economy that could be expected if premiums were 
allowed to rise.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Certainly 40,000 jobs are not something to be looked down 
upon in these uncertain times. It represents maybe $1 billion in 
wages.
<P>
	The government is going to roll back its own increase in the 
premium rate this year but only in 10 months. In the meantime 
this increase is killing thousands of jobs. It is strange indeed.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	But how do you explain that the announced cuts of several 
billion dollars do not have any real impact on the deficit? This is 
because there are two kinds of cuts: real cuts and artificial cuts. 
For several years, finance ministers have become real 
specialists in making false cuts.
<P>
	What is an artificial cut? It is an announced reduction of 
planned future spending. What was usually foreseen before, of 
course, was an increase. Reducing or eliminating this increase, 
in the jargon of technocrats at the Department of Finance, 
becomes a cut. An employee whose salary raise goes from 5 to 3 
per cent has his pay cut 2 per cent, from this point of view, 
although in fact it is a 3 per cent increase, which will be 
accounted for as such in the budget of the company or the 
department.
<P>
	Such an approach obviously has several advantages for the 
government. For one thing, it is a good show for the media, since 
the billions pile up fast in this game, especially since there is no 
time limit. They will talk about cuts spread over the next three or 
even five years. And since they are in the habit of adding the cuts 
over several years, even if it only makes the debate more 
confusing, they quickly come up with impressive amounts that 
they can boast about.
<P>
<B>(1150) </B>
<P>
	What this approach does, in reality, is keep the public 
guessing as to the government's determination to take the bull 
by the horns. These budget papers, like all those that came 
before, do not include the expenditure forecasts of the previous 
budget. This makes it easier for the government to pull the wool 
over people's eyes and to more or less distort the facts.
<P>
	Before I give you a few examples of this sleight of hand, 
Madam Speaker, I want to say that not only are we not impressed 
with all of these special effects, we also deeply deplore the lack 
of transparency in the budget process. The nice words spoken by 
the Minister of Finance at the University of Montreal last 
November were quickly forgotten, along with all of the other 
good intentions. However, the government will not resolve the 
serious debt crisis by playing hide-and-seek with the opposition 
parties and with the taxpayers.
<P>
	At this point, I would like to highlight a discrepancy which, 
considering the sums of money involved, is perhaps only a 
minor one, but one that is nonetheless symptomatic of a 
dangerous attitude. The government appears to be saying that 
since no one will bother to check the figures, it can take the 
liberty of concealing the truth. Here is one example of this type 
of attitude which we are not used to seeing, given the traditional 
accuracy of Finance Department budgets. On page 32 of the 
Budget Plan, we note the following: ``International assistance 
funding is, therefore, being reduced by 2 per cent for 1994-95 
from the 1993-94 level''. However, on page 34, the figure 
quoted for 1994-95 is $91 million. This represents a reduction 
of 3.4 per cent compared to this year's international assistance 
budget, which was pegged at $2.7 billion. Therefore, this is not a 
2 per cent reduction. Does this mean that we have to check every 
single percentage in the Budget Plan? Is there a catch here? Is 
the government trying to conceal something? We want an 
answer.
<P>
	The budget announces new cuts in business subsidies. On 
page 33, the following is stated and I quote: ``These reductions 
are over-and-above the reductions in grants and contributions 
announced in the April 1993 budget. By 1996-97, grants to 
business will be on the order of $3.1 billion, down by just under 
10 per cent from $3.4 billion in 1993-94''. While this last 
sentence is accurate, it completely contradicts the first one. 
Expenditures for this item already exceed the forecasts 
contained in the April 1993 budget. It was projected that 
expenditures would decrease from $3.3 billion in 1993-94 to 
$2.5 billion in 1997-98.
<P>
	All of this is quite complicated and difficult for anyone to 
understand. However, this approach generally allows the 
Finance Department and the Minister of Finance to hide behind 
distorted facts that have been introduced into the debate. In this 
instance, the lack of transparency is accompanied by a lack of 
consistency.
<P>
	This is doubly worrisome. Not only are facts being distorted, 
but the total accuracy of table 8 on page 34 can be viewed as 
questionable. This particular table is very important as it details 
reductions in expenditures associated with the restructuring of 
federal programs. Consequently, the formula used to calculate 
the deficit can also be viewed as questionable. In fact, in some 
cases the figures listed under such items as international 
assistance and defence relate to the April 1993 budget, while in 
other cases, they do not. They do not even represent new 
artificial reductions. The references are complex and confusing. 
We are dealing with apples and oranges and the average person 
has trouble sorting the whole mess out.
<P>
	The situation with respect to business subsidies is also true of 
federal government operating expenses, at least for 1994-95. It 
should be noted-and this is far from reassuring-that the 
federal government is having a lot of trouble controlling its 
operating expenses. Over the last  two fiscal years, these 
expenses have clearly exceeded budgetary projections. The 
Budget Plan announces that the new reductions for 1994-95 will 
be over-and-above those announced in the April 1993 budget. 
At the time, reductions of $468 million were projected for 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1774"> 1774 </A></B>
<P>
1994-95. Yet, in Tuesday's budget, we see that the operating 
expenses for the new fiscal year are identical to the forecasts in 
the April 1993 budget. It is in the defence sector, Mr. Speaker-I 
just went from the feminine to the masculine and the people 
reading <I>Hansard</I> will realize that our female Speaker has just 
been replaced by a male Speaker-so it is in the defence sector 
that we hit the jackpot of false cuts. Seven billion over five years 
compared with the April 1993 budget. In this case, it seems to be 
somewhat consistent. But the real cut is much smaller, since the 
defence budget will decrease from $11.3 billion in 1993-94 to 
$10.5 billion in 1995-96.
<P>
<B>(1155) </B>
<P>
	As there will be no real reduction in federal operating 
expenditures and in business subsidies, and as the overlap 
problem will remain unresolved, the Minister of Finance had to 
do something to at least give an impression of movement. So 
what was left? Social spending. So they went full speed ahead.
<P>
	Make no mistake. We would dearly like to see the 
unemployment insurance budget reduced to zero for lack of 
unemployed people, except for those in between jobs. But the 
minister is cutting the budget without reducing unemployment. 
He will eventually carry out a global reform combining, we are 
told, training and re-training programs. But, in the meantime, 
he is striking with full force. He himself estimates that 85 per 
cent of unemployed workers will receive reduced benefits while 
only 15 per cent will see an increase in theirs.
<P>
	Disadvantaged regions will be hit the hardest. Let us not 
forget that the minister's own forecasts for 1994 are not the 
greatest. Social assistance, mainly funded by the provinces, will 
see an increase in the number of claims.
<P>
	At the same time, the Minister of Finance is reducing his cash 
transfers to the provinces by $800 million. I am referring to 
Table 17 on page 56 of the Budget Plan, a $800 million reduction 
in cash transfers. The value of tax point transfers will increase 
by more than that, but cash transfers, the only transfers that the 
federal government can regulate, are the only ones that matter in 
terms of the federal government's policy in this regard. So the 
federal government's heavy responsibility in the budget crisis, 
the practice of shifting the deficit burden to the provinces 
remains popular. That is a heavy price to pay and we will come 
back to that later.
<P>
	Again, an accurate assessment of the unemployment 
insurance shortfall will have to wait. The Minister of Finance 
talks about savings of $725 million in 1994-95, but compared to 
what? It is not clear. What is surprising is the total cost of 
unemployment insurance benefits, which stays at practically the 
same level between 1993-94  and 1994-95, despite the new 
rules and the stable unemployment figures. Given other 
estimates of budgetary expenditures, we are entitled to see the 
finance department's detailed simulation.
<P>
	Is there, Mr. Speaker, more significant evidence of this 
government's lack of moral fibre than the avowed intention to 
achieve the most drastic cuts, $5.5 billion over three years in 
this particular sector? During the election campaign, the 
Liberals were rending their clothes over the protection of social 
programs. They are now trying to mend them but their 
stitchwork leaves much to be desired.
<P>
	The copy tabled by the Minister of Finance deserves a single 
annotation: ``This Budget is all smoke and mirrors''. This is not 
what Canada and Quebec were hoping for.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> As I am sure all hon. members understand, 
there will not be a question and comment period. The hon. 
Leader of the Opposition has unlimited time and it is only after 
20-minute speeches that there are questions and comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Calgary West):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wonder if there 
would be unanimous consent to have a 10-minute question and 
answer period.
<P>
	Daily we have the opportunity in the Chamber to question 
cabinet ministers and any other member who makes a speech, 
including the leader of the Reform Party. The government in 
particular is always saying that the Leader of the Opposition is 
somehow responsible for every policy that occurs around here.
<P>
	Maybe there would be unanimous consent to allow a 
10-minute question and answer period.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Is there unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
<B>(1200) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> Mr. Speaker, this process is a privilege of the 
Official Opposition and we do not want to call into question the 
role of the Official Opposition, as the Prime Minister did when 
he was leader of the opposition. So, we fully respect the normal 
operations of this House, while also following the example of 
the present Prime Minister when he was sitting on this side of 
the House.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to remind the Bloc that the current Prime Minister 
did accept questions in the question period after speeches when 
he was Leader of the Opposition, not necessarily on every 
occasion, but he certainly did it. Perhaps the current Leader of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1775"> 1775 </A></B>
<P>
the Opposition does not like to be reminded of his past as a 
member of the previous government.
<P>
	I have participated in a lot of budget debates and a lot of 
borrowing authority debates over the last five years, always of 
course from the other side of the House. The task of criticizing 
the budget when I was in opposition was always made easier by 
the fact that the previous government always failed to meet the 
budget targets it set. Every year it gave us more and more 
rhetoric about the deficit. It proposed more cuts and tax 
increases every year. Yet it seemed to auger deeper into the 
ground, so much so that this year we face a deficit of $45 billion.
<P>
	The fundamental problem which the previous government 
failed to address was the need to take seriously its responsibility 
for the transformation of the Canadian economy into one 
premised on the need for growth based on knowledge, skills, 
innovation and the use of technology.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We live in a new global market. Rapid structural changes are 
taking place in our traditional industries and these changes, 
combined with globalization, have generated confusion and 
uncertainty among Canadians.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We have reason to be hopeful. The new economy offers 
boundless opportunity for the innovative, the inventive and the 
courageous. This budget is about seizing the opportunities of the 
new economy. It is an agenda for economic growth. It is an 
agenda to put Canada back to work. It builds on our strengths, 
faces our weaknesses head on and points us to new horizons.
<P>
	A basic vision for the Canadian economy was at the core of 
our red book in the election campaign and survives intact in the 
budget. The vision is one of a  Canada successful in making 
adjustments to the new economy, a Canada in which our 
traditional sources of wealth creation are enhanced by the 
application of new technology and by adherence to the 
principles of sustainable development, a Canada in which small 
business is able to prosper in an environment in which 
governments believe that to succeed is good and to succeed 
requires the co-operation and support of public policy.
<P>
	The fundamental problem that faces Canadians today is that 
we as a society cannot finance our consumption at current 
levels. Measures in the budget reduced the amount that the 
federal public sector is consuming by a significant degree. 
However, we still face the reality that the only way our standard 
of living can be maintained and our expectations of government 
services can be realized is if we move forward with a plan to 
revitalize the wealth creation capacity of our economy.
<P>
	The notion that government does not have a role to play in 
enabling a nation's economy to succeed is a view that I believe 
was held by our predecessors, including the current Leader of 
the Official Opposition. This view has been widely discredited 
by the successful new economies that are emerging rapidly as 
our chief competitors in the international marketplace.
<P>
	The world is moving from a commodity and assembly line 
economy to a knowledge based economy in which innovations 
in products and processes are the result of scientific research 
and development.
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Knowledge and skills, rather than location and natural 
resources, are now the basis for the competitive edge in 
agriculture and mining, as well in electronic data processing.
<P>
	Public policies can have a bearing on knowledge and skills. 
The government can promote the creation and improvement of 
those.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	At the same time as barriers to trade are falling, new roles for 
government in determining a nation's economic success are 
being defined. Governments too have to be innovative and 
strategic in the use of their own limited resources and strategic 
as well in the direction sought for the economy of the nation.
<P>
	Our strategy recognizes the rapid change occurring in the 
world today. Our strategy recognizes that for Canadian firms the 
key competitors are not across the street. They are on the other 
side of the world. Our strategy recognizes that our most 
important resource is people: their skills, their knowledge, their 
desire to succeed.
<P>
	In this strategy individuals need to prepare themselves for a 
future that will likely include career changes and the acquisition 
of new skills and knowledge throughout their working lives. In 
this strategy companies must  recognize the importance of 
continual upgrading of their products and the need to develop 
new markets in Canada and abroad. To do so they need to 
continually invest in their people and they must not delay in 
acquiring and using new technology, new processes, new ways 
of solving old problems. In this strategy governments must 
create the supportive environment that encourages individuals 
and companies to innovate, to upgrade, to expand and to create 
jobs.
<P>
	What will this require of government? First, we have to get 
the economic framework right. The Minister of Finance has set 
out a tough but realistic plan for reducing the deficit to 3 per cent 
of GDP over three years.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1776"> 1776 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We put in place a clear and stable monetary policy until the 
end of the decade. We signed two major trade agreements, 
NAFTA and GATT, which increase and ensure access to world 
markets for Canada. We are also negotiating a comprehensive 
agreement to eliminate internal obstacles to domestic trade in a 
key sector by June 30 of this year.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Second we have to get Canada's business framework right. By 
that I mean we need a regulatory and tax environment that 
enables Canadian firms to succeed rather than hindering their 
success. We need competition and consumer protection laws 
that enhance the proper functioning of the marketplace while 
enabling Canadian businesses to achieve the critical mass 
necessary to take on the world.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We must try to attain excellence in education and training, and 
also eliminate barriers and obstacles to personal initiative.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Third, we must change the culture and attitudes of employers 
and employees alike to the adoption of new technologies.
<P>
	Advances in science and technology are driving productivity 
improvements everywhere in the world. In the 1990s no country 
can insulate itself from new developments. We must organize 
ourselves to keep up with cutting edge technology and where 
possible move ahead. This is the essence of creating well paying 
jobs and growth in this decade.
<P>
	The opening of markets around the world creates new 
opportunities for Canadian business. In Latin America and 
southeast Asia national economies are growing at a double digit 
pace. Yet almost 80 per cent of the Canada's trade continues to 
be with one nation, the United States. Despite the abundant 
opportunities abroad, as recently as 1990 only 100 firms 
accounted for 60 per cent of our exports. Only 7.6 per cent of 
Canadian firms are engaged in export trade. This is simply not 
good enough for a country as dependent on trade as we are to 
sustain our standard of living.
<P>
<B>(1210) </B>
<P>
	In a knowledge based world economy, technology and people 
define the difference between a firm in Singapore and one in 
Montreal. Yet less than one-half of 1 per cent of Canadian 
companies do research and development on their own. Not 
enough of our R and D winds up in products and services to 
create jobs at home. Canadian companies, particularly small 
businesses, have not integrated leading technologies as rapidly 
as their competitors abroad.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The message is clear. The number of businesses doing 
research and development and investing in state of the art 
technologies must increase dramatically.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The questions we have to answer are these: How are we going 
to make more than one in ten Canadian companies into 
exporters? How are we going to dramatically improve the 
number of Canadian companies that perform research and 
development? How are we going to match our global 
competitors in the use of new manufacturing and processing 
technologies?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	To succeed, we must have an economy based on innovation. 
We must rely on the strengths of small businesses which offer 
the best opportunities for growth and job creation. We must help 
small businesses where needed, that is with training, exports, 
high technology and financing.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As part of the budget the Minister of Finance and I have tabled 
an action agenda to help small businesses grow and to continue 
to generate jobs for Canadians. It is a small business agenda that 
is willing to help firms to take risks and to innovate. It is the 
small business that has the greatest potential for dynamic 
growth and job creation.
<P>
	At the top of our growth agenda is the vital consultative 
process that has been launched with the small business 
discussion paper. This consultation demonstrates that we are 
ready to listen and ready to act. The need to review our approach 
to science and technology to better support a knowledge based 
economy is also at the top of our growth agenda.
<P>
	As part of the budget, we announced a comprehensive 
re-evaluation of science and technology policy that will begin 
with the release of a discussion paper this spring. This process 
will build on budget initiatives to set a long-term course for 
science and technology policy focused on our greatest 
opportunity, the transfusion of R and D and technology into high 
value added products and services.
<P>
	A key feature of the knowledge based economy is the speed 
with which information is transferred. Economic success comes 
from freer, easier flows and exchanges of information. In this 
rapidly changing environment, the  prospect of linking 
Canadians to a high speed interactive multimedia network, a 
virtual information highway becomes critical to building our 
new economy.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Canada is a leader in telecommunications and we can rely on 
that strength. Investments, mostly from the private sector, are 
enormous. I will work in co-operation with industry and the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1777"> 1777 </A></B>
<P>
users of the information highway to ensure that governments 
play an active and creative role.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	An economic growth strategy is not a one budget issue. It is at 
the heart of the government's mission. I have reviewed today 
how we will elaborate on our growth agenda in coming months, 
particularly in the areas of small business, science and 
technology and the information highway. However this debate is 
also about what the government is doing to fulfil the immediate 
promises of the red book.
<P>
<B>(1215 ) </B>
<P>
	The answer is simple. We mean what we said. Capital is the 
catalyst that turns ideas into new products and services. The 
Canada investment fund will help provide that patient capital. 
We will contribute $100 million to the fund over four years and 
we will seek additional funds in the private sector. The fund will 
be operating before the start of the next fiscal year.
<P>
	We are working with the Canadian Bankers' Association on 
projects to improve financing for small business. These include 
the development of a banking code of conduct to clarify the 
relationship between borrower and lender and the search for new 
and better ways of providing regular and trade financing to 
knowledge based businesses.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We will work with the industrial sector to create networks that 
will help small businesses to form groups to do together what 
they cannot do alone.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Our competitors, particularly in Europe, recognize that 
networks are essential if small businesses are to compete 
internationally and gain competitive advantages of scale, scope 
and speed.
<P>
	Networks are particularly effective in innovation. They help 
small businesses develop new products and services, to put new 
and emerging technologies to work for them and to focus on 
marketing and exporting.
<P>
	We will improve the diffusion of innovation and the building 
of an innovation culture in business by committing $15 million 
this year for the creation of the Canadian technology network. 
The network will provide small businesses with the latest 
information on new technology, new management techniques 
and new market developments.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We want to set up an engineering and science program to help 
small businesses hire engineers, scientists, technicians or 
industrial designers. We will co-operate with the provinces and 
industry to develop this program and co-ordinate its 
implementation by 1995.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	To help turn research excellence into new products, growing 
industries and jobs, we are committing to start-up funding this 
year of $10 million for a national technology partnerships 
program. This program will promote the growth of technology 
partnerships and help small businesses turn research into new 
products, new services and new jobs.
<P>
	There is a great domestic and export growth potential for the 
environmental technology sector, particularly for small 
businesses. This sector is poised for growth and Canadians can 
benefit immeasurably from the jobs and exports created by 
environmental technologies.
<P>
	The Minister of the Environment and I are reviewing 
Canada's approach to the environmental technology sectors. 
When that review is complete we will table detailed plans for 
this strategic sector.
<P>
	The budget allocation of $800 million over 10 years for a new 
long-term space plan is proof of the government's commitment 
to Canada's continued role as a space-faring nation. The new 
space plan will be within our financial means and will build on 
our strengths in earth observation, remote sensing and satellite 
communications.
<P>
	A stable base for our research infrastructure is a vital part of 
improving our innovation capability. The National Research 
Council of Canada plays a key role in giving effect to the federal 
government's science and technology policies. This year we will 
provide the National Research Council with new resources to 
carry out its mandate.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It is important that we be able to promote and preserve our 
skills in the university research sector. University research and 
development are high priorities. This is why we continue this 
year to ensure the financing of the various granting agencies. 
Starting in 1995-96, we will give them an annual increase of 
about 1.5 per cent.
<P>
<B>(1220) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A significant part of Canada's academic research capability is 
the networks of centres of excellence program.
<P>
	We are making sure that there is enough funding to support the 
second phase of the program. In this second phase we will give 
greater weight to the economic and commercial potential of the 
networks to support our growth agenda based on innovation.
<P>
	As Canadians we have been through a lot in this last decade. 
Many of our fellow citizens approach the future with more 
anxiety than hope. Our mission as a government is to offer hope. 
But if hope is to be meaningful, it must be realistic. So we have 
put forth in this budget a plan for the revitalization of the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1778"> 1778 </A></B>
<P>
Canadian economy, a plan which I believe addresses the 
challenges and recognizes the opportunities that await Canada.
<P>
	This House was once told, and I quote: ``The times in which 
we are living call for initiative and resourcefulness on the part of 
industry. We must be constantly alive to the changes taking 
place in the world today and quick to seize every opportunity 
that will build up our economy. It cannot be done overnight but I 
am confident that with the co-operation of industry and of 
government we can build toward a better Canada and a better 
world''.
<P>
	Canadians heeded my predecessor, C. D. Howe, when he 
spoke those words in this place in 1948. Canadians showed 
initiative and resourcefulness. They worked together, they 
seized opportunity, and they launched Canada into a period of 
unparalleled vigorous growth and helped build a better world.
<P>
	We still have that initiative, that resourcefulness, that sense of 
shared opportunity. I am confident that we can harness it again 
to create a period of growth as we move into the next century 
that will match our great post-war expansion.
<P>
	I look forward to the co-operation of all Canadians and all 
members of this House in working toward that goal.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert):</B> First I have to say how 
much I enjoyed my colleague's speech about how enthusiastic 
he is about how bright the future of Canada perhaps will be. He 
talked about the electronic highway, and that of course is vitally 
important to the ability of this country to remain competitive in 
the years ahead.
<P>
	He talked about putting new technology to work. He talked 
about a $50 million program to provide assistance in the new 
technology. He talked about a program to hire scientists and 
engineers to ensure that we can move forward and develop new 
products. He talked about a $10 million program for new 
product partnerships. I thought this was just great and 
wonderful.
<P>
	If all these things are so important to Canada moving ahead 
and being competitive in the world, why are we spending $6 
billion to fix the roads and sewers when these things that he has 
outlined are so vitally important for the country to move ahead 
from this point forward?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manley:</B> I thank the member for his question because I 
think it is important for us to understand how economic growth 
is generated in the country. I think what is fundamental in the 
favourable comments that he made on the subject of some of the 
investments that we want to make with respect to the electronic 
highway, with respect to diffusion of technology, technology 
partnerships which get new inventions out into the marketplace, 
and what is very important about spending  in some of those 
areas is that it is seen as an investment in growth for the future.
<P>
	An analysis came out a week or so ago, produced by Statistics 
Canada, analysing what has made for success, made for growing 
small and medium sized firms in Canada. One point is that they 
have been prepared to invest in research. They are also good at 
applying new technologies.
<P>
	We have to understand when we spend whether we are 
consuming or whether we are investing.
<P>
	With respect to the infrastructure program, there are really 
two things that I would like to say in response to the member's 
question. First of all it was made an important point of the 
design of criteria for the program that the definition be broad 
enough to include expenditures that related to, for example, 
electronic highways, to things that would improve innovation 
that would allow investment in technology.
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>
<P>
	I am absolutely delighted that the Regional Municipality of 
Ottawa-Carleton, part of which I represent, has chosen to use 
some of its funds under the national infrastructure program to 
expand the communications network by investing in electronic 
highway capability for this region. I think that is exceptionally 
far-sighted on the part of local government and I applaud them 
for it.
<P>
	It must also be understood that the traditional infrastructure 
programs are also investments in economic growth in the future. 
True, they do provide short-term jobs, but just as at one time in 
our history it was the canals and at another time it was the 
railroads, currently in many areas it is the highways that are 
generating economic growth, highways, airports, means of 
transportation and communication. These are vital to economic 
growth in many parts of the country.
<P>
	Every government at every level needs to look at, and these 
issues are difficult because of the financial limitations on 
government, its expenditures very carefully to ensure that its 
expenditures represent investments in productivity gains for the 
future, not simply spending for current consumption. The 
emphasis has to be on building for the future so that we can 
afford our current level of consumption.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gérard Asselin (Charlevoix):</B> Madam Speaker, in 
response to the minister's speech, where he talked about sending 
a clear message, I would like to tell him that since the tabling in 
the House of this budget, which will be in effect until March 31, 
1995, Canadians and Quebecers do indeed find the message very 
clear.
<P>
	It is clear because, regardless of whether Conservatives or 
Liberals are at the helm, people no longer have any confidence 
at all in the present federal system. Let me explain: Canada is 
operating increasingly in the red. Both the budget and the deficit 
reflect this fact. Liberals, for a  second time, have set a record. 
The first one was when they created the deficit, under former 
Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau. This week, they set a 
second record, when they brought down a budget forecasting the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1779"> 1779 </A></B>
<P>
largest deficit ever, $39.7 billion; never before has a budget 
projected this large a deficit.
<P>
	How does the minister intend to reduce the deficit when he has 
tabled a budget forecasting a $39.7 billion deficit? I await his 
answer.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manley:</B> Madam Speaker, in my speech, I tried to explain 
what is not so hard to understand. I think that the key to deficit 
reduction is economic growth. Throughout the years under the 
previous government, we have learned that the Conservatives 
always thought that, by cutting expenditures and increasing 
taxes they could lower the deficit. It did not work.
<P>
	This year, we have a dreadful $40 billion deficit. If we want to 
tackle this problem, we will have to reduce government 
spending. That we have already acknowledged. But we must 
also limit tax increases. That is why the Minister of Finance 
stated that the deficit reduction measures announced in the 
budget will result in a cut of $5 in government expenditures for 
every one dollar raised in revenues. That is totally unlike the old 
tactics used by the Conservatives. We have also implemented an 
economic growth policy. We are prepared to invest in the new 
economy. We are prepared to help Canadian small businesses 
have access to international markets for their goods and 
services. That is the key to the problem.
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I would just like to say a couple of words in English. If we are 
going to solve the problem of the deficit over the long term there 
is only one realistic solution and that is to achieve substantial, 
sustainable economic growth. That is the plan of this budget.
<P>
	That is a diversion from the budgets of the previous 
government which relied entirely on a false hope that getting 
some of the macroeconomic fundamentals right was going to 
allow for economic growth as the grass grows in springtime. It 
simply did not work. We are going out into the fields, we are 
ploughing them, fertilizing them, we are trying to encourage 
economic growth. That is going to be the key to reducing the 
deficit in the future.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Jordan (Leeds-Grenville):</B> Madam Speaker, I just 
want to congratulate the minister on his fine speech. I am very 
sorry that we did not have the opportunity to question the Leader 
of the Opposition. I think that is a mistake because unless we 
have that exchange and dialogue we are not quite sure where the 
opposition stands in reference to the budget.
<P>
	If I understood correctly it was saying that the cuts did not go 
deep enough. I will never know for sure. I do know for sure that 
the Reform Party is saying that the cuts did not go nearly deep 
enough. It would have cut further and I guess would have been 
prepared to substantiate and defend the fallout.
<P>
	I want to ask the hon. minister if he saw any further area of 
substantial cuts that this budget could have imposed on the 
Canadian people, forgetting that there is a fallout; that innocent, 
hardworking, perhaps unemployed Canadian people will bear 
the negative effect of any further cuts we would have imposed 
on the Canadian people. That would have to be realized.
<P>
	I wonder where the Reform Party and the Bloc will be a year 
from today when we come in with a new budget. They will say 
further cuts, further cuts.
<P>
	I just wonder if the minister would care to pass judgment on 
that. If we consider that people are still the bottom line, will 
there still be that position a year from today when they think we 
should have made deeper cuts than we did?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manley:</B> Madam Speaker, I appreciate that question as 
well. I must say that what I find confusing about the position that 
the Official Opposition, the Bloc Quebecois, has been taking, 
and I heard part of its leader's speech, seemed to be that it was 
very dissatisfied with the fact that the deficit was too high.
<P>
	Yesterday in the House of Commons we heard its members 
raising question after question about the changes to the 
unemployment insurance regime which is effecting a reduction 
in the deficit and a reduction in payroll taxes. They send us very 
contradictory messages and it is impossible to understand how 
their ultimate political objectives which they proclaim on a 
regular basis of separatism are going to do anything but add to 
the burden of costs on the people of Canada and the people of 
Quebec.
<P>
	With respect to the Reform Party, the comment is correct. The 
view has been consistently presented. I do not agree with some 
of the views that have been put forward by the Reform Party, 
particularly with respect to  what it has said about eliminating 
all assistance to business.
<P>
	For example, in the areas of concern to me, science and 
technology, it is the scientific research and development tax 
credit which gives about a $1 billion a year assistance to 
advanced technology companies in Canada which has made 
Canada a desired location for much of the R and D facilities that 
are here now.
<P>
	In my speech I talked about how we do not have enough. If I 
had time I could list examples of companies that have chosen to 
locate facilities in Canada, high paying, high value added jobs, 
because of that assistance. It is provided by other countries. That 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1780"> 1780 </A></B>
<P>
kind of work is footloose. It can be here, it can be in the U.S., it 
can be in Europe, or it can be in Asia.
<P>
<B>(1235 ) </B>
<P>
	If we are going to secure those kinds of jobs, unfortunately or 
fortunately, depending on how one looks at it, we have to be 
prepared to create a tax and economic environment which is as 
favourable to those efforts as is offered by our competitors.
<P>
	Further, I would like to say that there are ways we can make 
more progress on reducing the deficit. Let me give one example. 
The elimination of internal trade barriers within Canada could 
generate as much as a 1 per cent increase in our GDP, a product 
of $6 billion to $7 billion a year. Why is it that so many 
provinces are still not willing to come to the table and say they 
will do it by June 30?
<P>
	We have signals of goodwill. We signed an agreement last 
month but there is a lot of work to do. I hope that we will see all 
of the provinces and the federal government sign such an 
agreement.
<P>
	We have to come to grips with areas of duplication between 
levels of government. That effort is being spearheaded by the 
Prime Minister and the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs. 
That will enable us to deliver government services more 
efficiently and help us make more progress on the deficit in 
years to come.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert):</B> Madam Speaker, February 
22, 1994 will go down in Canadian history as the day that the 
Minister of Finance failed to rise to the challenge of coming to 
grips with the fiscal problems facing this nation.
<P>
	This government has a debt in excess of $500 billion and an 
annual deficit of $45 billion. The Minister of Finance has 
brought down an uninspiring and tepid budget with nothing but a 
little more taxes and a little less spending that barely addresses 
the issue of deficit reduction and elimination. By his own 
admission, the actions that the minister announced in this House 
on Tuesday will only reduce next year's deficit by $1.5 billion, 
from $41.2 billion to $39.7 billion.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance had led us to believe that he was 
launching a major attack on the debt and deficit of this country. 
This was to be a tough budget, he said. He  was going to break 
the back of the deficit and we all expected that the Minister of 
Finance was going to be decisive. His budget reduces the size of 
the expected debt in this country next year by less than .3 of 1 
per cent. Is that what he calls an attack on the debt and deficit? Is 
that being decisive?
<P>
	I have challenged the Minister of Finance on several 
occasions. I will say it again. Will the Minister of Finance dare 
to be great and balance the budget by the end of this Parliament? 
I have stated that he could choose mediocrity or he could choose 
to rise above mediocrity and reach beyond himself and lead this 
nation out of the dark tunnel of deficits and debt and into the 
sunshine of renewed prosperity. History has always given the 
accolades to the leaders who rise to the challenge while those 
who have failed to rise to the challenge have been buried in the 
ignominy of their failure along with their mediocrity.
<P>
	It would appear to me that we may find the name of the 
Minister of Finance and his red book, or perhaps red ink book, 
buried in the footnotes of history along with his indecisive and 
inadequate policies.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance broke new ground on January 31 by 
holding the first ever parliamentary pre-budget debate in this 
House. At that time he was demonstrating his leadership. He had 
no shortage of innovative ideas presented to him. If he had 
listened to Canadians he would have heard that they were 
disgusted with budgets that profess to address our fiscal 
problems through a little more taxes and a little less spending 
while waiting for the panacea to fall out of the sky.
<P>
	This budget, in my opinion, has failed the test of financial 
leadership since the deficit and the debt tunnel has just been 
extended again. There is no sign of that ray of sunshine of 
renewed prosperity. According to my calculations, the light at 
the end of the tunnel may have been turned off as a result of lack 
of leadership and lack of vision.
<P>
	In his report, the Auditor General stated that hard choices lie 
ahead. This government continues to pay millions of dollars of 
old age security to high income families.
<P>
<B>(1240 ) </B>
<P>
	These taxes are paid by working people, many of them just 
scraping by. To continue paying old age security to high income 
families means that he, the Minister of Finance, has dodged the 
hard choices which still lie ahead.
<P>
	What about unemployment insurance? The Minister of 
Finance proposes to narrow the gap between employment 
income and unemployment insurance payments for people with 
modest income and dependants, thereby further reducing the 
incentive to work.
<P>
	If there is one thing this country needs it is more jobs. This 
budget has presented easy choices but no jobs. The bad news is 
that the hard choices still lie ahead.
<P>
	A previous Liberal government, back in the seventies, 
promised us a just society but delivered to us a debt society. If 
we examine the track record of the seventies we will see that the 
previous Liberal government spent beyond its means and the net 
result was a plethora of social programs and a mountain of debt.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1781"> 1781 </A></B>
<P>
	In the eighties the Tory governments promised to reverse this 
alarming trend. Every budget in the last 10 years has professed 
to address the annual deficits as they continue to consume our 
economy like a cancerous growth. What was sold to us, sold to 
Canadians as a just society by the Liberal governments in the 
seventies, turned us into a debt society in the eighties. The 
Minister of Finance's budget by this new Liberal government 
gives us every indication that, in turn, this will turn us into a 
bankrupt society in the nineties.
<P>
	I have spoken in this House of the difficult choices and how 
we have surmounted them in the past. I have drawn parallels 
between our current situation and the period at the end of World 
War II when the federal debt was 108 per cent of our gross 
domestic product. We had back then what we would call today a 
peace dividend as we wound down the war effort.
<P>
	That was not a time without problems, however. Soldiers were 
returning from the war with no jobs; industry was in transition. 
The leaders of our nation at that time were able to open the door 
to a period of unprecedented growth and prosperity through 
leadership and vision.
<P>
	Members will note that I said leadership and vision opened 
the door by using the peace dividend to buy the prosperity. We 
did not use it to buy more social programs.
<P>
	We can do the same today by creating our own deficit 
elimination dividend. This country needs a dramatic 
realignment of our resources toward the opportunities available 
in this rapidly changing technological world. We have talents 
and resources that are in high demand around the world.
<P>
	If we start exploiting these opportunities and teach our 
citizens to build on our advantages rather than holding each 
other's hand through social programs, it will be then that this 
country will have a bright future. The sunshine of renewed 
prosperity will once again be realized so that we can pass that 
prosperity on to our children.
<P>
	Unfortunately, the Minister of Finance has put that reality on 
hold for yet another year, if not indefinitely. The deficit 
elimination dividend, obtained through a dramatic 
reorganization of our priorities that will balance the budget by 
the end of this Parliament, is the only hope that I can see for the 
return to economic prosperity in this country.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance has failed to secure the economic 
future of this country. He did not rise to the challenge. He did not 
dare to be great and he passed up on an opportunity to balance 
the budget in this Parliament.
<P>
	The day of fiscal reckoning cannot be postponed. We must 
face it and we will face it. Based on the budget tabled yesterday, 
Canadians will have to face that day of reckoning on their own 
without the leadership of this government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Graham (Rosedale):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
congratulate the hon. member on his remarks.
<P>
	I would like to ask him a couple of questions that arose out of 
his remarks. The first is a specific one and the second is more 
general.
<P>
<B>(1245 ) </B>
<P>
	The member made specific reference to the fact that in his 
view old age security to high income families was still being 
paid as a result of the budget. Exactly what level does the 
member and his party set as high income? Where does the 
member set the line? Where would he cut the line and say that 
thereafter no one would get supplementary payments?
<P>
	As the member knows the budget referred to a possible cap at 
$49,000. Where does the hon. member drop it to? Would it be 
$30,000 or $35,000? What is the member's definition of a high 
income family? The member heard the minister specifically say 
that the budget was trying to deal with the problem of people 
trying to survive in complex urban societies who need money to 
live. The top cap is $49,000. Where would the member draw that 
line?
<P>
	It is easy to criticize, but we were here when the Minister of 
Industry explained what was in the budget for precisely, it seems 
to me, the types of items the member has been talking about: the 
need to get the economy going and the need for small businesses 
to have government services that would enable them to 
participate fully in the economy.
<P>
	Is the member suggesting that all those should be cut as well? 
Where is the member going to cut in three years to bring us down 
to a flat no debt position?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Madam Speaker, in response to the member's 
question, during the last election we stated quite specifically 
that we would cut back the old age security from families 
making more than $54,000.
<P>
	During the election campaign when I told seniors that our 
policy was to cut off the old age security for families making 
more than $54,000, their response was generally that they 
wished they could have earned $54,000 a year as a family. Why 
should hard working Canadians, many of whom are just scraping 
by, pay their taxes for retired people to be in Florida, Hawaii or 
California courtesy of the taxpayers of the country?
<P>
	I will address the second question. I listened to the excellent 
speech of the Minister of Industry earlier this  morning. I raised 
the point then and I will repeat it again: Why are we spending $6 
billion in infrastructure programs based on sewers, roads and 
low tech jobs when there is such a great need to ensure that the 
country is competitive around the world in the area of high 
priced jobs where education is required, where it is important 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1782"> 1782 </A></B>
<P>
that we can compete? I have always said that the differences 
between $20 an hour jobs in Canada and $1 an hour jobs in 
Mexico are motivation and education. That is where we should 
be taking the $6 billion and putting it into high tech jobs.
<P>
	We cancelled a helicopter program that was to create all kinds 
of research and development in the country in order to pave a 
road from here to there. That is where this government's 
priorities are wrong. It does not have a philosophy and a real 
plan of what it is trying to do. It is trying to appease various 
different projects with short-term solutions.
<P>
	If we finally got our act together we could accomplish what 
the minister was trying to say. At the same time we could 
balance the budget and ensure that the country has a future for 
our children.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Madam Speaker, 
this is the defining moment for the new government because the 
first budget sets the tone for the next four years of Liberal 
policy. I want to talk today about a definition of my own. It 
defines my view of the substance of the budget. There are some 
good things in the budget I could spend a good deal of time 
talking about, but I will talk about those things that are most 
disappointing.
<P>
	Here we are in a most critical period of our economic history 
and the government has gone soft. Instead of clenching its fists 
and getting tough with the deficit and debt at a time when world 
markets are watching our every move, the government has opted 
for a limp-wristed approach. At this defining moment for the 
new government the word I use to define this disappointing 
budget is flaccid. The dictionary defines flaccid as limp, flabby, 
less rigid, lacking vigour and feeble. How appropriate.
<P>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
	The budget is more important for what it does not address than 
what it does. I want to ask why the budget has not done more or, 
to paraphrase an American statesman, instead of looking at 
things the way they are and asking why, I am here today to look 
at the way they could be and ask why not.
<P>
	My focus today is on what was not cut and why. There are no 
details of significant cuts to spending on things like foreign aid, 
wasteful aspects of bilingualism programs, ineffective 
multiculturalism programs, subsidies to crown corporations, 
and grants and subsidies to special interest lobby groups. Quite 
frankly the reason the government avoided these areas is that 
they are politically dangerous.
<P>
	The time for safe, non-contentious decision making is past. It 
astounds me that members across the floor still refuse to 
acknowledge the seriousness of the country's financial 
situation. If we want to gain the confidence of business and the 
general public we have to make tough decisions now; not two 
years from now after more studies, but right now.
<P>
	Let me illustrate some needless cuts. I will start with the <I>b</I> 
word, bilingualism. The media like to jump on anyone who 
mentions this issue and brand him or her anti-Quebec. It makes 
good ink and is guaranteed a predictable response from Quebec 
members. There is a difference between talking about the theory 
of bilingualism and the outrageous waste of money that 
sometimes accompanies the application of that theory.
<P>
	I am talking about the needless waste of money. When it 
comes to official bilingualism, the act itself, we have absolutely 
no idea of how bad the problem of wasteful spending is. I would 
like to quote from a letter of a government official:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The true costs of official languages activities from the Department of 
National Defence are higher than those given. Unfortunately, Treasury Board 
reporting guidelines do not permit us to report, among other things, salaries of 
military personnel attending continuous language training-and the 
bilingualism bonus for civilian employees.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Millions of dollars were spent on translating manuals for 
frigates, but that figure is buried in the budget for the frigates, 
sunk so deep below the sea of numbers no one could ever dredge 
up the real true costs. While the commissioner may report the 
cost of official languages as about $654 million as he did in 
1992, the number means nothing. A report released last year 
puts it somewhere between $2 billion and $4 billion. What is the 
truth? No one knows.
<P>
	Since 1969, according to a report released last year, language 
policy added $49 billion to the federal debt. The effect on 
provincial debt and the compliance cost of private industry are 
left to our imagination. Where does it end?
<P>
	The government has also gone weak in the knees in the area of 
foreign aid. Flaccid is the word. The Auditor General's report 
cites a litany of mismanagement, especially in the area of 
foreign aid. The Canadian International Development Agency, 
CIDA, has become a cash cow. The Auditor General reports that 
CIDA is trying to please too many interest groups and meet too 
many conflicting objectives. The result is an agency with a 
budget of over $1 billion a year that is characterized by 
confusion and ineffectiveness.
<P>
	What is really confusing is the government's refusal to look to 
this area for major cuts. It cannot even use the excuse that it is a 
politically contentious area since criticism of the effectiveness 
of foreign aid spending is coming from all directions. What is 
the government waiting for? In 1993 the federal government 
spent just  under $2.7 billion on international assistance with 
little or no tangible proof of any kind of results.
<P>
	The horror story continues into the area of-dare I say it-the 
<I>m</I> word, the department of multiculturalism.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>

<P>
<B>(1255 ) </B>
<P>
	I am disturbed by some of the commentary in the Chamber 
this week. I firmly and deeply believe we are all equal regardless 
of race, colour or creed. Every single Canadian should be proud 
to stand and proclaim his heritage, but he should not expect 
every other Canadian to finance his group's cultural activities. 
These groups must be self-supporting.
<P>
	In 1992-93 federal government spending on multiculturalism 
was nearly $120 million. What is frightening is the response I 
got from a researcher when I tried to get the figure. He told us he 
was having trouble getting a response from government 
departments that incur costs as a result of multiculturalism 
programs. In other words again we have no idea what is the true 
cost of multiculturalism.
<P>
	A short time ago the deficit was supposed to be $33 billion. 
That was around the time when the election campaign started. 
During the election the government would not even tell us what 
it was. The new government took over and the number 
suspiciously grew. It went to $42 billion and all of a sudden we 
are told it could reach $46 billion. Now we are supposed to feel 
happy with a figure of $39.7 billion. It has to stop.
<P>
	In closing I leave the House with my definition of flaccid. I 
will redefine the term. For the purposes of this discussion I will 
use the acronym, FLACCID. The previous Progressive 
Conservative government promised tough measures, but when it 
came to making the politically tough decisions it withered under 
the pressure. The present government was elected on the 
promise it would tackle this critical problem too, but its feeble 
attempt to come to grips with our financial woes suggests 
another definition of flaccid applies. The acronym stands for 
federal Liberals are cunning Conservatives in disguise.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to 
congratulate my colleague on his speech. That is not to say that I 
agree with everything he said. There are things I would like him 
to go over again. I did not understand everything he said about 
multiculturalism. He spoke too fast and I do not understand 
English all that well yet. I am trying very hard to learn but it 
takes a lot of time.
<P>
	I would like to give the hon. member the opportunity to 
reiterate his thoughts on the reduction of the multiculturalism 
budget. I want to be sure that as long as Canada exists, English 
and French will be spoken in this country, and that the cuts 
regarding multiculturalism will not change that. I would like an 
answer from the hon. member.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, the cutting 
back of multiculturalism I was talking about is about $21.5 
million relating to grants to cultural groups. That is not the only 
cut that has to come about. I listed only a few.
<P>
	I am surprised government members would really believe 
Canadians would re-elect them in view of where they have 
already started to go. Their deficit is higher than anyone 
expected. We can look at what happened last week in the House.
<P>
	We asked a question of the Prime Minister about why they 
gave away a patronage payment of $4.5 million to his riding to 
build a museum. They spent $172,000 on one minister to take 
one flight to make a speech. They gave $27 million to Quebec 
City for a conference centre. They blew away $120 million by 
misfinancing CBC. They took over a deficit of $33 billion. They 
said it was going to be $45 billion and now they say we should be 
happy at $40 billion.
<P>
<B>(1300 ) </B>
<P>
	There is a saying that goes: If you forget the past, you are 
condemned to repeat it. The past is the Conservative 
government. The government is condemned to repeat it if it 
keeps on the same road.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened with 
interest to my friend's commentary. What caught my attention 
was his reference to the fact that he thought the Liberal 
government looked very much like past Conservative 
governments.
<P>
	What gave my hon. friend the clue? Was it the fact that the 
Conservatives promoted NAFTA? Of course the Liberals 
opposed NAFTA and then after they became the government 
they signed it. The Conservatives supported cruise missile 
testing and the Liberals opposed it, but when they got into 
government they too approved cruise missile testing. In 
opposition, my hon. friend opposite often spoke against payroll 
taxes, and one of the first things the government did was, of 
course, increase payroll taxes.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> They rolled it back.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Riis:</B> Well, indeed, introduced it and a few days later 
rolled it back.
<P>
	But are these items some of the reasons that my hon. friend 
thought that the present government looks an awful lot like the 
Conservative government?
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, I like the way 
the hon. member got his speech in by asking the questions. He 
made some very good points. Yes, we learn fast, we new 
members. I suppose I could use those too.
<P>
	I guess what reminds me most of the Conservative 
government over here is the acceptance of deficit financing and 
the very acceptance by virtue of their budget that the debt will 
increase by $100 billion in three years. It was not a problem with 
the Conservatives and it is not a problem with the Liberals.

<P>
	<B>Hon. Audrey McLaughlin (Yukon):</B> Madam Speaker, on 
February 1, the Minister of Finance stated in this House, and I 
quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>There is a profound sense that the status quo simply will not do and that if we 
continue on our current path then that would be a road to nowhere.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Having read the latest budget, I realize that, unfortunately, it 
will lead us nowhere. Why? Because it does not deviate in any 
significant way from the course taken by the Conservatives over 
the last nine years.
<P>
	The Liberals were elected because they promised jobs. Yet, 
there are 29,000 fewer jobs in Canada today than there were 
when the present government took office. Voters clearly showed 
the previous government how they felt about the unacceptable 
unemployment level. With this budget, the present government 
did not keep its word.
<P>
	Page 9 of the budget makes the point clearly: ``The 
unemployment rate will continue to exceed 10 per cent in the 
foreseeable future''. There is no hope for unemployed 
Canadians. One in five workers in Canada is unemployed or has 
a part-time job because full-time jobs are impossible to find.
<P>
	The budget simply abandons these people to pave the way for 
a jobless recovery.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Canadians have had enough of what the former government 
used to call the jobless recovery. I ask the government why are 
there no targets in the budget for reducing unemployment? 
There are deficit reduction targets, as there should be, but also 
accompanying those should be targets on reducing 
unemployment.
<P>
	What is the government's expectation other than, as we see by 
the budget, that we will have double digit unemployment in the 
next few years? Instead of choosing to attack unemployment the 
government in this budget chose to attack, once again, as its 
predecessor did, the unemployed.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance told us early on through the whole 
pre-budget consultations that everyone would share equally in 
the pain of this budget. I ask people to consider the facts and 
whether Canadians have shared equally in the pain of this 
budget.
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
	Fact one, fully 50 per cent of the spending reductions in the 
budget are on the backs of the unemployed.
<P>
	Fact two, the poor who rely on the social safety net lose $2 
billion. The social policy review has been given its final 
mandate before it even begins.
<P>
	Fact three, the provinces face cuts in transfers, increased 
welfare costs when unemployment runs out and there are no jobs 
to be found. The budget is a very elaborate offloading to the 
provinces and territories and to unemployed Canadians.
<P>
	Fact four, the Atlantic provinces get more than their fair share 
of the pain. With unemployment levels as high as 20 per cent in 
the Atlantic provinces, facing base closures, reductions in 
income, reduced fisheries compensation and no jobs, no one can 
look at the budget and say that the pain has been shared equally.
<P>
	These last few months since the election of the government 
we have witnessed a range of consultation initiatives. Let us 
look at what the budget really says about what those initiatives 
will mean. Prebudget consultations were held when it is clear 
that the budget is just going to be a continuation of previous 
governments. When the Minister of Finance looked in the mirror 
he saw his predecessor, Don Mazankowski.
<P>
	Defence reviews are being held when the government has 
already moved on the issue of defence. Social policy reviews are 
promised to be held when the budget in fact sets the parameters 
for that very debate. Negotiations on transfers to the provinces 
are also to be negotiated or reviewed, we are told. However, the 
finance department has already determined what the outcome 
will be with this budget. Lip service is being given to collective 
bargaining in this budget, but the budget precludes it.
<P>
	On February 2, 1994 there were 29,000 fewer jobs in Canada 
than on October 25, 1993. The government was elected with the 
hope that it would make good on its promises to create jobs and 
to get Canadians back to work. What does this budget show? It 
shows 25,000 fewer jobs in the public service, 16,500 jobs from 
defence. We did not know that the government's job plan was 
going to work in reverse after it got elected. This budget shows 
that is exactly what is going to happen.
<P>
	The minister said we would all share the pain equally. I ask 
Canadians if they feel it is fair that $6 billion was cut from the 
unemployed while the rich still get to deduct 50 per cent from 
the cost of their cruises and hunting trips. The unemployed will 
be getting more trips too, but those trips will just be to the food 
banks.
<P>
	The wealthy certainly did not need to fear the budget. They 
will still get to hide their money in private trusts, untouched. 
The 63,000 profitable corporations will still go untaxed, 
untouched. Offshore profits are untouched by the government.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	That is why, on behalf of Canadian workers and also on behalf 
of about six million Canadians who want to work, I ask the 
Minister of Finance to send back his work boots. The last thing 
we need is to be kicked while we are down.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1785"> 1785 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The budget clearly shows that the Minister of Finance should 
send back his work boots. We do not need to be kicked while we 
are down.
<P>
	Elements of the budget have not given hope to Canadians as it 
should have done. It has not restored consumer confidence that 
needed to get our economy on the rise.
<P>
<B>(1310 ) </B>
<P>
	The government has failed on all counts but most seriously it 
has failed the faith of Canadians, the faith that Canadians 
elected it to provide jobs to get them back to work. In fact more 
people are out of work.
<P>
	Later in this session I will be presenting a private member's 
bill on full employment. It will ask the government and require 
the government to set employment targets, to put before the 
House on a regular basis through the Minister of Labour a report 
on how those targets have been achieved and to give a full report 
to every member about the objectives of the government in 
terms of job creation. The time is long past when empty rhetoric 
and promises will do. Canadians want to see a pay cheque, not a 
promise.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry):</B> Madam Speaker, I want to say to the member for 
Yukon that whenever a budget is put forward there will always 
be people, through change and transition, who will go through 
some pain.
<P>
	I want to say to the member that we feel the pain that a lot of 
those people-we do not feel all of the pain, but we feel a little 
bit of the pain-are going through, especially on those bases in 
Atlantic Canada.
<P>
	The member knows we inherited a fiscal framework that was 
dramatically different from all of the forecasts to which we had 
access. We have been caught in a very tough bind. It is our 
collective responsibility to try to get some kind of confidence 
going in this country.
<P>
	There is an area in the budget that the member refused to talk 
about or forgot to talk about and that is the area around small 
business. The member for Yukon has made tremendous speeches 
on the importance of small business. Small business represents 
our greatest hope for putting Canadians back to work. It 
represents our greatest hope for liquidating the unemployment 
problem. I think she has to be fair and recognize that there are 
many good things related to small business in the budget.
<P>
	I have heard from small business people and already just the 
mere fact that the Minister of Finance announced we would be 
having a comprehensive study on access to capital for small 
business has caused a positive response in the community. 
Banks right now are beginning to trip over themselves in 
providing a more aggressive lending practice toward small 
business. That is a good feature of the budget and I do not think 
we should forget it.
<P>
	The other thing related to small business in the budget is the 
continuation of that good idea about new home ownership from 
the RRSP pool for first time buyers. In my community there are 
many people in the trades; carpenters, plumbers, home builders 
who are happy about that and already we can see some activity in 
the home building industry. That is another good part of the 
budget.
<P>
	My only point to the member for Yukon is that, yes, this is a 
tough budget and I acknowledge that. We have ourselves in a 
fiscal bind, the likes of which we have never seen in this country. 
When we talk about the budget she should at least acknowledge 
that there are some portions of it that really are exceptional. The 
section relating to small business is headed in the right 
direction.
<P>
<B>(1315) </B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. McLaughlin:</B> Madam Speaker, I will agree with my hon. 
friend. I certainly concur with an emphasis on small business 
but I would remind my hon. friend that small businesses rely on 
customers. If farmers are going bankrupt and factories and 
mines are closing across this country, there are not going to be 
many customers.
<P>
	We have to make the link between the two. People living on 
reduced unemployment insurance with no hope of a job and 
people living on reduced social assistance are certainly not 
going to be viable customers for the small businesses that my 
friend mentions.
<P>
	I agree that the Canada investment fund, a fund that we 
proposed during the election, is important to get venture capital 
to small businesses. I support that. I hope members opposite will 
review the proposal of the New Democratic Party. It was 
reasonable. There are some similarities to that of the Liberal 
Party. We share some good ideas on that. The hon. member 
across and I both share the necessity of ensuring that part of our 
economy is stimulated.
<P>
	I would like to mention two other points on small business. I 
note that the budget says that Canadian business centres will be 
established in every province. I hope that was just a lapse. We 
from the territories have to pick up on this lapse and hope that 
there will be one in Yukon and the Northwest Territories as well. 
I am assuming that there was a temporary amnesia there. We do 
have two territories that cover one-third of Canada's land mass.
<P>
	The second point I would like to make is with regard to the 
negotiations, and I applaud the government for doing this, with 
banks and financial institutions in terms of venture capital to 
small business. While it is not my place in this period to ask a 
question, I will phrase it as a comment. I hope that in this 
consultation the government will raise with financial 
institutions the possibility of looking at a formula whereby the 
savings 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1786"> 1786 </A></B>
<P>
that come into a particular financial institution from a 
community or a portion thereof will be reinvested in that 
community.
<P>
	One of the main problems we have is that a very large 
proportion of Canadians' savings is not being invested in 
Canada. It is being invested offshore. We must encourage 
Canadians to invest in their own country, something that the 
province of Quebec and Quebecers learned a long time ago and 
we could take a lesson from.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops):</B> Madam Speaker, I am pleased 
to have an opportunity to participate in today's debate.
<P>
	I listened to eight or nine Conservative budgets. After each 
budget I could almost hear the champagne corks popping on St. 
James Street in Montreal, on Bay Street in Toronto and on Howe 
Street in Vancouver because almost inevitably that same group 
was always pleased with the Conservative budget.
<P>
	Of course working people just shuddered because they knew 
that they would be slapped with additional taxes, they would be 
hacked here and there and slashed up. Indeed, they were never 
disappointed because that is exactly what happened time after 
time after time.
<P>
	When the election came along in October, the people of 
Canada said that they were going to send a clear message to 
Ottawa and they jettisoned all of the Tories, except two. They 
said that they were going to send the strongest message possible 
and set these Tories back so far they were never going to come 
back, at least in the foreseeable future. They disappeared almost 
like the dinosaurs.
<P>
	The people of Canada said that they wanted a government 
with a strong mandate, one that was going to do something 
totally different. There was going to be a new direction. There 
was going to be a new approach. We would get off this monetary 
and fiscal policy that we saw in the past and the government was 
going to create jobs. It went on and on.
<P>
	In the red book there were jobs here, jobs there, jobs, jobs. Of 
course, this was what Canadians wanted to hear. Therefore they 
elected the Liberals. Almost the next day things started to 
change. There is a magic conversion that takes place when 
Liberals walk across that central aisle and occupy the seats on 
the right hand side of you, Madam Speaker.
<P>
	I can see all my friends across there. I remember their 
passionate speeches against NAFTA, how NAFTA was going to 
be the killer of jobs. I heard ``killer of jobs'' echo throughout 
this Chamber days on end. The first thing they did was sign 
NAFTA. This sort of jarred people. They wondered what was 
going on.
<P>
	Of course, they remembered the payroll taxes that those mean 
and nasty Conservatives used to impose on small business. The 
first thing the government did was to impose another payroll 
tax. The people of Canada started to get a little shell-shocked at 
this.
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
	Then they remembered that cruise missile testing by the 
United States was coming up for renewal. They remembered all 
of the Liberals saying for years that this was dastardly, that it 
was caving in to the Americans, and they would never do that. 
When the time came, they did that too. They agreed to it.
<P>
	I could go on and on, but I think I have made my point. Before 
we even got started, people were dazed because suddenly the 
Liberals started to break their promises and do exactly what they 
said they would not do. They enacted exactly what they said they 
would never enact.
<P>
	Along comes the budget. I guess Canadians thought: Well, 
here is a chance because Liberals were elected to do a job, and 
that job was to create jobs. What Canadians got was a snow job.
<P>
	Look at this budget. I am sure that if you went back a few days 
you would find there were some ghostwriters such as Michael 
Wilson and perhaps Don Mazankowski. Perhaps they wrote that 
budget. Maybe Kim Campbell slipped back from Harvard and 
added her two bits worth.
<P>
	Has there been a significant departure in terms of domestic 
policy in this country? No. Has there been a change in monetary 
policy? No. I know there is a new Governor of the Bank of 
Canada, sort of a John Crow look-alike. He says that the same 
monetary policy will continue.
<P>
	Is there a shift in policy? No. Canadians were hoping for a 
different kind of budget that would actually put people back to 
work. What did they find? If they read the budget carefully and 
they go to page 9, they may ask what the government predicts all 
of this is going to do. They read through and, lo and behold, they 
find that unemployment levels will continue in double digits for 
the foreseeable future.
<P>
	After all the red book rhetoric, the budget plan says that 
unemployment will continue at essentially the same level for 
this year, next year and on into the future.
<P>
	<B>Ms. McLaughlin:</B> And it is a blue book.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Riis:</B> Yes, this is a blue book. They did not even change 
the bloody colour, for Pete's sake.
<P>
	We had a chance to start setting targets. When it came to 
reducing the deficit, targets were set. This is what we anticipate 
the debt reduction to be. However, when it came to setting 
targets for reducing unemployment, they were woefully absent 
from the budget. This is a serious oversight and it is really too 
bad.
<P>
	We have the old approach to the Peter Pan school of 
economics. We thought it would be something a little bit 
different from the Liberals; that if you really believe that 
unemployment will come down, it will. But you have to take 
action. You have to set 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1787"> 1787 </A></B>
<P>
targets and then introduce strategies to reduce those levels of 
unemployment. That is not in this budget. It is not in here.
<P>
	Here is what happened to me personally. I received calls from 
a number of small businesses in Kamloops. They called and 
said: ``We have not read the budget, Nelson, but what is in it for 
us?'' I told them there were a couple of things, that there would 
be a network established and so on so they could bid on 
international contracts. I was told: ``I am running a hair salon'' 
or ``I am running a welding shop, I am not going to be exporting 
my services overseas. What is in it for us?'' I had to say, with a 
heavy heart, that there was nothing in it for the average business 
person in this country.
<P>
	The unemployed, as my hon. leader indicated, were again hit 
with this budget. The victims of these government policies have 
been now hit. It is a strange way to run a government. We accept 
it, but it is a continuation of what we saw for the last nine years 
under the Mulroney regime.
<P>
	I want to give credit to the government on one point. Actually 
I could give it credit on a number but let us just pick one. When it 
was changing the unemployment insurance system, it 
acknowledged that some people would be really hard hit. I am 
thinking particularly of single parents or low income families 
with dependent children or adults that they are caring for. Their 
benefits went up slightly. In other words, there was 
acknowledgement that some people were hard hit.
<P>
	Is there anything in here for the 1.5 million kids who are 
living in poverty today?
<P>
	<B>Ms. McLaughlin:</B> No. Not a thing.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Riis:</B> Not a single word, not a word.
<P>
<B>(1325 ) </B>
<P>
	What about the public servants? The public service was hit in 
this budget. As a matter of fact 25,000 will likely lose their jobs 
over the next three years as a result of this budget. The 
government said it was going to freeze their salaries once again.
<P>
	Does it make sense to freeze everybody when messengers or 
people who shovel snow off sidewalks have annual incomes in 
many cases below $20,000 and deputy ministers have incomes 
in excess of $120,000? It does not acknowledge the fact that 
some federal government workers are struggling to simply 
survive.
<P>
	The government showed sensitivity when it came to changing 
UI programs. Why did it not show that same sensitivity to the 
people who actually work for the government? As somebody 
said the other day, it is like bombing your own troops.
<P>
	Show some compassion, show some sensitivity. There are 
people who work for the federal government right now who 
quite frankly are just managing to survive by the skin of their 
teeth. They are suffering. There should have been an 
acknowledgement about that in terms of that blanket across the 
board freezing of salaries.
<P>
	My greatest disappointment is that a handful of people are 
probably still drinking champagne. Those are the richest 
families in Canada who had a special tax loophole provided for 
them by a previous government, actually by the Liberals which 
was then updated by the Conservatives. There is not a single tax 
lawyer or single tax accountant in this country who says family 
trusts make any sense at all, not a single one.
<P>
	I remember when the experts were before the finance 
committee. The financial advisers were asked what they thought 
of this particular tax exemption. They all thought it was crazy. 
They thought it was nutty. They thought the government was 
goofy to do this.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance had a chance to show that even the 
very wealthy in this country are going to have to pay their fair 
share this time under this new government. Did he close that 
loophole? Oh, no. The government is going to study it. What on 
earth is there to study about a loophole that everybody agrees is 
absolutely dastardly?
<P>
	In closing, it was a missed opportunity. I could go on and 
hopefully I will have an opportunity later. I must say that those 
Canadians who were hoping for a change of course from the last 
nine years of Brian Mulroney are very disappointed after this 
budget.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Jordan (Leeds-Grenville):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
think anyone who campaigned in the last election found out that 
very high on the priority list of Canadians was the need to 
address the national debt and the national accumulating deficits. 
I notice my good friend from Kamloops did not allude to that.
<P>
	Today I think we know where the Reform would stand. They 
would say: ``Correct that by deeper cuts''. I think I know where 
the BQ stands, if I understood their leader this morning. We did 
not get a chance to dialogue with him because of the new rule. I 
think he was saying: ``We would be in favour of deeper cuts, that 
way of getting at the national debt''.
<P>
	I wonder if the hon. member for Kamloops would tell me 
where the NDP stands in relation to national debt. Were the cuts 
deep enough, too deep or just right?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Riis:</B> I think it is fair to say that there were some changes 
that could have had a very serious impact in terms of deficit 
reduction. I named one, the closing off of some of the glaring tax 
loopholes like the family trust loophole, a consideration of a 
wealth tax. Again, we are one of the very few countries in the 
world that does not have a wealth tax. These are not going to 
solve the deficit problem but they would show good faith in 
moving in the right direction.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1788"> 1788 </A></B>
<P>
	I think if a person wins $5 million on a lottery they would not 
mind paying some tax on that. I do not think anybody would say 
that is an unfair request.
<P>
	The question of a minimum corporate tax that we have often 
discussed in this House is something that deserves examining. 
In other words a whole number of changes to the tax system 
would generate an awful lot of wealth.
<P>
	This budget assumes that the deficit will be brought down, 
which we all support. No one in this House would say we do not 
have a serious debt crisis and a deficit problem and we have to 
take steps to get it down.
<P>
	This budget assumes that because of the steps taken there will 
be economic activity occurring and then general revenues will 
flow to the central government. That is a fair summary I think.
<P>
	However, as my leader indicated, when one person is 
unemployed or underemployed or afraid of being unemployed, 
if one is living on social services, one does not have enough 
disposable income to make much difference. That is what we 
require. We must get people back to work. I know my friends 
opposite when in opposition said the same thing. It is critical. If 
we are to pay down the deficit we must get people back to work 
so that they can contribute and not be a drain on those revenues.
<P>
<B>(1330) </B>
<P>
	I do not think the budget will put people back to work. I do not 
rely only on my own observations. I have listened to the experts 
who responded to the budget. I have yet to find anybody who 
says it is going to put a lot of Canadians back to work.
<P>
	We have all sorts of unused capacity. I remember the figures 
given earlier this week for manufacturing losses in the province 
of Ontario alone because of unused capacity and the new 
technologies. They are simply not putting people to work.
<P>
	This is why the budget has been such a disappointment. There 
is nothing in it to give hope to those people who are unemployed 
or to those people who want to see a meaningful new direction in 
terms of putting people back to work.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Cannis (Scarborough Centre):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
followed the debate with great interest all morning. If I were 
confused this morning, I am even more confused now.
<P>
	Earlier we heard two presentations from the Reform Party. 
One was saying how we did nothing and there were not enough 
cuts. The critic for the defence ministry indicated that we cut too 
much. Now I am hearing something else again. I do not know 
what it is.
<P>
	Did we cut enough? Did we not cut enough? We want to entice 
businesses to hire. The $300 million rollback on the UI will 
entice companies to hire.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Riis:</B> Madam Speaker, we in the House would all agree 
that the area the government has supported in the past to a 
certain degree and needs to support more in the future is the area 
of high technology.
<P>
	What do we find in the budget? We find the abandonment of 
the KAON project in British Columbia. I see some of my British 
Columbian colleagues across the way. That project would have 
put Canada on the cutting edge of high technology. It would have 
been a vote of confidence for our scientists and our top 
engineers in the country and around the world.
<P>
	The Conservatives slapped British Columbia in the face by 
abandoning the <I>Polar 8</I> icebreaker. This was to be the federal 
government's show of support for B.C. KAON was the same and 
the government let down KAON. Literally hundreds of millions 
of dollars that would have gone into creating jobs in the 
construction area and, most important, in the high tech 
sophisticated scientific engineering area have now been 
abandoned. It is very disappointing that we missed this 
opportunity.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup):</B> Madam 
Speaker, the finance minister's budget speech, that could be 
described as ``Campbell meat with Martin sauce'', reflects the 
vicious circle of irresponsibility the federal government has got 
stuck in.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance did not allow himself to do the job he 
has been elected to do. During the whole election campaign, he 
said ``jobs, jobs, jobs'', but when the time comes to create them, 
he is not there. Instead, he forecast a record deficit of $39.7 
billion, and a new series of committees. There is a disease in 
Ottawa, the ``committee disease'', which I have rarely seen so 
rampant anywhere else.
<P>
	The election slogan has fallen by the wayside due to the 
timidity of a finance minister who has given in to the federal 
bureaucracy. How then can politicians ask voters for their 
confidence when, every time, government parties promise one 
thing during the election campaign and do the opposite?
<P>
	This budget will contribute to increasing the differences and 
disparities between the various regions of Canada because, 
under the guise of the infrastructure program, the federal 
government is cutting the budgets of the development agencies 
without giving the provinces any leeway to take over their own 
development.
<P>
	The federal government is courageously taking on the 
weakest in the system by raising the minimum number of weeks 
of work required to be entitled to UI benefits and bringing down 
to 55 per cent benefits paid to unemployed workers. That is a 
Valcourt plus formula. What is worse, they assume that people 
do not want to work.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1789"> 1789 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
	The lack of jobs and the extensive restructuring of the North 
American economy are blamed on the unemployed and on other 
people who try and improve their lot. Instead of trying to help 
them, we will take a whole year to cook up a reform, the contents 
of which are not known, when we should be up and running and 
taking immediate action. We were not elected to create 
committees but to take action.
<P>
	I would like to underline more particularly that the situation 
in regions like Eastern Quebec is certainly as bad as in 
aboriginal communities, but I do not find the same level of 
support for those areas as for aboriginal communities. I think 
the needs of native people are real, but ours are too, and it is 
extremely unfortunate that the situation is handled the way it is.
<P>
	Somebody said a while ago that there is no tax increase. Do 
you not think there will be a hefty increase for those people who 
will have to go from unemployment to welfare next year because 
they do not have those two extra weeks of employment? They 
will have to find news ways of making ends meet only to find 
that they are accused of cheating the unemployment insurance 
system or the welfare system.
<P>
	The federal government turns a blind eye to the elimination of 
duplication, because it would have to admit that the federal 
system itself is the cause of runaway deficits. During the 
election campaign, voters kept asking the same question: Are 
you going to create jobs like the Liberals promise they will? Our 
answer was: Yes, but in order to do that, we need some leeway.
<P>
	Because of a lack of political courage, the Liberals will not 
reach their goal since they cannot get this breathing space. In no 
way, since the recall of Parliament, has the government allowed 
us to seriously examine spending in order to remedy the 
inequities, the programs which were created a long time ago, but 
no longer meet our needs. In the national capital, we often forget 
what the situation of unemployed people really is. We do not 
want to look at that because if we did, the government would be 
forced to admit that federalism is costly for Canada as a whole.
<P>
	If the Liberals had freed the $3 million lost because of 
duplication, they would have given hope again to the 25-35 
generation whose potential is wasted. That generation includes 
technicians, engineers, skilled people who should be working. 
We will realize in 10 or 15 years that this generation has been 
sacrificed, that we did not give these people the opportunity to 
work for the good of Quebec and Canada. They will struggle 
along from one project to another.
<P>
	The government also forgets-since it has decided to tax the 
elderly, we understand a little better its agenda, which is to 
become another conservative government-that unskilled 
workers older than 40 were the ones who were hardest hit by the 
recession. Nowhere do we find this search for fiscal fairness 
which was supposed to be the mark of this budget.
<P>
	Forgotten were family trusts. Forgotten were the $250 million 
which are wasted because of duplication of labour services for 
Quebec alone. I personally had the opportunity to work in 
reclassification and labour assistance committees which 
systematically have both a provincial representative and a 
federal representative to do a job that could be done properly by 
one person only. Quebec has agreed for a long time to take full 
jurisdiction in that field but no one wants to hear a word about it.
<P>
	The government reduces transfers to the provinces by $2 
billion, which means $700 million less for Quebec. All the 
provinces will then have to accept the machiavellian plan of the 
Minister of Human Resources Development to reform social 
programs.
<P>
	This is a very difficult situation to live with since the minister 
will then take advantage of the hardship the provinces will be 
faced with, because of the budgetary restraints, to impose on 
Canadians a reform that they do not want. In the foreword, the 
Minister of Finance said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Our goal is a Canada where every Canadian able to work can find a meaningful 
job.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Unfortunately, there are no incentives in that budget for 
massive job creation, as promissed by the Liberals during the 
electoral campaign, for all unskilled workers, except for the 
infrastructure program and that will judged when it is 
operational.
<P>
	By not having contingency funds coming from useless 
expenditures, the government is acting exactly like its 
predecessor, the Conservative government, but in their case, 
such an approach would have been understandable.
<P>
<B>(1340) </B>
<P>
	The government did not dare cancel the tax shelters of the 
rich. Rather it turned on average consumers-the elderly and the 
self-employed-by increasing their tax burden.
<P>
	They went so far as to create two income classes for UI 
beneficiaries. Single people will have to prove they are not 
hiding a lover in their closet. What a good decision is this, the 
Year of the Family. Terrific! All the better since individuals 
living alone very often have fixed expenses which eat away at 
their budget. The only jobs created by this decision will be those 
of Axworthy's Macoute-style inspectors they will surely 
appoint, because of their bureaucratic logic. Federal Liberals 
should have taken advantage of the experience of their Quebec 
counterparts. A similar measure is now leading to the downfall 
of the Johnson administration.
<P>
	In its process, the federal government even took the 
incredible decision of increasing the National Research 
Council's budget, an organization that is far from being as 
productive as regional research centres. Every part of the budget 
bears the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1790"> 1790 </A></B>
<P>
mark of Ottawa mandarins totally unaware of what citizens are 
experiencing in the regions, everywhere in Canada and in 
Quebec. The government members did not do their homework.
<P>
	On another point, I want to remind the minister of defence 
that, during the campaign, we did advocate cuts in the defence 
budget. However, the decision to close the only French language 
military college in all of North America has been inspired by 
something else than pure financial arithmetics. I appeal to all 
the Liberal members from Quebec, who will be stigmatised by 
this decision, especially the Prime Minister.
<P>
	The Prime Minister and I come from the same region. The St. 
Maurice Valley is an area which had long been dependent on 
American or English-Canadian companies in the pulp and paper 
industry. Then, we had to slowly blossom as full partners. If he 
is not aware of the impact a decision such as the closure of the 
Collège de Saint-Jean will have, I think that he forgot what 
being a Quebecer means.
<P>
	If the federal system can no longer assume the training of 
French-speaking officers in Quebec, Quebec will not take this 
laying down. We will fight as vigorously as others have done to 
protect the survival of the French fact in other Canadian 
provinces. The Acadian and francophone communities know 
full well that a bilingual education system is the shortest route to 
anglicization, for soldiers as well as ordinary citizens.
<P>
	The Liberals have decided to make committees the 
corner-stone of their job creation program. Let me name a few: 
a task force to develop a code of conduct regarding loans to 
small and medium-sized businesses; a task force on the taxation 
of family trusts; a task force on an improved supplementary plan 
to make businesses more competitive; a review of how to 
increase the efficiency of federal assistance. Moreover, a 
discussion paper on science and technology will be published to 
trigger a national debate that will lead to a new policy in that 
area.
<P>
	As a former civil servant, I know only too well this disease 
called ``committee-itis''. I know the recipe. It is the best way to 
go nowhere. A year or a year and a half from now, we will 
receive reports on reports. They will be quietly tabled here, on a 
day when the attendance is low, and they will not resurface until 
the following year.
<P>
	Today, governments must react quickly to allow this country 
to enter the excessively competitive world market. While we 
prepare all these fine reports and that years of pussy-footing in 
committee go by, Canada will pursue its breathtaking drop on 
the list of nations with declining productivity. We were not 
elected here to set up committees.
<P>
	Action was urgently needed to help college and university 
graduates. Now, forestry workers will have to hunt down 
12-week contracts instead of 10-week ones. Of course, 
unemployment insurance officers will be overworked, chasing 
down the bad guys who are trying to save their skins.
<P>
	The government is not taking its responsibilities and is 
behaving like a consultant when it should be governing. By 
giving itself additional time, it avoids making real decisions. 
However, unlike the Conservatives, the Liberals have dared to 
increase the qualifying period for unemployment insurance.
<P>
<B>(1345) </B>
<P>
	This budget appears to be the work of bureaucrats unaware of 
the devastating effect raising from 10 to 12 the minimum 
number of weeks of work required to be eligible for 
unemployment insurance will have in our local areas. I urge the 
Liberal members to remind their Minister of Finance of their 
election promise to put Canada back to work.
<P>
	This budget will disillusion those who still believed in 
election promises. During the election campaign, I met people 
working in peat bogs and took half an hour or so to explain to 
them how politics could be useful and how things could change 
with the coming election. Now, when I will go back home, these 
people are going to come to me and say: ``See, nothing changed. 
You elect a new government and, once in office, it does the exact 
same thing as the ones before''. At least, I will be able to say that 
we did not change.
<P>
	My cry to the Minister of Finance is also the cry of the 
regions, those struggling ever since fishing was restricted and 
doing their best to cope with their unemployment problems. 
These are also the regions that the young generation has 
inexorably fled, as well as those striving to pull through. No, the 
regions are not applauding this budget. They are scowling and 
looking forward to taking their development into their own 
hands. Two thirds of welfare spending goes to the various 
intermediaries in the system instead of to those who need 
it-that is something which should be attacked right away, and 
not worked on in a committee for over a year.
<P>
	Those who are surprised that Quebecers regularly and 
repeatedly elect sovereigntists should understand why, faced 
with these successive Tory or Grit budgets that only show the 
influence of the federal bureaucracy. If only to get out of this 
infernal cycle, Quebec can no longer afford to stay in the federal 
system.
<P>
	Indeed, next year at the same time, the Minister of Finance 
will explain to us why he could not keep the deficit to $39.7 
billion, but that 1995-96 will really be the year when the 
government regains control of its budget. I would be quite 
prepared to bet on that with any hon. member. It is a well-known 
old refrain that rings hollow.
<P>
	To avoid this sad situation, I again ask the government to 
strike a special all-party committee to analyze all spending. 
This would force government managers to answer our questions 
about the necessity of the work done and would show all of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1791"> 1791 </A></B>
<P>
Quebec and Canada that we, not the senior civil servants, are the 
ones running this country.
<P>
	Tomorrow I will go back to my riding to tell the people of 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup that there is no more hope of 
regaining control of the runaway federal government. I would 
hope that they rise up everywhere to show their disapproval as 
they have been doing in the media for several days. On the 
weekend, when you meet your constituents, how will you 
answer them when they ask all government members how this 
Liberal budget is different? Is there any hope in this budget of 
putting Canadians and Quebecers back to work? It is up to the 
Liberal members to bring their government to its senses.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Eleni Bakopanos (Saint-Denis):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
listened with great interest to the comments made by the hon. 
member opposite, and I find it strange that the remarks are 
always the same. Regardless of the issue discussed in this 
House, the observations made by the hon. members opposite 
never change. They are always making the same comments and 
every government measure is invariably taken at the expense of 
the poor and the unemployed. It is clear to me that they have not 
read the budget and I will simply give you an example to 
illustrate my point. As regards unemployment insurance, we 
clearly stated that women with children are going to benefit 
from the new system to be put in place. And let us not forget that 
the government also intends to bring in other changes. Of 
course, it is in their interest to talk about the unemployed and the 
poor and to mislead the media to get their message across.
<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
	In Montreal's newspapers, it was mentioned that senior 
citizens would lose their pension. I can tell you that I received 
calls at my office, because people read this inaccurate 
information released by the opposition, to the effect that the 
elderly, regardless of their income, would lose their pension, 
which is not true.
<P>
	Also, the scenario always being presented by the opposition is 
not realistic. Again, they did not look at the real figures in the 
budget and at what we really want to achieve. We do talk about 
jobs, yes we do. Let us not forget job creation. To what extent 
will we be able to create these jobs? It will be to the extent that 
we help small businesses in Quebec, including in Montreal 
where my riding is and which I know well, because they create 
jobs.
<P>
	A few years ago, the city of Montreal conducted a study which 
showed that small and medium-size businesses were the ones 
creating jobs. We will help those businesses. We will provide 
them with the means to create jobs for the poor, as the members 
opposite keep saying.
<P>
	Given the narrow vision of the opposition, and given that it 
keeps saying the same things, I would like to know why these 
separatists-after all this is their real name-insist on 
continually misleading Quebecers and not telling them the truth.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am very surprised to hear such words from a member 
who lives in the poorest region of Canada. I feel she has lost 
touch with our planet.
<P>
	How can you say that the Saint-Denis riding, in the region of 
Montreal-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Order! I am sorry to 
interrupt the member, but he should address his comments to the 
Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> Madam Speaker, can the hon. member seriously 
tell us that in her riding, increasing the required number of 
weeks worked before one is entitled to 
unemployment-insurance benefits will not increase poverty? 
Let us not be mistaken here; the unemployed will be entitled to 
fewer weeks of benefits.
<P>
	As for the issue of women, it is perverse for a member from 
Quebec to say such a thing; she should know better from her own 
experience in Quebec where the Bourbeau reform was 
implemented a few years ago and where women have to find 
witnesses and leave their homes in the evening just to prove they 
live alone. That kind of situation is unacceptable. We cannot 
maintain such a thing.
<P>
	With regard to the member's question and comment, I for one 
trust Canadian and Quebec medias. I do not feel they lie, I think 
they report truthfully what they hear in the House of Commons. 
This is also partly what Mr. Martin, the Minister of Finance, 
realized the day after he presented his budget. He discovered 
that everyone thought he had made no changes at all and that 
surprised him a great deal.
<P>
	My last comment is on the issue of what you call the 
separatists, or at least those who want Quebec to be sovereign. A 
sovereign country is one which makes its own legislation, 
collects its own taxes and signs all its treaties. We believe there 
is 3 billion dollars worth of duplication in a federal system and 
that means unnecessary expenditures; and because of your 
ideology, government members refuse to address that question. 
If they had the courage to do so, they would not have to take 
money away from the less fortunate among us.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Serré (Timiskaming-French River):</B> Madam 
Speaker, the hon. member for Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup 
certainly did not listen to my speech this morning. He claims 
that it is only in Quebec that one can get an education in French. 
In fact, he is asking a question to Acadians and francophones 
outside Quebec. Earlier, he was telling us: ``Ask them if one can 
get an education in French outside Quebec''.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, I think that I am living proof of that. I 
completed all my studies in Ontario and in French. Not only did 
the Franco-Ontarians have a good education system, but they 
also served a good part of Northwest Quebec, where people 
<P>

<B><A NAME="1792"> 1792 </A></B>
<P>
would come to Sudbury because there was no learning 
institution in Northwest Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1355) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> Madam Speaker, since the hon. member speaks 
French, he certainly did not listen to my answer, because I was 
talking about our bilingual colleges. I said we know very well 
that for any francophone, bilingualism in a bilingual college in 
any province of Canada leads directly to anglicization. When we 
know that, in Canada, we had to wait one hundred years for 
Supreme Court decisions allowing us to have French schools in 
some Western provinces and that we must still go to court to be 
able to preserve that, I think it is very clear that bilingual 
education in Canada does not have any future. You will have to 
walk all over us before you can impose the closing of the 
Collège militaire de Saint-Jean. You can be sure that the entire 
Quebec population will be behind us.
<P>
[English] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I listened to the member's speech closely and I 
appreciated his respect for the fact that we had such limited 
manoeuvrability because we inherited a fiscal framework that 
was much worse than any of us ever imagined.
<P>
	We all realize there is a crisis of confidence in the country. It 
does not matter whether it is in the member's riding in Quebec or 
my community in downtown Toronto, one of the factors that 
affects the confidence of investors is that we have so many 
members constantly talking about separation.
<P>
	Does the member not realize or does he not agree that this 
constant focus on separation affects the economy just as much as 
any budget does?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> Madam Speaker, if making a case for the 
sovereignty of Quebec could be as successful as the process that 
led to the separation of Norway and Sweden, I think we will have 
much to be proud of. Today, small countries like these have 
practically full employment while we are stuck with a federal 
government that is as cumbersome and slow-moving as an 
elephant. It is so slow to react to crises that by the time it is ready 
with solutions, another crisis has already developed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin Cauchon (Outremont):</B> Madam Speaker, I heard 
what the hon. member said. To hear him talk, a separate Quebec 
would be seventh heaven. I would like to ask him why that would 
be the case and how a separate Quebec could be in better shape 
economically than it is now within Canada, a Canada that has its 
place among the Group of Seven, a Canada that operates within a 
North American free-trade zone and that looks both to Europe 
and Asia. What more would a separate Quebec be able to offer 
Quebecers?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> Madam Speaker, when Quebec is a sovereign 
state, it will control all decisions that affect Quebec. It will 
never decide to waste $250 million worth of labour just to make 
another level of government look good.
<P>
	Furthermore, we can say that this beautiful Canada of ours is 
close to being examined by the World Bank. If the government 
keeps bringing down budgets like this one, not only those 
terrible separatists from Quebec but the whole world will want 
to see some changes made.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Eugène Bellemare (Carleton-Gloucester):</B> Madam 
Speaker, the hon. member of the Bloc Quebecois is to be 
commended for his very sensitive presentation on government 
administration.
<P>
<B>(1400) </B>
<P>
	He suggests that once his province is a separate state, which 
God forbid, he will have all the answers and that Quebec's 
economy will be the envy of the whole world.
<P>
	If we look at unemployment insurance, considering the 
economic situation in Canada today, a Canada which includes 
the 10 provinces and two territories, I would like to ask the hon. 
member what he wants to improve in reference to the economy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, if Quebec became a sovereign state, I 
never claimed it would be seventh heaven. Those were the terms 
used by the hon. members on the government side. However, I 
did say, and maintain that we would be able to get along as well 
as many small countries in the world which are doing a better job

	<B>Mr. Réginald Bélair (Cochrane-Superior):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the Electoral Boundaries Commission has proposed to eliminate 
the ridings of Cochrane-Superior and Timiskaming-French 
River in northern Ontario.
<P>
	I am appalled at the commission's ignorance of the 
geopolitical landscape of this area. Reducing the number of 
ridings will only make it more difficult to properly serve our 
constituents because of the distances travelled and the increase 
of population set at 80,000.
<P>

<P>
	Northern Ontario will not sacrifice two ridings for the benefit 
of southern Ontario which will be getting four additional 
ridings. We need a strong voice in Ottawa.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	By eliminating the ridings of Cochrane-Superior and 
Timiskaming-French River, the Elections Commission is 
proposing to disfigure the north of Ontario. We will never accept 
a diminished representation. How could the Commission use a 
population of 80,000 as the only criterion to divide the huge 
territory of northern Ontario?
<P>
	It did not take into account the excellent service we offer our 
constituents in spite of the great distances we must cover.

	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, February 22 is a very important day. It is on February 
22, 1857, in London, that Lord Baden-Powell, the founder of the 
scouting movement, was born. So, on February 22, 
Baden-Powell Day, we celebrate scouting, which Canada joined 
in 1910.
<P>
	The scouting movement has now more than 25 million 
members across the world, in 150 countries. As a former scout, I 
would like to repeat for the House this famous quote from 
Baden-Powell: Try to leave this world in a better state than you 
found it.

	<B>Mr. Paul E. Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise to reflect what the tobacco smuggling issue tells 
me about Canadians.
<P>
	Many say the government started it all by over reaching with 
taxes, but what about the complicity of the tobacco industry that 
markets a killer substance and then passes it off as socially 
acceptable? Protesting store vendors did not participate in civil 
disobedience. It was crime for profit. Some natives near the 
border look the other way, then blame someone else.
<P>
	However, the real moral lapse comes from Canadians who 
consume illegal products. When did we become a nation of 
cheaters? Is it okay as long as one does not get caught? Dodging 
the GST, scamming welfare, lying to customs, it is time for each 
of us to look at ourselves and our social malaise.

	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South):</B> Mr. Speaker, on many 
occasions in this House, hon. members from all sides have 
expressed unanimous concern about the growing and senseless 
violence and abuse within our society.
<P>
	Spousal abuse, child abuse and racism have been raised 
frequently because we know that law and order and safety within 
our communities are very important to all Canadians.
<P>
	As such, members of this House have a duty to reflect their 
support for these social concerns whenever possible. Verbal 
support is important but tangible actions must compliment the 
words to demonstrate our sincere commitment.
<P>
	Accordingly, I call on all members of this House, and indeed 
all elected representatives across Canada, to utilize their skills 
and resources to develop and to champion specific initiatives to 
promote our shared value which is, and I emphasize, there is no 
excuse for abuse.

	<B>Mr. Martin Cauchon (Outremont):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to clarify a question which many people have asked me 
regarding the age credit.
<P>
	Contrary to what the Bloc Quebecois has been saying, the 
changes brought to the age credit will be of no consequence for 
the vast majority of seniors.
<P>
	As a matter of fact, three quarters of retirees are not affected 
since their income is less than $25,921. Only those whose 
income exceeds $50,000 will no longer be entitled to the age 
credit. They represent only 5 per cent of all retirees. Thus, three 
quarters of them will not be affected at all.
<P>
	The new budget provisions will have the same beneficial 
impact on seniors who are less fortunate. Retirees with an 
income below $26,000 will not pay more taxes.
<P>
	One of the key ideas of the 1994 budget is to better target our 
resources so that we can meet the basic needs of those who 
depend on government assistance. By reducing the level of tax 
credits for the more wealthy, we free additional money to help 
the elderly who are less fortunate, so that they can live with 
dignity without being afraid of tomorrow.

Speaker, I address the Canadian people in celebration of the 76th 
anniversary of the independence of the republic of Estonia.
<P>
	On February 24, 1918 Estonian nationalists declared 
independence from Russia, and after several periods of foreign 
control, reclaimed their independence on August 20, 1991. 
Since then it has emerged as a leader among the Baltic states. It 
is the first former Soviet republic to issue its own currency, to 
double exports and is outstripping the other developing 
economies of the former Soviet Union as well as most European 
countries.
<P>
	Under the vibrant leadership of Prime Minister Mart Laar, 
institutions are rapidly emerging which clearly and solidly 
establish Estonia as an independent and free democratic 
republic wherein the supreme power is vested in the people.

of permanent peace and prosperity.

Philippe Laroche of Lac-Beauport, in the riding of 
Charlesbourg, and Lloyd Langlois of Magog, in my riding, have 
respectively won silver and bronze in freestyle skiing-aerials.

	We extend our heartfelt congratulations to them and wish 
them the best of luck in whatever challenge they decide to take 
on next, with no lack of enthusiasm, that is for sure.

is even more preaiseworthy when you think that they must 
initially struggle on their own to find financial support.

Sports honours his commitments and quickly puts in place new

of Indians by certain members of this House.
<P>
	I find this repulsive and so do more than 2.5 million 
Canadians across this nation who voted for the Reform Party.

<P>
	Many of those who supported our party are native Indians. I 
have two reserves in my riding and they as well find these 
remarks offensive.
<P>
	Remarks of this nature serve only to create divisions in our 
country and foster hatred between different groups of Canadians 
where there should be friendship and understanding.
<P>
	It is my fervent hope that the members who have made such 
offensive remarks will rise in this House and apologize and 
promise never again to make such hate filled comments,

February is Black History Month. The black community has a 
long history in Canada during which, like many other 
immigrants, black people have substantially contributed to the 
life of this country with pride and determination.
<P>
	Every February <I>Pride</I> magazine presents the Canadian Black 
Achievement Awards to members of the black community who 
have performed outstandingly in their field of expertise and in 
participating in the life of their communities. The awards 
recognize and honour the accomplishments, achievements and 
excellence of African Canadians in 16 different categories of 
endeavour.
<P>
	This year <I>Pride</I> magazine has recognized and honoured three 
members of this House who are for the first time representing 
the constituents of their ridings in the Government of Canada.

	The hon. member for Etobicoke-Lakeshore, the hon.

communities in their capacities as educator, medical doctor and

<P>
was sending 12 Canadian forces personnel to Cambodia to take 
part in the dangerous task of removing five million land mines 
which literally cover half of the country.
<P>
	The terrible legacy of two decades of civil war left a deadly 
variety of land mines which kill or maim 300 Cambodians every 
month. It also makes any kind of agricultural activity virtually 
impossible.
<P>
	I congratulate the bravery of these 12 Canadian soldiers who 
are going to Cambodia to support the demining operations there.
<P>
	In view of the international conventions against the use of 
biological, chemical and other diabolical weapons of 
destruction, I will recommend that the use of land mines in 
warfare be considered on the agenda of the Canadian foreign 
affairs and defence policy review which this government is 
preparing to launch very shortly.

otherwise, this is not the case. Take for instance this important 
issue affecting my riding, namely the closure of the weather 
office in Saint-Hubert.

	Weather services experts are slated to be replaced by an 
automatic meteorological observation system which has not yet 
been perfected and does not differentiate accurately between 
types of precipitation.

his concern with what he believes is the Reform Party's view on 
aboriginal Canadians which is that Reformers hate Indians. This 
allegation, of course, is completely false.

	Charges of racism have been used all too often as a means of 
attempting to undermine the Reform Party. These allegations 
contribute nothing to the daily performance of this House.

federal government. Almost everyone seems to support the idea 
of special recognition for these very deserving war veterans. 
Politicians make positive statements, officials meet and 
promises are made, but nothing really happens. If the country 
waits much longer all these men will be dead.
<P>
	I am given to understand that the federal government is now 
studying proposals on how special recognition might best be 
provided and that when that is done the government will have 
several concrete options for veterans' groups to review. 
Moreover the secretary of state says he sees merit in a war medal 
for these courageous men.

Liberals are making it more difficult to be a young person with 
hope. In Regina-Lumsden more and more unemployment 
insurance claimants are rejected because of the unfair changes 
to UI.
<P>
	These individuals cannot find full-time work and are forced 
to take seasonal or part-time jobs. When these jobs dry up they 
do not qualify for UI; they go on the province's welfare rolls 
instead. They are not lazy. They are underemployed because 
there are simply not enough full-time jobs to go around.
<P>
	The Government of Saskatchewan addressed the issue of 
unemployment in its recent budget with a job creation program. 
Unfortunately the federal budget will mean more 
unemployment for Saskatchewan and more people dependent on 
welfare.
<P>
	The changes to UI simply offload federal costs to the 
provinces and continue the Tory tradition of disguising how 
many unemployed people there really are by shifting them to 
welfare.

not want to be unemployed. They only wanted one thing from 
this government: real jobs. Instead they got snow jobs.

	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	Unexpectedly, to the dismay of francophones in Quebec and 
Canada, the government wants to close the military college in 
Saint-Jean. It is the only French-language military college in 
Canada and enables francophones to advance in the armed 
forces in their own language. Since it was founded, this college 
has trained several generations of brilliant French-speaking 
officers.
<P>
	I ask the Prime Minister if he does not admit that by closing 
the Saint-Jean college in an arbitrary and underhanded way, he 
is sending a message that there is no more room for 
francophones who want to become officers in the Canadian 
armed forces in their own language and environment.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the government does not take such action on a whim. We had a 
recommendation to close the Royal Roads Military College in 
Victoria and the one in Saint-Jean, Quebec.
<P>
	Royal Roads was established in 1942 and Saint-Jean in 1952. 
We decided to close them both and to keep the one in Kingston, 
Ontario, where both official languages of the country will be 
taught. There are many French-language institutions that work 
very well in Ontario.
<P>
	I would remind the Leader of the Opposition that many times 
he recommended cutting military spending by 25 per cent. If we 
had followed his recommendations, not only would we have 
closed the military college in Saint-Jean but we would also have 
had to shut down the facility in Bagotville, in his region.
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> I have 
trouble understanding how one can say such things when the 
Canadian armed forces already spend only 13 per cent of their 
capital budget in Quebec.
<P>
	But, Mr. Speaker, if you allow me, I would remind the Prime 
Minister that the college in Saint-Jean was founded to end the 
scandal of an army that resisted the French fact and that the 
college in Kingston was indeed one of the bastions of that 
hostile attitude.
<P>
	I want to ask the Prime Minister if he does not admit that his 
government's decision is taking us back 40 years and wiping out 
a symbol of success for the French fact in Canada.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am sorry, perhaps that was the problem in 1952, but since then, 
we passed the Official Languages Act. The best example I can 
give the House now is that the chief of Canada's armed forces, 
John de Chastelain, is a perfectly bilingual anglophone, which 
proves that the Canadian armed forces have changed a lot since 
1952.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we all noted with interest that the Prime Minister 
admitted that until 1952, it was a problem. Indeed, the problem 
was that the French fact was not recognized and was snubbed by 
the Canadian armed forces and that Kingston was a prime 
example of such rejection.
<P>
	Can the Prime Minister confirm that closing the college in 
Saint-Jean is the result of last-minute pressure from the Liberal 
caucus to help the closure of military bases go down better in the 
rest of Canada?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
that statement is totally false. The problem was not even raised 
in the Liberal caucus.
<P>
	I would say to the hon. member that he should think twice 
before making statements like that. If we had cut 25 per cent as 
he asked and as he called for dozens of times in the election 
campaign, not only would we have closed Saint-Jean, but we 
would have closed the military base in Bagotville at the same 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1797"> 1797 </A></B>
<P>
time. Furthermore, I think that the new Canada can have a 
completely bilingual institution in Kingston, Ontario, where 
they have one of the best universities in Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, in an article 
published this morning and entitled ``Kingston, a choice made 
for reasons of economy and national unity'', the Minister of 
National Defence says, and I quote: ``I am tired of those 
Quebecers who claim to be the only ones protecting the French 
fact in Canada''. The minister goes on to say: ``In Canada, 
francophones must feel comfortable everywhere. That was the 
dream of Mr. Trudeau and the Liberals of old''.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, given those comments, are we to understand 
that, to get rid of those Quebecers he is tired of, the minister 
intends to give to Kingston the responsibility of training 
French-speaking officers?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
stand by what the Minister of National Defence said. There is a 
possibility.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I once was the member for Beauséjour. When I was there, I 
attended the University of Moncton, where some law classes are 
taught only in French. I visited the University of Sudbury and 
the University of Ottawa. I was also invited to Glendon College, 
in Toronto. It is possible to find institutions in Canada, outside 
Quebec, which provide first-class education in French, and that 
is what Canada is all about: ensuring the preservation of French 
all across the country.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, how can the 
Prime Minister, who supports the comments made by his 
minister to the effect that he is tired of Quebecers who try to 
protect the French fact in Canada, believe that they will trust 
him when it comes to protecting the interests of the French 
language, while he and his government are about to close the 
only institution for the training of francophone officers in the 
Canadian Forces?

am very pleased to see the hon. member defending federal 
institutions in Quebec. I am really very happy to see that. I hope 
that the hon. member will now start saying that he knows more 
than his small region.

it?

objective of his government to reduce unemployment in that 
province by 1 per cent this year.

reduction target for the country as a whole and, if so, what is it?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to respond to the 
hon. member for Calgary Southwest by pointing out that one of 
the reasons the premier of Quebec is able to target a reduction of 
1 per cent unemployment per year is that there is a federal 
government in Ottawa providing great assistance in job creation 
right across Canada and helping Quebec, Alberta, British 
Columbia, and every other province to reduce the number of 
unemployed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the minister's reply is simply too vague, particularly on an issue 
of such personal importance to millions of Canadians.
<P>
	In the name of those Canadians my question is: Does the 
minister have specific targets for reducing unemployment in 
1994-95, public sector targets, private sector targets or national 
targets, and if he does, can he tell us what they are?

hon. member. The real target for members of the government is 
to put into place job creation programs, such as reducing UI 
premiums 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1798"> 1798 </A></B>
<P>
that will create over 60,000 jobs; an infrastructure program that 
will create over 65,000 jobs; a youth corps that will create over 
15,000 jobs; an apprenticeship program that will create  15,000 
or 20,000 jobs. The government is in the job creation business.
<P>
	If the member wants the targets I suggest he read the budget 
papers because the information is in the budget papers. Maybe 
he should learn to read before he asks questions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the red book and the throne speech promised jobs. Yet the budget 
predicts that unemployment will fall from 11.2 per cent last year 
to 11.1 per cent this year, a drop of only one-tenth of 1 per cent.
<P>
	Will the minister acknowledge that this is not good enough, 
that the job impacts of the budget presented on Tuesday are 
negligible in 1994-95 and therefore unacceptable to 
unemployed Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, with all due respect to the hon. 
member I think he has been attacked by a slight case of 
schizophrenia.
<P>
	Yesterday he was in the House of Commons in high dudgeon 
speaking about the need to cut government expenditures, to get 
all the expenditures down, which would put thousands and 
thousands more Canadians in the unemployment ranks. Now he 
is asking us how we are going to put people back to work. He 
cannot have it both ways.

	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is directed to the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	Last December, the Liberal government raised unemployment 
insurance premiums to $3.07, a tax increase of several hundred 
million dollars for 1994. The new Budget reverses this decision 
but will maintain the tax until next December. The government 
claims that the rate reduction will create 40,000 jobs, starting 
next January.
<P>
	Would the minister agree that a roll-back is necessary right 
away, and that based on what the minister said, the premium 
increase, a real tax on jobs, will cost us about 40,000 jobs 
between now and next December?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec): </B>Mr. Speaker, I am glad to hear the hon. 
member agrees with the number of jobs we will create by 
lowering unemployment insurance premiums, after the increase 
we had to introduce as soon as we came to power because of the 
deficit inherited from the previous government. If you look at 
the number of jobs we will create, our roll-back is in line with 
our infrastructure program and our job creation program which 
was welcomed by everyone. It is really excellent.
<P>
	Let me quote the following: ``The unemployment insurance 
premium roll-back is a major incentive for small business. By 
cutting social costs you get more jobs''; this was said by John 
Bulloch, President of the Canadian Federation of Independent 
Business. ``It should provide the conditions that will help the 
private sector create jobs. And I think that is the tenor of this 
budget''; this from Anne-Marie Hubert, accountant, participant 
at the conference in Montreal. ``I think the minister has brought 
down a budget that goes as far as the government can go 
towards-''
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order. The hon. member for 
Laurier-Sainte-Marie.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, thank you for interrupting the minister's quotes from 
favourable press clippings.
<P>
	It is really incredible. The minister tells us: ``You agree this 
will create 40,000 jobs, and it certainly will, especially since 
this year we are going to cut 40,000''. Now that is quite an 
achievement. Mr. Speaker, this is like the cha-cha-cha: one step 
forward, two steps backward. The minister admits that this year 
he will be cutting 40,000 jobs, and he says that next year, he will 
save 40,000 jobs.
<P>
	Why does he not do something right away and save several 
hundred million dollars in the process? This measure will create 
unemployment, because-the minister admitted this 
himself-they want to create jobs because this year they are 
creating unemployment.
<P>
	Does the minister feel his policy is responsible, yes or no?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec): </B>Mr. Speaker, the answer is, of course, 
yes.
<P>
<B>(1435) </B>
<P>
	According to statements by the vast majority of union and 
business leaders, because we made it very clear that we are 
going to freeze spending- that is how we can do this 
roll-back-we are creating the kind of optimism that will create 
jobs. And here again, I could quote, if you do not interrupt me, 
Mr. Speaker, ``This is the right way to go, because it is 
essentially a social cost, and if we can reduce the tax on jobs, 
this will have a positive impact on employment growth''. That is 
one quote, but there are thousands, Mr. Speaker.

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-interim target of a 3 per cent deficit-to-GDP ratio by 1996-97.</BLOCKQUOTE>

reduce the deficit to zero?

<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker,

<P>
	The obvious question for the minister then is when does he 
forecast a successful attempt in getting to zero?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development

budget. It is the first important step.

<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> No, no.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (LaSalle-Émard):</B> But they are so good, Mr. 
Speaker.
<P>
	It is very clearly our ultimate goal. It is a goal that we have set 
out with this budget. As we begin to approach that goal there is 
another goal that we intend to implement at the same time and 
that is reductions of taxes because that is very important to a 
nation which is overburdened.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Mercier (Blainville-Deux-Montagnes):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is also for the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	In his budget speech, the minister chose to target the 
middle-class and particularly middle-income seniors. He has 
decided to take $490 million out of their pockets over the next 
three years.
<P>
	Does the Minister of Finance realize that he is adding 
unacceptably to the fiscal burden of 800,000 seniors by digging 
into the pockets of every senior earning over $35,000 to find an 
extra $560 over two years?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec): </B>Mr. Speaker, first of all, 95 per cent of 
seniors will be entitled to all or part of the age credit. Only 5 per 
cent of seniors will no longer be entitled to any credit 
whatsoever.
<P>
	All we are really doing is bringing the age credit in line with 
other revenue-based credits.
<P>
	I might add that our budget does not affect in any way Old Age 
Security, the Guaranteed Income Supplement or the pension 
income credit.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Mercier (Blainville-Deux-Montagnes):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the 800,000 people I was referring to are over and 
above this 5 per cent.
<P>
	Why did the minister choose to target middle-income seniors 
rather than making sure that all corporations pay minimum tax 
or doing away with outrageous family trusts?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec): </B>Mr. Speaker, there are two questions in 
one and I will answer both. As far as seniors and the budget are 
concerned, if I could just quote the famous Mrs. Solange Denis 
who was quoted in this morning's edition of <I>Le Droit</I> as saying: 
``We must be careful not to think that we can do as we please 
because we are senior citizens. Seniors must do their share; the 
deficit is enormous and every one knows that a concerted effort 
is required''. Certainly, we will take the word of Mrs. Denis on 
this. Now, Mr. Speaker, the question was put to me-
<P>
<B>(1440) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> One question, was it?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (LaSalle-Émard):</B> No, there were two. At any 
rate, he is much cleverer than you are.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, in response to the question on family trusts, 
about what we plan to do, allow me to refer the hon member to a 
speech made by the Bloc Quebecois critic for finance, who said 
in essence that the same thing applies to family trusts, that there 
are no really comprehensive studies on the subject, that the Bloc 
Quebecois reiterates its request that a parliamentary committee 
be struck.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I was surprised I

<P>
	<B>Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, I think 
it is the same for the Governor General as it is for the Prime 
Minister. When the Governor General and the Prime Minister 
travel, questions of security are decided along guidelines 
established by the security service of the RCMP.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose):</B> Mr. Speaker, I can

in the budget the Minister of Finance indicated that a review of

<P>
	Does the minister not agree that it is women who will bear the

have to prove whether or not they have a spouse or dependant 
children?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister

role of women is very important in the unemployment insurance 
reform we are presenting, as indicated by the fact that we have 
substantially increased benefits for single mothers. We did away 
with the draconian measures imposed by the Conservative Party.

	<B>Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question 
is for the hon. Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development.
<P>
	It is my understanding that the previous government and 
native leaders agreed not to discuss Bill C-31, a bill defining 
band membership as part of ongoing discussions regarding land 
claims and native self-government. In fact, they agreed to leave 
that matter to the courts for a decision so that land claims and 
self-government discussions could proceed more quickly.
<P>
	If native leaders made this agreement with the previous 
government and were satisfied with it, why is the present 
minister dragging Bill C-31 into discussions with native leaders 
and bands?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a different government.
<P>
	We started with the premise that the inherent right of 
self-government exists. We look at communities, watersheds 
and cultural aspects. We do not say that an aboriginal person on 
a reserve is any different from an aboriginal person off that 
reserve during negotiations.
<P>
	It is very sensitive. I know there is strong feeling within the 
bands across Canada. Part of the problem is on the return. No 
one knew this was coming on the return. Everybody estimated it 
would be about 10 per cent of those people reinstated wanting to 
return to the reserve. In fact, it is closer to 40 or 50 per cent and it 
provides tremendous pressures on the chiefs.
<P>
	Notwithstanding all that, dealing with the people who 
legitimately belong to bands is part of the ongoing discussions. 
That is the policy of this government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am not sure 
if that answered my question or not. Native Canadians arrive at 
agreements with governments and rely on governments, no 
matter what party is in office, to honour those agreements.
<P>
	My supplementary is this. The minister has yet to clearly deny 
or confirm that he told members of bands in my riding that 
Reformers hate Indians. Will he rise in this House today and 
give an unequivocal yes or no. Did he so label Reformers as 
haters of Indians, yes or no?
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. Minister of Indian Affairs, if he 
wishes to answer the question.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development):</B> Mr. Speaker, I think it is very important. The 
Reform Party of Canada has asked me several times if I at a 
private meeting said that the Reform Party of Canada hates 
Indians. As I said yesterday in this House, I do not recall making 
such a statement and others do not recall me making such a 
statement.

	However, if I did or even if the Reform Party thinks I did, and 
I think that is important, let me state categorically to all

the Reform Party of Canada hates Indians.

	There have been changes in the criminal law in recent years,

	There is a perception among many Canadians that 
government departments seek to avoid future budgetary

end. Will the minister tell this House how he will implement the

controlling federal spending?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board

there is indeed that perception on the part of Canadians about 
rushing to spend the money before the year runs out. Of course, 
under the Financial Administration Act it does lapse. Perhaps 
from time to time it means that managers will spend prematurely 
or money will be expended prior to when it needs to be.
<P>
	To combat that we have in this current fiscal year put in place 
the opportunity to carry over a percentage of the budget so that 
spending can be done at more appropriate times beyond the year 
end. I am pleased to inform the hon. member and other members

	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Finance, but first of all, on behalf 
of all members of the Bloc Quebecois, I would like to express 
our solidarity with the people of Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean 
and our disappointment with the comments made by the Prime 
Minister earlier in this question period.
<P>
	In his budget, the Minister of Finance announces a slight 
reduction in government expenditures of only $400 million and 
postpones until 1995 the real decisions on streamlining the 
government's administrative machinery. Thousands of 
statements condemn him in this regard.
<P>
	Why did the Minister of Finance not act this year to 
implement without delay the repeated recommendations made 
year after year by the Auditor General to streamline government 
and reduce waste estimated at several billion dollars?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, regarding not only the 
cuts but also our plan to streamline government and to really 
make it much more efficient, in co-operation with the President 
of the Treasury Board and the Minister responsible for Public 
Service Renewal, we have outlined in our budget the most 
substantial government reform process since World War II.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> Mr. Speaker, does 
the minister not agree that, by acting without delay on the 
government cuts recommended by the Auditor General year 
after year, he would show a real political will to end the waste of 
public funds instead of going after the unemployed, the poor and 
the aged?
<P>
<B>(1500) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec): </B>Mr. Speaker, as we already stated in 
this House, we accept the great majority of the Auditor 
General's suggestions and we intend-we said so in the 
budget-to implement them this year. That is our intention.

	<B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is for 
the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.
<P>
	The enabling authority for the aboriginal fishing strategy will 
expire this spring. As I understand it cabinet must review the 
program and then rule on whether to continue or terminate it.
<P>
	Will the minister tell us when we can expect such a decision, 
whether the decision will be made in splendid isolation, or will 
input be sought from those affected by the program?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the member for Delta for his question.
<P>
	The member will know I had the great privilege and honour to 
be in the province of British Columbia within the last two 
weeks. I met with many groups while in British Columbia. With 
each and every group I talked to, including during an address to 
the Pacific Trollers Association, we had a discussion of the 
aboriginal fisheries strategy.
<P>
	Certainly consultation is not being done, to quote the member, 
``in splendid isolation''. May I say that I would welcome input 
from the member either on the floor of the House, in committee, 
or privately on this important subject.
<P>
	The government will be seized of the matter within the next 
number of weeks. We will conduct the review as is appropriate. 
We will be glad to report our findings to the country as a whole 
through the auspices of the House of Commons in the 
appropriate way and time.

	<B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops):</B> Mr. Speaker, the minister

demonstrated a sensitivity for seniors with the continuation of 
the RRAP. I agree. The Minister of Finance indicated some 
sensitivity to low income Canadians with special 
responsibilities by having a benefit differential with the UI 
changes.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Finance. When the decision 
was made to freeze salaries of the public service across the 
board, and recognizing the tremendous variation from very low 
paid jobs to very high, why did he not show the same sensitivity 
to those people who work for the government? Why did he not 
recognize that to freeze those wages for everybody is quite 
different in terms of impact for somebody making $20,000 a 
year and somebody making $120,000 a year?

prior to the budget being brought in I consulted with employee 
representatives, the various union leaders, with respect to the 
fact that in order to get the deficit down we were going to have to 
make some of the cuts on the wage bill. We looked at various 
options. I told them that we were looking for up to a billion 
dollars. I got their input on this matter.
<P>
	First and foremost union representatives said that they wanted 
to preserve jobs. That is what we took. We found that the best 
way to make those cuts was to extend the wage freeze and to try 
to preserve jobs.
<P>
	We looked at a lot of other options: everything from wage 
rollbacks to the kinds of measures that the hon. member's leader 
in Ontario had taken, but those Rae days, those kinds of 
measures were very unpopular with the union. We did what we 
believed was best to preserve the jobs for our employees.

	<B>Mr. Allan Kerpan (Moose Jaw-Lake Centre):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I consider it an honour to rise in the House today to pay 
tribute to a veteran honourable member and a friend of this 
place.
<P>
	Hon. Douglas Charles Neil passed from this world on 
Monday, February 21. Mr. Neil served his community and 
country well. Along with community service Mr. Neil, like so 
many others, was part of the overseas forces during World War 
II. As a member of Parliament, Doug had nothing but the highest 
respect from his colleagues as well as from his constituents. He 
truly was an honourable member.
<P>
	He served as member for Moose Jaw from 1972 until 1984. 
This was the southern and urban part of the current riding of 
Moose Jaw-Lake Centre, the electoral district which I am now 
privileged to represent.
<P>
	Although I did not know Doug personally I have heard many 
in my riding refer to him and the service he gave to them, to his 
country and to the House. These references of which I speak 
were without exception favourable and commendatory.
<P>
	Just today I was reading through press accounts of Doug's 
passing. I am struck by the deep sense of loss many of his 
personal friends are expressing at this time. Even stronger than 
that sentiment is the gratitude and respect these friends hold for 
Mr. Neil. Truly his life of service impacted his fellow citizens in 
a profound way.
<P>
	I join all those who sorrow at this time of Mr. Neil's death. On 
behalf of members on this side of the House I express my sincere 
condolences to his wife, Charlotte, and to his family. I also join 
in the recognition that Doug Neil has had and will have a lasting 
influence for good. May his memory be blessed.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food):</B> Mr. Speaker, it was my privilege to know the late 
Doug Neil and to serve with him for a term in the House in the 
1970s.
<P>
	Doug was first elected as the member for Moose Jaw in 1972 
and he served as a member of Parliament until 1984. From 1974 
until 1979 it was my honour to represent the Saskatchewan 
constituency of Assiniboia which at that time was right next to 
the constituency of Moose Jaw.
<P>
	Doug and I shared a common interest in issues such as 
agriculture, transportation and rural affairs. We had many 
encounters on these issues and others in the House, in the 
Standing Committee on Agriculture, in the Standing Committee 
on Transport and on many public platforms, especially in 
western Canada. We obviously had our policy disagreements, 
but I believe we also shared a mutual respect for each other and a 
profound commitment to the well-being of those we were 
elected to serve.
<P>
	Prior to his career as a member of Parliament, Doug Neil 
distinguished himself as an RCAF navigator, a barrister and 
solicitor, a Moose Jaw city councillor and an active contributor 
to his community through such vehicles as the Moose Jaw Wild 
Animal Regional Park, the Royal Canadian Legion, the United 
Services Institute and the Moose Jaw Kinsmen and K-40 
organizations.
<P>
	Doug Neil was well known and well respected in Moose Jaw. 
He was a proud citizen of Saskatchewan and Canada. He was a 
successful and effective member of Parliament and a dedicated 
servant to his community. He will be missed.
<P>
	I wish to join with the hon. member for Moose Jaw-Lake 
Centre to express on behalf of the Government of Canada our 
sincere condolences to Mr. Neil's family.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion that this 
House approves in general the budgetary policy of the 
government; the amendment; and the amendment to the 
amendment.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, after listening to the response to 
the budget proposal of Tuesday and examining very carefully 
the comments of members of the opposition, outside 
commentators and others, I am struck by one very sad and 
disappointing realization.
<P>
	People still have not come to grips with the fact that there is a 
jobs crisis in this country just as there is a jobs crisis right 
around the world. They have not really come to terms with the 
reality but we are going to have to look at a fundamental change 
in employment strategy for this country and begin to make the 
changes to make it work.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois, out of sheer partisanship, is claiming 
that the budget is an attack on the unemployed. However, what it 
neglects to say is that the budget is an attack on unemployment. 
The Bloc prefers to see people remain on unemployment 
insurance rather than have a chance at getting a job.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The difference is that we want people to go back to work while 
they want to protect the status quo. They want to protect the old 
way and not look to create new opportunities.
<P>
	The Reform Party has elevated the reduction of the deficit to 
an end in itself, not what it will do, not what impact it might 
have, but an end in itself to the point even that the member for 
Medicine Hat rises in this House and says that we should have a 
complete cancellation of government programs for training at a 
time when every single whip would know that the best 
investment we can make is in the people of this country.
<P>
	The outside commentators who have commented on the 
budget have said that the government in reducing UI benefits, is 
doing what the Conservatives said they were going to do. What 
they ignore is how the changes we made are designed to put 
people back to work.
<P>
	It is about time in this Chamber, in this city and across this 
country that we begin to examine seriously how to create work, 
how to find work for Canadians, how we distribute work and 
how we prepare people for work. That is the overriding, ever 
compelling responsibility of this government and it should be 
the responsibility of all members of this Chamber.
<P>
	The shortage of jobs is world-wide. We know that. It is not 
simply happening in Canada. In two weeks time, there will be a 
major job summit of the G-7 countries at which we are going to 
come together to examine this shrinkage of employment, the 
shredding of jobs.
<P>
	The OECD has said that the number one employment problem 
in European countries is the lack of job creation. We are finding 
increasingly that all the old standards, all the old formulas no 
longer work. One pushes the levers of productivity, competition 
and growth and it does not end up in jobs. It is like pushing a wet 
string.
<P>
	Therefore we have to put our minds to the serious question of 
how we begin to find jobs. That means that we have to take a 
look at what is happening in the employment market of this 
country. For example, 10 years ago part-time work was about 10 
per cent of all jobs created. It is now close to 20 per cent.
<P>
<B>(1520) </B>
<P>
	In the 1990s all new jobs will require a minimum of 
post-secondary education. Between 1990 and 1993 jobs held by 
university graduates increased by 17 per cent, those held by high 
school graduates increased .5 per cent, and the jobs held by 
those who did not graduate from high school decreased by 17 per 
cent.
<P>
	That is an enormous revolution in the world of work. We have 
members in this House unable, unwilling and not ready to begin 
facing that new reality, talking about defending the old ways of 
doing things. The world of work is changing and it is about time 
members opposite began to change with it.
<P>
	I have just come from a meeting of a group of labour leaders, 
business leaders and academics, a special group I have 
established to look at this question of work, the distribution of 
work, and who are prepared to join a common cause to look at 
this issue. The conclusion at the first meeting is clear. The 
traditional strategies of productivity and economic growth are 
not working any more. The time for political posturing is over.
<P>
	I would say to members who have spent a great deal of time in 
this House, Reform members, Bloc members, our own 
members, we must make Parliament relevant again. The best 
way to make Parliament relevant is to start talking about 
relevant things such as how we get people back to work.
<P>
	That is what the budget of Tuesday did. It began to set the 
stage, the foundation, the framework by which we can begin to 
create a new employment strategy for Canadians. That is what 
Canadians want. That is why they elected us in October.
<P>
	All the other smoke-screens and masquerades and charades 
that we have heard will not mask the fundamental fact that the 
deep, abiding, overwhelming commitment of all members of 
this government is to get Canadians back to work. We invite 
members opposite to  help us in that task. Just take a look, let us 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1807"> 1807 </A></B>
<P>
clear away all the attempts to short-circuit and create 
smoke-screens.
<P>
	Let me give some clear indication of our commitment to job 
creation. The leader of the Reform Party wanted to know what 
we are going to do about it.
<P>
	The infrastructure program has been part of the budget, 
65,000 direct jobs and perhaps close to 130,000 indirect jobs as 
a result. The youth service program has 17,000 as a first 
estimate. By an interim program to help get young people from 
school into the workplace we are talking about 60,000. On the 
reduction of the UI premiums alone, from a statutory 
requirement to be raised to $3.30 by 1995 will be brought down 
to $3.00 which in itself will create 40,000 jobs.
<P>
	On a rough total, my mathematics are pretty simple, that adds 
up to over 180,000 to 200,000 jobs forecast by direct initiatives 
of this government alone.
<P>
	We believe that will set the climate in which the private sector 
can respond. It will begin to set the engine rolling, it will begin 
to put a catalyst in the system so once again people will no 
longer have the insecurity of not knowing where the jobs are. 
They will know they have a government that cares where their 
jobs are and that is going to do something about it.
<P>
	When we hear all these cherry-picking criticisms, let us not 
forget the central task that we have to begin to mould our 
programs, our initiatives and our policies around that central 
fundamental issue of how to get people working again.
<P>
	Let me talk for a minute about the unemployment insurance 
changes. Members opposite have made a great deal of effort to 
try to distort the actual meaning of what took place. How can 
they distort the fact that in every single consultation that the 
Minister of Finance and, in every single meeting right across 
this country, we heard small business say to us that if we reduce 
the premiums, if we begin to reduce the burden of the payroll 
tax, if we begin to show for the first time that we are prepared to 
give small business a chance, it will go out and create work for 
Canadians?
<P>
	That is exactly what we have done. We have started a contract 
with the small business community across this country to say: 
We are beginning to do our part, now do yours. That is the 
message in the budget.
<P>
<B>(1525 ) </B>
<P>
	To give one example, if there is a small enterprise of 100 
employees, the net effect of the changes announced by the 
Minister of Finance would be a net saving to that employer of 
$30,000. There is one new job all by itself. What is wrong with 
that and why do members opposite oppose creating another new 
job in a small business?
<P>
	I want answers from them because they have not given them 
so far. All they are asking is how do we keep people on 
unemployment insurance. They do not ask how we put people 
back in the work place. That is the question they should be 
asking themselves.
<P>
	Certainly we have made a very clear linkage between one's 
work history and the amount of benefits provided. Some ask 
why. I would like to cite a couple of examples. It is time we 
began to break that sense that UI itself has become part of the 
wage scale of so many Canadians.
<P>
	I have a copy of a letter written to the Minister of Finance 
from someone living in a small town in British Columbia. The 
letter says: ``The people in this town do the necessary work and 
then refuse any further work until next year. They feel that the 
only time they need to work is to build up their UI claims and 
that they do not feel the need to do further work''. The sad part 
about this is that they say their children are beginning to do the 
same.
<P>
	We are building a culture in which we are saying that the only 
requirement is to get a bare minimum of 10 weeks and then one 
can be on pogey for the next 42 weeks. There is no relationship 
between work and benefit. We believe that unemployment 
insurance is crucial. It is a vital program. It is an essential 
program but it shall not be used to provide a replacement for 
work. It should be simply-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Axworthy (Winnipeg South Centre):</B> That is what the 
members opposite want us to do. They want to perpetuate a 
system that is killing jobs in this country and destroying the 
incentive to work.
<P>
	I think it is disgraceful at this time when there are so many 
unemployed Canadians that we have an opposition that says 
keep them that way, do not try to put them back to work.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, that is the position of the Bloc Quebecois. It 
prefers unemployment to jobs.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The fact of the matter is we have also said that we will begin to 
change our system to respond to need, that we recognize there 
are large numbers of people in that system who need special 
assistance.
<P>
	Again we changed the UI program to ensure that those who 
have the greatest need will receive the greatest benefits and we 
have raised the benefits.
<P>
	Some journalists yesterday asked me how we are different 
from the Tories. When we changed UI conditions we brought 
down benefits as a result to change work. When we changed 
benefits we made sure those most in need had the highest level 
of benefits.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1808"> 1808 </A></B>
<P>
	We also have made fundamental changes to the voluntary quit 
portion to change the onus of responsibility from the employee 
to the employer to make sure there is a built-in fairness in the 
system. That is how we are different. We care about the 
workers.
<P>
	The hon. member laughs. That is the hon. member who will 
stand in her place and say do something about social housing to 
create jobs but at the same time supports the party which has no 
interest in creating jobs by bringing down UI premiums, by 
changing the world of UI so that people have a chance.
<P>
	That is the problem. I do not think that party is really 
interested in getting Canadians back to work. Its real agenda is 
to provide delay, distortion, to show that federalism does not 
work so its own self-prophecy of separatism will be the agenda, 
not putting people back to work. That is the real, true agenda of 
the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
	We fully recognize that those changes in themselves are not 
enough. They are just the beginning. That is why we have put in 
place within the budget a fundamental restructuring of those 
programs at the federal level. It can provide a new framework 
for employment in this country, our training programs, our 
employment programs, our educational programs, our 
assistance programs, and unemployment insurance, and to begin 
to provide the integration of those programs so they begin to 
reinforce one another, they begin to provide a synergy of 
assistance and are not simply used as a way of propping up old 
ways of doing things.
<P>
	We recognize that action is required. We recognize that 
Canadians have voted for us, not for more studies, not for 
lengthy and delayed consultations. They want action. They want 
this government and this Parliament to show that it is ready to 
work to put Canadians back to work. That is the message we had 
and that is the message in the budget. That is why we believe that 
it is going to be absolutely crucial in the days and weeks ahead 
that we begin to build upon this framework.
<P>
<B>(1530) </B>
<P>
	A week or so ago we met with the provincial governments 
which have offered their full co-operation in a major program of 
reform. They are not hanging back, obscuring and obfuscating 
like members opposite have done during this budget debate. 
They are prepared to get in there and work.
<P>
	What is more important is that in joint co-operation with the 
provinces we have come to an agreement that over the next year 
or two we will initiate a number of new programs targeted at the 
most chronically unemployed Canadians, those who have been 
on welfare for a long period of time, those who have exhausted  
benefits and those who have various employment handicaps.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance has dedicated $800 million over the 
next two years to give this country a brand new lease on 
innovation. We are challenging the provinces, ourselves, 
employers, business groups and labour unions to become part of 
the new thinking and approach to the world of employment. We 
are prepared to use scarce resources to make sure that those 
hardest hit, those most in need, those with the longest record of 
unemployment will be given that assistance.
<P>
	I can report to members of the House today that already we 
have applications and proposals from every single province in 
this country. That is the kind of spirit of co-operation we need. 
That is the kind of working together that Canadians expect. That 
is the kind of esprit that Canadians voted for, that we have a 
notion as to how we can bring Canadians together to reason 
together and find ways of working together. That is the kind of 
invitation we keep putting out to members of the opposition to 
respond to.
<P>
	Of course they do not want to co-operate. We know why they 
do not. We know what their agenda is. We hear it every day in the 
House. Co-operation is not part of their make-up. Working 
together as Canadians is not part of their make-up. Trying to 
make this country economically strong and firm again is not part 
of their make-up. They have a very different, destructive, 
negative agenda but we will not let them succeed. We will not let 
them have their way because we want to put Canadians back to 
work.
<P>
	We believe that the budget is the first step in giving Canadians 
a sense of a new direction, a sense that they recognize that there 
is now a plan in place, that we are moving toward a new 
employment strategy, that we will begin to work within the 
programs of our own level of government, work with provinces 
and work with the private sector to give that sense that we can 
begin to reorganize, restructure and reform the system of 
employment in this country.
<P>
	I do not pretend it is going to be easy. I do not say it is 
something that is going to happen overnight. I recognize the 
difficulties of it. However, I also recognize that if we do nothing 
about it, if we simply hang on to the old shibboleth, if we simply 
echo the old arguments, if we simply hang on to the status quo 
then nothing will be done. We will not be able to have a better 
trained population. We will not be able to say to our young 
people that we are going to give them a chance to have a first 
time job with real employment, not to go on UI as their first 
source of income. We will not be able to say to older workers 
that we are prepared to help them get back to work.
<P>
	My colleague, the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, and I are 
presently working with other ministers on a program in the 
Atlantic in order to say to the 35,000 to 40,000 people in the 
fishing industry who have seen their  livelihood disappear that 
we are prepared to give them a five year commitment of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1809"> 1809 </A></B>
<P>
long-term stability, to change their training, to change their 
careers and to put them back to work on eco tourism, 
aquaculture, restoring the resources, conserving the reap of the 
natural riches of the Atlantic provinces so they will no longer 
have to say, when they get up in the morning: ``I have nothing to 
do. I am waiting for the fish to come back''.
<P>
	We are going to help them to go back to work and to put the 
fish back. They have been harvesting for 20 years. Now we think 
we can help them plan for the next 10. That is what we want to 
do. That is the new way of thinking about things. We are again 
working in co-operation with the provinces, the unions and the 
industry to make it happen.
<P>
	I think that this is the great crusade for this Parliament. This is 
the great mission that we have before us. How do we once again 
give Canadians a sense of the dignity of work, the opportunity to 
have a livelihood based upon their labours and their creative 
talents, something that is the entitlement and the right of every 
Canadian?
<P>
<B>(1535) </B>
<P>
	It will not be perfect and we will not fill every hole. We are 
now putting in place a youth service corps for community 
employment, an intern program for workplace training, and 
major changes to student aid and education so we can provide 
serious incentives to get back to school and get back to work. We 
are basically providing a guarantee to all our young people from 
18 to 21 that if they want to improve themselves, if they want to 
go to work, if they want to change their skills, the federal 
government is there to help. Those are the kinds of things we are 
working on.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, you have been very kind in allowing me to speak 
this full period of time. I hope that what we have been able to 
convey to members of this House and to Canadians listening that 
the need for a new employment strategy is paramount. The 
foundations were laid in the budget of our finance minister, but 
we have a lot of work to do yet.
<P>
	We have enormous work to do in this Parliament in coming 
together to put forward ideas, to provide a forum for Canadians 
to come together and present their solutions. We have an 
enormous amount of work to do in working in our own 
communities to change the attitudes of business and labour and 
community groups to begin seeing that employment is the major 
priority. We have a lot of work to do ourselves, to begin to 
understand that we can no longer separate or rely on the old 
habits and old ways of thinking.
<P>
	If we do it right, if we are able to mobilize ourselves into this 
new world of work, to face the new realities that we all have to 
experience, then I believe that at the end of this Parliament we 
will be able to say to Canadians we have done well by helping 
them to get back to work.
<P>
	That is our purpose and our mission.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Tremblay (Rosemont):</B> Mr. Speaker, when one 
has a little parliamentary experience and hears a minister make, 
in reply to the budget speech or as a follow-up to the budget 
speech, the kind of partisan remarks the Minister for Human 
Resources Development just made, you can be sure that he is 
hiding something.
<P>
	He spent half of his speech blaming the opposition. Yet, he is 
the one who ran an entire election campaign on job creation. The 
truth is plain and simple and, if it was easy to speak the truth, 
then the minister could speak it calmly. Canadians would 
understand.
<P>
	Why does the minister have to make such a fuss, raise his 
voice and make accusations? The reason is simple. I cannot say 
that he is lying, of course, but I can say that he is not telling the 
whole truth. The truth of the matter is quite simple. They are 
making $5.5 billion worth of cuts on the backs of the 
unemployed, cutting $2.5 billion in social assistance and there is 
no telling what is going to happen two years from now to 
post-secondary education, I mean federal transfer payments to 
the provinces in that area, but one thing is sure, we can expect 
cuts. We do not have the individual amounts for social 
assistance and post-secondary education, but the combined 
amount is in the budget.
<P>
	The minister talks about job creation. He did so during the 
entire campaign. Yet, in January, the government decided to 
collect an extra $800 million in UI premiums. And now, it is 
telling us that in 1995 it is going to reduce the premium rate and 
roll it back to its previous level. That will happen next year.
<P>
	The loss of 40,000 jobs has just been announced, and we will 
have more jobs in 1995. Of course, this is making the 
unemployment situation worse, so benefits have to be cut. 
Everyone can see that you are cutting benefits. Everyone can see 
that you are getting ready to cut social assistance. That is clear 
from your budget.
<P>
	It apparently contains measures for businesses. As we said 
before, Mr. Speaker, the Auditor General of Canada clearly 
demonstrated that Canadian corporations were hiding millions 
of dollars in international tax havens. Yet, there is only one tiny 
little measure with regard to banks and insurance companies in 
this budget, and it will not be implemented before November 
1995.
<P>
	In the <I>Globe and Mail</I> this morning banks were reported as 
saying: ``We did not get an answer yet. We are waiting. It is only 
for 1995, anyway''. Basically, what they mean is that things can 
change between now and then. Cuts on the other hand take effect 
immediately.
<P>
	I would ask the minister to calmly tell us the truth on this. He 
does not need to shout if he wants to get his message across to 
the Canadian people. Neither does he need to accuse the 
opposition. If he has positive steps to introduce, we are prepared 
to listen.
<P>

	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order! I recognize the hon. Minister of 
Human Resources Development.
<P>
<B>(1540 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Axworthy (Winnipeg South Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
response to the hon. member who said that there were all these 
cuts taking place in the budget and so on, I would remind him 
that there is a need in any budget to balance the objectives. One 
of the most important is to make sure that the fiscal stability of 
the country is held in a position which is respected by 
international finance.
<P>
	I would like to cite a very important authority on this matter. I 
quote from a page of <I>Hansard</I> of May 4, 1989.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We never see any recognition of the fact that we have throughout the country a 
responsibility for public finances and that those finances must be absolutely 
sound if we are to maintain social programs.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In other words, says the speaker, our responsibility is not just 
to Canadians living today who are having trouble but also to 
future generations. He goes on to talk about the need to handle 
the debt and deficit problems. The authority I cite is the-
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The authority I just quoted is the hon. leader of the Bloc 
Quebecois, when he was a member of the Conservative 
government. He has changed his position since he left the 
Mulroney government to become leader of the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Many members would like to speak. Is 
the minister finished?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Axworthy (Winnipeg South Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
understand. I would just like to simply have the amount of time 
that the hon. member took in posing the question. I think he 
missed it. I do not think he was in the House. I just want to point 
out to him that under the direct job creation measures proposed 
in the budget, not just the general economic climate ones, we are 
talking about 180,000 new jobs being created as a result. That 
seems to me to be a pretty good start.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
was interested in the minister's comments about selective 
attention. Basically I think what he was saying was tunnel 
vision. He was referring to his aim to achieve jobs for 
Canadians. He referred to the Reform aim or our concentration 
on the deficit as the be all and end all.
<P>
	However, in answer to the questions posed to the Minister of 
Finance less than an hour ago, after finally admitting that his 
eventual goal should be the achievement of a balanced budget, 
he volunteered the information, ``and that would allow us to 
reduce taxes''. By reducing taxes you enable business to expand 
and to generate jobs. These are long-term jobs.
<P>
	If I may quote the hon. minister, he has invested $6 billion, $2 
billion from the federal government, $2 billion from the 
provincial government and $2 billion from the municipal 
government, all from the same taxpayer and this is going to 
create 60,000 jobs, I think he said, with various off-shuttles. But 
these are short-term jobs and they are bought with borrowed 
money.
<P>
	I think the answer to the problem of Canada is to get our fiscal 
situation right and to generate long term jobs so that we own our 
future rather than owing it to somebody else.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Axworthy (Winnipeg South Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, there 
may be no argument about the question of getting the fiscal 
situation in order and bringing down the deficit. It is a question 
of how you want to do it. The Reform Party says the only way to 
do it is to cut all kinds of expenditures which would throw tens 
of thousands of Canadians out of work. That is what they are 
talking about. They are saying we did not go far enough. We 
have members here who are saying that we went too far.
<P>
	They are saying that the kind of Draconian measures proposed 
by the Reform Party would have the unemployment rate in this 
country going up to 13 per cent, 14 per cent, 15 per cent. We are 
saying that the only way to ultimately bring down the deficit is 
to get Canadians back to work, get them back creating revenue 
for their families. Get them off unemployment insurance. Get 
them back paying taxes. The responsibility of the government is 
to provide the stimulus to do that, to create a climate in which 
government can give a signal, a message to the private sector 
that the hard days are over and that they should get back and 
create work.
<P>
	In my speech I asked: What is one of the important signals? 
By reducing unemployment insurance premiums from a 
projected statutory rate of $3.30, it brings it down to $3 which 
for every company of 100 employees puts $30,000 back in the 
pocket of the employer; it puts $80 to $100 back in the pocket of 
the employee. That employee can go out and buy a kitchen table 
or his kid's shoes. That is how we are going to create deficit 
reduction, not by the cut and slash program-
<P>
<B>(1545) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened with 
attention to the very aggressive speech by the Minister of 
Human Resources Development. He launched several attacks on 
the Bloc Quebecois. He occasionally uses progressive terms to 
outline conservative, sometimes right-wing policies.
<P>
	Instead of tackling unemployment, the budget goes after the 
unemployed themselves. The Bloc Quebecois worries about the 
most disadvantaged in our society: unemployed workers and 
welfare recipients. I come from the union movement, Mr. 
Speaker, and we are not alone in our fight against the minister's 
budget and his cuts to unemployment insurance. I had feedback 
from three Quebec unions, namely the FTQ, the CEQ and the  
CNTU. I also heard from the Canadian Labour Congress. Over 
two million Canadians are very concerned about the govern-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1811"> 1811 </A></B>
<P>
ment's budget. The president of the FTQ, Clément Godbout, 
said, ``To effectively tackle the debt and deficit problem, we 
must put people back to work by creating jobs. However, this 
concern does not appear in the budget''. For the FTQ, this is 
incomprehensible. Not only does the government not do 
anything to create jobs, but it is hitting the unemployed very 
hard by taking $6 billion over the next three years from the 
unemployment insurance fund.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order, please. The hon. member must 
conclude his comments and ask his question as soon as possible.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nunez:</B> What does the Minister of Human Resources 
Development think of the unions' unanimous opposition to this 
government's budget, to its cuts to unemployment insurance and 
social programs?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Axworthy (Winnipeg South Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, what 
the unions said, as reported to us by the hon. member, is false, is 
not true. Indeed, the budget we brought down will create 
180,000 jobs. I hope that the hon. member will send to union 
members in his riding messages of hope and not the ones being 
sent by the Bloc Quebecois which say there is no hope for the 
unemployed. We are sending a positive message of hope. I hope 
he will relay it.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
cannot help but be astounded how a minister of a government 
can stand up and continuously say that spending more 
government money will create more jobs. Ultimately that 
money is going to turn into a higher deficit, more debt. When is 
that going to get paid off?
<P>
	My question though is on the infrastructure program. I was 
told very recently by a mayor of a municipality that the 
infrastructure program was basically going to accommodate 
their program to build sewers and roads. All it is doing quite 
frankly is costing them one-third of the cost instead of the whole 
full cost-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The Minister of Human Resources 
Development.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> What happens-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order. The hon. member's question is 
clear enough.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Axworthy (Winnipeg South Centre):</B> I am astounded 
equally by how members of the Reform Party do not have the 
economic sense to understand that when we put capital 
investment in new transportation, in new infrastructure, in 
improving productivity, we create new wealth for the country.
<P>
	Do they have no understanding of how important it is to 
improve the productivity of the country and to help people get 
back to work?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> You don't know what 
economic sense is.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order. Time has thankfully expired on 
the questions and answers.
<P>
<B>(1550 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
address the budgetary policy of the government as presented by 
the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	As a new member of Parliament and a member of the Standing 
Committee on Finance I listened intently to the minister's 
speech in the hope that this budget was going to be different. 
After cutting through the finance minister's wonderful rhetoric, 
the budget is nothing more than a continuation of the Trudeau 
philosophy that we can grow out of our economic problems.
<P>
	That concept was the solution for a different problem at a 
different time. In fact, the only things that grow out of this 
budget are overall spending, up by $3.3 billion, and the number 
of task forces, committees and hearings to determine and sell 
next year's budget. These new studies are up to about 15 new 
committees with three or four task forces.
<P>
	I have said this before in the House and I will say it again. 
Total government revenues are projected at $123.9 billion. Total 
expenditures are slightly less than this. It is the interest on the 
debt that creates the deficit of $41 billion. Interest expenses on 
the federal debt now total 33 cents of every tax dollar. I submit 
that it is the debt and the interest expense to service the debt that 
puts in jeopardy the viability and flexibility of our existing 
programs.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance has taken great pride in the 
unprecedented degree of consultation that his party sought in the 
preparation of the budget. What good is consultation when a 
government will not implement policies that people want and 
are demanding?
<P>
	I fail to see the finance minister's so-called game plan that he 
claims to have presented in a budget that is full of 
wait-until-next-year promises. Spending increases are this 
year and all the big spending cuts are left for future years.
<P>
	As a former professional football player I know the value and 
the purpose of a game plan. A game plan is about attacking a 
known obstacle or problem which in this case is the rising costs 
associated with servicing the debt.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1812"> 1812 </A></B>
<P>
	Based on the government's game plan I can tell members that 
they are attacking the wrong problem because they have 
ignored the debt. It will not work in the field of economics. 
However through his great political skills and wondrous 
humour skills, the Minister of Finance will certainly know how 
to talk to the reporters after the game. Will he blame the 
players, the game plan or himself when this plan fails?
<P>
	The finance minister has promised to ``put an end to real 
drift'' by guaranteeing meaningful jobs, training and retraining. 
How does he plan to do this when he tells the people who pay our 
salaries to wait another year for government to fulfil its 
policies? It appears that he has learned nothing while he was 
eight years in opposition and has applied, I am sad to say, very 
little of his own business acumen.
<P>
	I hope that the finance minister and the Prime Minister truly 
enjoy themselves as they travel across the country selling 
another year's worth of hope and weak promises on the rock 
solid financial foundation of living on borrowed money and over 
spending while those to whom they speak must live within their 
means.
<P>
	I submit that the budget, like those before it, has missed the 
mark. The Minister of Finance has truly wasted some golden 
opportunities to reduce spending and here are a few of them.
<P>
	The budget could have included the elimination of business 
subsidies and regional development programs; savings to the 
government, $3 billion to $4 billion. The budget could have 
outlined at the minimum a 25 per cent reduction of subsidies to 
crown corporations; savings to the government, $1.25 billion. In 
this area our party would have gone further and outlined the 
value of some privatization, with the application of the proceeds 
from the sale to the national debt, another savings to 
government of $3 billion to $4 billion.
<P>
	This budget could also have addressed old age security 
payments going to seniors whose household income is in excess 
of the national average of $54,000 per year. That is $54,000 and 
not $35,000 as the finance minister seems to say on television. 
They are not truly needy. Savings to the government, $2 billion 
to $3 billion.
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	If the government or the finance minister had done nothing, in 
other words no new budget, with his own figures and estimates it 
shows us that the federal deficit would have gone down, dropped 
to $41.2 billion from this artificially inflated $45 billion, in the 
coming fiscal year, and unemployment would have remained at 
around 11 per cent. By doing nothing that is what we would 
achieve. What the finance minister did was shuffle the financial 
deck of cards and confuse everyone with a new hand to evaluate.
<P>
	The finance minister has deferred the tough decisions and at 
the end of the day has ended up with virtually the same results. 
Why did he bother? He has created a whole lot of pain with no 
net gain for those who have been  asked to sacrifice. At the end 
of the day, in my opinion, if you are asked to contribute and 
sacrifice, there should be a reward, and there is none in the 
budget for those people.
<P>
	In my estimation, Canadians have been dealt a rotten hand 
while the finance minister on the other side of the table has 
finessed four aces in the financial deck of cards. When will he 
play the ace of toughness and cut overall spending by the 
government? When will he play the ace of reality and stop 
hiding behind taxpayer funded task forces and committees to 
debate the obvious? When will he make the real choice; do what 
has to be done, reduce overall spending.
<P>
	When will he play the ace of change and show something for 
his party's eight years of opposition, spent criticizing Tory 
budgets, and work toward helping Canadians see the benefit in 
attacking the debt instead of adding to it, more so than the 
previous Tory government did in their last year?
<P>
	Finally, when will the Minister of Finance play the ace of all 
aces, the ace of tax reform, and eliminate the incredibly high, 
complicated and bureaucratic taxation system that all Canadians 
want simplified and lowered? Canada needs a simple, visible or 
flat tax that is the same rate for individuals and businesses alike; 
a tax with no exemptions or loopholes in the range of 15 to 20 
per cent, which addresses the problem of equality, equity, 
neutrality and efficiency; a tax that increases disposable income 
for all Canadians and businesses and reduces the current 
bureaucratic, suffocating nightmare.
<P>
	These are the key factors for an effective system of taxation. 
The Liberal budget addresses none of them. When the finance 
minister has the courage to play this card, the ace of tax reform, 
his government will have begun to address the real problems in 
the country.
<P>
	This budget is not about change, but rather a nibbling at the 
edges leaving only high debt, high taxes and high 
unemployment, the exact opposite of what is intended.
<P>
	The Liberal Party always challenges us for alternatives. Here 
in my speech I have provided over $9 billion in cuts this year for 
the Minister of Finance to use which are not in his budget. I 
challenge him to take the initiative, take the credit, start 
reducing the debt and do what is best for the country.
<P>
	I say to the Minister of Finance: Stop talking a good game. 
Make some real decisions. Get into the game. Get your uniform 
dirty and complete the grand slam to lower debts.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (York-Simcoe):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would suggest that the Minister of Finance is not some kind of 
card shark who is gambling with the lives of Canadians. The 
Minister of Finance is someone who cares about the lives of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1813"> 1813 </A></B>
<P>
Canadians, is concerned about job creation and has taken a 
balanced view.
<P>
	When we have one million Canadians unemployed it costs the 
economy $25 billion, and I would suggest to the hon. member on 
the other side that perhaps the deficit is only the symptom not 
the root of the problem.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have long abandoned the deficit 
because when you say deficit the opposition tackles that. So let 
us present the real problem: the debt; the fact that the 
government is now adding another $41 billion to the debt. It is 
going to be $550 billion at the end of this coming fiscal year. It is 
the debt that is causing the problem and the interest on it. They 
make an emotional plea about jobs. Currently the 
unemployment rate is at 11.2 per cent. At the end of this year, 
with the finance minister's projections and the Minister of 
Human Resources Development with these 168,000 jobs 
offered, at the end of all this the unemployment rate goes from 
11.2 per cent to 11.1 per cent. This is one-tenth of 1 per cent. Is 
that what this government calls giving jobs to Canadians?
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>

	All you do is talk and promise, promise, promise but you do 
not deliver the goods. Here was your opportunity to lower the 
deficit to a point at which you could leave money in the hands of 
private enterprise so it could create long-term, meaningful jobs 
and it is equity capital.
<P>
	In the previous speech I heard the Minister of Human 
Resources Development say that capital creates jobs. There is 
no question that capital creates jobs but not borrowed money 
and not governments-equity capital not debt capital, private 
enterprise not public enterprise.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I would invite the hon. member for 
Calgary Centre to put his remarks through the Chair. The reason 
is quite simple. It is designed to promote harmony between the 
members by doing it that way. That is the theory.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Waterloo):</B> Mr. Speaker, let me 
express my harmony through you to the member for Calgary 
Centre.
<P>
	Actually I have found the member for Calgary Centre to be 
rather reasonable on some issues. What I am concerned about is 
the amount of response we have coming back and forth between 
the government and the Reform Party. It is the same kind of 
debate that took place during the election campaign when we all 
were on the hustings. We were all debating the issue.
<P>
	There is a fundamental question. We laid out a plan and our 
plan is the red book. The Reform Party laid out a plan which was 
the slash and burn book. My question to the member for Calgary 
Centre is will he not concede that we stayed true to what we said 
we were going to do in the red book?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, in response to the hon. member and 
with respect, I just cite the figures of the finance minister which 
show that the Liberals were elected on a promise to create jobs. 
The number of jobs they are going to create after 12 months is 
one-tenth of 1 per cent. If the member figures it out himself he 
will see that is not very much of a growth.
<P>
	If they keep that up in year two, year three and year four, 
pretty soon the rest of the member's mates will be back over on 
this side of the House and we will be all over there full. Once 
eastern Canada gets to see what we are talking about, the 
advantages of living within our means, it will understand that we 
have the right medicine and we have identified the right problem 
and not the pie in the sky that the Liberals keep talking about.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Prime 
Minister bought the Minister of Finance a new pair of work 
boots for the budget the other day and it is a good thing because 
he has certainly got his work cut out for him.
<P>
	Like all new work boots, or at least like any that I have had, it 
will only be a matter of time now before he gets a certain amount 
of organic material on them.
<P>
	This was the minister's first budget and we can only hope that 
within the next three budgets he will get better at reducing the 
deficit. This budget will put Canadians another $39.7 billion in 
debt, bringing the total debt in two years to $550 billion. If we 
add the projected deficit of $39.7 billion to this and the $32.7 
billion for the forecast for next year, one will find that we are 
adding another $72.4 billion to our already burgeoning debt.
<P>
	Since we are living on borrowed money, as has already been 
pointed out by my hon. colleague from Calgary, and borrowed 
money is subject to interest of at least 7 per cent, if we are lucky, 
we are adding another $5 billion in interest to that debt.
<P>
	To switch off of the negative for second, I do wish to 
commend the minister for showing at least some restraint and 
changing some government operations which will produce some 
savings.
<P>
<B>(1605 ) </B>
<P>
	Unfortunately, it seems to me that all of this will be negated 
by the cost of the 18 new programs and 15 new studies 
announced in this budget.
<P>
	When will this government admit that we have a spending 
problem? Spending is the key, not revenue. The government 
revenues for 1993-94 totalled $127 billion. The Prime Minister 
said in this House not too long ago we cannot run government as 
if it were a business.
<P>
	Even if we grant him that supposition, perhaps the 
government could be run like a household. Certainly, when we 
can no longer pay our bills in our household we have to take 
drastic measures; namely, do without some of the things that we 
can do 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1814"> 1814 </A></B>
<P>
without in order to reduce our expenditures to fit our income. 
That certainly seems to make sense to me.
<P>
	The whole issue of spending $70 billion a year on a social 
safety net and a further $40 billion on interest to service our debt 
simply has to stop. Past governments have certainly made the 
military their whipping boy at budget time. What do you know, 
this government seems to have taken right up where the other 
bunch left off.
<P>
	We on this side of the House were quite pleased. We 
applauded and supported the government in its promise to 
undertake a military defence review. Instead it accelerated the 
process and we as members of Parliament did not have any 
opportunity for input. It completely prejudiced the outcome of 
the study by going ahead and closing bases and reducing others.
<P>
	Perhaps if we had had a better equipped military we could 
have exercised sovereignty over the Atlantic fishery and we 
would not have to pay support to the whole east coast fishing 
industry. The cod stocks maybe would not be quite as low as they 
are now, and certainly they are depleted. Members opposite 
refer to our cod stocks as extinct. Now we have added all these 
otherwise self-sufficient business people to the ranks of the full 
time unemployed.
<P>
	The January unemployment rate was 11.4 per cent in Canada. 
Stats Canada reports that there were 1,592,000 unemployed 
people in Canada last month and that does not take into account 
all those people who have dropped out of the system.
<P>
	This budget simply nibbled at the edges in my opinion. The 
unemployment insurance program is a good example of that.
<P>
	Reducing the generosity of the program is, however, a step in 
the right direction. After all, we are all aware that generous UI 
programs do have the effect of increasing the number of people 
drawing unemployment insurance.
<P>
	The cumulative deficit of the unemployment insurance 
account amounts to $6 billion. It is a fallacy to believe that this 
is solely a worker-employer funded program. It is the 
government, the taxpayer of Canada, paying for the shortfall.
<P>
	The unemployment insurance program changes announced in 
the budget begin to target social benefits to lower income 
Canadians, as the minister has said, to target those most in need. 
This as well is a positive step.
<P>
	The Canadian unemployment insurance plan has become an 
inefficient income supplement plan rather than social insurance. 
We need to the ``un'' out of unemployment insurance. It should 
be employment insurance with extra emphasis on insurance. We 
buy life insurance, not death insurance.
<P>
	The Reform Party policy is to make employment insurance a 
sensible, sustainable program of social insurance which 
provides compensation for temporary loss of employment. We 
believe the program should be funded by employers and 
employees who determine the level of premiums and benefits. 
This, I am sure, would go  a long way in reducing the 
underground economy and ultimately relieving the tax burden.
<P>
	To quote the hon. Minister of Finance, the underground 
economy is not simply about smuggling, it is about hundreds of 
thousands of otherwise honest people who have withdrawn their 
consent to be governed.
<P>
	It appears that they are withdrawing their consent to be 
overtaxed as well.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Good point.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Johnston:</B> The underground economy's strength is 
directly proportionate to the high levels of taxation. Taxpayers 
need a break. The beleaguered Canadian taxpayer deserves a 
break.
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	Canadians do not want to cheat. They are prepared to pay their 
fair share of taxes. Does this budget provide a fair level of 
taxation?
<P>
	Over the last 10 years successive governments have increased 
the tax burden of the average middle class Canadian. The Fraser 
Institute reports that even though before tax earnings have 
increased for the average family, the percentage of after tax 
income has decreased. It has to be an increase in the taxation.
<P>
	At the same time the same governments allowed this debt to 
escalate to $500 billion, half a trillion dollars. Is it any wonder 
that the underground economy is flourishing? Does this budget 
give the taxpayer a break? I do not think so.
<P>
	We in the Reform Party will do everything we can to ensure 
that the minister gets an opportunity to wear out his new work 
boots. We will continue to work in this House and in committees 
to convince the minister and his government colleagues that 
they must reform their red ink book philosophy before the 
minister brings in another budget.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Harvard (Winnipeg St. James):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have one question to put to my hon. friend, the hon. member for 
Wetaskiwin.
<P>
	The hon. member went on a bit about the UI program. As 
opposition members are wont to do, the member focused on 
what he thinks are some of the more negative aspects of what we 
have done or not done with UI.
<P>
	One thing that he did not point out is the reduction in premium 
rates that will come about from $3.07 to $3.00. According to the 
government, and I have no reason to disbelieve the calculation 
put forward by the hon. Minister of Human Resources 
Development, that premium reduction alone could translate into 
as many as 40,000 jobs. That reduction does put an additional 
$300 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1815"> 1815 </A></B>
<P>
million into the hands of business. Most of that is small and 
medium size business.
<P>
	I would like to know from the hon. member for Wetaskiwin 
how he feels about that particular reduction and whether he 
would support putting that kind of money into the hands of 
business which might use it to increase jobs.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Johnston:</B> Mr. Speaker, the member raises an excellent 
question, one that I am sure we could debate on all day.
<P>
	The first thing that springs to my mind is that whenever 
government gives something, it first had to take something 
away.
<P>
	I am going to try to answer this question to the very best of my 
ability. I am not going to dance around it. If government had not 
been involved in unemployment insurance in the first place, if it 
was an agreement between the employer and the employee, 
probably the rate would have been down around $1.50. There 
would never have been a need for it to be raised in the first place 
so that it can be lowered at budget time.
<P>
	I think that should probably suffice the hon. member.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jerry Pickard (Essex-Kent):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would also 
like to ask a question of the member and congratulate him on his 
presentation.
<P>
	I have a bit of a problem with the position he took with regard 
to the military. I think it is very clear that as the budget came 
down, the finance minister and the minister of defence had a 
mandate to reduce expenditures and costs. Certainly there is a 
review of the military and that is extremely important as well.
<P>
	However, if they were not to take steps and measures within 
this budget of a $1.9 billion reduction we would have a deficit, 
in addition to what there is at present, of $1.9 billion more.
<P>
	Is the hon. member suggesting that those cuts not be taken and 
the deficit be increased?
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Johnston:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am suggesting that there is a 
need for military in Canada today. Let us define what it is. We 
need a certain amount of military to exercise our sovereignty 
over Canada. We also need a certain amount of military to 
exercise our sovereignty over our 200-mile offshore limit. We 
also need a certain amount of military for search and rescue 
operations.
<P>
	Let us define what it is before-and I use some terms I have 
heard from the other side of the House-we hack, slash and burn 
our military.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have a very quick question for my hon. colleague.
<P>
	He mentioned in passing in his speech that he found the $70 
billion figure for the social safety net unacceptable. Could I ask 
him what he thinks is an acceptable figure? In other words by 
how much would he cut the $70 billion and what programs 
would he cut thereby?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Johnston:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not know that it is so much a 
matter of cutting out certain programs. It is safe to say that we 
could find a level somewhat less than $70 billion.
<P>
	If we were able to lower our debt we would lower our interest 
payments and there would be at least a portion of the $40 billion 
that could be used to put into social programs. That would be my 
recommendation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Tony Ianno (Trinity-Spadina):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to present my maiden speech to Parliament with honour, 
pride and a great sense of responsibility. I would first like to 
congratulate you on your election as Speaker. I believe your 
sense of fairness and calmness will help us in these uncertain 
times as we face the unique challenges of the nation.
<P>
	I am honoured and humbled by the confidence placed in me by 
the people of Trinity-Spadina who have given me the 
opportunity to serve them in the House. In this capacity I hope to 
echo both their deepest concerns and their greatest hopes.
<P>
	Trinity-Spadina is located in the heart of downtown Toronto 
by Lake Ontario. It is one of the most economically and 
culturally diverse ridings in Canada. It is an exciting place to 
live and a great place to raise a family. It is home to the 
University of Toronto and the world champion Toronto Blue 
Jays. Great theatres and some of the best restaurants in Canada 
are located in places like Portugal Village, Little Italy, 
Chinatown, the Annex on Queen Street and the waterfront.
<P>
	I had the good fortune to be raised in Trinity-Spadina and 
have experienced many of its great attributes. My parents like 
many Canadians immigrated to this country because of the 
opportunities it provided. They instilled in me the belief that 
with hard work any dream can be achieved. They also instilled in 
me that sharing with and compassion for others must be integral 
parts of that dream.
<P>
	I believe the government was elected to give Canadians their 
pride, dignity and hope. The way to achieve this is by charting a 
new economic course. As an entrepreneur this experience allows 
me to speak with some insight on the issues facing our economy. 
Too often in Trinity-Spadina I see small business people 
striving to keep their enterprises alive. I see single mothers 
struggling to raise their children. I see university graduates 
trying to find jobs that do not exist and working people who 
cannot make ends meet. I see a staggering number of people who 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1816"> 1816 </A></B>
<P>
depend on the Daily Bread Food Bank, an appalling number of 
whom are children.
<P>
	For us to move ahead as a nation we must ensure those without 
a voice, those who have fallen through the cracks, are not left 
behind. We must give Canadians the tools to realize their 
potential and their dreams and thereby fulfil Canada's. That is 
this government's goal.
<P>
	The budget is the first step in achieving that goal by laying the 
basis for tomorrow's prosperity. In order to achieve this we must 
harness the initiative and creative talents of all Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	The key to the success of Canada's economy is our small and 
medium sized businesses. There are over 900,000 of them across 
the country. If we as a government as we have started to do in the 
budget establish the proper framework for our small and 
medium sized businesses so that each of these businesses can 
hire just one person, many of our economic problems would be 
solved and the government would have a net gain of $18 billion 
from direct employment alone.
<P>
	What small businesses need to achieve this is access to 
capital. The banks' rigid lending formulas and the arbitrary 
cancelling of lines of credit are cracking the backbone of our 
economy. Every time we allow a small business to close we not 
only lose jobs; we kill a dream. It is time Canadian banks 
recognize their responsibilities as partners in the development 
and growth of Canada's economy. Canadians through the Bank 
Act have given the banks special privileges. Canadians expect 
them to do more. We will work to achieve it.
<P>
	The first step, as mentioned in the budget, was to establish a 
task force that would develop a code of conduct for small 
business lending. Small businesses also need access to the 
emerging new global economy to survive and grow. The opening 
of foreign markets to Canadian business will provide 
unprecedented opportunities for growth. Canada's cultural 
diversity, coupled with its entrepreneurial spirit, gives our 
country a unique advantage in this highly competitive world.
<P>
	This government is going to play its role. Our international 
network of embassies and trade officers will provide a 
pro-active, ongoing link to these exciting new export markets. 
The economic engines of the future are the emerging 
technologies of today. We must participate fully in the 
technological revolution and be at its leading edge.
<P>
	Through increased funding for the National Research Council 
and the technology partnership program, government will bring 
together our research institutions and the private sector to 
capitalize on the innovations of Canadians in such fields as 
environment, health care, biotechnology and 
telecommunications. In some of these fields we are already 
world leaders.
<P>
	By the year 2000 environmental technology sales alone will 
be worth approximately $580 billion a year. We have great 
opportunities. The government's task is to ensure that 
Canadians have the capacity to meet these new challenges.
<P>
	Let me give an example from my own riding. At Central 
Technical High School a partnership has already been forged 
between the school and the Canadian Tire Corporation. In the 
past Canadian Tire could not find graduates trained in computer 
based auto repair. To help remedy this situation they provided 
the school with $200,000 of equipment to modernize the auto 
mechanics teaching facility. Because of this, graduating 
students will now enter the workforce with the most up to date 
skills and Canadian Tire will not have to look abroad to fill the 
jobs.
<P>
	We must keep up with technological change, not only in our 
educational facilities but also in the workforce and the 
workplace. We must use new technologies to reinvigorate our 
existing industries. As an example, Spadina Avenue has 
historically been synonymous with the fashion industry in 
Canada. Today, to remain competitive, this industry must 
embrace new approaches to design and manufacturing. By 
drawing on the creative talents of designers and by utilizing the 
most modern computer assisted systems we can put Toronto 
once again back on the leading edge of the global fashion 
industry.
<P>
	It is only through this kind of creative leadership that we can 
accomplish these changes. The budget will help in the required 
transformation.
<P>
	However economic growth is not just a matter of exporting 
abroad. It is drawing on the strengths we already have. In 
Trinity-Spadina we know first hand the benefits that can come 
from expanding tourism. Trinity-Spadina is home to many of 
Canada's most unique tourist attractions. From the art galleries 
and the museums to the theatres and the bistros, from the 
SkyDome to Ontario Place, from the CN Tower to Harbourfront 
Centre, millions of visitors come to my riding to enjoy music, 
art, theatre, history and sport. We must take advantage of this 
resource. Governments and business must work together to 
expand this industry by letting the world know of our treasures. 
These resources must be aggressively marketed. Tourism is a 
form of export. The difference is that foreign customers come 
here and leave their money behind.
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	I draw the attention of members to a potential infrastructure 
project in my constituency which will provide much needed 
construction jobs and will advance the long-term goals I have 
described. I am referring to the establishment of the World 
Trade Centre at Exhibition Place or the expansion of the Toronto 
Convention Centre. Either of these facilities would provide 
Canada with a venue that would allow us to compete with 
convention centres around the world. By drawing these shows to 
Canada we could help small and medium sized  businesses bring 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1817"> 1817 </A></B>
<P>
their Canadian products and technologies to the world 
marketplace.
<P>
	Along with bolstering our export market such a facility would 
draw hundreds of thousands of visitors who would leave 
millions of dollars behind. The people of Trinity-Spadina want 
to be a part of a proud Canadian team competing in this 
international market. Canada has the tools and an intelligent 
educated workforce that can adapt to these new industries and 
technologies. We have the strength in our diversity and we have 
the desire and ability to succeed. We are not afraid of 
competition.
<P>
	The budget set the foundation on which the future economic 
growth of Canada will be built. This government will be the 
catalyst to bring Canada's people, businesses and institutions 
together to harness our strengths and to achieve our common 
goals.
<P>
	All Canadians must share in our growth. Everyone's dream is 
important. No one will be left behind.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia-Matane):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened attentively to the hon. member opposite. In addition to 
our ideological differences, I noticed something else. I noticed 
that there are huge differences between urban and rural 
constituencies. Where I live, there is no CN Tower. I live in a 
rural riding whose population depends on farming and forestry 
and where many are unemployed.
<P>
	Is the hon. member not a little surprised that the budget cuts 
funds for forestry and maintains the status quo for agriculture? 
Are you not a little surprised by that?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ianno:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for the question. 
I am not surprised. What we are doing in the budget is setting the 
framework so that we can invest in agriculture and forestry, but 
maybe not in the same ways that have been used in the past.
<P>
	We have to get creative. There is a lot available for us with 
new forestry technology and agricultural technology. Not only 
will we serve our own purposes here as my father-in-law on his 
own farm and my relatives deal with. There will be a future. 
Their children will have a chance to participate in innovative 
ways. Not only will we be able to use the technology in Canada 
but abroad to the benefit of export markets for cattle and 
everything else our farmers utilize, and in our forest industries 
when we take into account depletion around the world and our 
concern for the environment.
<P>
	I am not surprised by the member's question, but I hope in the 
next four years when the economy comes along with us we will 
be at the leading edge of a lot of these new industries that our 
communities will be able to participate in fully and vibrantly, 
especially the young.
<P>
<B>(1630 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I know the hon. member was referring to me 
when he said you.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to thank 
the hon. member for not only his speech but the demure way in 
which he gave it. I appreciated that very much. His presence 
would be welcome in my office or in my presence at any time as 
a result of that.
<P>
	I would like to ask the member a question having to do with 
the debt. We have been told by economists that we may be 
beyond the line of any return on the debt. What impact does the 
member feel the addition of $100 billion to the federal debt over 
the next three years will have upon job creation and employment 
in Canada?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ianno:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question from the 
hon. member.
<P>
	We wish that we did not have any debt to deal with and could 
just deal strictly with investment. However, as a small business 
person I can tell the hon. member that when one is searching for 
growth, one has to pay a price and that price is in investment.
<P>
	I believe that we need to retrain our work force in Canada. I 
indicated in my speech that we have to give training to the lower 
echelon of Canadians, those who do not currently participate in 
the situation. We have to give them the opportunity to have the 
tools so that we, as business people and entrepreneurs, can 
develop the niche markets and expand internationally to bring 
all of that money back to Canada for growth. We must help 
Canadians, those who are not as fortunate as some of us, to be 
able to participate in the process.
<P>
	I therefore believe that there is an investment. I am not afraid 
of having a debt in order to invest in the future.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It is my duty, pursuant to Standing 
Order 38, to inform the House that the questions to be raised 
tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows: the hon. 
member for Crowfoot-Indian Affairs; the hon. member for 
Regina-Qu'Appelle-Book Publishing Industry.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul DeVillers (Simcoe North):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak in support of the budget tabled by the finance 
minister earlier this week. I am particularly comfortable in 
supporting this budget because it is the funding of the red book 
key programs that were the Liberal platform in the last election. 
They contain investments in people and job creation not 
necessarily through tax increases but rather through spending 
cuts.
<P>
	Earlier today in this House I heard what in my opinion was 
hollow rhetoric coming from the backbenches of the 
independent members to the effect that this budget must have 
been ghost written by a former Tory minister.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1818"> 1818 </A></B>
<P>
	I would like to take the opportunity to outline some of the 
measures contained in the budget, some of the red book 
programs that are being implemented. For instance, the 
establishment of the national infrastructure program that is 
already in place, the restoration of full funding for the national 
literacy program, the establishment of the youth service corps, 
the establishment of the youth internship and apprenticeship 
programs, the insurance of access to capital for small businesses 
in replacement of GST, the reinstatement of the residential 
rehabilitation assistance program, the establishment of a 
prenatal nutrition program, the establishment of the aboriginal 
head-start program, the establishment of a centre of excellence 
for women's health, the restoration of the court challenges 
program, the restoration of the law reform commission, the 
establishment of the Canadian race relations foundation and the 
establishment of the national forum on health.
<P>
	I suggest that it is indeed hollow rhetoric to suggest that this 
was written by a former Tory minister. What this budget 
contains in addition to the implementation of these red book 
programs is hope.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	If we want to give voters hope in our political institutions 
again, governments must keep their promises. Canadians have 
had enough of governments that say one thing and do the 
opposite. With the former government, this country got the habit 
of not respecting politicians because of broken promises. Just 
think of universal social programs, which were a sacred trust for 
the former government. We are keeping our word with this 
budget. We are doing exactly what we promised to do.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Past efforts by Tory governments in deficit reduction 
overlooked the expenditure side of the financial statements. 
Tory minister after Tory finance minister used to indicate that 
the forecasted deficits were not attained because there was not 
enough revenue. They were able to control the spending but 
there was not enough revenue. That is why I submit that what we 
have in this country is an income crisis, not a spending crisis.
<P>
	Government like businesses must be prepared to promote and 
intervene in economic activity to create revenues. That is 
something that has been lacking in the last few years and it is 
something that is contained in this budget that is before the 
House.
<P>
	This budget also was delivered following unprecedented 
consultation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The pre-budget consultation process begun by the Minister of 
Finance gave many people an opportunity to express their views 
on the policies which affect them deeply. The government has 
created an important precedent with these consultations. I hope 
that we can go beyond the four cities that were visited by the 
advisory  committee for next year's budget. Through the debates 
in this House, I was able to share the concerns of my constituents 
in Simcoe North.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The measures contained in my prebudget debate speech that 
received favourable review in the budget include the need to 
prevent tax avoidance through offshore affiliates of Canadian 
companies, a review by the parliamentary committee of family 
trust rules, partial preservation of business expense deductions, 
no reduction in RRSP contribution limits and implementation of 
a permanent RRSP first time home buyers' plan.
<P>
	In addition, this government will be undertaking a complete 
tax review in the very near future. As a matter of fact it is already 
before committee. That will include the replacement of the GST.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I already said in this House that Canadians have an 
unprecedented lack of confidence in our taxation policies. If we 
want Canadians to respect the law, they must feel that the law is 
fair and equitable.
<P>
	If we want our economic recovery to succeed, people must 
feel good and contribute to the economy. I can say with full 
confidence that the measures in this budget will restore the 
confidence of Canadians. Canadians can now count on this 
government for greater fiscal fairness.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This budget has been well received by the international 
monetary markets. I am aware that the Canadian dollar was 
indeed up yesterday, the day after the budget was announced. 
The budget also received favourable comment from the 
Canadian Federation of Independent Business. It realizes that 
the UI premium reduction provided for in this budget was in fact 
a tax on business and jobs and that this measure will indeed help 
in job creation.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This budget shows that this government is taking a radically 
different approach from the one the former government took. 
Some people want us to give up our search for a just society. As 
the finance minister said, this is not the time to move away from 
our values; on the contrary, it is the time to return to them.
<P>
	The mere fact that the opposition parties claim on the one 
hand that we have not cut enough and on the other that we have 
cut too much is a perfect indication that this budget is balanced.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1819"> 1819 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The bottom line is that we are delivering on our election 
promises. This budget puts us on track to reduce the deficit to 3 
per cent of GDP in three years. This was what our red book 
commitment contained.
<P>
	Some opposition members have been saying that we did not 
cut deeply enough. This is the position of most of the Reform 
Party speakers I have heard.
<P>
	Their election platform as I understood it was a zero deficit in 
three years. In my estimation that would create untold hardship 
on Canadians. We have already seen the hardship that the 
present measures in the military cuts have inflicted on Canadian 
lives. To attempt to reduce a deficit of this magnitude in three 
years I submit would be untenable.
<P>
	The Liberal approach is much more balanced and realistic. 
The majority of Canadians supported the Liberal plan. 
Canadians know one cannot stop putting groceries on the table 
in order to pay off the mortgage on the house in three years.
<P>
	I do not expect the opposition to agree with this budget since 
they campaigned against the Liberal plan. I do not believe that 
they or Canadians can truthfully say the Liberal government is 
not following our red book plan.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Terrebonne):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
apologize to Mr. Collenette if we are bothering him, but we do 
have to speak up from time to time in the House.
<P>
	First of all, I want to get back to something my hon. colleague 
from Simcoe North said. Throughout his presentation, he kept 
repeating that his government had delivered on its promises and 
had followed through on its red book plan, and so on. In their red 
book-as you can see, I have read it because I am familiar with 
the lies it contains-, the Liberals promised to convert military 
bases into peacekeeping training and staging centres. A program 
is like a contract and when one fails to meet the terms of a 
contract, one must pay a penalty.
<P>
	The Liberals did not promise to close military bases. They 
promised to convert them into peacekeeping training and 
staging centres. So, what did the government do? It closed some 
bases and consolidated others. As a result, jobs have been lost.
<P>
	I would like to ask the hon. member, through you, Mr. 
Speaker, if the government gave any thought at all to the cost of 
redeploying thousands of military personnel who will have to be 
moved and reassigned? Did it give any thought at all to number 
of direct and indirect jobs that would be lost as a result of base 
closures? The government talks about job creation, but what I 
see are job losses.
<P>
	In an editorial, Lise Bissonnette stated the following: ``In five 
years, once the dust has settled, DND will not even have saved 
$1 billion. Not even $1 billion after five years. The figure will be 
more like $850 million.  However, for the communities in which 
the designated bases are located, economic activity will grind to 
a halt. Everyone will feel the effects: the corner store, the movie 
theatre, the school and the restaurant. Activity will come to a 
standstill because direct and indirect jobs will be lost''. That is 
the first part of my question.
<P>
	The second part has to do with the promises you made. Did 
you promise during the election campaign to tax the elderly? 
Did you promise during the election campaign to penalize the 
unemployed? Did you promise during the election campaign to 
extend the wage freeze in the public service? Did you promise 
during the election campaign to close military bases? These are 
my questions, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	<B>Mr. DeVillers:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not think I have enough time 
to answer all of these questions.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I am sure the hon. member knows that the red book contained 
many promises. The present action taken in the budget with 
respect to the military closings was not an action taken lightly. It 
results obviously in some unemployment for people who are 
affected. The minister of defence has assured us that there will 
be early retirement packages available as well as relocation 
packages, et cetera, to try to deal with that. But the more 
significant issue is that the funds that are being saved by these 
cuts, which we are informed should have been made years ago 
and would have been easier to make at that time, are being 
reinvested into the programs, some of which I listed at the 
beginning of my speech, where there would be a better return for 
the job creation that is required than to continue to fund the 
military establishments that are no longer useful.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a few 
points I would like to raise in response to the hon. member's 
speech in defence of the budget.
<P>
	He took great pride in talking about the new programs that are 
being introduced in the budget. This was presented by the 
Minister of Finance as being a tough budget. Yet 18 new 
programs are being introduced. We have gone 125 years since 
Confederation without these programs. This was supposed to be 
a tough budget and here we have the government starting off and 
spending on programs in brand new areas.
<P>
	I have another point, and it is the one to which I would really 
like the member to respond. He said we have an income crisis 
and not a spending crisis. The country is $500 billion in debt. 
Canadians are groaning under the weight of taxes they can 
hardly afford to pay. I would like him to tell us why he thinks we 
have a revenue crisis rather than a spending crisis.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1820"> 1820 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. DeVillers:</B> Mr. Speaker, the definition of a deficit is the 
difference between incomes and expenditures. My position, and 
I believe my party's position, is that we can increase our 
revenues. Government obtains revenue from taxation. The 
problem is we do not have enough people paying taxes because 
of the unemployment rate.
<P>
	The measures being implemented through the red book 
program and through the budget are designed to get more people 
employed so that we can broaden the tax base, have more people 
paying taxes, not people paying more taxes. That is the object of 
the budget.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Daviault (Ahuntsic):</B> Mr. Speaker, as a 
Montrealer from way back who represents Ahuntsic, a Montreal 
riding, I would like to talk about my city, the city of Montreal.
<P>
	A number of years ago when I was still in elementary school, 
our teachers taught us, with barely disguised pride, that 
Montreal was Canada's metropolis. We were the residents of a 
city that was Canada's financial and banking centre. The port of 
Montreal was Canada's major port, handling goods from 
Ontario and the Prairie provinces and imports from Europe and 
Africa. Those were the good old days, but times have changed.
<P>
	Montreal has now become this country's poverty capital. In 
the metropolitan area, 18.5 per cent of households live below the 
poverty line. And with the first Martin budget, Montreal has 
become the capital of despair. During the past ten years, poverty 
has been gaining ground, and not only undermining the moral of 
Montreal's residents but also their ability to face the major 
challenges it must overcome to be competitive on the market. 
Business arteries formerly crowded with shops, boutiques and 
markets, now show signs ``for rent'', ``going out of business'' 
or, tersely, ``bankruptcy''. I am not dramatizing at all. This is a 
fact of life in Montreal.
<P>
	But what these shop windows tell us reflects only a fraction of 
the experience of Montreal residents. According to a study 
conducted by United Appeal to improve the way it targets 
funding to the neediest in the organization's territory, half the 
low-income residents surveyed in the United Appeal's territory 
live in the city of Montreal. Montreal Island has a poverty rate 
that is higher than the average rate for the greater United Appeal 
district, which also includes the suburbs. In Montreal, Montreal 
North, Verdun and Ville-Saint-Pierre, one resident out of three 
lives below the poverty line.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	I may add, for the benefit of the Minister of Finance, that his 
own city and his own riding has been struck by poverty as well, 
since one resident out of four in Ville LaSalle lives below the 
poverty line.
<P>
	This is the same minister who gave us a budget that, 
ostensibly to give the economy a boost, takes the money out of 
the pockets of those who need it most. They do not need the 
money to put into family trusts and save on their income tax or to 
compensate for the fact that they can no longer deduct their 
business lunches. They need the money for food, clothing, 
shelter and health care.
<P>
	Not so long ago, when he was meditating on the opposition 
benches before becoming Minister of Finance, this is the same 
person-although he seems to have forgotten this, as we saw in 
his first budget-the same person responsible for the economic 
development of greater Montreal, who wrote in <I>La Presse</I> on 
June 8, 1992, in referring to Montreal: ``As the economic 
heartland and a major development force, the Montreal region 
must be given a boost very quickly, otherwise its economic 
decline will be that of Quebec as well''.
<P>
	Why did the minister not introduce the kind of measures he 
proposed last June, which included upgrading or rebuilding 
infrastructures and a program for home renovation assistance, 
which, as he said quite accurately, generated jobs and would be 
very beneficial in an area like Montreal, with one of the highest 
tenancy rates in the country? Since the only existing renovation 
program, the Residential Rehabilitation Assistance Program, is 
intended not for tenants but for owner-occupants, one wonders 
who had the most powerful lobby.
<P>
	Why did the same member, who is now the minister, not talk 
about creating super economic incubators and implementing a 
policy for renewal of growth sectors in the manufacturing 
industry in partnership with Quebec and the city of Montreal?
<P>
	These are all former proposals made by the minister. Was it all 
just a fantasy? What happened to the promise he made with other 
Liberal candidates last October, a promise that included 
investing $250 million in research and development in Quebec, 
mostly in Montreal? What happened, since everyone agrees 
Quebec does not get its fair share of spending on research and 
development?
<P>
	How could they promise such measures and many others it 
would take too long to mention, and not take concrete steps in 
the Budget, at a time when we are witnessing the pauperization 
of Montreal? And what are the consequences, in the near and not 
so near future, of a deteriorating financial situation in a city of 
1.2 million with an unemployment rate that rose from 9.1 per 
cent in December 1989 to 13.8 per cent in December 1993, 
higher than the unemployment rate in St. John's, Newfoundland 
during the same period, or in Toronto, where the unemployment 
rate rose from 4.1 per cent in December 1989 to 11.5 per cent for 
the same period?
<P>
	One of the more obvious signs of poverty is reflected in the 
housing situation, shelter being a very basic need and extremely 
important in a country like ours with its severe winters-some-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1821"> 1821 </A></B>
<P>
thing we can certainly see these  days-like the winter we are 
going through, which may end some time this spring?
<P>
	But seriously, the housing situation has been discussed many 
times in this House, and with good reason. It is a good way to 
assess the poverty level of a city or any other community. In the 
last census, we get a very good picture of the rental housing 
situation in Quebec and Canada. In Toronto, 62 per cent of all 
units requiring major repairs were occupied by tenants. In 
Montreal, the figure is about the same, that is, 59 per cent; it is 
58 per cent for Ottawa-Hull and 54 per cent for Vancouver.
<P>
	In Montreal, families in rental housing live in appalling 
conditions. One household out of three spends more than 30 per 
cent of its income on accommodation, and one household out of 
six spends more than 50 per cent. Nearly 20,000 people are 
considered homeless. According to the Montreal Municipal 
Housing Bureau, 10,000 households or about 20,000 people are 
on the waiting list. Most of the requests for low-cost housing 
come from seniors, single-parent families and people with 
disabilities, that is to say the most vulnerable segment of our 
society.
<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
	Last Tuesday, merely two hours before the budget speech, 
when I inquired about the lack of social housing, the Minister of 
Public Works, who is responsible for the Canada Mortgage and 
Housing Corporation, asked me to be patient, that I would have 
an opportunity to review the decisions of the Minister of 
Finance once he had delivered his budget. The fact of the matter 
is that there is nothing for social housing in that budget.
<P>
	In Montreal, 63,280 households pay in excess of 50 per cent of 
their income in rent. That is about one tenant household in five, 
or 19.1 per cent. Montreal is the Canadian city with the highest 
number of tenant households paying over 50 per cent of their 
income in rent, with 19.1 per cent, as compared to 14.5 per cent 
in Ottawa and 16 per cent in Toronto.
<P>
	One third of all tenant households forced to devote in excess 
of 50 per cent of their income to housing, or 194,225 
households, live in Quebec, as compared to 583,705 in Canada. 
With a much larger population, Ontario has about the same 
number of households in the same predicament: 194,920 
households, in a much larger population. There are 77,120 such 
households in British Columbia.
<P>
	To complete this list of sad statistics showing the poverty 
level in Montreal, we must take a brief look at Montréal-Nord, a 
city represented by Mr. Nunez, the hon. member for Bourassa, a 
neighbouring riding. The level of poverty in Montréal-Nord is 
such that experts warn that it could turn into a social tinderbox. 
In Montréal-Nord, a very cosmopolitan city, 10,500 
households, nearly 42 per cent of all tenant households, spend 
more than 30 per cent of their income on housing, while 22 per 
cent spend over 50 per cent. These figures reflect a completely 
absurd situation.
<P>
	Again, it must be pointed out that, last October, the Minister 
of Finance, like the rest of the Liberal candidates, had promised 
to support co-ops and non-profit organizations involved in 
providing social housing.
<P>
	At this point, I must quote statistics from the Co-operative 
Housing Federation of Canada. In 1992, there were 17,400 
housing units in Quebec versus 35,000 in Ontario; 17,400 versus 
35,000. These figures show once again that Quebec does not get 
its fair share. One out of two is certainly not a prorated share. 
This is no doubt another good example of the fairness of the 
federal system.
<P>
	Why is it then that the Minister of Finance wrote a coalition of 
organizations involved in social housing and told them that it 
was up to the federal administration to ensure that over one 
million Canadian households have decent and affordable 
housing? I hope that our colleagues will ask questions about the 
RRAP program, so that we can cover that aspect as well.
<P>
	How can a nation which calls itself civilized and boasts that it 
is the best in the world, as our friends have told us repeatedly, 
see the desperate situation some of its citizens, people just like 
you and me, are in because they are unable to find work or have 
lost their jobs and have us believe that taking $5.5 billion away 
from the unemployed over the next three years will help put 
Canada back to work? It is surrealistic. By failing to tackle the 
deficit directly by reducing duplication and overlap, of which 
we still do not fully appreciate the magnitude, failing to even 
impose minimum tax on large corporations and getting cold feet 
when it should cut federal operating expenditures, the 
government made the conscious decision to get the money it 
needed out of the pockets of the most vulnerable members of our 
society.
<P>
	With the qualifying period for unemployment insurance 
benefits increased from 10 to 12 weeks, chances are that all 
those whose work is seasonal in nature, like farmers, fishermen, 
gardeners, waiters and waitresses, and summer camp workers, 
or do contract work, which is the only way for many young 
professionals to earn a living, will be greatly penalized. Again, 
the hardest hit by the measures introduced by the Minister of 
Finance will be the people who already have an employment 
problem.
<P>
<B>(1700) </B>
<P>
	Furthermore, beginning unemployment insurance reform 
before the vast consultation to identify the people's needs even 
begins will have a downright disastrous effect on the provinces' 
finances. These measures will put more people on welfare, at 
provincial expense; the provinces in turn will be forced to cut 
their programs as a result of the freeze on transfers to the 
provinces. Part of our deficit is being shifted to our neighbours, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1822"> 1822 </A></B>
<P>
while their funds to meet the resulting new needs are cut. The 
situation is most alarming. It is quite a program.
<P>
	Just think that during the election campaign, the Liberal Party 
spoke only of employment and equity, and this budget provides 
no remedy for unemployment and poverty; it only offers 
short-term jobs, which we hope will last at least 12 weeks so 
that these workers qualify for unemployment insurance. It is 
clearly insufficient for restoring the dignity of people without 
work.
<P>
	The unemployed, especially jobless women, seniors and the 
poor will pay the price for the Liberal government's social 
spending cuts. The Minister of Human Resources Development, 
whom I would call Mr. Axe, tells us that the social program 
review could lead to more cuts. What an indecent turnaround in 
the Liberals' social positions from the time they were in 
opposition until now, when they are in power. Unemployment 
insurance cuts lead to more people on welfare, the present 
Deputy Prime Minister said in 1992. Unemployment insurance 
cuts lead to more people on welfare! She was in the opposition 
then. If you raise your eyebrows, you can check the news on the 
French network of the CBC yesterday; it ran that newsclip.
<P>
	These new cuts still mean shifting the deficit to the provinces. 
Freezing transfer payments costs the provinces $2 billion more. 
Montreal is seriously ill, but the Liberal government is still 
cutting a little more of the oxygen off from its disadvantaged 
population. We have to thank the Liberals for their generous 
program of collective impoverishment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Graham (Rosedale):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to thank 
the hon. member for his eloquent speech and for his description 
of a city that has fallen on hard times. Many of us who live 
elsewhere in Canada also find this situation very distressing. I 
was born in Montreal, but have lived many years in Toronto. I 
also taught at McGill University and at the University of 
Montreal. I do have a question for my colleague and I ask it of 
him humbly and with no malice. Will he not concede that the 
problems experienced by the big city of Montreal, which should 
be a prosperous city after all, are due to his own policies and 
threats of independence? In order for a city to be prosperous, it 
needs to attract investment. Investors are shying away from 
Montreal. Even Montrealers themselves refuse to invest their 
money because they fear the current policies. You are 
responsible for creating this situation, and we are having to pay 
for it. This budget attempts to correct the imbalance created by 
your own policies.
<P>
	Montreal first lost its advantage over Toronto when Mr. 
Lévesque was elected. I remember, because I living in Montreal 
at the time. We can trace everything back to this time. That is 
when Montreal lost its edge over Toronto. People in this world 
are free to do as they please. They are free to leave, free to 
travel, free to invest their money wherever they want.
<P>
	I would like you to be honest and to ask yourselves whether 
your sovereigntist policies encourage investment in Quebec or 
whether in fact your policies are responsible to some extent for 
creating the problems which you have so sadly ascribed to us. I 
put this question to you very humbly, as all Canadians are very 
fond of Montreal.
<P>
<B>(1705) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Please address your remarks to the 
chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Daviault: </B>Mr. Speaker, through you, I thank the hon. 
member for his nice comments. Earlier I quoted unemployment 
figures from 1989 to 1993. As far as I know, there was no 
sovereigntist government in Quebec at that time.
<P>
	I would like to talk about a study done by Professor William J. 
Coffey and Mario Polèse-it could be tabled if someone asks for 
a copy; this document is available at the Library by the way-on 
the city of Montreal; it is called <I>Le déclin de l'empire 
montréalais: regard sur l'économie d'une métropole en 
mutation</I>. The authors are not sovereigntists. Their analysis 
shows that Montreal's decline is mainly due to what they call the 
loss of the hinterland. The market gradually moved to Toronto. 
Our industries got older. The Lachine canal region, which was a 
cradle of industrial development in Canada, is sinking into 
obsolescence; major investments are needed to revitalize it.
<P>
	I was involved in creating an association to promote 
economic development in Montreal. In the end, we must take 
ourselves in hand at the local level and this, in turn, will lead us 
to do the same at the national level. I am a Montrealer and a 
``Montrealist'' and, in that sense, we cannot propose to use the 
means at our disposal while leaving important tools in the hands 
of the federal government, which does a very poor job of 
managing them.
<P>
	During question period this afternoon, the minister, in a flight 
of partisan oratory, talked about the RRAP. The RRAP was 
supposed to be a social housing program. The first part of the 
program is aimed at homeowners and the second part, at 
handicapped people. The part of the program designed for 
handicapped people can be compared to social housing, 
obviously.
<P>
	We know that Montreal has a problem, mostly because of 
single parent families and the large number of new residents, 
who often live in apartments. Toronto probably has the same 
problem to some extent. But these people are not eligible under 
that program.
<P>
	This government, which was a great advocate of social 
housing when in opposition, throws us a few peanuts and tells us 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1823"> 1823 </A></B>
<P>
it is providing social housing; it is outrageous. When the 
minister adds that we should applaud the Minister of Finance, 
who is responsible for Montreal's economic development, that 
is the last straw.
<P>
	So this study, that will be made available to you-again, it is 
called <I>Déclin de l'empire montréalais</I>-identifies the Quebec 
political option as a minor factor. It is a minor political factor at 
this stage. I would guess that William J. Coffey is not a 
sovereigntist.
<P>
	It is important for Quebec's main city to give itself tools and 
to recognize that these tools must belong to the Quebec 
government. The federal government did not fulfil its mandate 
and I myself have lost hope.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	In 1988, I was among those who supported the Conservatives 
for the nice worth-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Chrétien nixed that one.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Daviault:</B> The ``beau risque'', as we say in French, did 
not work. Even Bourassa's five minimum conditions did not 
work. To start with, these five minimum conditions with a 
patriation of power, respect for our jurisdiction, even that did 
not work. The government tells us that as far as the Constitution 
is concerned, it is business as usual, the problem will disappear 
by itself. That is not true. The federal government is involved in 
all spheres of activity. There is not one department, except 
possibly defence, where it is not involved.
<P>
	The economic development projects that it presents to us, the 
Youth Corps program which resembles Katimavik is a 
provincial program. It has no business being there. This is a 
cultural program, an educational program, it has no business 
being there.
<P>
	As for occupational training, no subject brings such nearly 
unanimous agreement among Quebecers. Even the very 
federalist Conseil du patronat and its president, Ghislain 
Dufour, who is not a sovereigntist, agree. It is up to the SQDM, 
the Quebec labour development corporation, to act in this field. 
When we get to this point in other subjects, we can raise specific 
issues where the federal government does not even recognize 
programs that qualify for the SQDM, there is all that 
duplication. We are wasting our energy while we cut help for the 
unemployed. You said yourselves that by cutting unemployment 
insurance, you would put pressure on welfare. Now that you are 
in power, you say the opposite.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Fernand Robichaud (Secretary of State 
(Parliamentary Affairs)):</B> Mr. Speaker, I find it very 
depressing to listen to the speeches of Bloc Quebecois members. 
They are painting a very gloomy picture of Quebec and making 
it out to be the most miserable place in the world. Truthfully, I 
would be most unhappy if I had to live there.
<P>
	Would Bloc members not be better off singing the praises of 
Quebec expertise, and giving examples of the achievements of 
Quebec industries which are recognized around the world? Does 
the hon. member not think that if he spoke in a more positive 
tone, if he praised Quebec's merits, then businesses would 
consider relocating to the province, which would result in job 
creation and improve the lot of Quebecers? Does he not want the 
same thing as we want?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Daviault:</B> I thank the hon. member for Beauséjour. 
Indeed, entrepreneurship in Quebec is alive and well. In my 
riding, attempts were under way for many years to set up an 
economic development corporation. Federal and provincial 
members of Parliament and municipal councillors persisted in 
telling us that this was impossible. But, we took matters into our 
own hands and established such a corporation, because we had 
the will to succeed.
<P>
	There are many examples of similar successes at the 
provincial level. However, we also encounter obstacles and 
when I spoke about unemployment insurance in particular, I 
mentioned that we needed some oxygen. Until such time as all of 
these problems are resolved, and the Minister of Human 
Resources Development sits down with his provincial 
counterpart and settles the question of manpower training as 
best he can, until such time, we need some oxygen in Montreal 
to help the disadvantaged who are gasping for breath.
<P>
	This afternoon, the minister quoted from a newspaper 
clipping. Undoubtedly, he overlooked an article on 
unemployment insurance which appeared on page C-1 of 
today's edition of <I>La Presse</I>. It quotes Mr. Claude Forget, a 
former provincial Liberal minister who once put forward a 
major proposal for unemployment insurance reform.
<P>
<B>(1715) </B>
<P>
	Mr. Forget is reported as saying that the introduction of a 
different benefit level for persons with dependants will 
complicate matters and increase the costs of administering the 
legislation which is already highly complex.
<P>
	With two different benefit levels, namely 55 per cent and 60 
per cent, the system will be absolutely impossible to administer. 
This will create major problems and complicate the system. In 
addition, as reported on page C-3, the budget proposes vague 
fiscal measures. Even the experts are confused. Moreover, it is 
reported on the front page that Mr. Paul Martin was visibly 
disappointed with the frosty reception given to the 
government's financial plan and was prepared to accept part of 
the blame.
<P>
	Perhaps the most interesting of all the articles appearing in <I>La 
Presse</I>-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order, please. The hon. member's time 
has expired. We will now proceed to debate.
<P>

<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Culbert:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Concerning the previous speaker's presentation, one of the 
things I noted, and I believe I noted it correctly unless it lost 
something in its translation to me, was his reference to a very 
distinguished and honoured minister of this House, whom I 
believe, if I am not mistaken, he referred to as Mr. Axe. That was 
the translation I got. I do not think that was the intention of the 
hon. member but if it was I certainly suggest that this House take 
an action.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I take it that was a point of order. The 
test of a point of order is whether it is disruptive in the House. 
Although the member just raised the point of order, I did not take 
it as being a disruptive comment.
<P>
	If I find otherwise I will come back to the House with respect 
to words that have been ruled to be unparliamentary. Having 
read Beauchesne several times, I am not sure that Mr. X is an 
unparliamentary word, but I will be happy to look at it and report 
back to the member.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Finlay (Oxford):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise today as the 
elected member for the Oxford riding to make my maiden 
speech in this elegant and venerable chamber. When I visited 
this place as a high school student some 50 years ago, I little 
thought that I would have the opportunity to address my hon. 
colleagues as a member of Her Majesty's government. However, 
that day has arrived and it is an intensely moving experience for 
me.
<P>
	I am proud to represent all the citizens of Oxford riding and 
Burford Township and I thank them for giving me the 
opportunity to serve them and Canada.
<P>
	Oxford County and Burford Township, which make up the 
riding of Oxford, are situated in the agricultural heartland of 
southwestern Ontario. It is not as rugged as Alberta or B.C., or 
as expansive as Manitoba or Saskatchewan, nor does it have the 
rocky coasts and oceans of maritime Canada. It does have the 
pastoral beauty, character and history of many predominantly 
rural ridings in central Canada.
<P>
	Agriculture is the backbone of our communities. We have 
tobacco farms in the southern part of Oxford around 
Tillsonburg, which is a progressive town, supporting factories, 
supplying parts to the automotive industry. Tillsonburg is also 
the headquarters of the Flue-Cured Tobacco Growers' 
Marketing Board.
<P>
	About 25 kilometres north of Tillsonburg is the town of 
Ingersoll, the home of the huge, modern General Motors Suzuki 
automobile plant known as CAMI.
<P>
	The county seat is in the city of Woodstock, population 
30,000. It is the administrative centre of Oxford County and has 
many factories serving the automotive and trucking industry, as 
well as several concrete fabricating plants, foundries and metal  
machining factories. The linings for the new Detroit River 
tunnel are being fabricated in Woodstock.
<P>
<B>(1720 ) </B>
<P>
	Woodstock is proud to be called the dairy capital of Canada 
and its symbol for the last 50 years is a holstein cow, Springbank 
Snow Countess, owned and milked by Tom Dent, a former 
Speaker of the legislative assembly of Ontario between 1943 
and 1955. A life size statue of Snow Countess stands proudly 
beside the highway just as one enters Woodstock from the east.
<P>
	I could wax eloquent about the hundreds of well kept dairy 
farms throughout Oxford County and Burford Township. There 
are also cash crop farmers, pork producers and chicken farmers. 
In fact, Cold Springs Farms of Thamesford is one of Ontario's 
largest turkey producers and processors.
<P>
	Burford Township boasts some high tech factories and an 
outstanding research farm. Just north of Woodstock is the 
Western Ontario Breeders Incorporated which collects, tests, 
stores and sells semen around the world for the artificial 
insemination of cattle.
<P>
	Oxford, my hon. friends, was the birthplace of some 
interesting historical characters. Aimie Semple MacPherson, 
the California evangelist, was born and raised near Ingersoll. A 
woman with a less admirable but no less colourful life was 
Cassie Chadwick, the famous con artist who lived very high off 
the hog in Cleveland, Ohio by pretending to be the illegitimate 
daughter of the New York City millionaire Andrew Carnegie of 
library fame.
<P>
	On the male side, ``Colonel'' Joe Boyle, the saviour of 
Romania, was a Woodstonian who made a fortune from 
hydraulic placer mining in the Klondike following the gold rush. 
He equipped his own machine gun battery of ex-mounties and 
miners and transported them to France in the first world war. He 
was sent to Romania and Russia to reorganize the railroads. He 
rescued the crown jewels and 20 million in currency for Queen 
Marie of Romania from the Kremlin during the Bolshevik 
revolution.
<P>
	His bones were returned to Woodstock several years ago and 
reburied. The Reverend John Davies of old St. Paul's Anglican 
Church in Woodstock, who lived to be 101 and who had known 
Joe Boyle in the Klondike, presided at the reinternment.
<P>
	I will just mention some other heroes. The Mighty Men of 
Zorra, the tug-o-war team which won the world title at the 
Chicago World's Fair in 1893, was commemorated last year on 
July 1 at the Annual Highland Games in Embro by an 
international tug-o-war contest. The anchorman on the 1893 
team, Robert MacIntosh, had a chest expansion of 52 inches.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1825"> 1825 </A></B>
<P>
	Last year the unlimited class hydroplane, Miss Canada IV, 
was returned to Ingersoll to the Centennial Park Museum by 
Harold Wilson, its owner and driver. Miss Canada IV broke Sir 
Malcolm Campbell's world speedboat record in the 1930s.
<P>
	I want to share with my hon. colleagues some of the things I 
believe about this country. I believe passionately in this country. 
I agree with the view expressed two weeks ago by one of the hon. 
members opposite who said there were three founding realities 
in Canada's past, the aboriginal people, the French and the 
English.
<P>
	My hon. friend from the Bloc went on to point out very rightly 
that now more than one-third of Canadians, 12 million in fact, 
are neither aboriginal, English nor French, but come from many 
cultures and races.
<P>
	I would like to remind all hon. members that 52 per cent of 
Canadians are women.
<P>
	I am proud to espouse the Liberal philosophy and to be part of 
this Liberal government. Our members represent people from 
one end of this great country to the other, both ways, and bottom 
to top.
<P>
	Just look at the diversity along these government benches and 
across the way in the rump corner. Nearly every one of the ethnic 
groups which make up this country is represented in this 
government. We have not yet achieved parity in representation 
for women. Yet, 37 Liberals out of the 52 women members in 
this House is a great improvement over the last government.
<P>
<B>(1725) </B>
<P>
	I believe that Canadians want this government to succeed. 
They want to help Canadians get back to work. They want an 
equitable tax system in which everyone pays their fair share.
<P>
	They want a revised safety net of social programs which is 
affordable, makes sense, and serves all those who need it but not 
those who do not. The people want us to govern firmly. They 
want peace, law and order. They approve of the Prime Minister's 
multifaceted and firm approach to the tobacco smuggling 
problem. They want a searching review of the Young Offenders 
Act and our parole system with respect to serial killers and 
violent sexual offenders.
<P>
	This government committed itself in the throne speech to a 
more open process and more power to the backbenchers on both 
sides of this House. I would remind the hon. members opposite 
that provincial governments are just as guilty of overlap and 
unnecessary duplication of programs as the federal government 
ever was.
<P>
	In this first budget presented by the hon. Minister of Finance 
we have fulfilled another promise from our famous red book.
<P>
	This budget will stimulate small and medium size businesses 
to undertake new ventures and test new markets. It will reduce 
significantly government spending on inefficient and 
non-productive programs. It will force a thorough review of all 
our social security programs and our defence department's role 
to make sure that we can deliver the programs we need 
efficiently and effectively.
<P>
	The budget does broaden the tax base and stops up loopholes 
in the tax system. It collects more taxes from large corporations 
and the rich. It will reduce the unemployment insurance 
premiums to help small business expand.
<P>
	It lengthens the minimal work requirement and lowers the 
percentage benefit for all except those who have dependents and 
need.
<P>
	There are many other provisions which reduce government 
spending.
<P>
	In conclusion, I give a quotation from Sir Wilfrid Laurier 
which I would ask all hon. members to ponder, particularly those 
in Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition from Quebec.
<P>
	In 1911 Sir Wilfrid said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I am branded in Quebec as a traitor to the French and in Ontario as a traitor to 
the English. In Quebec, I am branded as a jingo and in Ontario as a separatist. In 
Quebec I am attacked as an imperialist and in Ontario as an anti-imperialist. I 
am neither. I am a Canadian. Canada has been the inspiration of my life. I have 
had before me as a pillar of fire by night and a pillar of cloud by day, a policy of 
true Canadianism, of moderation, of conciliation.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I honour the spirit of Sir Wilfred and I commend his balanced 
and zealous view of this great country to all honourable 
members.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert):</B> Mr. Speaker, I offer my 
congratulations to the hon. member for Oxford on his maiden 
speech in the House. We are delighted to hear about the many 
facets of his riding and I can see that he has much to talk about.
<P>
	On the budget, about which he did not have too much to say, 
he seemed to emphasize the fact that he was proud of his 
government's attempts to broaden the tax base and close the 
loopholes and perhaps raise taxes and so on.
<P>
	I was wondering if he would agree with the previous speaker 
with whom I took issue who said he thought that we did not have 
a spending crisis in this country but that we had a revenue crisis 
in this country.
<P>
	The hon. member seems to think that we should be raising 
more taxes. Again, I ask him the same question I asked the 
previous speaker. Does he think that while Canadians are 
groaning under the massive weight of taxes in this country, and 
while we are $500 billion in debt, we should not look at cutting 
spending and cutting that spending dramatically rather than 
trying to squeeze another dollar out of the Canadian taxpayer?
<P>
<B></B>

<P>
<B>(1730) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Finlay:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the comments of my 
hon. colleague. I am glad that he found some of the comments 
about Oxford interesting.
<P>
	With respect to the budget and his very appropriate question, 
we must not forget that this budget cuts $5 in spending for every 
$1 it takes in through taxes or other payments.
<P>
	I agree that the Canadian people do not want any more taxes. I 
said that they wanted a tax system that is equitable and in which 
those that can pay their fair share. I do not think this budget goes 
as far in this regard as it can. I remind the hon. member that the 
matter of family trusts is being taken up by a committee and that 
there are other changes that the finance minister pointed out 
would be dealt with in future.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly):</B> Mr. Speaker, I speak out 
against what the hon. member opposite said about duplication 
being the provinces' fault. It has been more than 50 years since 
he attended high school and he needs a refresher course.
<P>
	I wonder if the sharing of constitutional jurisdiction has any 
meaning for him. Originally, four provinces agreed to share 
certain powers, but never ever did they think that they would 
give up their own powers which belonged to them and which 
they needed for their own development within the Canadian 
Confederation. So there is something wrong with that.
<P>
	If there is duplication, it is because the federal government 
has always been meddling. The provinces did not middle in the 
national defence of Canada, the provinces did not meddle in 
foreign trade. It is downright wrong. We have been hearing that 
since this morning, so we should set the record straight.
<P>
	As for job creation, 99 per cent of Canadian businesses have 
fewer than four employees. There are 1,114,000 self-employed 
people who work for their own business; that is not a lot. They 
play with figures to suggest that taxes for those people will be 
reduced from 28 to 12 per cent, when in reality their tax rate is 
12 per cent. Those people have an awful time making ends meet.
<P>
	Does the minister know that while he was telling us such 
nonsense, the national debt is costing us $75,000 a minute, and 
for the four or five minutes he took to tell us such rubbish, we are 
some $275,000 worse off than when he started to speak? He 
should be aware of that.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Finlay:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think there were three or four 
questions there. There were a couple at the start. I might remind 
my hon. friend that while death and taxes may be sure, the other 
sure thing in this world is change.
<P>
	When the Constitution was written we were not flying across 
the ocean in six hours. We were not flying from the capital to 
Vancouver in four and a half hours. We were not picking up the 
telephone and calling our offices  at home. There was no such 
thing as electronics, fibre optics and a lot of other things we now 
have. The Constitution did a good jobs in those days for what 
people knew.
<P>
	I suggest to my hon. friend that he has to keep up with the 
times. We have the problem of airlines and telecommunications. 
These things need new approaches.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernie Collins (Souris-Moose Mountain):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I commend my colleague from Oxford for his maiden 
speech. It was very well done and certainly very timely in this 
Chamber.
<P>
	As I rise this afternoon to place some comments before this 
House with regard to the budget of the finance minister, I think 
that it is a credit to the people of Canada that they elected the 
government they did that keeps its promises.
<P>
<B>(1735 ) </B>
<P>
	Within four months every single item we proposed in the red 
book has been met or budgeted for. I can tell my constituents in 
Souris-Moose Mountain that there are no new taxes. For 
farmers and small business in my riding, it is good news. They 
were concerned over the $500,000 capital gains provision, that 
it not be touched.
<P>
	For many farmers their farms are their pension plans. The 
exemption is a legitimate means of financial security. This 
budget is an investment in the future of Canada. It is fair, it is 
pragmatic and it is progressively oriented.
<P>
	I was very pleased that agriculture was given careful 
consideration in this budget. Again the citizens of 
Souris-Moose Mountain are greatly affected by the 
agricultural industry. Every livelihood in our riding is affected 
by it.
<P>
	It therefore pleases me very much to see that many programs 
affecting the industry were kept in place. The people of 
Souris-Moose Mountain are responsible and they are 
compassionate people. They want to contribute their share to 
this country, to the reduction of the deficit and to the 
development of our economy. They are willing to shoulder their 
share of the burden. However, they want to know that the 
contribution they make is handled responsibly by this 
government.
<P>
	That is what pleases me about this budget. It is a balanced 
responsible approach to problems of the future. We are reducing 
the deficit while stimulating jobs. We are supporting those in 
need while closing loopholes and eliminating waste. We are 
putting our own house in order, just what my constituents asked 
us to do.
<P>
	In that same spirit of co-operation and contribution my 
constituents are saying to me with respect to agriculture that 
they will make their contribution but we should handle things 
responsibly, guard the industry from disaster and collapse.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1827"> 1827 </A></B>
<P>
	This budget is addressing those concerns. Although grants 
and contributions will see a 5 per cent across the board cut, 
essential agricultural insurance programs will not be affected. 
The gross revenue insurance plan, the net income stabilization 
account and crop insurance were exempted from these cuts. 
This is very good news for the people of my riding. They have 
been severely affected by circumstances far beyond their 
control in the field of agriculture. The exemption of these 
programs from the restraint measures is much needed and 
appreciated.
<P>
	As well the finance minister has announced that there will be a 
study of the taxation of capital gains as it applies to small 
business and farmers. We have been given assurance by the 
minister that no changes will be made to the current exemption 
without the agreement of the farming community.
<P>
	The grain farmers in my riding have one concern. That is with 
regard to cuts in the Western Grain Transportation Act. The 
report of the producer payment panel is still outstanding. The 
agriculture community would like to have a chance to agree on a 
new process before any cuts to this program are made.
<P>
	With respect to the impact of the budget on growth and jobs, 
the budget provides funding for a number of programs 
mentioned in ``Creating Opportunities'' which will create jobs 
immediately and build the foundation for job creation in the 
future.
<P>
	The infrastructure program is now being implemented and 
agreements have been signed with every province. Over the next 
three years the programs will create 50,000 to 65,000 new jobs. 
There are other initiatives in the budget that offer hope to young 
people. For example, the Canadian Youth Services program will 
put together a place where young Canadians get meaningful 
work experience and develop personal skills.
<P>
	In addition, new youth internship programs will be developed 
with the province which will help to provide young people with 
alternative training.
<P>
	It is important to note that there are no changes to the access to 
RRSPs for first time home buyers. That was a major concern to 
the people of my constituency and one that the budget delivers 
well on.
<P>
<B>(1740 ) </B>
<P>
	With respect to social programs, I am very pleased that the 
government intends to overhaul Canada's outdated social 
security system within two years. It will build bridges to work 
and support independence and not dependence. The budget calls 
for an investment of $800 million to test innovative new 
approaches to release Canadians from dependency and get them 
back to work.
<P>
	As promised in the government's platform, the budget 
provided funding for the aboriginal head start program, a centre 
for excellence for women's health, the creation of the Canadian 
race relations foundation, the reinstatement of the law reform 
commission and the  court challenges program and a prenatal 
program for low income pregnant women.
<P>
	As an alderman and a former mayor of the city of Estevan, I 
have always believed in fiscal responsibility and fiscal restraint. 
This budget addresses both. For every dollar raised in new 
revenues, the government will cut $5 from government 
spending, resulting in a $23 billion cut over three years. The 
cancellation of the EH-101 helicopter added another $1.7 
billion over three years.
<P>
	In addition to focusing on fiscal restraint, we also have 
focused on budget loopholes. Through incentives we are going 
to bring together fairness to Canada's tax system.
<P>
	The corporate income tax deduction for meals being reduced 
from 80 per cent to 50 per cent is a good direction to travel in. 
The $100,000 capital gains exemption which primarily benefits 
high income Canadians is eliminated immediately, another right 
direction.
<P>
	The Liberal government promised to create jobs and to this 
end the budget addresses economic renewal. We encourage 
innovation and technology development and the government is 
supporting the vital small business. Canada's investment 
program, venture capital, and Canada's technology network 
program are excellent moves.
<P>
	For years governments have promised more than they can 
deliver and delivered more than they can afford. We are 
confronting a deficit head on. In three years we will reduce that 
deficit from $45.7 billion to $32.7 billion. As a government 
committed to cutting expenditures, we intend as an example 
cutting $3 billion from government operations and putting on 
salary freezes.
<P>
	Finally, with regard to UIC, the move from $3.07 to $3 will 
add $300 million for new investment by small business.
<P>
	I want to assure this House and all Canadians that we will be 
taking home the gold. Never has so much been done by such a 
finance minister as the present Minister of Finance. I am pleased 
to stand here and support the budget this evening.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
congratulate the hon. member on his speech. I would like to once 
again try to put some logic into this infrastructure program.
<P>
	The infrastructure program is supposed to have $2 billion 
coming from the federal government, $2 billion from provincial 
and $2 billion from municipal. Municipalities will charge 
residential tax and the provincial probably an income surtax and 
so on.
<P>
	I wonder if the hon. member could enlighten us as to how long 
these infrastructure jobs might last, how he sees the logic in 
spending $6 billion for that duration of those jobs and how will it 
be recovered.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1828"> 1828 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Collins:</B> Mr. Speaker, let me just highlight the process we 
have in the province of Saskatchewan with regard to 
infrastructure program. I look forward to the infrastucture 
program in Saskatchewan because I think it has all kinds of 
potential, certainly for the city I come from.
<P>
	We are looking at putting a sewer and water program in place 
that will cost about $4 million. Whether it will be selected as one 
of the projects to be approved by the province will be a 
provincial decision. What will it do for our area?
<P>
<B>(1745 ) </B>
<P>
	I know very well that many people in southeast 
Saskatchewan, particularly in the riding I am from, are looking 
for jobs. They are looking for an opportunity to do some work 
and to develop some skills.
<P>
	What will it do? It will give us people who will work on those 
jobs, in those places and as those improvements to our city come 
on stream we can hire those people as part of our infrastructure 
program within the city. Therefore, we also have the feature of 
being able to supplement and have these people right on the job 
in the city as a permanent possibility for the city of Estevan. I 
look forward to the infrastructure program. That is just in the 
south part.
<P>
	Let us go to the north part of Saskatchewan. The 
infrastructure program, as we have it set for the native people, 
has tremendous possibilities. We have the possibility for head 
start education; the possibility for them to determine for 
themselves new inroads in the educational field. For job 
opportunities I think there is tremendous potential.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia-Matane):</B> Mr. Speaker, how 
can the hon. member say that the budget is very good for farmers 
when, in the East, in just about every parish, there is a weekly 
auction, and he admitted that there was a 5 per cent budget cut. I 
am asking him to give me one benefit for Eastern farmers in this 
budget.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Collins:</B> Mr. Speaker, there is a tremendous potential for 
everybody. We can sit here, put our heads in the sand and say 
nothing will be done. That is what some people would like to do. 
Some would say we have gone too far and others would say we 
have not gone far enough.
<P>
	We have come to a point in time when we have to make an 
effort to make the best of what we have. The farmers in Quebec 
and Ontario will do just as well as the farmers in Saskatchewan. 
Maybe they will have to be a little more ingenious, but it is a fact 
there are going to be some cutbacks. They will provide that 
incentive.
<P>
	The people in the dairy farming industry will become 
ingenious. They are going to be competing with the United 
States and I think they will do very well. Yes, they have had to 
take a bit of the cut. However, I think of  hon. members farther to 
the east where some bases are being closed and 2,000 jobs may 
be lost. The impact there is great. The impact was spread across 
the country. It is no different for Quebec than it is for 
Saskatchewan or any other province.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise today on 
behalf of Canadians who were disappointed with the budget the 
government tabled in the House on Tuesday.
<P>
	This disappointment is well-founded. Let us start by 
examining the words of the participants at pre-budget 
conferences, the words of government itself and the subsequent 
actions of the government in the 1994-95 budget.
<P>
	One Calgarian participating in the pre-budget consultations 
stated: ``Government cannot, in and of itself, create jobs. 
Government should get out of the way of private sector 
investment and employment''. Many other Canadians share 
those views.
<P>
	On page 7 of <I>Facing Choices Together</I>, one of the 
government's own booklets, the Minister of Finance 
acknowledged that the role of government should be:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-establishing a positive economic climate for the private sector, and 
particularly small business; reducing the burden of regulation and taxation; and 
strengthening education.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I thank the minister for acknowledging what Reformers have 
been saying for years.
<P>
	It is unfortunate, however, that in the budget the actions of the 
government do not follow its words. Not only did the 
government back off in terms of action, but on page 8 of the 
same booklet the finance minister inferred that the people at 
these consultations are not to be trusted. To demonstrate this I 
will quote the minister:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-the government does not accept the view that there is no role for some 
immediate spending action.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The minister continues to ignore the views of the people by 
justifying a need for increased spending in programs like the 
infrastructure program. For the people to gain confidence in the 
integrity of a government there must be consistency between the 
words of the government and their actions. In this case there is 
not even consistency between the words of government on one 
page of their document and the words that follow on the next 
page.
<P>
<B>(1750) </B>
<P>
	Canadians used their common sense and said cut spending. In 
fact the government has increased spending. It is time for the 
government to start listening to the people.
<P>
	I will illustrate how the figures in this budget affect the people 
in the Vegreville constituency and indeed across the country. At 
the end of next year, Canada's federal government debt will be 
approximately $550 billion. Approximately $40 billion will be 
added to this debt in the next fiscal year. Using my own family as 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1829"> 1829 </A></B>
<P>
an example I  will demonstrate the burden we are placing on the 
young people in Canada.
<P>
	My wife, my five children, and myself owe about $140,000 as 
our share of the national debt. This year's deficit adds 
approximately another $1,700 to each person as their share of 
the debt. By the time my younger children reach their early 
twenties they will each owe a total of about $40,000 as their 
share of Canada's national debt if it keeps growing at the same 
rate.
<P>
	I believe it is morally wrong for government to continue this 
wild overspending. If it continues Canada will reach a crisis 
situation, maybe as New Zealand did, within the next couple of 
years. If this happens, painfully drastic spending measures will 
have to be implemented. Some of this pain can be avoided if the 
necessary government cuts are made now.
<P>
	I plead with the Minister of Finance to make these spending 
cuts or similar cuts in a mini budget in the early fall. Canadians 
cannot afford to wait another year for sanity to come.
<P>
	Reform MPs have consistently presented positive, 
constructive alternatives to government proposals. In keeping 
with this I would like to offer some specific advice to the 
government.
<P>
	Reform's specific proposals include: unemployment 
insurance should be made into a self-funding insurance plan 
where the benefits, the premiums and the funding are 
determined by employers and employees. If implemented this 
will save taxpayers about $3.5 billion per year. Eliminate 
business subsidies to the tune of about $3.4 billion per year. Stop 
funding special interest groups rather than just reviewing the 
matter, saving $500 million per year. Reduce foreign 
government aid by $700 million instead of the $400 million 
proposed in this budget. Decrease subsidies to crown 
corporations by 25 per cent saving approximately $1.25 billion 
per year. Cut non-salary federal government overhead by 15 per 
cent, saving about $1.8 billion per year. Target the Canada 
assistance plan to help poor Canadians for savings of about $1.5 
billion per year. Reduce old age security for households making 
over $54,000 per year, saving $3.5 billion per year.
<P>
	Excluding the unemployment insurance reform, the total 
savings I have just outlined amount to over $12 billion per year. 
The government should have made these, or similar, changes in 
this budget. They are the measures that were presented by 
Canadians at the pre-budget consultation meetings.
<P>
	Will the minister and the government listen to Canadians this 
time? Will they present a new budget in the early fall putting 
their own words into action?
<P>
	I will use the rest of my time to discuss agriculture in the 
budget. My greatest concern is that the government has made 
and will continue to make cuts in spending to agriculture before 
they have released farmers from the burden of over-regulation. 
For example, the government followed through on the 10 per 
cent cuts to the Crow benefit which were implemented by the 
former government in the 1993-94 budget. This eliminated 
funding of over $60 million to farmers. My concern is that while 
the funding is being reduced, the problems which plague the 
grain transportation system and further processing of 
agricultural commodities have not been dealt with.
<P>
<B>(1755) </B>
<P>
	Furthermore, the Crow benefit is still being paid to the 
railways. Grain cars are still controlled by at least three separate 
agencies and the Canadian Wheat Board restricts farmers from 
seeking out markets on their own and shipping to these markets.
<P>
	Funding is being cut to farmers, but farmers' hands are tied so 
they cannot improve the situation for themselves. It is critical 
that over-regulation is eliminated before cuts are made.
<P>
	At a conference I attended last weekend farmers made it very 
clear they do not want farm subsidies to continue indefinitely. 
They called for a massive reduction in government regulations 
to be followed by spending cuts. I hope the parliamentary 
secretary to the Minister of Agriculture, who also attended this 
conference, was listening carefully.
<P>
	During the campaign, Reform presented a budget for 
agriculture for the next three years. This budget outlined our 
plan to target over $2 billion in support to producers and save 
taxpayers between $400 million and $500 million per year. 
Reformers promised to present positive alternatives and we 
have certainly done this in the area of agriculture.
<P>
	Once again I must emphasize that before cuts can be made, 
regulations that prevents farmers from achieving open access to 
free markets must be eliminated. Federal-provincial 
government overlap must be reduced, and high administrative 
costs in delivering the various programs that are in place must 
be substantially trimmed.
<P>
	Some of the specific recommendations that Reformers 
support are: first, consolidate over a dozen unco-ordinated 
safety net programs into three; a trade distortion adjustment 
program, an income stabilization program and an improved crop 
insurance program.
<P>
	Second, reform the transportation system so that products 
may be moved by any route, any mode, and in any state of 
processing.
<P>
	Third, improve private sector participation in research, 
education and job training.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1830"> 1830 </A></B>
<P>
	Fourth, better target research funds to meet the goals that are 
set out by farmers and agribusiness.
<P>
	Fifth, improve regulations relating to safety, fair competition, 
and dispute settlement so the marketplace can work better.
<P>
	As well, we propose these changes to the Canadian Wheat 
Board: first, make the Wheat Board accountable to the people 
who pay the bills, that is western Canadian grain farmers. 
Second, allow the board to handle any crop, but permit farmers 
and grain companies the right to compete with the board. Third, 
continue Canada's loan guarantees as long as other countries 
offer them. Fourth, give farmers the right to choose between a 
pool price and a daily cash price.
<P>
	I believe these changes to the Canadian Wheat Board will 
increase the price that farmers get from the marketplace. This 
increase in market revenue will reduce payments to safety net 
programs, a reduction that is not included in the Reform budget 
on agriculture.
<P>
	In conclusion, the government made few changes in the area 
of agriculture in this budget, nor should they have without a 
comprehensive review of agriculture policy. However, studies 
similar to the one being conducted in the dairy, egg and poultry 
industries are virtually worthless because the scope of these 
studies is limited from the start. In this study, supply 
management is retained as a fundamental principle rather than 
allowing farmers and others affected to discuss this principle 
and decide if supply management is needed at all.
<P>
	While a study of agriculture-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order. I very much regret interrupting 
the hon. member. Is it his maiden speech? I do not think it is. 
Would the member indicate whether it is his maiden speech. It is 
not; then I am afraid his time is up. I am sure he will get a chance 
to make the point he was just going to finish with prior to all 
these questions that are waiting to be asked.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morris Bodnar (Saskatoon-Dundurn):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member has touched on rail line transportation. In 
Alberta there has been some experimentation with privatization 
of abandoned rail lines, where they have been taken over by 
private entrepreneurs who have been successful in the operation 
of these lines.
<P>
<B>(1800) </B>
<P>
	Could the hon. member tell us whether his party favours the 
privatization of rail lines in Canada?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> Mr. Speaker, on the question of the privatization 
of railroads and the question of the privatization of rolling 
stock, the answer is that we would certainly consider privatizing 
both.
<P>
	There has to be a bit more study on the issue, but I believe 
there must be more competition allowed for the railways than 
there is now. Privatizing rail lines or  nationalizing rail lines and 
allowing competition is important. How it can be done is up for 
debate still.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Public Works and Government Services):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I thank my colleague for his address. He made a 
number of potentially very useful suggestions with respect to 
cost cutting.
<P>
	It would be very helpful if my hon. colleague could indicate to 
us what impact if implemented the list of suggestions would 
have on unemployment. In other words how many more 
unemployed Canadians would there be?
<P>
	My second question is with respect to the self-funded 
unemployment insurance program. Does the member know 
whether or not that would increase or decrease the premiums, 
whether or not it would increase or decrease the payouts to 
unemployed Canadians?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate those questions. They 
are both excellent questions.
<P>
	In terms of the last question first on whether unemployment 
insurance will increase or decrease premiums, we are saying 
that as a self-directed plan the decisions will be made by 
employers and employees on whether premiums are raised, 
benefits are reduced, or who in fact is eligible under the plan. It 
is up to the employers and employees to make the decisions on 
the plan, as they should, because they are the ones who are 
funding the plan and we say it should be strictly them funding 
the plan.
<P>
	On the question respecting how much the cuts would affect 
unemployment, I believe the cuts we have laid out may affect 
unemployment over a very short term. I believe very strongly 
that as these cuts are made and as Canadians see that the 
government is finally dealing with its overspending problem, 
unemployment will be reduced within a year and a half to two 
years. Economics is not an exact science but that is my belief.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John English (Parliamentary Secretary to President of 
the Queen's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs):</B> Mr. Speaker, I too welcome the 
suggestions made by the hon. member, but I recall that during 
the debate on the GATT we talked about subsidization of grain 
exports in many countries including Canada, United States and 
the European Community.
<P>
	In the case of those countries we recalled that Canadian 
subsidization of grain exports amounted roughly to somewhere 
between 30 and 35 per cent; less than the Europeans and 
probably a little less than the Americans but considerably more 
than the Australians and the Argentinians. In the case of the 
Australians it is almost nil. In the case of the Argentinians it 
costs them to export because they subsidize their manufacturers.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1831"> 1831 </A></B>
<P>
	Having said that, what would the hon. member think would be 
an appropriate figure for our subsidization agreement?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> Mr. Speaker, the member is specifically asking 
about what level subsidies should be at in terms of grain exports. 
Talking about grain exports specifically, the level has to be 
reduced over time. My goal and the goal farmers have told me 
they would like achieved some time down the road-and I 
cannot say exactly whether it might be six years or ten 
years-would be as close to zero as possible.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
heard the Minister of Finance during the budget presentation say 
that he was looking for $400 million to be cut from operating 
budgets of government departments in the next year and a 
further $1.5 billion in the subsequent three years. I have a 
suggestion for where the minister could find that amount of 
money.
<P>
<B>(1805) </B>
<P>
	His budget speech was very impressive. I was really caught up 
in it. He said: ``The budget being tabled today follows an 
unprecedented process of consultation with Canadians. We have 
gained a great deal from listening to Canadians but one thing 
stands above all others: Canadians are fed up with government 
inertia. They seek determined fundamental change. Canadians 
know the kind of Canada they want''.
<P>
	I was really impressed with those words. I was therefore a 
little surprised to find that the minister and the government had 
not been doing the consulting they pretended to do. They came 
up with nothing, for example, in the way of cuts to official 
languages. I hear from my constituents in Nanaimo-Cowichan 
that it is one place where cuts should surely be made.
<P>
	I wonder too if the hon. Minister of Finance was consulting 
with his own colleagues. The hon. member for Ottawa-Vanier 
across the way said on January 27: ``A serious study should be 
undertaken by an individual to determine whether the Official 
Languages Act is working as intended''. I agree with the hon. 
member. A serious study should be undertaken. My impression 
and that of my constituents is that it is not working and it is 
costing far too much.
<P>
	Before I go further I would like to correct an impression of the 
Bloc Quebecois on what the Reform Party policy is on official 
languages.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The hon. member for Richmond-Wolfe said, ``If they think 
that English should be the only official language of the federal 
government, they should say so clearly''. I would like to say 
clearly that we do not think that English should be the only 
official language. There must be two official languages, English 
and French, everywhere. But it must here in Parliament, in the 
courts and in government offices.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The Reform Party's official policy on bilingualism is that we 
support individual bilingualism. We support territorial 
bilingualism as far as the federal government is concerned, that 
is to say-and let us take Quebec as a specific 
example-services must be given in the French language 
throughout the province of Quebec because obviously the 
numbers warrant it. Within the city of Montreal it is evident that 
services in the English language should be given in the regions 
of Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, Saint-Luc, Beaconsfield, et cetera.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Services must be provided in the appropriate languages 
wherever there is a need.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Let us now move to another phase of why I am tackling 
official bilingualism. I underline again that we are in favour of 
bilingualism, personal bilingualism. Let us have more of it, but 
official bilingualism is divisive in the country and is wasteful. It 
is a terrible waste of money.
<P>
<B>(1810) </B>
<P>
	How wasteful is it? I quote from Diane Francis in the 
<I>Financial Post</I>: ``Translating technical documents involves the 
500,000-page technical manuals for two new frigates currently 
under construction. A full translation of these manuals would 
cost $100 million''.
<P>
	In their defence National Defence and Supply and Services 
shot back that the real cost could reach $43.5 million. 
Unfortunately the real cost of translating those manuals will 
likely never be known since it will be buried in the overall cost 
of the frigates. That is one of the big problems we have not only 
with government but with estimates and everything else. Costs 
are buried and it is very hard to find them.
<P>
	Another problem I have with the official languages policy in 
the country is that it is a product of the Ottawa elite. The elite in 
Ottawa says and has said for a number of years that this is what 
we should be pushing, that it will be wonderful for the whole 
country and it will certainly help keep Quebec in. I do not 
believe that is true and I do not believe the people of Quebec 
believe it is true either; not official bilingualism as it is 
practised here.
<P>
	Typical of the attitude embraced by the Ottawa elite is the 
official languages commissioner who was recently quoted as 
saying: ``We must not be deterred by the opposition which there 
is in public opinion. They are great adversaries with whom we 
have to attend''. That was in spite of or perhaps because of a 
March 1992 Gallup poll which showed that 64 per cent of 
Canadians believe official bilingualism has been a failure.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1832"> 1832 </A></B>
<P>
	How expensive is it? I do not know. It is almost impossible to 
find the real cost, but let us look at one example. National 
Defence admits official languages program activities cost 
nearly $48 million in fiscal 1992-93. Yet nowhere in the 
1992-93 public accounts for National Defence is that figure 
recorded. It is buried somewhere.
<P>
	In fact the person who prepared the report on official 
languages cost in National Defence to send to my office said in 
his covering letter: ``The true costs of official languages 
activities for DND are higher than those given in the enclosed 
fax sheet. Unfortunately Treasury Board reporting guidelines do 
not permit us to report, among other things, salaries of military 
personnel attending continuous language training and the 
bilingualism bonus for civilian employees''. That is part of the 
problem of identifying costs.
<P>
	Let me conclude by saying that the budget should be tackling 
the deficit. One way of attacking the deficit is to cut 
expenditures, especially in areas where it is creating division in 
the country. One such area is the Official Languages Act. I say to 
the government: ``Please look at it and cut''.
<P>
<B>(1815) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dan McTeague (Ontario):</B> Mr. Speaker, I must point out 
as a Franco-Ontarian that during the 1960s and 1970s, I had a 
chance to learn a second language. I learned another language, 
and I want to make this clear to the hon. member for 
Nanaimo-Cowichan, thanks to the institution of bilingualism. 
During my school years and when I was employed in the private 
sector-
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I had an opportunity to work with several large firms in this 
country which acknowledge readily that official bilingualism is 
a lot easier when you put, for instance, English on one side of the 
Kellogg's box and French on the same side. It is far more 
efficient to try to communicate to the seven, eight or nine 
million people in this nation who do speak French and who are 
not confined to one single region of the country.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I am living testimony to a system that works, a system that 
helped me learn a second language. I hope the hon. member for 
Nanaimo-Cowichan will agree that having two official 
languages was one of the great things that happened to this 
country, and that it gives us, as Canadians, an edge in our 
business dealings.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ringma:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am delighted the hon. member 
learned to speak English and French. It is a good thing for this 
country, and I certainly agree with him. However, I maintain 
what I said in my speech, that a tremendous amount of money is 
being wasted in this country. You are an example of someone 
who learned both languages, and that is wonderful. However, I 
can assure you that, although they agree with the principle of  
learning both official languages and other languages as well, 
most people in Western Canada feel that money is being wasted, 
and I repeat what I said in my speech in this respect.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I would ask hon. members, whether 
they speak English or French, to address the Chair.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Public Works and Government Services):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if the hon. member wants to know about costs for the 
official languages policy of this country, there is no policy on 
official bilingualism. I would be delighted to share with him an 
article that I published on that very subject matter which 
outlines those costs. No one has ever challenged them.
<P>
	With respect to the comments that he has made about costs, it 
is those kinds of things that are said that exaggerate the fears 
that are found throughout the nation. We do not know what they 
are but they are big.
<P>
	What about this comment about the Ottawa elite?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	What about the French language communities-like St. 
Boniface, St. Albert in Alberta and other francophone 
communities across Canada. Those are the elite, those are the 
people who are asking for services in French.
<P>
	Does he realize we have unilingual senators and members of 
the House of Commons here, some unilingual French and others 
unilingual English, Canadian soldiers who speak only French or 
only English? Are these people not supposed to talk to each 
other? What does he really want? Does he want to scare 
Canadians? If there is any waste, let us identify it. Waste can be 
eliminated, but removing a policy that makes it possible to talk 
to each other is ridiculous.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ringma:</B> Mr. Speaker, as I said before, I have nothing 
against bilingualism and neither does the Reform Party, and 
when I say the elite, I am not referring to the people of 
Gravelbourg, Saskatchewan, or Grande-Prairie or St. Boniface. 
The elite are here in Ottawa, where they force the issue by 
saying: We will have this legislation enforced by inspectors who 
will monitor its implementation, and we can spend any amount 
of money on this. That is what I object to.

	<B>Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Middlesex):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased today to stand in the House to present my maiden 
speech.
<P>
	I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate you, Mr. 
Speaker, on your appointment to the chair.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1833"> 1833 </A></B>
<P>
	I will begin in recognition of the International Year of the 
Family by thanking my own family for their encouragement and 
the support they have always given me.
<P>
	I would also like to thank the most dedicated campaign team 
for all their hard work and the constituents of 
Lambton-Middlesex for the trust and confidence they have put 
in me by electing me as their representative in the 35th 
Parliament and may I also add as the first female representative 
for the riding since Confederation.
<P>
	Prior to my being elected, I also had the privilege to work with 
the former member for Lambton-Middlesex, the Hon. Ralph 
Ferguson, who was the agriculture minister in the Turner 
government.
<P>
	Hon. members may be interested to know that 
Lambton-Middlesex has a pivotal role in Canada's history. The 
historic Battle of the Longwoods took place in Middlesex 
country during the War of 1812. In fact the great Indian Chief 
Tecumseh was killed during the Battle of the Longwoods. No 
doubt were it not for the role of Tecumseh in repelling the 
Americans, we would probably be a part of the United States 
today.
<P>
	On the Lambton side of the riding oil was discovered in the 
mid-1800s in Enniskillen Township, the first oil discovery in all 
of North America. In fact some of these oil wells have been 
producing for over 100 years and are still producing today.
<P>
	Lambton-Middlesex is one of the largest ridings in 
southwestern Ontario. It is predominantly rural in nature, 
containing 18 municipalities, several towns and villages, one 
urban centre, Strathroy, and four native reserves.
<P>
	The single largest industry in Lambton-Middlesex is 
agriculture, producing fruits, vegetables, corn, soybeans, 
raising poultry, dairy, pork, and beef, just to name a few.
<P>
	I am proud to say that a number of very prominent Canadian 
leaders in the field of agriculture reside in my riding.
<P>
	I would also be remiss if I did not mention that Cuddy's turkey 
farms, one of the largest turkey breeding farms in North 
America, is located in Lambton-Middlesex. It exports turkey 
parts all over the world.
<P>
	As co-chair of the ethanol task force and ad hoc committee 
exploring the viability of a Canadian ethanol industry, I am 
pleased to see that the Minister of Finance is willing to review 
the necessity for greater assurance of federal excise tax 
exemptions for ethanol. I would urge the minister to make this 
his next top priority.
<P>
	We have a window of opportunity that we must not ignore. We 
must encourage the greater use of ethanol blended fuels. It is 
good for the environment. It is a renewable resource and will 
create huge new markets for corn and grain.
<P>
	This budget sets in motion some of the most fundamental 
far-reaching reforms in government policy in decades in such 
crucial areas as social security and defence.
<P>
	Canadians have told us they are fed up with government 
inertia. They want a government to have a game plan and stick to 
it. We have a game plan, our election platform, Creating 
Opportunity, the red book.
<P>
	In this budget we are funding every key initiative in the red 
book. We are delivering on our commitment.
<P>
	What pleases me the most is that this budget offers a balanced 
approach because of its three main goals: economic renewal, 
deficit reduction, and social reform. These are all foundations 
for our top priorities, jobs and growth.
<P>
	By focusing on these three goals this budget directly answers 
the concerns and priorities expressed by Canadians during a 
first-ever series of consultation conferences. The budget takes 
action through funding for infrastructure programs, a 
commitment to rolling back unemployment insurance premiums 
to the 1993 levels, and through new strategies to promote small 
business, the engine that drives the new economy.
<P>
	The recession has taken its toll, as it has all over Canada, on 
some of the small businesses in my riding. However, a number 
of enterprising factories producing footwear, auto parts, frozen 
foods, mobile homes, to name just a few, have bravely 
weathered the economic storm through their own diligence, 
creativity and hard work.
<P>
<B>(1825) </B>
<P>
	I am especially gratified and relieved that the $500,000 
exemption for small business and farm property will remain.
<P>
	I am also very pleased that the home buyers plan which allows 
first time home buyers to use RRSP funds as a down payment is 
now a permanent program. The use of RRSPs has grown by leaps 
and bounds in Canada as more and more Canadians make use of 
them as a retirement supplement.
<P>
	In agriculture areas such as my riding of 
Lambton-Middlesex RRSPs are often the only means of 
ensuring retirement security. Small and medium sized 
businesses do not want handouts. What they require is an 
environment characterized by improved access to capital, the 
encouragement of innovative leading edge technology, a 
commitment to better management training, a reduction of the 
regulatory and paper burden and the adoption of an aggressive 
trading mentality to take advantage of new export markets.
<P>
	I am delighted that this budget addresses all these areas. In 
fact this budget is a winner I believe for small business. The 
following programs are being initiated: the Canada investment 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1834"> 1834 </A></B>
<P>
fund to provide venture capital for companies, improving access 
to capital for small businesses by establishing a task force to 
work with  Canada's banks to develop a code of conduct for 
small business lending, establishing a Canada business service 
centre in every province to provide one-stop shopping for 
government services, and rolling back the unemployment 
insurance rate to the level of 1993 for 1995 and 1996. This is 
going to save businesses $300 million a year, money that can be 
invested in new jobs. Our small businesses need a break and this 
budget provides it.
<P>
	If I had to use one word to describe the message contained in 
the 1994 budget, then I would use the word hope.
<P>
	Canadians have also said they want changes in our social 
security system to ensure it is fair, compassionate and 
affordable, a reform that delivers incentives for work and 
creates jobs and opportunities.
<P>
	That commitment to change has already been launched by the 
Minister of Human Resources Development. The budget 
highlights important steps in meeting this challenge. The link 
between the length of time a person works and the UI benefits is 
being recalculated.
<P>
	Assistance is being enhanced for those with dependants to 
increase benefits to 60 per cent of their wages. Other individuals 
will receive 55 per cent of their original wages.
<P>
	This government is committed to deficit reduction. Our 
program of net spending reduction over the next three years is 
the most significant of any budget in a decade. A major goal of 
this budget is to take concerted action to bring government 
finances under control, action that is essential in Canada's 
economic revitalization.
<P>
	In planning this budget the finance minister has relied on 
cautious, prudent projections of economic growth for this year 
and next. These projections based on consensus of private sector 
forecasts are in stark contrast to the overly optimistic 
expectations of those presented in some previous budgets, 
expectations that resulted in deficit forecasts that were wrong by 
millions of dollars.
<P>
	Obviously the Canadian people will not stand for any more of 
these rude surprises. The 1994 budget actions, coupled with 
moderate economic growth we are projecting, will reduce the 
deficit from $45.7 billion in 1993-94 to $39.7 billion in the 
coming fiscal year. A further drop to $32.7 billion is expected in 
1995-96. For every $1 of revenue increase there are $5 of 
spending cuts.
<P>
	Finally, I think it is fair to say that the 1994 budget was 
developed following unprecedented public consultations that 
brought together a wide spectrum of Canadians to discuss the 
economic and fiscal challenges confronting the country. I salute 
the finance minister in his pledge to continue to consult openly 
and widely with Canadians.
<P>
	May I conclude, by saying that I am proud to be a part of this 
government, a government that has pledged to restore honesty, 
integrity and accountability to all its operations.
<P>
<B>(1830 ) </B>
<P>
	If we continue to honour this pledge then we will have won 
back the public trust, enabling us to fight to rebuild Canada as a 
strong, independent sovereign nation, a nation that makes its 
own decisions, a nation that is caring and compassionate, a 
nation that will be united from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
congratulations to the hon. member on her maiden speech.
<P>
	I assume that she is a new member as I am. I know one feels 
after one gets that first speech done. It feels great. Thank 
goodness it is over.
<P>
	Although the hon. member did not mention specifically about 
getting our own house in order I know she alluded to responsible 
spending and the accountability of politicians, the importance of 
it, being careful with the money, being very cautious in our 
spending so that we do not get carried away. I would like to know 
how the member feels on some issues and I will pick on three 
because the list is quite extensive.
<P>
	There are a couple of things that are happening in this country 
that I find disturbing. One of them was mentioned by the 
Minister of Human Resources Development when he said that 
over a million children were living in poverty in this country. It 
is really a shame to hear that kind of news.
<P>
	I have here on the top of my list that the Challenger jets cost us 
in excess of $3 million a year, the little blue cars that the cabinet 
ministers drive around in cost us in the neighbourhood of $1.3 
million a year, the outrageous tax funded pensions for MPs are 
over $2 million a year. We are coming up to about $10 million.
<P>
	Does the member agree with me that cutting that kind of fat 
out of the spending from the government and transferring those 
funds to help the poverty stricken children in this country would 
make a lot more sense?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ur:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his kind 
remarks and for his questions also.
<P>
	I too believe that one of our first priorities, one of the issues I 
ran on when I was campaigning last fall, is that we should 
certainly take a look at the funding and the way government 
spends its money.
<P>
	As to the examples the hon. member has given me, pensions 
for instance, that question came up quite often when I was at 
all-candidates meetings. I certainly appreciate the member's 
question on that.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1835"> 1835 </A></B>
<P>
	I felt that with the Canada pension plan I always referred to 
pensions for members. Perhaps we could look at it in that 
fashion. I am sure it is going to be reviewed in the near future 
and work it on the same basic principle as Canada pensions.
<P>
	I know several people came up to me after these meetings 
thinking that was a genuine way of looking at Canada pensions, 
making them more fair to the general public's pension plan.
<P>
	I certainly agree that governments have to address spending 
but as to the Challenger jets and so on, there is security. The 
Prime Minister has said at different times that he would prefer to 
be one of the regular folks on economy class but he cannot travel 
in that fashion. When one is elected to that office, there are 
standards one has to live by. We have to certainly respect his 
security and the security of whomever is Prime Minister.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island):</B> Mr. Speaker, I too would 
congratulate the member for that first speech.
<P>
	I am really hesitant to put her on the spot but I would like to at 
least give notice of a question. This is a really genuine and 
serious question.
<P>
	She quoted from the budget speech that for every $1 raised in 
new revenues, we will cut $5 in government expenditures. That 
is a worthy goal. I may be putting a new member on the spot here 
but sometime I would like the answer to where is this being cut? 
How does it then occur that our government expenditures keep 
rising every year in the plan, the debt keeps going up and the 
deficit each year is also going up? How can we then have a ratio 
of five to one in cuts?
<P>
<B>(1835) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ur:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
question. It certainly is a good question and I do not pretend to 
be the finance minister here. I thought the finance minister had 
given time and time again during question period really good 
answers to this question. There have been several cuts made, 
whether they were the helicopter cuts, the defence cuts. We have 
heard those questions asked and answered during question 
period. Really, the issues are all outlined. All one has to do is 
read the budget papers that we have presented and the answers 
are there.
<P>
	I thank the hon. member for his question.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robichaud: </B>Mr. Speaker, the next speaker will not have 
time to finish his speech. I wonder if there would be unanimous 
consent to allow him to finish his 10-minute speech before the 
question is put to a vote.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Does the House agree to give 10 
minutes to the next speaker so that he can finish his speech.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
speak in favour of the budget as presented by the hon. Minister 
of Finance.
<P>
	My hon. colleague has spoken of the five and one plan. 
Tonight I only want to deal with a two and one plan, that is, two 
expenditure cuts with one expenditure increase.
<P>
	First, I would like to discuss the actions the hon. Minister of 
Finance has taken with regard to the federal civil service. I am 
sure that our civil service across this country is basically hard 
working and shares the commitment of the government toward a 
prosperous Canada. There are those who feel that the continued 
freeze of $500 million in 1994-95 fiscal period and the further 
$620 million in the 1995-96 fiscal period is a great hardship.
<P>
	I would like to point out that this only represents a reduction 
in the federal civil service payroll of 2.2 per cent.
<P>
	I know that many of us are all too well aware of reductions 
much more significant than this by national and international 
companies based in our own ridings. I would like to refer to a 
study done by the Canadian Federation of Independent 
Businesses which undertook an analysis of the 1991 Canada 
census data.
<P>
	It discovered in all sectors of employment that the federal 
civil service had the highest paid workers in all classification for 
all sectors studied in all urban areas across this country. On 
average, the federal civil service is paid 13.9 per cent higher 
than similar classifications of the private sector.
<P>
	What sort of a message does this send our workers and 
taxpayers?
<P>
	I have been unable to find similar parallels in any other 
country in the world. At a time when we are negotiating 
international trade agreements such as NAFTA and GATT with 
the objective of making our private sectors more competitive, 
we discover that the federal government is over burdened by an 
inequitable wage system.
<P>
	I note that the finance minister has attempted to deal with this 
very serious situation by proposing payroll freezes in the hopes 
of curtailing layoffs. Having said that, I acknowledge the 
planned layoffs which are to occur in the military, being well 
over 17,000 jobs.
<P>
	Not only is the civil service pay structure out of step with the 
private sector, many of my constituents inform me of great 
difficulties in dealing with the personnel of the civil service who 
often do not return phone calls, often have work hours which are 
inconsistent with the concept of service. I know that there are 
many individual conscientious civil servants but it would appear 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1836"> 1836 </A></B>
<P>
that there is much that we have to do in improving service in the 
federal civil service.
<P>
<B>(1840 ) </B>
<P>
	I would now like to address the second of my points dealing 
with the expenditure support of the budget. This is the area of 
social programs.
<P>
	The Minister of Human Resources has often stated Canada's 
social programs were designed for another time and another 
place. There is a tremendous structural change sweeping our 
country. This change means that my generation, a generation 
that thought our career paths were set for life, now finds itself 
without jobs and uncertain of the future.
<P>
	We have to reach out to these people and give them hope but 
also give them the tools to find alternate employment. It is not 
good enough to talk about retraining and train people for jobs 
that either do not exist or will not exist in the near future.
<P>
	The government has to show leadership in planning the 
training needs of the future. This is why the federal government 
must retain its discretionary spending power in this area across 
this nation to set national training standards.
<P>
	What does this say about our present social welfare system? It 
says that it is no longer sustainable. It says that we are creating 
social ghettos in which we subsidize people to do nothing, 
fostering a loss of self-respect and dignity. We must do better.
<P>
	Our benefits under the unemployment insurance system in 
this country are in excess of 20 per cent of the average of the 
United States and indeed all G-7 countries. I have always 
believed that money restored energy. It is a human's way of 
taking work and converting it into a liquid commodity.
<P>
	For instance, if I pay someone at the front door of this place 
$25 he or she will use their car and expend natural resources and 
time to drive me to the train station. To take money and give it to 
people to have them simply subsist is an insult to human 
intelligence. We must use unemployment insurance and other 
forms of transfers to individuals to assist them to rise up and 
take control of their lives. I am talking about using these funds 
to send them to learn new skills so that everyone can benefit 
from the new challenges of an evolving economy.
<P>
	I now want to talk about the final point in my support of the 
budget and that deals with the area of small and medium size 
businesses. Much talk has been made around this place on this 
issue and much discussion has been made about the relation of 
these businesses with the banking community.
<P>
	I would like to draw the attention of the House to the fact that 
these institutions account for less than 6 per cent of all deposits 
in this country. As a consequence, castigating this sector, the 
banking sector, is much like trying to fix a leaky row boat to 
cross the Great Lakes. It will not do the job even if we do fix it.
<P>
	I note that the minister has elected to study pension funds and 
how they can be used to more effectively finance small and 
medium size businesses. Clearly, this is the right direction.
<P>
	The minister has also pointed to a number of government 
initiatives in the budget. These include Canadian investment 
fund, business network strategies and the establishment of 
business service centres for one stop shopping for government 
services. One feature of these initiatives is the electronic 
highway.
<P>
	The railway bounded this country in our history, then roads 
made it easier for people to communicate. Finally, the telephone 
first operated in Canada so that we could even more effectively 
deal with each other. Our diversity and the fact that we are 
spread fairly thin across this great nation turned us into the 
world's expert in the field of communication.
<P>
	While we have squabbled about our internal problems, as my 
colleagues to the left of me continue to do, the real world is 
passing us by. We need to get on with the fourth stage of our 
nation building. The ability to link each individual in the 
country by means of an electronic highway, regardless of 
language or culture is our challenge.
<P>
<B>(1845) </B>
<P>
	I am proud to note that the government has provided funding 
for this worthwhile project, recognizing that it, together with the 
initiatives for the small and medium sized business sector, will 
set the agenda for a new tomorrow for all Canadians.

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">ADJOURNMENT PROCEEDINGS</H2>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 
deemed to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="INDIANAFFAIRS">INDIAN AFFAIRS</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot):</B> Mr. Speaker, on Tuesday of 
this week I rose in the House to ask the Minister of Indian 
Affairs and Northern Development a question of great 
importance to me, to my colleagues and particularly to the 
members of the Slave Lake bands.
<P>
	The hon. member chose to blatantly ignore the question which 
showed disrespect to me and to the grand chiefs and chiefs who 
brought this issue to our attention.
<P>
	I did not simply ask the question of my own accord. We had 
contacted members who were present at the meeting between the 
minister and the Slave Lake bands. I was told that they felt the 
minister's conduct at the meeting was insulting and shocking. 
They said his comments, as they pertained to the Reform Party, 
were indeed racist.
<P>
	My colleague, the hon. member for Nanaimo-Cowichan, 
who was upset by the lack of response by the minister to my 
question, was prompted to pose the same one later in the 
question period.
<P>
	The minister, when asked to provide a direct, clear answer, 
once again avoided the question. He said: ``I am sure, Mr. 
Speaker, that the Reform Party does not hate Indians'', but he 
did not deny or admit saying to a group of aboriginal people that 
the Reform Party hates Indians and they want to be seen as the 
defender of the white man. I believe the hon. member has a duty 
and responsibility as a minister of the crown to answer this 
question.
<P>
<B>(1850) </B>
<P>
	I and other members of the Reform Party have established 
close ties with many First Nations people and leaders over the 
years. This kind of comment, if made by the minister, amounts 
to a racist and slanderous attack on members of the Reform 
Party by a minister of the crown and defames us in the eyes of 
the aboriginal people and all Canadians. Nothing short of an 
honest and straightforward answer will suffice in a matter of this 
importance.
<P>
	I was present in the House today when the question was posed 
in almost identical words to the minister for the third time. I also 
have the ``blues'' that indicate his answer. Again he does not 
clearly indicate whether he had made this statement. He only 
deals with a portion of the statement that has to do with the hate 
of the Reform Party for Indian people and does not cover the 
other part of the question, that we want to represent the white 
man, in effect against the Indian people.
<P>
	Although it appeared to me that the minister had come a 
certain way in resolving this issue, it has not been resolved in my 
mind nor in the minds of my colleagues within the Reform Party.
<P>
	We have also received a joint affidavit from people who were 
present at that meeting when this incident occurred. Eight of the 
leaders have signed a document and sworn before a notary 
public what actually happened at that meeting. I am prepared to 
table a copy of that here today.
<P>
	I feel the minister should resolve this matter so that we can get 
on with our business and he can get on with the affairs of his 
ministry.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Iyerak Anawak (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development):</B>
<P>
	[<I>Member spoke in Inuktitut</I>]
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, as you know this question concerns an alleged 
comment by the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development that Reform Party members hate Indians. As the 
member said, it was raised earlier in the House this week. At that 
time the minister answered the charge, clearly stating that he 
does not believe he said any such thing.
<P>
	Again today the minister told members of the House 
categorically that he does not believe Reform members or any 
other members of the House for that matter hate Indians. I think 
it is quite understandable that he would not believe any such 
thing. The minister took the opportunity to encourage all 
members to look beyond their partisan interests so that we might 
all work together in building a new relationship with us, the 
aboriginal people of Canada.
<P>
	Aboriginal people have told us that implementing the inherent 
right to aboriginal self-government should be the cornerstone of 
this new relationship. To that end the minister has had an 
opportunity to meet with many leaders across the country, 
discussing various issues, one of which is the inherent right to 
self-government.
<P>
	The member would like the minister to respond to one 
particular community or meeting that he attended and at that 
point the minister answered clearly, again restated today that he 
does not believe any such thing. He said he has checked with 
<P>

<B><A NAME="1838"> 1838 </A></B>
<P>
other members who attended the same meeting and they do not 
remember such a statement being made.
<P>
<B>(1855 ) </B>
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="BOOKPUBLISHING">BOOK PUBLISHING</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Simon de Jong (Regina-Qu'Appelle):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
February 22 I asked the Minister of Canadian Heritage why his 
government did not follow the requirements of the Investment 
Canada Act and in fact allowed Paramount to obtain the book 
publishing company's Maxwell Macmillan and Ginn 
Publishing.
<P>
	The act prevents a non-Canadian from acquiring a Canadian 
controlled book publishing business.
<P>
	Ginn Publishing was 51 per cent owned by the government 
through CDIC. In the case of a non-Canadian wishing to sell an 
existing Canadian business like Maxwell Macmillan the act 
requires that the vendor must prove that the potential Canadian 
investors have had a full and thorough opportunity to purchase. 
In both cases the government simply ignored the act.
<P>
	In the case of Ginn Publishing the government claims it was 
obliged to sell its 51 per cent share to Paramount because of a 
legal obligation.
<P>
	Canadians would like to see that contract made public in order 
to determine what that obligation is, who incurred it, when and 
where. Even if that obligation is there this government has 
renegotiated commitments made by the past Tory government, 
i.e. Pearson airport and the helicopter deal.
<P>
	The Minister of Industry also claimed there was not ``a 
substantial indication of interest''.
<P>
	Let me quote from the <I>Toronto Star</I> of February 22:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>One of Canada's top publishers, Canada Publishing Corporation, insists that 
its repeated expressions of interest in the company were constantly spurned.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The firm's chairman, Ron Besse, says that the government kept promising a 
prospectus on Ginn but never issued one.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>After the Liberals assumed power, Besse sent his lawyers to Ottawa to again 
explore the possibility of purchasing Ginn. The next day, he received a call from 
Paramount asking what he wanted.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In other words, it is Paramount that is speaking on behalf of 
the minister and the government and not the department.
<P>
	In the case of Maxwell Macmillan this is a direct acquisition 
and the act requires that Canadians have a full and fair 
opportunity to bid.
<P>
	What effort was made to find Canadian buyers? Why was the 
acquisition of Maxwell Macmillan not reviewed by Investment 
Canada as part of the larger review that the act requires because 
Paramount in turn has been bought by Viacom?
<P>
	The government could have had significant leverage in 
negotiating with Paramount but again it failed to do so.
<P>
	This government could have acted to prevent the book 
publishing business of especially high school and university 
texts being dominated by American controlled companies. The 
fact the government did not has sent shock waves through the 
cultural community.
<P>
	As Keith Kelly, national director of the Canadian Conference 
of the Arts stated, `` What is stopping other transactions from 
acquiring other Canadian cultural industries?''
<P>
	One wonders if the ministers involved in this decision really 
knew what they were doing. Were they misinformed by their 
advisers? If not, is this going to be the Liberal government's 
policy, the same as the previous Conservative policy.
<P>
	I quote from the Liberal red book:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>At a time when globalization and the information and communications 
revolution are erasing national borders, Canada needs more than ever to commit 
itself to cultural development. Instead, the Conservative regime has deliberately 
undermined our national cultural institutions.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The purchase by Paramount of Maxwell Macmillan and Ginn 
is an undermining of our national cultural institutions.
<P>
	I ask this government, is this what it means when it talks about 
cultural development? Is this a harbinger of things to come?
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Walker (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance):</B> Mr. Speaker, this is my first opportunity to 
congratulate you in your new job. I wish you well. I remember 
working in caucus with you. I very much appreciate the 
contribution you made as a member of our caucus and I look 
forward to working with you in the House.
<P>
	I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak to the questions 
raised by the hon. member for Regina Qu'Appelle. Also, I would 
like to elaborate on the information that was already distributed 
to all members so that the hon. member can better understand 
the series of events that led up to this transaction.
<P>
	Further to a directive from the previous government CDIC 
acquired 51 per cent of Ginn from Paramount in 1989. In 
consideration of the book publishing policy then in effect known 
as the Baie Comeau policy, Paramount, then Gulf &amp; Western 
Industries Inc., had acquired Ginn as part of a larger takeover of 
a U.S.-based parent. It was subsequently required to divest a 
controlling interest in Ginn to Canadians.
<P>
	Following Paramount's unsuccessful efforts to find a 
Canadian buyer, the government through CDIC bought a 51 per 
cent interest in Ginn for $10.3 million. At the same time CDIC 
was directed to sell its interest to Canadians as soon as practical.
<P>
	In negotiating the forced divestiture of Paramount the 
previous government agreed that if its policy respecting  
indirect acquisitions in the Canadian book publishing industry 
changed while CDIC continued to hold its interest in Ginn, 
Paramount would have the right to repurchase the holdings by 
CDIC at the same price.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="1839"> 1839 </A></B>
<P>
	Furthermore, while CDIC technically purchased the Ginn 
holding in 1989, there remained a number of legal and 
commercial issues to resolve with Paramount before the 
interest could be offered for sale to Canadians. CDIC succeeded 
in resolving some but not all those issues.
<P>
	In the meantime CDIC received inquiries from Canadians 
interested in purchasing the Ginn holding and a list of potential 
purchasers was compiled. However, contrary to the statement 
made by the hon. member, no potential purchaser was turned 
away. In reality, CDIC was at no time in a position to market its 
interest in Ginn actively until the resolution of certain 
outstanding issues, one of which was a complicated distribution 
arrangement to be settled.
<P>
	In January 1992, when the former government announced its 
new book publishing policy, Paramount's legal right to 
repurchase CDIC's holding in Ginn was triggered. From that 
time forward CDIC's hands were tied as it was not able to 
consider a sale to a Canadian purchaser until Paramount 
declined to exercise its right to repurchase the 51 per cent 
interest in Ginn.
<P>
	To have proceeded otherwise could have exposed CDIC and 
the government to possible legal action. Paramount decided to 
exercise its right to repurchase the Ginn holding for the original 
price paid by CDIC of $10.3 million. The government was 
required to complete a transaction that was set in motion by its 
predecessors.
