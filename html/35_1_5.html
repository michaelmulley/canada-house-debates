	The House resumed from January 20 consideration of the 
motion for an address to His Excellency the Governor General in 
reply to his Speech at the opening of the session; and the 
amendment.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Before giving the floor to the President 
of the Treasury Board, I would like to read a very brief 
statement.
<P>
	Members will be aware that Telesat Canada has encountered 
major technical difficulties with the Anik E2 satellite. That is 
the satellite that is used by the cable parliamentary channel, as 
members will know, to distribute our proceedings across the 
country. I would therefore advise hon. members that until 
further notice there will be no national distribution of these 
proceedings. Members will be advised when this is rectified 
which hopefully will be soon.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board 
and Minister responsible for Infrastructure):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
now I guess we can relax a little more.
<P>
	I want to begin by congratulating the Speaker on his election. 
May I also, in addition to congratulating him, congratulate you 
and your colleagues who will assist him in that capacity.
<P>
	I want to go beyond that. For my part I want to pledge that I 
will do all I can to assist you, Mr. Speaker, in ensuring that this 
House provides the forum for civilized and informative debate 
that Canadians I think are really expecting from their elected 
representatives.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Unfortunately, I cannot make my speech in French, because 
my fluency in that language is far from adequate. However, I can 
assure you one of my personal goals is to improve my French, 
not only because it is the other official language but because it is 
a beautiful language and the expression of a rich and important 
culture, both in Canada and internationally.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This is my inaugural address to the House. Therefore while 
preparing for today's debate I spent some time thinking about 
the men and women who preceded me in this place. For new 
members like myself there are many excellent role models to 
choose from. In fact there are people who now serve and who 
used to serve in this House whose compassion, persuasiveness 
and original thinking I admire a great deal. One such person is 
my predecessor the former member of Parliament for York 
Centre and a former Solicitor General for Canada, the Hon. Bob 
Kaplan. Bob Kaplan was an outstanding parliamentarian, a 
respected community leader and a man who is still highly 
regarded by his constituents. During the course of the election 
campaign I was struck by the degree of attachment and devotion 
people felt for him. Bob set a very high standard of service to his 
constituents and one that I will try to emulate.
<P>
<B>(1005) </B>
<P>
	While I am new to this House and to politics at the national 
level, I arrive here with the perspective of 22 years experience in 
municipal government, including 11 years as the mayor of 
Toronto. It was an honour to be mayor of my city and now I have 
the honour to use that experience for the benefit of the people of 
York Centre and the people of Canada. It was also that 
experience that persuaded me of the need for Canada's three 
levels of government to address the need to enhance the quantity 
and the quality of infrastructure in our cities, towns and villages.
<P>
	I was a member of the board of directors of the umbrella 
organization known as the Federation of Canadian 
Municipalities during the period when it undertook a major 
survey of the state of our municipal infrastructure, a survey 
which demonstrated the extent of our need for new investment.
<P>
	I was one of those who helped the federation shape its 
proposal for a new three way program of co-operation between 
the federal, provincial and municipal levels of government to 
renew Canada's municipal infrastructure.
<P>
	The work of the federation did not take place in a vacuum. 
Throughout the industrialized world the last few years have seen 
a very active, renewed interest in the role and the importance of 
infrastructure, whether it is for economic competitiveness to 
attract investment, environmental protection and improvement, 
the quality of public amenities and the quality of life in general.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="138"> 138 </A></B>
<P>
	For these reasons and despite extremely difficult fiscal 
constraints which we are well aware of, the Liberal Party chose 
to undertake a major co-operative program of infrastructure 
renewal as one of the central planks of its election platform.
<P>
	In my riding many people earn their living in construction 
related industries. During the recent election campaign our 
leader and current Prime Minister travelled to York Centre to 
outline our new program on infrastructure to an audience of 
skilled trades people from our local unions. These union 
officials report that their membership suffers greatly from high 
unemployment. In fact, levels get as high as 50 per cent at times 
in this industry in the Toronto area they told me. Our proposal, 
therefore, struck a deep responsive chord with these workers and 
with the Canadian public.
<P>
	Given the importance which the Prime Minister attaches to 
the infrastructure program I was honoured when he asked me to 
become the Minister responsible for Infrastructure in the new 
government. The Prime Minister underlined to me the 
importance of moving quickly to develop agreements with the 
provinces and to get the program up and operating. An early 
start to this program will provide new hope to Canadians and 
help to rebuild the confidence that is such an important part of 
our healthy economy.
<P>
	Some Canadians are asking why we have chosen 
infrastructure as a major priority and why are we doing this now. 
The answer is that the infrastructure program has become a 
cornerstone of the government's programs because it will create 
jobs while refurbishing at the same time Canada's infrastructure 
and promoting our long term economic growth.
<P>
<B>(1010 ) </B>
<P>
	There is also strong evidence that much of our infrastructure 
has deteriorated and deteriorating infrastructure, as they found 
out in the country to the south of us, can be a serious detriment to 
not only the quality of life but, of course, to attracting 
investment dollars into their communities.
<P>
	Beyond that, the current tough economic climate has brought 
more competitive pricing and it provides, therefore, government 
with a chance to stretch the construction dollars to the 
maximum. This promises real value for the taxpayers.
<P>
	The infrastructure program has not been designed as the 
government's only job creation project, I hasten to add, but 
rather as an important stimulus to the economy as a whole. The 
exact number of jobs it will create depends on the construction 
projects which will be approved. Some projects such as repairs 
and renovations will be extremely labour-intensive while those 
such as cultural facilities are also going to create long-term 
jobs.
<P>
	One thing, however, is clear: The program will have 
substantial impact on unemployment. In fact, the Federation of 
Canadian Municipalities has estimated that for every billion 
dollars invested, some 20,000 jobs are created. The 
infrastructure program is more than simply the building of 
roads, the building of bridges or sewers. It is more than repairing 
buildings, more than restoring water supply systems. The 
infrastructure program is an integral part of the vision of the new 
Liberal government to lay the foundation for economic 
recovery, to kick-start a sluggish economy and provide a future 
for Canadians, particularly for young Canadians who are 
currently without hope or prospects.
<P>
	We will give these young Canadians new hope and confidence 
in the future. That is what we said we would do in the red book 
and that is still our commitment now that we are here as the 
government.
<P>
	This is an ideal time for accelerated investment in public 
infrastructure, as I have already said. Also, let me say that 
national unemployment, which stands at an unacceptable level 
of over 11 per cent and in the construction industry over 20 per 
cent, and as I said a few moments ago over 50 per cent, are very 
key reasons why we need to move into this program at this time.
<P>
	There is a terrible waste of human talent and a tremendous 
distress on the part of hundreds of thousands of people and their 
families right across this country. I met many of these people in 
the course of the election campaign. I understand their pain and I 
understand their frustration at what has been called a jobless 
recovery. That is why the speech from the throne earlier this 
week stated: ``the government attaches the highest priority to 
job creation and economic growth in the short and long term''.
<P>
	I am pleased to say that in the brief few weeks since the new 
government was sworn in we have made very tangible progress 
to put this new infrastructure program into place. After 
discussions between federal and provincial ministers and 
various officials, the Prime Minister and the provincial premiers 
endorsed the program when they came here to Ottawa for their 
meeting on December 21. Last Friday, January 14, less than 10 
weeks after the new government was formed, we signed our first 
four federal-provincial framework agreements establishing the 
Canada Infrastructure Works Program for the provinces of Nova 
Scotia, New Brunswick, Manitoba and Saskatchewan.
<P>
	My colleagues, the Minister responsible for Atlantic 
Development and the Secretary of State for Veterans Affairs, are 
signing an agreement today with Prince Edward Island and we 
will continue this momentum on Monday when the Minister of 
Industry and I will be in my city of Toronto to sign a similar 
agreement with the province of Ontario. I expect to sign 
agreements with the other four provinces and the territories in a 
matter of days.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="139"> 139 </A></B>
<P>
	The conclusion of this number of federal-provincial 
agreements in so short a time demonstrates that the federal 
government is honouring its commitment to Canadians to create 
jobs and to create jobs now.
<P>
	Our success owes a good deal to the very co-operative 
attitude taken by all of the provincial governments. They have 
recognized the intrinsic merit of the program, they have 
responded to the public's desire for early action, and have shown 
a determination to demonstrate that federal and provincial 
governments can work quickly and co-operatively. I wish to 
express publicly my gratitude for the exceptional co-operation 
of the provinces on this program.
<P>
	I also wish to underline the importance of the support this 
program has received from mayors and other elected 
representatives at the local level across Canada. They have been 
supportive, they have been enthusiastic, they are very much 
equal partners. I am delighted that the federal government will 
be able to contribute so significantly to a program that our local 
governments have created and have advocated for a number of 
years.
<P>
<B>(1015 ) </B>
<P>
	The federal contribution will be very tangible and very 
significant. We are providing the provinces and municipalities 
with a total of $2 billion over the next two years. For the most 
part the federal contribution will be matched equally by the 
provinces and municipalities. This will provide for a total joint 
program of $6 billion.
<P>
	In some projects however the provinces themselves will 
provide two-thirds of the funding, while the federal government 
will contribute its normal one-third share.
<P>
	Similarly the program will have flexibility to accommodate 
private financing. In fact the subject of my address in November 
1993 to the Canadian Council for Public-Private Partnerships 
opened the door for possible private financing of infrastructure 
projects.
<P>
	The focus of our program is on local infrastructure and we 
believe that it should be the local and provincial governments 
themselves which take the lead in proposing projects. There will 
be, as is natural, differences in the precise form that the program 
will take in each province. In some cases only municipal 
projects will be considered; in others, other local government 
institutions such as education boards may be eligible, or there 
might be projects carried out by the province itself. Indian 
reserves are also included in the program.
<P>
	As well the emphasis on types of infrastructure may vary by 
province. Some will put more emphasis on the traditional water 
treatment or sewage. Others may be more inclined to support 
roads or construction or repair of existing facilities. These 
variations should reflect local needs and priorities. That is what 
we clearly said in the election campaign and that is what we 
want to see carried out.
<P>
	We should also point out that this is a national program and we 
expect some elements of consistency across the country. In all 
provinces the federal government will review projects in 
relation to broad program criteria such as long and short-term 
job creation.
<P>
	We will be looking at the environmental benefits, wanting to 
ensure that environmental practices and environmental 
assessments are adhered to. We will be looking at the 
incremental or accelerated nature of the project. We are not 
looking to just fund projects that were going to go ahead 
anyway. We want to fund projects that create additional jobs.
<P>
	We will be looking at the distribution of benefits within a 
province. We want to make sure there is a wide distribution in 
benefit across each province. We will be looking at the use of 
advanced technology. The term as to what infrastructure 
includes is changing because the economy of this country and of 
this world is changing. Here is an opportunity in fact to develop 
infrastructure, invest in infrastructure that has to do with the 
future kinds of jobs that will be taken by our young people in this 
country.
<P>
	We will look at the use of innovative financing and the 
contributions to skills development. As people learn new skills 
the opportunities for them beyond this program expand. The 
bringing of infrastructure up to community standards, up to 
community codes will be considered. We will want cost-benefit 
information about these projects. We are also going to want to 
have cost control measures.
<P>
	Our basic approach is to provide enough guidance to ensure 
the high quality of the projects approved, but at the same time to 
leave ample room for local or provincial priorities. We are 
offering federal money for infrastructure programs as you know 
at a time of very severe fiscal constraints. We all are very 
conscious of the financial constraints upon all governments in 
this country.
<P>
	This government believes so much in the value of this 
investment that it is prepared to take the tough decisions to find 
the necessary funds through reallocations in the federal budget 
and by cutting spending proposed by the previous government.
<P>
	The federal government, I should add, may well recoup much 
of its $2 billion investment from additional tax revenues which 
will fall into the federal treasury as a result of increased 
construction activity. For every dollar spent on the proposed 
construction projects, federal government revenues in the form 
of taxes, unemployment insurance premiums and Canada 
pension plan contributions will increase. The federal 
government of course will also benefit from reductions in 
payments that it makes for the unemployed because they will be 
getting back to work. They will be able to restore their dignity 
and their desire to contribute to this nation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="140"> 140 </A></B>
<P>
	We moved quickly to sign framework agreements with the 
provinces and we shall move quickly to approve projects after 
we have appropriately evaluated them. Already federal and 
provincial officials in each province are working to refine the 
criteria and the guidelines which apply in each province. Local 
governments are being consulted. I expect to receive 
recommendations for the first proposals in the coming weeks 
and to see some projects approved in time for work to start in 
the spring of this year.
<P>
<B>(1020) </B>
<P>
	I know members of this House will take a close interest in the 
projects in their constituencies. For this reason we shall invite 
comments from each member of Parliament on projects 
recommended for his or her riding so that we can ensure that any 
information a member wishes to bring to our attention is 
available before a decision is taken.
<P>
	I look forward to members honouring the spirit of this 
consultation which will need to be done quickly and with full 
respect of our local and provincial partners if it is to be effective. 
For my part I shall listen to the views of all members with great 
interest. I look forward to the chance to discuss the program 
with individual members as well.
<P>
	The infrastructure program has received wide support across 
Canada not only from local governments but also from 
provincial governments, of very different political persuasions I 
might add. I hope members of this House will be responsive to 
this wide support and work as co-operatively as they can to 
ensure the success of the program.
<P>
	The Prime Minister in his remarks in the debate on the speech 
from the throne emphasized that the long-term future of our 
country lies in forming a new partnership, a partnership where 
the municipalities and the provinces work in genuine 
co-operation with a national government which has the vision of 
what can be, not what used to be.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to start by congratulating the minister on his infrastructure 
program which is to be launched very soon, witness the 
announcement concerning construction of the convention centre 
in Quebec City.
<P>
	I represent the riding of Chicoutimi, which includes the 
municipalities of Rivière-Éternité, Petit-Saguenay, 
L'Anse-Saint-Jean, Saint-Félix-d'Otis, Ferland-et-Boileau, 
Ville La Baie and Chicoutimi. The unemployment situation in 
all these municipalities is very bad. In the 
Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean area, the unemployment rate is an 
unacceptable 16 per cent, and there is nothing in the throne 
speech to indicate that this percentage will go down.
<P>
	This government's infrastructures program will certainly not 
be enough to turn around the economy, either in the riding, 
Quebec or Canada. We must break the vicious circle of 
unemployment insurance which means that people work four 
months a year on a government project and then are unemployed 
for the rest of the year. If they are lucky, after using up their 
unemployment insurance benefits they might qualify for 
another government project, but that is it, and then they end up 
on welfare, which makes it even harder to get back to work.
<P>
	Economic recovery must be achieved through regional 
development by giving the regions all the infrastructures they 
need, not just the road networks covered by your program but 
infrastructures for water and air transportation which provide 
links between the regions and give them access to major urban 
centres.
<P>
<B>(1025) </B>
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, in addition to the infrastructures program, could 
the minister confirm there have been cabinet-level discussions 
on other programs aimed at a sustainable reduction of the 
unemployment rate, which the government will be tabling very 
shortly?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Eggleton:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
question and also for enlightening me with respect to the 
conditions in his constituency of Chicoutimi and other 
municipalities.
<P>
	I hope this infrastructure program will be of benefit to them. I 
hope certainly that the municipal leaders are encouraged by the 
member to put forward projects that can be of benefit to the 
communities and economy of the region.
<P>
	As I indicated in my remarks, the government has put this 
forward as one of its programs and projects that it wants to use to 
help rebuild the economy and get Canadians back to work.
<P>
	There are discussions going on on many other types of 
programs. One has to only look in the red book to see the many 
different things for young people, for people right across this 
country, for small business.
<P>
	We want to promote and help ensure that Canadians can get 
back to work. What we need badly in this country is a more 
balanced approach to economic planning. That is what the 
Liberal government has committed itself to do. It committed 
itself in the throne speech to give the highest priority to getting 
Canadians back to work.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
clearly this infrastructure project has created tremendous 
expectations and this was obvious from the general reaction of 
the municipalities. In his speech, the minister outlined ten or so 
conditions that will have to be met by all provinces in order for 
the program to be successful. He spoke of the need for cost 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="141"> 141 </A></B>
<P>
control mechanisms, while allowing some room to manoeuvre. 
Could the Minister  explain what kind of national criteria he has 
in mind for controlling costs while still allowing third parties 
some room to manoeuvre?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Eggleton:</B> Mr. Speaker, this program is a co-operative 
program with three levels of government. Each project will 
require each level of government to sign off on it.
<P>
	Each level of government has a responsibility also to ensure 
that the taxpayer's dollar is well spent. I do not think any level of 
government wants to get into a situation of cost overruns. We 
want to make sure that there are cost control mechanisms in 
place. Each level of government has internal auditing 
procedures and controllership procedures that help to ensure 
that the best cost estimates are being put forward.
<P>
	We will have a still further look at it even though the 
provincial and municipal governments with their very 
restrained budgets are going to want to make sure that those 
costs are as accurate as they can be. We are going to want to 
make sure as well because I want this program to be carried out 
in an efficient and effective manner. I want it to produce good 
results. I do not want people to have to face a situation where 
there are going to be cost overruns.
<P>
	We will look at cost controls and cost benefits, understanding 
the benefits that come out at the end of the day. One of the things 
we said in the red book was that we want to know what these 
programs produce. What are the results? What are they really 
going to do for Canadians in the short and long term? Those 
kinds of evaluations are also part and parcel of what we will be 
looking at.
<P>
	Three orders of government will be working together, giving 
consideration to the fiscal constraints we find ourselves in and 
the very serious nature of how the taxpayer's dollar is used.
<P>
<B>(1030) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philippe Paré (Louis-Hébert):</B> Mr. Speaker, as this is 
my maiden speech, I would like to begin by saying a few words 
about my riding of Louis-Hébert. It includes three lovely 
suburban municipalities in the Quebec City area, namely 
Cap-Rouge, Sainte-Foy and Sillery, located on the shores of the 
St. Lawrence.
<P>
	I listened closely to the remarks of the hon. member for York 
Centre concerning the infrastructure program and I would like to 
make a few comments. My first concerns the spirit of 
co-operation to which the Minister referred. I am very happy 
that the federal, provincial and municipal governments are 
co-operating.
<P>
	This is good to see, except that given the current situation, it 
illustrates the weak position of the federal government, in view 
of the size of the debt and runaway government expenses. When 
the federal government wants to carry out a project, it must work 
side by side with the municipalities-which in itself is a good 
thing-and with the provinces. This only reflects the serious 
state of the government's finances.
<P>
	The hon. member for York Centre indicated-and I am happy 
to hear it-that this is not the only job creation program. We 
will, however, be paying close attention to concrete programs 
announced later.
<P>
	The Minister said that the infrastructure program will 
kick-start the economy. Economic recovery will be difficult, if 
not impossible, until such time as the government takes serious, 
radical steps to slash government spending. And there is nothing 
in the throne speech to indicate that the government intends to 
take this kind of action.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Eggleton:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
intervention. I would quickly point out that this is a great 
example of bringing three levels of government to work 
together. Is it not about time that we did that rather than have the 
duplications? We may have three levels of government but we 
have one taxpayer and that taxpayer wants to make sure we are 
spending his or her money efficiently and effectively.
<P>
	That taxpayer is also concerned about government 
expenditure. Indeed, that is an issue that is also being addressed 
by the Minister of Finance, by me and by my colleagues in the 
cabinet and will of course be addressed in the federal budget 
when it is brought forward.
<P>
	However, at this point in time we are entering into a program 
that is unprecedented in terms of the co-operation. It is also a 
program that is based on local priorities and the need to keep our 
communities safe and liveable, have the kind of infrastructure to 
enjoy a quality of life that has been traditionally held dear and 
which will attract additional investment to improve their 
economic growth.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I would like to start by taking this opportunity to congratulate all 
my colleagues who were elected to the House of Commons on 
October 25, in an election which must be seen as crucial for the 
future of Quebec and that of Canada without Quebec.
<P>
	I also take this opportunity to thank the constituents of the 
great riding of Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, the Quebec agri-food 
technocity, for the trust they have shown in me by giving me a 
clear dual mandate: first, to fight most vigorously to protect 
their interests and those of Quebec as a whole and, second, to 
pave the way for Quebec to attain full sovereignty to put to rest 
once and for all the constitutional issue.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="142"> 142 </A></B>
<P>
	Quebec sovereignty is no longer a mere matter of the heart 
or patriotism. It has become a matter of practicality.
<P>
<B>(1035) </B>
<P>
	Following the constitutional negotiations of recent years, 
sovereignty has emerged as the only way to allow our two 
nations to stop arguing endlessly about the Constitution and 
start dealing with the real issues.
<P>
	What are those real issues? First, to undo the harm done by 
overly liberal budgeting in recent years, especially at the federal 
level. Second, to promote economic development and 
competitiveness. Third, to create lasting employment. And 
fourth, to really tackle the problem of growing poverty in 
Quebec and Canada.
<P>
	Let us say, for the sake of argument, that a beneficial 
restructuring of the relations between Quebec and Canada did 
occur, such that we would end up with two sovereign countries. 
Their relations would then be free of any constitutional dispute 
and a common economic space would be maintained out of 
mutual interest, not as a favour, as the other side usually says.
<P>
	That is what the sovereignty plan is all about. It is directed 
against no one, especially not our Canadians friends. Our plan 
has a resolutely global reach. It is legitimate, progressive, open 
and totally in tune with the times.
<P>
	Until the people of Quebec decide democratically to take their 
destiny into their own hands, the Bloc Quebecois has received 
from them the mandate to protect their interests. And whether 
you like it or not, the Canadian democratic process has given us 
the role of official opposition in this chamber of Parliament.
<P>
	As my leader has repeatedly said, the Bloc Quebecois will 
assume the role of Official Opposition with all the fervour we 
have come to expect from it, especially in the last four days, 
because the fight against poverty and unemployment, for 
example, is universal. Whether you are a federalist or a 
sovereignist, you must fight these evils.
<P>
	Equity also has a universal definition and the Bloc Quebecois 
will act on the basis of this concern for fairness. For Quebec first 
of all, because the inequity in federal spending is most flagrant 
in its case, and elsewhere if required.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, you will understand that, as the Official 
Opposition, we will often be working towards the Bloc 
Quebecois's ultimate goal, which is to pave the way for 
sovereignty for Quebec.
<P>
	Where public finances are concerned, no one in Quebec or 
Canada has any interest in seeing the already catastrophic state 
of the federal government's finances deteriorate further. Canada 
and a sovereign Quebec will have to assume their share of the 
federal debt.
<P>
	The same goes for international trade. It is definitely in 
Quebec's interest, beginning with Quebec's duly elected 
representatives in the Bloc Quebecois, to ensure that the 
international agreements recently concluded in its name are 
beneficial. Under the rule for successor states, a sovereign 
Quebec would inherit the commitments already made by 
Canada.
<P>
	So in these two specific areas, public finances and 
international trade, we have seen recently that both Quebecers 
and Canadians really need a vigorous official opposition.
<P>
	Quebecers and Canadians need a strong opposition because 
the federal government, the present Liberal government, intends 
to solve the Canadian government's financial problem using the 
same approach that it criticized the previous government for, 
namely putting the burden of fiscal reform on the poorest 
members of our society. As my leader said, that is unacceptable.
<P>
	Modernizing and restructuring the social security system as 
suggested in the speech from the throne, knowing that this 
reform comes from the same senior civil servants, these great 
mandarins, one of whom has now become the new member for 
Hull-Aylmer, these great mandarins praised to the skies by this 
government, such a reform simply means cutting social 
programs.
<P>
	We see the same sinister intent in a publication on Canada's 
economic challenges issued last week by the Minister of 
Finance. What do we find in this new bible of the federal 
mandarins? We read that Canada spends more on social 
assistance than its major trading partners. It says that our 
unemployment insurance system is more generous than average 
and creates major disincentives to work. Major disincentives to 
work-I find that downright odious.
<P>
<B>(1040) </B>
<P>
	This is despicable because, as the Leader of the Official 
Opposition said two days ago, nobody goes to the 
unemployment office for the fun of it. Nobody in Quebec, as in 
the rest of Canada, is proud to be unemployed or on welfare. And 
everybody wants to enjoy the fundamental right to work. When I 
read this document and the recent statements made by our 
friends across the floor, I get the impression that I am reading 
old stuff written a century ago by ultraconservative economists.
<P>
	This document from the Department of Finance also mentions 
that our public expenditures related to health care are higher 
than others, without noticeable results. I was flabbergasted to 
see this kind of statement in the Department of Finance's 
document, because those are precisely the people who, not long 
ago, were saying that our health care system was the best and the 
cheapest in the world. Now they are contradicting themselves 
and, because they want to please some ultraconservative 
economists met recently at a seminar, they are prepared to make 
cuts to health care programs.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="143"> 143 </A></B>
<P>
	We can now better understand the meaning of the comments 
made last December by the hon. member for Hull-Aylmer, 
who is himself a former mandarin, and who alluded to the 
possibility of a 20 per cent cut in the health care budget. We 
can also better understand the meaning of the throne speech.
<P>
	I am absolutely flabbergasted to see that, in less than three 
months, this government has violated the basic principles 
underlying its electoral platform. This government was elected 
on the basis of false premises regarding, among others things, 
social programs. It has also reneged on its monetary policy. We 
now know only too well what has become of the promises made 
by the Liberals. Shortly before the Christmas holidays, the 
Minister of Finance appointed Mr. John Crow's successor, 
namely his assistant and advisor regarding monetary policy who 
is also obsessed with fighting inflation.
<P>
	It must be remembered that, among the G-7 countries, 
Canada was the most adversely affected by the recession of the 
early nineties. Canada was also the first one affected among the 
industrialized nations of the world. Why is that? It is precisely 
because of this obsession with fighting inflation regardless of 
the consequences on employment and on jobs in general.
<P>
	Today, even though inflation pressures are still weak, and 
while Quebec has only gained back a quarter of the jobs it lost 
and the economy has not reached its full potential, the Liberal 
government is refocusing its monetary policy to fight inflation 
instead of aiming for a fair balance between price stability in the 
long run and employment growth in the short run. These same 
people are now telling us that with their infrastructure program, 
they will be able to create thousands and thousands of jobs. 
Contradictory measures like this infrastructure program only go 
to show the inconsistencies in the Liberals' policies.
<P>
	Such policies are contrary to what the Liberals talked about 
during the election campaign and even before that, when they 
were the official opposition in this House.
<P>
	Let me remind you that on November 26, 1992, both <I>La 
Presse</I> and <I>Le Devoir</I> quoted the present prime minister as 
saying: ``For several months now, we have clearly indicated that 
we are proposing a growth policy based on low interest rates. 
And if the Canadian dollar should weaken, we can live with 
that''. That is what the present Prime Minister had to say only 
two years ago. Today, he is doing exactly what he was blaming 
the Conservatives for. The present prime minister also said: 
``People are becoming obsessed with the anti-inflationary 
policy''. Can you believe that. The Liberals themselves have 
developed an obsession for the same monetary policies they 
used to criticize.
<P>
	Earlier this week, the Minister of Finance even said about the 
throne speech: ``We will be worthy of the trust Canadians put in 
us''. He mentioned that the speech from the throne would break 
the vicious cycle of ``cynicism and deception Canadians felt 
about politics''.
<P>
	This kind of approach, this kind of backtracking will not do 
anything to break the cynicism that exists towards the old 
federalist parties; it is there to stay.
<P>
	And there will still be cynicism about the tax equity issue 
since nothing leads us to believe that the Liberals will do 
something about that despite having complained loudly about 
the unfairness of our tax system during all these years. The 
government does not have the political will to eliminate all the 
tax loopholes and all the tax breaks that some people benefit 
from. We always point to the same problem, and with good 
reason. Just as the Conservatives before them, the Liberals 
probably have their hands tied by Canada's richest families who 
contribute to their election fund.
<P>
<B>(1045) </B>
<P>
	There are plenty of examples of unfairness and inequity in our 
tax system, Mr. Speaker. Here are some of them. In 1987, the 
most recent year for which this kind of data is available, 90,000 
Canadian companies made profits totalling $27 billion and paid 
no taxes at all. There is no in-depth study on this but in 1991, 
according to the Auditor General, a minimum of $16.1 billion in 
revenues found their way to various tax havens. Hundreds of 
millions of dollars in federal tax revenues are lost through the 
family trusts which we talked about earlier this week.
<P>
	Here is another example of unfairness and inequity in our tax 
system. In 1991, 368,000 taxpayers with a total declared income 
of $60 billion, that is an average income of $163,000 each, paid 
a federal income tax of only 18 per cent. That was their real tax 
rate because of all the tax loopholes. But isn't the basic rate 29 
per cent, Mr. Speaker? This is shameful.
<P>
	On the other hand, a certain Ms. Pauline came to my riding 
office last week. She is on welfare and her income is about half 
the poverty threshold in Quebec as well as Canada, and she 
received a letter from Revenue Canada asking her to pay her 
income tax like any other taxpayer. Mr. Speaker, that is nothing 
short of outrageous.
<P>
	Two days ago, the Auditor General reported a number of cases 
of profligate spending and misuse of public money. I noticed 
two cases which are striking enough to demonstrate the urgent 
need for tax reform to achieve greater equity instead of wasting 
money.
<P>
	Investment Canada spent $132,000 to set up a new office, 
kitchen and bathroom for its new president, while her 
predecessor had an office in the same building with the same 
conveniences. Mr. Speaker, $132,000 is the equivalent of the 
annual income of four households. It is utterly disgraceful. The 
Auditor General also pointed out that because of a loophole in a 
deduction concerning natural resources, the government lost 
$1.2 billion in  revenue, mainly in the oil and mining industries. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="144"> 144 </A></B>
<P>
What is this government waiting for before they settle once and 
for all these problem that plague Quebec and Canada alike?
<P>
	That is where we can find money to get the public finances in 
order. That is where we should go to reduce the revenue shortfall 
of the federal government, which over the years has generated 
an accumulated debt of over $500 billion. These are the persons 
we should be after, not the less fortunate like Ms. Pauline in the 
riding of Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot.
<P>
	We should not cut transfer payments to the provinces either. 
When will those opposite realize that, in the end, it falls on the 
backs of the same taxpayers. I will give you just one example 
taken from the Quebec public accounts. All the measures taken 
since 1980 either to reduce or freeze transfer payments to the 
provinces have cost the government of Quebec over two billion 
dollars. Who had to provide for this shortfall in federal transfer 
payments to Quebec? The women and men of Quebec, of course, 
because they are the same taxpayers. All this to say that shifting 
the burden onto the provinces is not a way to improve the fiscal 
situation.
<P>
	Given these shameful and odious fiscal inequities and the 
disastrous state of federal public finances, the Bloc Quebecois 
reaffirms the need to proceed with a public examination by 
Parliament of all federal budgetary and tax expenditures. We do 
not want a media circus of unending consultations which would 
only postpone a necessary reform. We do not want piecemeal 
reform. We do not want a little something here and a little 
something there. We want an in-depth examination by 
Parliamentarians of federal fiscal policies and expenditures.
<P>
	One last point before I conclude. There is another thing barely 
mentioned in the speech from the throne, and that is the GATT 
agreement. Instead of wasting his time arguing about impossible 
changes to the North American Free Trade Agreement, the way 
he did after the House of Representatives passed the NAFTA, the 
Prime Minister of Canada should have focused on the final 
sprint toward a GATT agreement. The Bloc Quebecois 
welcomes the conclusion of the eighth GATT round, and I say 
this without reservations. The Bloc, like Quebecers generally, 
takes a global perspective, an attitude that is entirely compatible 
with nationalism and sovereignism, as I indicated at the 
beginning of my speech.
<P>
<B>(1050) </B>
<P>
	However, although we welcome the conclusion of the 
Uruguay round, we are not satisfied with Canada's performance 
in this area, especially in the negotiations on agriculture, in the 
course of which article XI-2(c)(i) of the GATT rules, an article 
that was vital to agriculture in Quebec and Canada, was dropped.
<P>
	This article was vital because it ensured the survival and 
effectiveness of the supply management system in Canada's 
dairy and poultry sectors. The Canadian government gave up 
this article without obtaining anything in return. That was the 
worst part, like the government's financial situation. Nothing 
was obtained in return, while countries like South Korea, Japan, 
the United States, France and Belgium privately obtained 
exemptions that were included in the eighth GATT Round.
<P>
	Why did Canada not obtain an exemption? Because it failed to 
take a firm stand and because the Prime Minister, unlike Mr. 
Clinton in the United States, Mr. Mitterrand and the Japanese 
and South Korean prime ministers, did not get involved in the 
final sprint to protect article XI-2(c)(i) and the interests of 
Quebec and Canada in this area.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois does not blame the Canadian government 
for losing. These negotiations involve more than 110 countries, 
and it stands to reason that we cannot win on all fronts and might 
have to give up some of the items on our list. However, the 
Canadian government and the Prime Minister failed to do 
everything they could have done, which makes matters worse.
<P>
	It is public knowledge that the Government of Canada is about 
to cave in once more and renege on its commitments in 
negotiations on the GATT rules with the United States. For 
instance, in negotiations with the United States on border tariffs 
that will replace article XI, the government is poised to make 
concessions on tariff levels that are supposed to protect the dairy 
and poultry sectors.
<P>
	Unfortunately, the Canadian government has also caved in to 
unfounded rumours that U.S. borders would be closed to exports 
of durum wheat from the Canadian prairies.
<P>
	In concluding, the Official Opposition deplores the lack of 
vigour shown by the government in defending the interests of 
Quebec and Canada and the lack of any concern in this respect in 
the throne speech at the opening of the 35th Parliament.
<P>
	As the Official Opposition, the Bloc Quebecois intends to 
keep a close watch on further developments.

	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin by 
congratulating the member for Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot for his 
maiden speech in the House of Commons. There were moments 
as I listened to him speak when I was reminded of some of the 
things that we said in opposition just a few months ago. I would 
like to be very specific about that part of his speech that dealt 
with the issue of tax reform.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="145"> 145 </A></B>
<P>
	I want to say to the hon. member that the Prime Minister 
stated repeatedly before the campaign, during the campaign and 
during the speech from the throne that this government is 
dedicated to comprehensive tax reform. We are dedicated to 
working with all members of this House in finding a more 
simple, fair and efficient way of dealing with the tax issue in 
this country. We agree that the current tax act has tax 
preferences and privileges that need to be reviewed because the 
current system is not working.
<P>
<B>(1055) </B>
<P>
	He should not think that because we have come from one side 
of the floor to the other we will run away from the issue. Many 
members know I have a particular bias in that area called the 
single tax, l'impôt unique, and I will be sending copies to him 
and his colleagues for review.
<P>
	The second point I want to make to the member has to do with 
his statement where he said ``we want to have a situation in 
Quebec where our financial condition does not deteriorate''. I 
support the position the member has taken, but I think it is 
important to point out to all Canadians and all Quebecers that we 
have a system in this country, managed by the Government of 
Canada, called the equalization entitlement program.
<P>
	As the member knows, the province of Quebec is at this 
moment in time a have not province, as are many other 
provinces. We do have three provinces that we define as have 
provinces; British Columbia, Alberta and Ontario. Since 1969 
the equalization entitlement, and I stress the word entitlement 
here, by this federation, which is the total amount of that 
transfer to the province of Quebec, has been approximately $52 
billion. I support this approach and that is why I think it is 
important to have a strong national government. I will make sure 
that the member has time to respond.
<P>
	What I am having a very difficult time understanding is how 
one can maintain the same standards in education, health care 
and all other national standards that all of us want to achieve 
when one gives up a situation called equalization.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> Mr. Speaker, during the next few minutes, I will 
try to reply to two statements that struck me in the speech of my 
Liberal colleague. First, Mr. Speaker, he compared the Bloc 
Quebecois, as the Official Opposition, to the Liberal Party when 
they were the Official Opposition. Let me remind him that he 
should not mix apples with oranges.
<P>
	As the Official Opposition we have been saying right from the 
beginning that in the area of public finances we were reaching 
out to the government to make a democratic effort to launch a 
thorough review of all Canadian finances, not only budgetary 
expenditures, but also tax expenditures.
<P>
	Instead, since the beginning of November, the Minister of 
Finance has gone through an endless round of consultations with 
economists and institutions here and there. In Quebec, we call 
that an acute case of consultationitis. It looks like a strange 
rerun of what we have known since the Meech failure with all 
the other constitutional conferences, forums and discussions. 
Remember the Citizens' Forum on Canada's Future, chaired by 
Mr. Keith Spicer, and the Beaudoin-Dobbie and 
Beaudoin-Edwards commissions. I feel the Minister of Finance 
wants to repeat the same scenario with budgetary and tax 
expenditures instead of implementing a real measure of-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order. The member for Brant would 
also like to ask a question if the member agrees.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> Very well.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> As we have but 90 seconds left, I would 
ask the hon. member for Brant to be very brief, please.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jane Stewart (Brant):</B> Mr. Speaker, I felt compelled to 
respond to a couple of things that the hon. member mentioned in 
his speech.
<P>
	First, I believe he said that we as Liberals talked about our 
health care system as being the best and the least costly. Yes, we 
did talk about it as being the best but certainly not the least 
costly. Our position was that we spend a tremendous amount of 
money on our health care system and our challenge is to make 
sure that we spend it effectively and wisely.
<P>
<B>(1100 ) </B>
<P>
	Second, I would like to ask both the member and his leader a 
question. They have identified or they seem to believe that just 
because we wish to change, improve and make more relevant the 
social safety net we have here in Canada that we will necessarily 
make it more difficult for those less advantaged. I ask the hon. 
member why he assumes that is in fact so.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> Mr. Speaker, the Bloc Quebecois is not opposed 
to improvements to the health system. That is not the point. The 
point is that every time fiscal restraint is being considered, 
health care and social services are prime targets. That is 
absolutely disgusting, totally unacceptable. The Canadian 
system is among the least expensive in the world. Just remember 
how it stood the comparison with the American system. You too 
made that comparison, Mr. Speaker. The Liberals did it also in 
the past, comparing it to the health coverage provided by the 
private system in the States where there is no public health care. 
I do not remember the exact numbers but it was very clear that 
the Canadian system was among the most efficient and the least 
expensive in the world.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="146"> 146 </A></B>
<P>
	Every time there is talk of fiscal reform, of tackling the debt 
or the annual deficit, the main targets, the first ones to be 
singled out are health care and social services. Let us not forget 
that since 1990, the most vulnerable members of society have 
grown in number. Unemployment is on the rise. Job creation 
is not picking up; unemployed workers are losing hope and 
joining the ranks of the non-working population on welfare; 
their number is increasing in Quebec and throughout Canada. 
Let us not forget that. There is a way to get the public finances 
in order-

around our necks if we do not change our attitude now. Our 
children's quality of life depends on it. How can any of us, with

	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
the report he tabled on Wednesday, the Auditor General regrets 
that the government denies access to information on ministers' 
travel expenses. Because of this, the public accounts committee 
is not adequately assured that such information is accurately 
disclosed to Parliament. And we are not talking about small 
amounts. For fiscal year 1990-91, the Auditor General 
estimates the cost of using the administrative flight service to 
$54 million, including some $25 million for ministers' travel 
expenses.
<P>
	And as the Auditor General puts it, and I quote: ``The 
government should conduct a review of the economy, efficiency 
and effectiveness of providing government aircraft to transport 
such users.''
<P>
	This is a clear example of the need to create a parliamentary 
committee to examine spending programs, item by item.

<P>
	First of all, the government is losing hundreds of billions of 
dollars in taxes.

can easily get cigarettes at a lower price than if they were 
reasonably taxed.

we are facing a tax revolt.

governments' tax policy has resulted in a tax regime that is now 
recognized by all to be unfair, unjust, biased, distorted, 
confusing, convoluted and discriminatory.
<P>
	Having completely lost faith in the tax system, Canadians' 
responses include tens of thousands of businesses collecting the 
GST and simply keeping the money, hundreds of thousands of 
Canadians purchasing contraband cigarettes and illegal liquor, 
and perhaps most Canadians participating in the growing 
underground economy where business transactions are 
conducted in cash or through barter to avoid paying tax.
<P>
	This system has created a nation where millions of Canadians 
now consciously and regularly break the law. This has led to a 
serious erosion of our value system.
<P>
	There are many reasons to clean up our tax system and to 
restore Canadians' faith in it. But surely what it is doing to our 
nation's value system ought to make reform of our tax system a 
major priority in the upcoming federal budget.

	<B>Hon. Roger Simmons (Burin-St. George's):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
1.5 million Canadians are unemployed, including 400,000 
young people. They are not too lazy to go to work; there is just 
no work to go to. That is why the Liberal Party during the 
election proposed the infrastructure program, both as a job 
generator and as a way of upgrading transportation and local 
services.
<P>
	I am pleased that the government is moving so quickly to keep 
that promise. There is an agreement to be signed today. Some 
agreements have been signed and others are in the works. That is 
good news for municipalities, but it is great news for the jobless.
<P>
	The infrastructure program will not by itself solve all our 
economic woes, but it is a great start.

proud and honoured at the opportunity to represent the 
constituents of Huron-Bruce in the 35th Parliament of Canada.
<P>
	I want to congratulate the Prime Minister on his first throne 
speech where the priority is on putting Canadians back to work 
from east to west and north to south and not on the Constitution.
<P>
	The Prime Minister has shown Canadians his commitment to 
the promises he made during the election. I was pleased to see 
included in the throne speech a statement on our continued 
commitment to work with financial institutions to improve 
access to capital for such businesses.
<P>
	I am sure all will agree with me that capital is the lifeblood of 
all small and medium sized businesses. Canada has an 
abundance of entrepreneurial talent and innovation. Therefore it 
must be our role as a government to ensure that businesses can 
unleash this talent by providing them with access to capital. 
Without this access Canadian small and medium sized 
businesses will not be able to compete globally, and therefore 
will not be able to create jobs for skilled, hard-working 
Canadians.

the people of Nepean for again placing their trust and confidence

<P>
	Many of the major issues presented to me during the 
campaign have already been implemented by my government. 
Employment and job creation was the number one issue. Where 
would people find jobs? How would they be created? What does 
the future hold for secondary and post-secondary graduates? 
There was also job security for public servants and women and 
pay equity.
<P>
	I heard about over-taxation and that deficit reduction must be 
achieved through a means other than tax increases. I heard from 
mothers at home who believe they are unfairly treated in 
Canada's taxation policies compared to mothers who work. I 
heard from the business community and the high cost of doing 
business due to overtaxation, a crippling GST and unresponsive 
and uncaring banks.
<P>
	The government of Jean Chrétien places honesty and integrity 
as one of its highest priorities and it is a privilege for me to serve 
in this government. Again, my thanks to the people of Nepean.

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
Wednesday in this House, the Minister of Finance said that 
lower cigarette taxes could be considered if the Government of 
Quebec and other governments, a majority of the governments 
concerned, agreed to it. Yesterday, the Government of Ontario 
said that it was open to such a possibility.
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister. In light of the Quebec 
Premier's urgent request and of the openness shown by the 
Government of Ontario, can the Prime Minister tell us if he is 
prepared to review his government's position on this subject?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
said that we were discussing it with the provinces at this time. 
The Minister of Finance has met his provincial counterparts. I 
am glad to see that the Government of Ontario has taken a 
position.
<P>
	Basically some details remain to be discussed and I hope there 
will be some movement but some provincial finance ministers 
said that they did not agree. The Minister of Finance is 
discussing this problem now and, as I said, we want to take the 
necessary action to end cigarette smuggling which is costing 
Canadians a tremendous amount of money and giving the 
impression that people can live in Canada without obeying the 
law of the land. We will act to enforce this country's laws.
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, does the 
Prime Minister realize that his hesitation is the main reason for 
the growing revolt among Quebec convenience store owners?
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order. It is not allowed to show anything in the 
House. It is a small matter, but I know that you want to respect 
tradition.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="150"> 150 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, yes, I respect 
tradition and I will repeat my question so that everyone 
understands it clearly.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister of Canada realize that his hesitation 
on this issue is the main reason for the revolt of convenience 
store owners in Quebec which is growing considerably and 
assuming disturbing proportions?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
is a little surprising that I should have to rise in this House and 
say that I respect the different jurisdictions in Canada, that there 
is a federal government and provincial governments and that I 
do not want to act unilaterally. I am being criticized for not 
being firm enough and not imposing decisions on the provincial 
governments. If the member for Roberval is suggesting to the 
Prime Minister and the federalist that I am that the federal 
government should act unilaterally, that is very welcome from 
the member for Roberval. I will take note of it and use it on 
occasion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Prime 
Minister's interpretation is very revealing and as a third 
question I will ask him this: Does the Prime Minister have such a 
short memory that he does not remember that this week the 
Premier of Quebec was urging him to act by lowering taxes and 
that yesterday the treasurer of Ontario followed suit and asked 
the Prime Minister to act to solve a problem which is creating a 
serious social crisis in Quebec?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member should know that last night the Minister of 
Finance was discussing this problem with the provincial finance 
ministers so it is fresh in our minds. We were talking about it 
yesterday. I spoke about it in this House. We are developing a 
solution with the provincial governments and co-operation is 
required not only on taxation but also on policing; the Solicitor 
General has already met his colleagues or discussed this issue 
with them. This is an example of the federalism which this party 
advocates.
<P>
	It may take a few days more but it is better to do it in harmony 
with everyone. If at some point the federal government must use 
all its powers and impose a solution on the provinces and if the 
Bloc Quebecois asks the federal government to assert itself and 
ignore any objections from the provinces, well, perhaps we will 
do that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
minister of Indian affairs made a rather surprising comment 
yesterday for a minister of a government that claims not to want 
to talk about the Constitution. Indeed, he said yesterday that his 
government was prepared to institute a system of native 
self-government.
<P>
	My question is for the right hon. Prime Minister. Does the 
government not realize that to bring about native 
self-government, the Constitution would need to be amended?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
in fact the commission that has reported is working on this 
problem at this time.
<P>
	An interim report earlier in the year said that it was possible to 
implement self-government for the native population in Canada 
without changing the Constitution and I agree with that.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu):</B> My second question, Mr. 
Speaker, is for my good friend and leading spokesperson for 
federalists in Quebec, the Minister of Foreign Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1125) </B>
<P>
	Are we to understand that constitutional amendments are 
possible in so far as they concern the inherent right of native 
self-government, but that when it comes to overlap, the 
distribution of powers and constitutional issues affecting 
Quebec, amendments are out of the question? Do two of the 
founding peoples have different rights?
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Do you wish to respond?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am not certain if the question was directed to the secretary-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I believe the question was for the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Plamondon:</B> Mr. Speaker, the question was for the 
minister responsible for Quebec and Minister of Foreign 
Affairs.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order, please.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Plamondon:</B> With all due respect, Mr. Speaker, the 
question was directed to the Quebec lieutenant and Minister of 
Foreign Affairs.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Of course, if the Prime Minister wishes to 
respond, by all means he can.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> I know the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs would have been happy to answer the question, 
but unfortunately this matter does not fall within the jurisdiction 
of his department.
<P>
	The hon. minister will surely be happy to answer questions 
during the course of a debate. This being said, I have nothing 
further to add to what I said earlier. Our goal is to treat every 
person in Canada equally because we believe everyone is equal 
in this country and that no one should have a special status.

	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	Reform MPs in this House and the voters we represent are 
disgusted by the abusive use of taxpayers' dollars for the MPs' 
pension plan. In December our leader, the hon. member for 
Calgary Southwest, wrote to the Prime Minister asking him to 
change the plan so that Reform Party MPs or any member of this 
House could opt out. The Prime Minister's reply refers to yet 
another study which will not be complete until mid-July.
<P>
	My question for the Prime Minister is this. Has the 
government not realized that Canadians want action not more 
studies on this matter?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
do not think that we are about to have an election. The next 
election will be probably four or five years from now, so none of 
us is about to benefit from this pension until we have completed 
this term.
<P>
	Therefore I do not see the urgency in that. We said in our red 
book that we would review the pension plan and work on it. We 
have four years to settle this before anyone can qualify for this 
plan. It is a problem that we will deal with and we will have 
legislation before the House.
<P>
	Even if we were to pass the bill today it would not have effect 
until four and a half years from now. Perhaps the hon. member 
can wait a bit and we will have a bill in the House of Commons. 
If he does not want to have a pension plan applying to him I hope 
he will vote in a way that he will not benefit from it. I do not 
want members of Parliament to be in a position where they vote 
against a bill and after that collect.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, a supplementary. Canadians want action on this 
immediately and so do members of Parliament who are making 
contributions to this pension plan today.
<P>
	We would like to know if the government intends to continue 
to force MPs to participate in the MPs' pension plan.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> If the hon. 
member does not want to contribute we can make administrative 
arrangements to make sure he is not contributing and we will 
save-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> But do not come and ask to 
have the portion of the money paid by the federal government 
put somewhere for utilization later on. If you are out, you are 
out.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I sense some uncertainty in the government's position 
on the MPs' pension plan.
<P>
	For the benefit of members' personal financial planning, 
could the Prime Minister tell this House if he will make a 
decision on the MPs' pension plan before or after the 
government moves to limit RRSP contributions?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> The member 
should not be worried at all if he does not contribute. We will 
pay him back the few dollars he would have contributed in the 
first few months. We will not try to make money off of him.
<P>
<B>(1130) </B>
<P>
	I would like to make this statement. When we talk about 
compensation for members, we should realize that every elected 
member of this House makes less than half the salary of the 
worst hockey player in the NHL. Members of Parliament also 
make less than most police chiefs, directors of schools and 
directors of hospitals in Alberta who sometimes make more than 
$120,000 a year.
<P>
	I do not think that members are overpaid. However, if some 
members think they are not worth what they are making we will 
be happy to reduce their salaries.

	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the right hon. Prime Minister. The Prime Minister 
told the House yesterday that he wanted the action brought 
against the Government of Canada by his Minister of National 
Revenue to be withdrawn fully.
<P>
	However, following Question Period yesterday, the Minister 
of National Revenue noted, as reported on page B11 of <I>The 
Gazette</I> today, that he was not the one who could terminate the 
Federal Court appeal division's procedure.
<P>
	That comment made outside the Commons clearly infers that 
he wishes the Crown to drop its case so that he can receive the 
proceeds initially awarded to him.
<P>
	Here is my question: Does the Prime Minister who is himself 
a lawyer recognize that the legal dispute between his Minister of 
National Revenue and the Government of Canada which is 
presently before the Federal Court appeal division is of the exact 
same nature as the case which was discontinued in the first 
instance?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
what I have been told is that the Minister had instructed his 
lawyer to drop the case immediately and that he will not be 
getting any settlement from the government.

will ask his Minister for National Revenue to discontinue his 
appeal of the lower court's decision or else he will ask him to 
leave the cabinet?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> I have nothing 
to add to my answer, Mr. Speaker. The minister has asked that all 
and any proceedings against the crown be discontinued and is 
not expecting any settlement from the government. It could not

	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
also like to put my question to the Prime Minister.
<P>
	Yesterday during debate the government member for 
Davenport suggested that the government should consider 
further limiting RRSP contributions. When asked about the 
possible repeal of the clawback of old age security, a measure 
which his party opposed in opposition, he suggested that 
everyone who pays into seniors' programs like OAS should 
benefit from them.
<P>
	Is this the policy position of the government or are those 
options that the government would be considering?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the Minister of Finance is preparing his budget. Any member of 
this House who wants to make a contribution and express his 
views on any part of the budget is free to do so.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance will look at the member's speech of 
yesterday and make his own decision before the budget comes 
out. That is why we have the House of Commons and why 
members are welcome to express their views. I am happy when 
they express their views because that is democracy. However, it 
is up to the Minister of Finance to decide what will be part of the 
budget. We will know this some time in February.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West):</B> I have a 
supplementary question, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	We appreciate the opportunity to express our views and hope 
that the Prime Minister will use this opportunity to express his 
own views on this subject.
<P>
	Is it the government's policy to go in the direction that we 
increase the dependency of Canadians on the underfunded and 
overburdened old age security system while undercutting their 
ability to provide for their own retirement?
<P>
<B>(1135 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have nothing to add. Everybody in society has to contribute to 
the financing of this government. This party wants to reduce the 
deficit and the debt and we are looking at all the options.
<P>
	This is money earned by a lot of people on which they do not 
pay any tax. That is a way to accumulate money and I have 
nothing against it, but there is no tax paid on the money 
invested. We want to ensure that the system is fair between the 
poor and the rich in our society in relation to the tax system.

	<B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval-Est):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question 
is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs. Upon returning from its 
visit to Chiapas, the Canadian delegation set up by Development 
and Peace met yesterday with the Secretary of State responsible 
for Latin America and informed her of its great concern 
regarding the violation of human rights in that conflict. The 
Secretary of State has evidently downplayed the issue.
<P>
	My first question is: Does the Minister of Foreign Affairs 
share the attitude of his colleague who seems to make light of 
the fact that human rights are being violated in this conflict, 
thereby leading us to believe that Canada is ignoring these 
violations?
<P>
	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I was very disappointed when I read the article in the 
<I>Journal de Montréal</I> of this morning which refers to comments 
made by Mrs. Marthe Lapierre and which probably prompted 
this question. I believe on the contrary that the secretary of state 
paid great attention to the representations made by the 
delegation returning from Mexico.
<P>
	Moreover I must point out that that the secretary of state has 
made public statements which were reported in several 
newspapers-and I am surprised that the hon. member did not 
read those-and which confirm my colleague's great concern 
regarding the respect of human rights. The article published in 
the <I>Journal de Montréal</I> is absolutely unfair to the secretary of 
State.
<P>
	I can assure the hon. member that we on the government side 
are all listening to those who are willing to make suggestions 
concerning this issue. I myself met this morning with the head of 
another delegation, Mr. Ovide Mercredi, and in the next few 
days, we will state on behalf of the government our position 
regarding this issue.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval-Est):</B> Mr. Speaker, I ask the 
minister apart from listening, what specific steps does he intend 
to take to stress to Mexican authorities who, let us not forget, are 
Canada's partners under NAFTA, the vital importance of 
respecting human rights in Mexico?

representations on behalf of the government. I myself have had 
discussions with the Mexican ambassador in Ottawa and I also 
intend to meet her next week. Following those discussions with 
Mexican authorities we believe that they themselves will be 
able to make a decision regarding this issue.

commission was established through the Mexican legislation 
and that President Salinas was adamant that every Mexican

	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is 
for the Minister of National Revenue. The day after the throne 
speech the Auditor General informed Canadians that some $1.8 
billion of GST was overdue and not collected. He also informed 
Canadians that some 576 Canadians had not paid their GST.
<P>
<B>(1140) </B>
<P>
	Could the minister indicate whether those overdue payments 
will be paid or whether they disappear along with the GST?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of National Revenue):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, may I congratulate a very experienced parliamentarian 
on his first presentation in this House. May I assure him that I 
was very pleased to see the Auditor General made clear that 
many of the criticisms from this side of the House when we were 
in opposition of the GST were in fact supported by his report.
<P>
	I would also like to point out that measures have been taken, 
and I refer particularly to a press release I issued three weeks 
after assuming my position as minister to the effect that we 
would enhance enforcement, carry out more audits and have 
more prosecutions. We will continue to do that and I again am 
very happy to find that the Auditor General has supported the 
approach I took back in late November.
<P>
	I can also assure the member that the amount of money 
involved is approximately 4 per cent of the total GST amount 
which is almost comparable to other jurisdictions that have a 
value added tax of this type. I can assure him that while 31 per 
cent of the firms and individuals who should be reporting have 
not done so, many of those individuals are in fact owed money 
by us and on others there is no question of owing anything at all.
<P>
	This would explain for the member the discrepancy between a 
4 per cent figure and a 31 per cent figure in terms of total 
numbers.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a 
supplementary question for the minister. I thank him for the very 
comprehensive and objective answer; it is much appreciated.
<P>
	The minister knows that often when tax levels are too high 
consumers resist paying. Possibly that is one circumstance with 
regard to the GST and taxation in Canada.
<P>
	Could the minister indicate when there is a review of the GST 
and a change of tax whether consideration will be given with all 
sincerity for a reduction of taxation and possibly a remedy to the

<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of National Revenue):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, once again I am in the position of essentially agreeing 
with much that has been said by my hon. friend.
<P>
	The fact is that this side of the House-and indeed I am sure 
both sides of the House-as I mentioned two days ago believes 
tax levels are high and are onerous. We wish to reduce them 
wherever possible.
<P>
	In the examination of the replacement for the GST, which as 
the Prime Minister has indicated will go to a committee of the 
House, I am quite sure the issue of the level of taxation and its 
affect upon the willingness of Canadians to pay and willingness 
to abide by a fair tax system will be discussed by members.
<P>
	I would suggest to the hon. member that the committee of the 
House dealing with the replacement for the GST will probably 
be one of the most important committees of the House. I suggest 
he put his name forward before he is trampled by his fellow 
members in the Reform Party.

	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
speech from the throne as well as various statements by 
Ministers seem to indicate that a reform of unemployment 
insurance will be presented with a view to reducing cost which 
will mean a reduction in accessibility and in payments to the 
unemployed.
<P>
	My question is to the Minister of Human Resources 
Development since he said yesterday that this was his first 
target. Will the government assure us today that they will not 
raise again unemployment insurance premiums in 1994?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification): </B>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member knows that 
through the speech from the throne I indicated that a number of 
issues needed to be examined such as the important matter of 
restruc-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="154"> 154 </A></B>
<P>
turing our social security net.  This includes unemployment 
insurance. Indeed, I announced before Christmas a freeze on 
unemployment insurance premiums, an initiative which should 
go a long way toward ensuring stability for small businesses.
<P>
<B>(1145) </B>
<P>
	So, between now and 1995 when another UI premium 
structure will come in effect we will have a two-year period of 
stability. I hope the hon. member will support that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> I have a 
supplementary question, Mr. Speaker. Should we understand 
that the Liberal Party deliberately duped and misled the Quebec 
people when a few short months ago in opposition they 
vehemently denounced Bill C-113 proposed by the 
Conservative government of the day because it was aimed at 
reducing accessibility and the amount of money paid to 
unemployed workers?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would suggest the hon. member 
may want to take a look at his remarks when they appear in 
<I>Hansard</I>, because I think he was in breach of the rules of the 
House by suggesting that we deliberately mislead anybody. That 
has certainly never been the intention of this party or this 
government.
<P>
	Clearly what we were faced with when we took office was a 
decision by the past government to raise the level of premiums. 
That was already in the statutes; it had already been decided. We 
in fact reduced that to its bare minimum so that the actual raise 
was only 2.3 per cent for this year. To live up to the commitment 
we had made and that we undertook we froze the premiums for 
the entire year of 1995 so small businesses will have the 
two-year stability of a constant premium rate. That will give 
them the kind of incentive and stimulation they need to go out 
and create jobs.
<P>
	In the meantime, if he and his colleagues were prepared to 
work with us and collaborate with us on a broad review of our 
social programs we would be able to take a look at the issue of 
payroll tax and give a real sense of hope not only to the 
unemployed but to the business people who would give them 
jobs.

question is for the Minister of Justice.
<P>
	January 15 marked the deadline for submissions from all 
Canadians recommending changes to the Young Offenders Act. 
Will the minister provide a detailed report of his findings from 
these submissions to all members of Parliament?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, my hon. friend has quite 
properly pointed out that the submissions have been received by 
the Department of Justice. They are now under review. As the 
hon. member might appreciate it will take us some time to 
evaluate them and to draw conclusions.
<P>
	I can assure my hon. friend, though, that the entire question of 
the youth justice system is under active review. As we made 
clear in the speech from the throne our commitment is to 
enhance community safety and the justice system in general, 
including youth justice, so the entire statute is very much a 
matter of priority for the department.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose):</B> I have a supplementary 
question, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	As we all well know the Young Offenders Act has been under 
question for quite some time. Could the minister give us an 
indication of when we could expect action that would change the 
Young Offenders Act, something that Canadians everywhere 
want done immediately?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member will recall 
that during the course of the election campaign the Liberal Party 
made clear in its platform that it proposed specific changes to 
the Young Offenders Act. Those changes included longer 
sentences for violent crime, creating the category of dangerous 
youth offender, releasing information when it was in the 
interests of the community to do so, and changes of that kind.
<P>
	I can assure my hon. friend, and I take this opportunity to 
assure the House, that when I speak next week in the debate on 
the speech from the throne I will be elaborating upon our plans 
with respect to the Young Offenders Act and the criminal justice 
system in general. I can also assure him that included in our 
plans at present are measures in the short term to implement the 
undertakings we made during the campaign.

	<B>Mr. Joe Comuzzi (Thunder Bay-Nipigon):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Minister of Agriculture.
<P>
	Canadian taxpayers subsidize the movement of grain in 
Canada by approximately $720 million a year. This subsidy is 
paid directly to the railways and I might say that the subsidy is 
abused. As an example, to qualify by regulation for the subsidy 
grain destined for the U.S. market must first go to Thunder Bay. 
Then from Thunder Bay it is shipped somewhere out west and 
eventually gets to the market to which it is destined. This is an 
abuse of the system. It distorts the cost of shipping grain in this 
country.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="155"> 155 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1150) </B>
<P>
	Would the Minister of Agriculture consult with the Minister 
of Transport to stop the flagrant abuse of taxpayers' money 
through this subsidy immediately? Would he then consider 
removing the subsidy paid directly to the railways? If there is to 
be a subsidy on grain in this country perhaps it could be paid to 
the farmers to whom it rightfully belongs.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
question. Obviously the issue of grain transportation, and in 
particular the Western Grain Transportation Act, is a subject 
that is under active consideration by this government.
<P>
	The previous government had established a number of 
processes that will result in a series of reports we expect to 
receive during the early part of this year, specifically on grain 
transportation efficiencies.
<P>
	In the member's question he has pointed out a fairly glaring 
example of an inefficiency in the system. We await that report 
on grain transportation efficiencies. We also await a report on 
the method of payment under the Western Grain Transportation 
Act conducted by a producer payment panel.
<P>
	While we as a new government are by no means bound by 
processes started by a previous government, we are anxious to 
receive this input. We will be making our decisions in due 
course.

question is directed to the Minister of the Environment. On 
September 7, 1970, a tanker, the <I>Irving Whale</I>, sank off the 
Magdalen Islands. Over time, corrosion by salt water caused the 
ship to leak its cargo.
<P>

the Minister of the Environment have a specific plan to avert 
this disaster?

his concern about reports of a suspected leak from the tanker 
when geese were found on the shores of the Magdalen Islands.
<P>
	I personally visited the Magdalen Islands during the election 
campaign, and I am aware that this particular area is a favourite 
destination for tourists. Since I have a particular interest in the 
tourism industry on Prince  Edward Island, I am working very

financial solution to a problem that, of course, predates current 
federal standards in this respect.

federal legislation governing the difficulties that we face when 
ships sink. In that regard I am working very closely with my

solution to a problem that we both recognize.

<P>
	The failure of the Charlottetown accord even among

people of Canada could not support undefined aboriginal

<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development):</B> Mr. Speaker, not only would I give that 
commitment, I think that should be the commitment of every 
one who comes to this House.
<P>
	Sovereignty is not in question. What is in question is how we 
take inherent right and develop it into something that is 
workable. I think the process of discussion over the next six

Canada well.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of National Defence and 
Veterans Affairs and involves household moves by the 
government which cost over $100 million a year. The moves are 
managed by an interdepartmental committee chaired by 
National Defence.
<P>
	I understand that the previous government authorized the 
conduct of pilot projects with two private sector companies to 
see if savings could be made.
<P>
	Would the government seriously examine the proposals to 
privatize its move management services to see if they are 
feasible and if any further savings can be made on behalf of the 
taxpayers of Canada?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Michael Collenette (Minister of National 
Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
congratulate the hon. member on asking his first question.
<P>
	The issue he raises with us has been raised by a number of 
members from other parties as well. The House should be 
informed that earlier last year the former government did solicit 
proposals for privatization of move management services.
<P>
	Of the six bids received only one was compliant with the 
government's requirements. Independent accountants have 
found that the compliant bidder's costs were several million 
dollars greater than the government's costs.
<P>
	I should inform the House that only 10 days before the 
election former ministers in the Conservative government 
directed the conduct of two pilot projects without authorization, 
one with a firm whose costs were millions more than the 
government's and the other one with a company whose bid was 
found to be non-compliant. As soon as we took office we 
cancelled this authority to conduct the pilot project. That is the 
way business was done under the Tories. That is not the way we 
are going to do business.

Ches Carter.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="THELATESENATORCHESLEYCARTER">THE LATE SENATOR CHESLEY CARTER</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Roger Simmons (Burin-St. George's):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it was the fall of 1973 and I was for the very first time seeking 
public political office. I went to a community, an island called 
Pass Island off the south coast of Newfoundland, an island that 
has since been resettled. In those days it had a couple of hundred 
people.
<P>
	Pass Island produced a very famous man by the name of Major 
Ches Carter. Ches Carter distinguished himself in many ways, 
first by serving overseas with the Royal Newfoundland 
Regiment during the first world war during which he was 
gassed, placed among the terminally ill in a hospital in England 
and left to die. He did not. He came back and had a distinguished 
career in education in Newfoundland. Come the second world 
war we found Ches Carter back on the battlefields of Europe. 
This time it was with the Canadian army, a full 10 years before 
Newfoundland and Canada had become one country.
<P>
	He came back from there and picked up his education career. 
In 1949 Ches Carter was one of the original seven men who came 
here as the first members of Parliament from Newfoundland 
after Confederation. He was elected again and again, a total of 
seven times, the last time having been in the 1965 election and 
then in 1966 he was appointed to the Senate.
<P>
	Ches Carter died last week at the age of 91 in Nova Scotia. He 
leaves us a great legacy. I am pleased to stand as the successor 
member for Burin-Burgeo, as it was then called, and now 
Burin-St. George's, but essentially the same piece of 
geography with a little bit tacked on from time to time.
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	There have only been four members for Burin-St. George's 
or Burin-Burgeo. They are the late Ches Carter, my late friend 
the Hon. Don Jamieson, Joe Price who sat here from 1984 to 
1988 and of course myself.
<P>
	I realize that there is only one member sitting in this House 
today who was here during the time of Ches Carter, but that is of 
course entirely beside the point. If we come here and serve our 
people well then it is not necessary for all the people we serve 
with to be around forever to remember our deeds and Ches 
Carter is proof of that. If one does well while one is here and if 
one is true to those who sent one here then the legacy one leaves 
will be the memory one leaves.
<P>
	Ches's legacy is a very important one. I looked through the 
<I>Hansard</I> index for 1960 and 1961. Yes, he was fighting about 
foreign draggers inside the three-mile limit. I am still fighting 
that one. He was talking about atomic radiation hazards and 
trade with Cuba. I could go on. There was page after page of 
intervention by an obviously active member.
<P>
	Time does not permit me to even capsule the impact he had 
here, but let me give one clear example with which many will be 
able to very quickly identify. Having been a veteran with the 
Royal Newfoundland Regiment in the first world war and in the 
Canadian army in the second world war, he had a particular 
interest in and knowledge of military matters and the legacy the 
war had left for those people who sometimes came back maimed 
and often without appropriate training to plug back into civilian 
life.
<P>
	Ches Carter's battle was non-stop. His battle was non-stop in 
the interest of veterans in general and in particular the foresters 
who went out in the thousands from Newfoundland and eastern 
Canada to do their bit not in a military uniform but on behalf of 
the war effort. For many years after the war they were left 
without benefits because technically they were not military 
although they had gone overseas and had been exposed in many 
ways to some of the same dangers, certainly the deprivation and 
isolation of being away from home and so on.
<P>
	It was Ches Carter who led the battle on that one. It was Ches 
Carter who after a long time won the battle. He saw to it that the 
battle was won on behalf of the foresters in the context of having 
them recognized for benefits under the veterans program.
<P>
	In concluding let me on behalf of all Canadians, this 
Parliament and the Parliaments before it, salute a very great 
man, a very great Newfoundlander and a very great Canadian. 
Let me also say, on behalf of the House, our condolences, yes, 
but also our thanks for a life well served to his wife Elsie, to 
Alan his son and to his two daughters.

Mr. Speaker, I just wanted to add a few words to that of my 
colleague about Ches Carter. He and I sat together here in the 
back two rows when I first came here. Ches Carter was a very 
humble man. He had been in both world wars as my colleague 
has stated. He was a great champion of veterans. He went to bat 
for them and was responsible I am sure for some of the 
amendments to the veterans legislation in Canada.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="158"> 158 </A></B>
<P>
	Ches Carter also exemplified a man who had been a citizen 
of Newfoundland prior to it becoming part of Canada. He then 
got into the federal scene and came here as a member from 
Newfoundland and was highly respected in this House.
<P>
	I want to extend our sincere appreciation to him for the work 
that he did on behalf of veterans across Canada and for his 
service in two world wars. He exemplifies very responsible 
Canadian citizenship and will be long remembered by those of 
us who knew him and should be long remembered by those 
Canadians for whom he made such a contribution.
<P>
	I want to extend my condolences to his family. I thank them 
for allowing him to be part of this place and of the Canadian 
nation, to come forward to display his strength through humility 
for the improvement of veterans in Canada and to make his mark 
for the military forces in this country. He is an example for many

slow to recognize: that our environmental and economic goals 
can and must support each other.
<P>
	Nowhere is that more evident than in our country's 
environmental industry. This is one of the fastest growing 
economic sectors, with some 4,500 firms employing 150,000 
people. Its annual sales are now approximately $11 billion and 
this figure is expected to double by the year 2000. By that year 
the global market for environmental technology, products and 
services will reach over $500 billion. Canada wants to be on the 
cutting edge of that green market.

	What we have here is a Canadian success story and we must 
build on it. Mr. Speaker, this government is wasting no time in 
doing that. With my colleague, the Minister of Industry, I am 
pleased to announce that next Monday, January 24, we will 
begin the first of a series of public consultations with the aim of 
developing a Canadian Environmental Industry Strategy.
<P>
	The consultations in Montreal, Halifax, Winnipeg, Toronto, 
Vancouver and Edmonton are being organized in close 
co-operation with the provincial chapters of the Canadian 
Environmental Industry Association. We hope that they will 
give us an opportunity to meet and share views with 
representatives of all groups who can help to shape a winning 
strategy for Canada.
<P>
<B>(1215) </B>
<P>
	As a focus for the discussions, we have prepared a paper 
entitled ``Environmental Industry Strategy for Canada''. This 
contains initial proposals for a partnership between the public 
and private sectors, a joint venture that will substantially 
increase Canada's share of the domestic and international 
markets for environmental industry.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="159"> 159 </A></B>
<P>
	We already know what must be the key elements of such a 
strategy: increased funding for research and development, 
increased support for business, especially small and 
medium-sized enterprises, and better environmental standards, 
policies and programs. These are all priorities of the Canadian 
government and they received mention in Tuesday's speech 
from the throne.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We also have another priority. That is to ensure that every 
member of this House has a hand in helping to shape these 
strategies. We would welcome the participation of the 
representatives of the Reform Party and the Bloc Quebecois in 
participating in these meetings next week which are the very 
beginning of a new strategy to help Canada take advantage of 
our world market for environmental technologies.
<P>
	We face the challenge of acting on those priorities to advance 
the environmental industry sector in Canada. We intend to listen 
carefully to all consultations. I can say that on the government 
side of the House we have a number of members who are 
specifically interested in this issue. We will use the input we 
receive to forge an effective strategy that promotes our 
country's economy and our environment.
<P>
	The Minister of Industry and I are very happy to be working in 
close co-operation with the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of the Environment, the hon. member for 
Lachine-Lac-Saint-Louis, and with the Secretary of State for 
Science, Research and Development, the hon. member for 
Portage-Interlake who is taking a special interest in industrial 
and environmental technologies.
<P>
	Our departments' and our government's twin goals are 
sustained job growth and a clean healthy environment. Green 
industries will play a growing part in helping us reach those 
goals.
<P>
	An environmental industry strategy can help us act on 
pollution prevention. It can help us build green infrastructure in 
industries and it can and must help create the high-tech jobs we 
desperately need in those areas. That is the best way of 
guaranteeing a prosperous country, a healthy environment, and a 
realistic and brighter future for the Canadian economy and for 
Canada as a whole.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
indeed essential that all intervenors in this area be consulted 
prior to developing a comprehensive government strategy. The 
environment as such transcends partisan concerns and it is in 
fact incumbent on all nations to work together to find solutions 
to the pressing problems confronting us today.
<P>
	I applaud this initiative by the government and the Minister of 
the Environment to include the industry and environment 
ministers in these consultations. It is indeed vital to examine 
these particular aspects of the issues we  are being asked to 
consider. Instead of wishful thinking that is out of touch with our 
present day lives, the environment needs realistic and effective 
policies that will ensure sustainable development.
<P>
	The environmental industry is one of the sectors that are 
crucial to our future economic development and the government 
must do everything in its power to promote the growth of this 
industry. The consultations with the provincial chapters of the 
Canadian Environmental Industry Association are essential in 
this respect. In the past, Quebecers and Canadians have too often 
been exposed to government strategies that were unrealistic and 
far removed from local needs.
<P>
<B>(1220) </B>
<P>
	The government should listen to the various groups, draw up a 
strategy and then provide the necessary resources to meet the 
objectives set forth in the course of the consultation process.
<P>
	Ministers should listen to what the people have to say and not 
view these consultations as a media event.
<P>
	The minister mentioned the importance of developing this 
industry, and I agree. However, this commitment should be 
followed by proposals that provide an effective framework for 
this enterprise.
<P>
	Promoting the environmental industry is all very well, but it 
should not be seen as merely a way to silence criticism from 
environmental groups in Quebec and Canada.
<P>
	We also want to warn the federal government and the 
environment minister that public consultations are useless 
unless recommendations are acted upon.
<P>
	The environment minister knows that I will monitor these 
consultations very closely and ensure that any useful proposals 
that may result are implemented by the government as soon as 
possible.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East):</B> Mr. Speaker, I stand today 
in response to the statement by the Minister of the Environment.
<P>
	Before commenting on her presentation I would like to 
express my sincere congratulations on your election, Mr. 
Speaker. The process with which you were elected provided an 
indication of the new, more innovative atmosphere of this 
House. Certainly the first days of this sitting have shown your 
fresh approach.
<P>
	The Reform Party intends to approach all issues raised in this 
Chamber with a three-step process. First we express support for 
the positive, then concern about potential areas for 
improvement, and finally constructive alternatives.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="160"> 160 </A></B>
<P>
	It has been instructive in reviewing the Reform Party blue 
sheet of principles, policies and election platform that there is 
in fact a strong parallel to the direction and intent expressed 
by the Liberals in their red book.
<P>
	Of course we support public consultations in that we believe 
concerned Canadians are very intelligent and have already 
thought out many of the issues of concern with respect to the 
environment.
<P>
	We also wish to commend the government on the speed with 
which it is initiating this process. It is unfortunate that with the 
arrangements which have been made, we received official notice 
of this yesterday. I received the details at about 9.30 this 
morning. Unfortunately therefore, the Reform Party will be 
unable to respond to the very kind invitation of the minister to 
take part in this process.
<P>
	We do have some areas of concern when the minister uses the 
terms such as increased funding and increased support.
<P>
	Where the Reform Party differs significantly from the 
policies outlined in the Liberal red book is that we note on pages 
67 and 68 of their red book they speak of funding research and 
development for green technologies, commitment of new 
government funding and consultation of incentive and support 
programs.
<P>
	We have learned from history with boondoggles like the 
scientific research tax credit program introduced by a prior 
Liberal government and ongoing regional development grants 
and special tax incentives that there is frequently abuse, pork 
barrelling and outright waste of resources that Canada no longer 
has.
<P>
	The Reform Party will therefore be watching very carefully 
what impact this initiative will have on the government's out of 
control overspending. We will also be interested to see what 
economies it will put into effect even on its country-wide tour 
next week. What new thrift style will the government bring to 
the actual public consultation process? For example, will its 
members be travelling by regularly scheduled airlines?
<P>
	We put the government on notice. We will be looking for a 
statement of expenses incurred for this process and would 
expect a cost benefit analysis on the expenditure.
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>
<P>
	In summary, the Reform Party stands committed to ensuring 
that all Canadians and their descendants dwell in a clean and 
healthy environment and supports the federal government 
taking leadership in developing a new discipline integrating 
economics and the environment.
<P>
	We also commend the minister on the speedy implementation 
of this process early in this government's life.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Riis:</B> I rise on a point of order, Mr. Speaker. I appreciate 
the standing orders do not permit me to respond to the minister, 
but I simply want to say that we  appreciate this statement being 
made in the House announcing this new government initiative.
<P>
	Coming on the tails of what the House leader was saying the 
other day, that there would be a number of debates on important 
policy issues in the House of Commons to which members can 
contribute, I simply want to say-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I thank the hon. member for not getting into 
debate or answering.

	The previous government made cuts in social housing and 
today people in my riding and in neighbouring ones are turning 
to the House of Commons because the federal government froze 
the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation budget for the 
next five years while asking it to save money to help young 
couples.
<P>
	The petitioners are asking Parliament to forego any rent 
increase in social housing and to lift the freeze on the Canada 
Mortgage and Housing Corporation budget in order to build new 
social and co-op housing, especially in east Montreal.

	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, pursuant to Standing Order 36 the attached petition is 
certified correct. It is signed by many people from the greater 
Toronto area.
<P>
	The undersigned residents of Canada humbly ask and draw the 
attention of the House to the following. As a consequence of the 
death, separation or divorce of their children, grandparents are 
often denied access to their grandchildren by their guardians. 
The relationship that exists between grandparents and 
grandchildren is a natural, fundamental one. Denial of access 
could constitute elder abuse and could have a serious 
detrimental emotional impact on both the grandparents and the 
grandchildren. Several provincial jurisdictions, including the 
Quebec 
<P>

<B><A NAME="161"> 161 </A></B>
<P>
civil code, contain a provision to  ensure the right of access of 
grandparents to their grandchildren.
<P>
	Therefore the petitioners request that the Parliament amend 
the Divorce Act to include a provision similar to article 6(11) of 
the Quebec civil code which states: ``In no case may a father or 
mother without serious cause place obstacles between a child 
and grandparents and failing agreement between the parties the 
modalities of the relations are settled by the court''.
<P>
	Further, an amendment to the Divorce Act would give a 
grandparent who is granted access to a child the right to make 
inquiries and to be given information as to the health, education 
and welfare of the child.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion for an 
address to His Excellency the Governor General in reply to his 
Speech at the opening of the session; and of the amendment.
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
want to congratulate you on your election as Speaker of this 
House.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Some members will know that it was the Speaker who as much 
as anyone played a role in my coming to this place and I am so 
pleased to be here under his direction as Speaker. I have every 
confidence that you, Sir, will perform your task in a way which 
is going to bring great honour to this place and to the role that 
you hold.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I would also want to thank my constituents of Ottawa South 
for re-electing me on October 25. It is a great honour for me to 
represent them here, in the House of Commons. It is also an 
honour to have been appointed minister. But the greatest honour 
of all is to have this opportunity to serve the people of Ottawa 
South.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I think for all of us the greatest honour is to be able to 
represent our peers in the House of Commons. This is a place 
rich in history and tradition. The role that we play here I believe 
is very important. I believe it to be a great honour and a great 
privilege to be servants of the people.
<P>
	Politicians have been given a bad name and we are all 
conscious of that and Mr. Speaker in his opening comments to us 
upon his election alluded to it.
<P>
	I think what we need to reinforce is that after all is said the 
role of politician is not something of which we should be 
ashamed. The role of a politician is to be a servant. To be a 
politician is to wear a badge of honour because after all we are 
here as servants of the people who sent us. That to me is a very 
great badge of honour.
<P>
	I would also like to express my appreciation to the Prime 
Minister for the confidence he has placed in me in asking me to 
serve as his Minister of Industry. What I hope to do in these few 
moments is to outline some of the ideas I take with me into this 
portfolio as I undertake the work which was given to me. Much 
of my mandate has been made clear I believe.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The red book stressed the importance of job creation and 
economic growth, and in the throne speech we again emphasized 
the importance of economic growth.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The people who sent me here talked to me about a lot of 
things. What I heard repeatedly was the concern they have for 
jobs, if not jobs for themselves personally then very often jobs 
for their children or their neighbours. How many times I have 
heard people say: ``I have adult children who are trained, 
qualified and skilled but they cannot find work''.
<P>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
	I believe the heavy weight of despair the recession of 1990 
brought to bear on our people is one of the things that all of us 
were elected to address in a very direct and positive way. What 
we have to do is very clear. We need strategies to follow. We 
need strategies to create jobs. We need strategies to encourage 
growth in the economy.
<P>
	Part of that strategy obviously has to be the tackling of 
obstacles because there are obstacles to overcome as we launch 
this new phase of economic growth. I know no one on this side is 
unaware of the unhappy circumstance when this week we passed 
$500 billion in federal indebtedness. The burden of debt we are 
carrying as a country, not just at the federal level but also at the 
provincial and municipal levels, is something which no 
government regardless of its political stripe or ideology can fail 
to consider.
<P>
	I have encountered questions about whether worry about the 
deficit did not indicate a certain political bent to one side of the 
spectrum. I cannot agree with that. Our colleagues from the New 
Democratic party who govern in three provinces in Canada are 
frequently engaged in discussions about how to deal with the 
serious problems of provincial indebtedness. Our colleagues 
from Conservative governments in some of the provinces are 
likewise faced with tackling those problems.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="162"> 162 </A></B>
<P>
	We are also faced with a slow economic recovery this time.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The fact that the recession that started in 1990 dragged on for 
so long is an indication that our economy is undergoing 
fundamental changes.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This is not just like the last recession. What we have 
encountered is a fundamental change in our economy. There is a 
restructuring whereby many companies are rebuilding on the 
basis of downsizing. We have seen a significant reduction in 
employment even while economic growth is beginning again. 
That in turn has caused what can only be described as a crisis of 
confidence, particularly among consumers.
<P>
	If we look at the tracking of graphs as we grow out of the past 
recession and compare them to the tracking after the recession 
of the early 1980s what can be seen indicates the lack of 
consumer confidence which has been prolonging this recession. 
There are very low numbers in residential housing for example 
and in consumption of durable goods.
<P>
	Consumers do not have confidence. Why? It is because not 
only do we have a high rate of unemployment of 11 plus per cent 
but we are also faced with the fact that virtually 40 per cent of 
the people who have jobs are concerned they are going to lose 
them. Where can we inspire confidence to begin to build again?
<P>
	Internal trade barriers. I am talking again about obstacles that 
we have to overcome. Can it be explained to me why in Canada 
our regime of international trade is roughly equivalent to what 
the GATT provided internationally back in the late 1940s? What 
makes it so hard to us to break down the barriers of trade among 
our own Canadian provinces? We do not have a big market in the 
world. Our domestic market based on population is roughly the 
size of the state of California. Yet we have created these 
obstacles among us to take that already small market and make it 
even smaller. We like 10 little markets instead of putting 
together one medium sized market which would enable us to 
compete in the world.
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I have to say we have made headway in that area during the 
meeting held this week in Ottawa by the Minister of Industry 
and the Minister of Economic Development. There is a great 
common will among the ministers to find effective means of 
removing trade barriers between Canadian provinces.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We now have a fixed schedule. We will have a preliminary 
draft agreement of an internal trade agreement by February 14, 
Valentine's day. We hope that will be further transformed by 
provincial negotiators into a draft agreement for consideration 
by ministers by the end of March. We are working on a strict and 
tight  timetable on this file and we have enormous good will 
among all provincial governments and the federal government 
to tackle this obstacle.
<P>
	It can create jobs, not just because of the encouragement of 
trade within Canada, but the fact that we have these internal 
barriers is a deterrent to foreign investment. Why? It is because 
under our international treaties it is just as easy to trade into 
Canada from the United States, in fact it is easier, than it is to 
trade within Canada across provincial boundaries. Why are we 
penalizing ourselves in this way? It simply does not make sense. 
I am hopeful that this process toward progress on this file will 
continue very rapidly.
<P>
	In addition to attacking obstacles we have to build on our 
strengths. It is reflected clearly in the red book and also in the 
speech from the throne that one of the strengths in this country 
we have to build on is the small business sector. There are 
900,000 small and medium sized enterprises in this country. If 
we could enable them each to hire one Canadian then our 
unemployment problem would no longer be upon us.
<P>
	For that reason I think the efforts the Canadian Chamber of 
Commerce has under way to identify how to create one million 
jobs in Canada is something we in government ought to 
encourage and support. It is the kinds of partnerships we can 
build with the private sector, business organizations, labour 
organizations and others that are going to enable us to overcome 
obstacles and build on some of our strengths.
<P>
	Small business has told us pretty clearly what problems they 
face. They are the masters or the creators of 80 per cent of the 
new jobs in Canada. Yet they tell us repeatedly-my colleague 
from Broadview-Greenwood has borne eloquent testimony to 
this-they cannot get adequate capital or financing to do what 
they want to do to create jobs.
<P>
	We must find a way to bring our financial institutions to bear 
all of their resources on how to solve this problem of inadequate 
capital in small and medium sized business. I am not so sure we 
do it by passing laws and making rules but we are working very 
directly with financial institutions and trying to see what it is 
that makes it so hard to provide adequate capital for small 
business, in particular small businesses that are engaged in the 
process of developing and marketing new technologies. I will 
say a little more about the innovative economy in a few minutes.
<P>
	I can understand why it is difficult. How does one secure debt 
against knowledge? A knowledge based enterprise finds it 
difficult, however, to get the capital resources it needs in order 
to build foreign markets, to do research and development, to get 
the kinds of sales it needs and to finance those sales over 
development periods. These are problems we are going to have 
to tackle.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="163"> 163 </A></B>
<P>
	Small and medium sized business needs technology. 
Technology diffusion has to be the key to building a more active 
and more aggressive small and medium sized business sector. 
It is clear in the studies that have been done that growing small 
business means adequate capital, adequate access to new and 
existing technologies, good marketing and management skills. 
Those are the keys. There are no secrets here.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	The question is: How do we help small business in achieving 
the things that it knows?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It is clear to us that the small and medium-sized businesses 
are the key to the economic recovery that, I believe, we are all 
waiting for.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We also need to concentrate our efforts on building a new and 
innovative economy. Canada is a very blessed country. We enjoy 
enormous prosperity and have over many years. Why? It is 
largely because we find ourselves in a country that is rich in 
natural resources. We built our prosperity on resources we were 
able to access easily and that the world wanted to buy from us for 
very good prices.
<P>
	During the war my predecessor, whose desk I am proud to sit 
at in my ministry, C. D. Howe, built the Canadian manufacturing 
economy to meet the needs of the war. After the war, he was able 
to transform it to peaceful purposes behind tariff barriers.
<P>
	At a time when Europe was flattened and when the new 
competition we now face in Asia was virtually non-existent, 
Canada was able to build a strong manufacturing based 
economy. There we were as we came through the 1950s and 
1960s. With strong sales of natural resources, high prices and a 
good manufacturing base, things were going well for us. It 
looked like it would never end.
<P>
	Today the problems that we face in some ways reflect upon the 
very strengths that we had in those decades. It was easy for us to 
be prosperous at that time relative to many other countries that 
had to build their war-torn economies up from the ground.
<P>
	Now we find that our cheapest natural resources have been 
sold off. It becomes more expensive for us to acquire them 
whether they are from the forests or the mines. The fish are 
gone. Agriculture is becoming tough and competitive. Our 
manufacturing economy that was built up during and after the 
war is finding that change is overtaking it.
<P>
	The rebirth of Europe in the 1960s and 1970s was tough 
competition. Now we have the emergence in Asia of strong 
manufacturing based economies. These are the problems we 
face. What do we do now?
<P>
	We need to find the innovation and the change that will enable 
us to compete against these companies in places around the 
world. If I can put it in a phrase, my objective as Minister of 
Industry is to make the Canadian business sector synonymous 
with quality and innovation. It is by emphasizing these two 
characteristics that we are going to regain our place in the world. 
That will be the key to our economic growth.
<P>
	Some people think governments do not play a role in these 
things. They think one just stands back and lets the world unfold 
as it is going to. That is wrong. Government plays a very 
important role in this. Government has to play a role solving 
some of the problems we talked about earlier. Government also 
has to play a role itself in not being an obstacle.
<P>
	We are prepared to work with provincial governments to 
ensure that whatever burdens are being placed on business can 
be reduced. As an initiative of this government we want to work 
with the provinces to reduce duplication and overlap.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	As the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs said, overlap is 
indeed a concern for the government.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We are prepared through strategic investments, through the 
Canada Investment Fund, through the creation of technology 
networks and by giving leadership on issues like the electronic 
highway to help the Canadian business sector to move forward 
into the 21st century.
<P>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
	The information highway is a good example of the fact that 
government has a role to play. We saw Vice President Gore in the 
last weeks make a major statement on what the information 
highway can mean and look like in the United States. We have to 
play a leadership role in defining what this highway is to look 
like, how it is to help Canadian business move forward into the 
future.
<P>
	We have some advantages here as a country which is so huge 
geographically and so sparsely populated. We have built 
strengths in telecommunications and in satellite 
communications, despite what may have happened to Anik. 
Those who want to watch it on Newsworld will have to miss it 
for today.
<P>
	However, there are strengths that our Canadian industrial base 
has within it that will tie perfectly to the rapid explosion of the 
information technologies. One of the roles of government is to 
provide the necessary leadership. We want to help find ways in 
which the regulatory regime should be structured to encourage 
the right level of competition of Canadian ownership. Those are 
two of our goals. We will see to it that we are in the  right place to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="164"> 164 </A></B>
<P>
encourage pilot projects to see how this new technology 
infrastructure is going to work.
<P>
	We are playing a role, for example, in the Canary project 
which is tying research facilities across Canada together. We 
recently had the pleasure of announcing in Ottawa-Carleton 
the establishment of the OCI net which is a measure to provide 
what will ultimately be a node on the information highway 
which is to come.
<P>
	These are exciting possibilities. There are many more to 
come. We have a role to play. We need to remove the obstacles 
that impede economic development. We need to build on our 
strengths. Canada is a marvellous country. We believe in it. We 
can overcome the obstacles as we have in the past and we can 
build on our strengths.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger)</B> Before proceeding to the 
10 minutes of questions and comments, I wish to inform the 
House that pursuant to Standing Order 33(2)(b) because of the 
ministerial statement, Government Orders will be extended by 
13 minutes.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We will open questions and comments with the hon. member 
for Québec-Est.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
thank you very much. I am very pleased to be able to speak for 
the first time in this hon. Chamber, the symbol of democracy in 
Canada.
<P>
	I believe that I am the last Bloc member to speak for the first 
time, but that does not take anything away from the importance I 
attach to my maiden speech or from the pleasure it gives me.
<P>
	I am also especially honoured to be the member for 
Québec-Est and to represent that riding. I take the opportunity, 
as many of us have already done, to thank my constituents who 
had the good judgment to elect me as their member. I have the 
honour to represent a very beautiful riding in Quebec City and to 
have won by 21,000 votes. This is an impressive victory, all the 
more so since I ran against a very well-known personality in 
Quebec whose name I will not mention in this House.
<P>
	I am a new member who intends to be a good MP and to 
represent his riding well. I come back to what the Minister of 
Industry said. I appreciated it as an opening. He said that we 
have an important responsibility to be honourable, to be sincere, 
to work hard because we have heavy responsibilities, and that is 
what I intend to do. I intend to do that for my constituents, 
especially since most of them voted for the Bloc knowing full 
well that we are a sovereignist party. I believe firmly in this 
option and I think that I will therefore defend it with great zeal 
and gusto.
<P>
<B>(1255) </B>
<P>
	I would also like to take the opportunity to raise a point which 
has not yet been raised and that surprises me a lot. We have had 
many discussions to date on the relative merits of Canada versus 
Quebec, as they relate to the question of sovereignty, and no one 
has yet spoken about the rights of francophones outside Quebec.
<P>
	I would have liked the Speaker to be here today, not only to 
congratulate him on his election, and I take the opportunity, Mr. 
Deputy Speaker, to congratulate you on your appointment. 
Nevertheless, I would have liked him to be here because he is a 
Franco-Ontarian. I have had a chance to discuss the issue of 
francophones outside Quebec with the Speaker, because he 
comes from Ontario, as I do. I am a native of Ontario myself.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I was born in Ontario.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
That is why I am a sovereignist today: I was a francophone 
outside Quebec and I know the situation they are in.
<P>
	If there is one thing that I will mention and emphasize in this 
House, it is the abuses and injustices which francophones 
outside Quebec have suffered. Many people talked about the 
virtues of Canada, like the Minister of Foreign Affairs and 
others yesterday and the day before, but I did not have a chance 
to answer. Now I will give my reply.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> I rise on a point of 
order, Mr. Speaker. I just need some clarification. We had the 
Minister of Industry here. I thought I heard you say questions 
and comments. We asked the minister to stay here thinking there 
might be a question. I wondered if in fact there would be a 
question.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I thank the hon. member 
for his comment. Recognizing the member for Quebec-Est in 
his first intervention here in this House of this 35th Parliament I 
think seized the occasion. I understand and have witnessed all 
members making reference to their constituents, thanking them 
and so on. Certainly I want to give the floor back to the member 
for Quebec-Est and give him the opportunity to complete his 
comment and would hope that in the end it would allow time also 
for the Minister of Industry to reply to his comment.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Marchand:</B> Mr. Speaker, I did not want to be too long in 
my introduction; I simply wanted to comment on the very 
interesting statements made by the Minister of Industry.
<P>
	As was mentioned, the minister referred to several issues. He 
said, among other things, that one of the most important 
objectives stated in the Liberal Party's red book is the creation 
of jobs. It just so happens that I am the official critic for the Bloc 
on agricultural issues and  these days the minister of agriculture 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="165"> 165 </A></B>
<P>
is negotiating with the Americans a substantial loss of jobs in 
the field of agriculture, in fact a potential loss of 10,000 jobs in 
that sector for Quebec and Ontario.
<P>
	It is rather puzzling that one of the first agreements signed 
with the Americans by a government which claims to be in 
favour of job creation could in fact lead to the loss of several 
thousand jobs in the agricultural sector.
<P>
	I agree with the hon. member when he says that our society is 
undergoing radical changes. He emphasizes of course that those 
changes have strictly an economic dimension, and I agree with 
him that the world is indeed in a state of flux which affects 
Quebec and Canada, and which triggers a real problem of 
confidence. This brings me back to his comments on the role of 
members of Parliament: we must inspire confidence. We must 
inspire confidence, but I am under the impression that we are not 
doing very well in that regard.
<P>
<B>(1300) </B>
<P>
	Take, for example, the GATT agreement which the minister 
alluded to. I assume that the hon. minister is among those who 
believe that GATT is a very good agreement. It is obvious that 
we derive some benefits from it, but we have also suffered 
substantial losses.
<P>
	Personally, I am not among those who believe that GATT is 
such a marvellous thing. On the contrary, I am under the 
impression that the opening of new markets, in the context of 
that agreement, adversely affects levels of production. It 
favours major American industries at the expense of Canadian 
ones.
<P>
	In the agricultural sector, we have suffered considerable 
losses through GATT.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> In fairness, I will allow 
one brief question as I have to give the minister time to respond. 
Therefore, a very brief question from the hon. member for 
Québec-Est.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Marchand:</B> My question will be very brief, Mr. Speaker. 
Among other things, the Minister of Industry said that efforts 
had to be focussed on creating and strengthening small and 
medium size business. Are the nearly 50,000 farmers in Canada 
who have invested in excess of $1 million in their operations the 
kind of small and medium size businesses that he would like to 
promote?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manley: </B>First of all, I would like to congratulate the hon. 
member for Québec-Est on his maiden speech in the House. It is 
never easy to speak in this Chamber for the first time. He will 
find that things get easier after a few years.
<P>
	I find the hon. member's comments rather odd. Canada 
accounts for approximately 3 per cent of world trade. Therefore, 
when we negotiate within an international forum such as the 
GATT, a forum that is of truly great importance to Canada and to 
Quebec as well since our economy is greatly dependent on trade, 
it is important to find a way to achieve a consensus with 
everyone.
<P>
	Now the hon. member has said that he favours sovereignty for 
Quebec. Judging from his remarks, he seems to think that a 
sovereign Quebec would not be a part of international 
organizations such as the GATT. How then does a sovereign 
Quebec intend to become a player on the world trade scene?
<P>
	International trade agreements are always a source of 
problems. There are always winners and losers. It is a difficult 
situation. Adjustments have to be made. That is always the case.
<P>
	After all, there is a role to play on the world scene. If Quebec 
can negotiate a better agreement for the farmers to which the 
hon. member alluded with the world's trading partners, then I 
wish it good luck. As the minister of agriculture stated, the 
government is deeply concerned about the future of Canadian 
farmers. We also believe very strongly that Canada and Quebec 
must be members the international trade community.
<P>
<B>(1305 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Daphne Jennings (Mission-Coquitlam):</B> I welcome 
the opportunity to take part in this throne speech debate. At the 
outset I would like to congratulate you, Mr. Speaker, upon your 
appointment. I would also like to congratulate our Speaker of 
the House of Commons upon his election as Speaker of this 35th 
Parliament.
<P>
	As someone who is vitally concerned with parliamentary 
reform I feel we owe a debt of gratitude to those who served on 
the special committee on reform of the House of Commons in 
1984-85 and who recommended the method of election of the 
Speaker. A Speaker elected by his or her peers in a free vote is 
ideally placed to serve the needs of this Chamber and its 
members.
<P>
	I would also like to congratulate all those who have been 
elected to serve in this 35th Parliament.
<P>
	I would like to take this opportunity to thank the electors of 
Mission-Coquitlam, a riding in the heart of the Fraser Valley in 
British Columbia, for seeing fit to send me to Ottawa to serve as 
their elected representative.
<P>
	For those of you not familiar with this most beautiful part of 
our country I can only attempt to describe it. 
Mission-Coquitlam has a population of approximately 
115,000. Its population has grown more than 25 per cent 
between 1986 and now and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="166"> 166 </A></B>
<P>
therefore has associated with  it all the problems of a growing 
rural area located close to a thriving metropolis, Vancouver.
<P>
	Employment in this area is spread among the primary 
industries of dairy farming, lumber and fishing as well as 
manufacturing, construction and the wholesale and retail trade 
required to serve the population.
<P>
	At this time I would like to just take a few moments to address 
this House on two government initiatives that, depending on 
how they are implemented, may or may not be beneficial for my 
constituents. I understand the government is proceeding with its 
shared cost, two year, multimillion dollar infrastructure 
program to upgrade transportation and local services. I trust the 
moneys to be used for this plan are not new moneys but are 
already designated as government expenditures and we are 
dealing here with a simple reallocation of funds and priorities.
<P>
	I also want to say that such a program would be of great 
benefit to my riding. Improved transportation and 
communication links are of vital importance to the industries of 
Mission-Coquitlam and to our residents, many of whom 
commute daily to Vancouver in a frustrating two hour, one way 
trip.
<P>
	I am concerned that the outcome of the recent GATT 
discussions may have a detrimental effect on our nation's 
farming community and in Fraser Valley dairy farming in 
particular. The recently signed GATT agreement calls for the 
removal of border restrictions in article XI. This will, we hope, 
be replaced by a set of import tariffs which will be removed on a 
graduated scale until eventually completely phased out in 
approximately 15 years. I trust the government realizes that 
these tariffs and the long phase out period will be necessary to 
ease the transition of our supply managed farmers.
<P>
	This being my first address to this House I would like to take a 
few moments to reflect upon why I believe so many of us from 
the Reform Party of Canada were elected on October 25, 1993.
<P>
	During the past 10 to 15 years a feeling has developed among 
Canadians that government, the party in power, the opposition 
parties and the bureaucracy is not serving the needs of the 
people who are to be served and whose tax dollars pay for this 
government. The separation between government and the people 
grew in the last few years because the views of Canadians seem 
to be ignored by government or, alternatively, there was no 
means by which Canadians could see that their views were being 
expressed, especially in this House. This led, I believe, to an 
unprecedented feeling of frustration in Canadians.
<P>
	I believe the electorate chose on October 25 a higher standard 
in political accountability and by their votes requested a role in 
the policy making process. The people of Canada want their 
views to be considered and they want to see how their views and 
interests are reconciled when policy is formed.
<P>
	I believe the people of Canada are willing to give their trust 
once again to those of us who are willing to take up this 
challenge. They want to see politicians who are willing to 
exercise the courage necessary to state their views publicly, 
even though they may be contrary to party line. At the same time 
the public wants to see courage exercised by our leaders so that 
dissent may be publicly expressed without fear of retribution.
<P>
	I am privileged to have been chosen as the chairperson of our 
caucus committee on parliamentary reform. In the short time I 
have been here I have had the opportunity to study this subject at 
some length.
<P>
<B>(1310) </B>
<P>
	I have come to the conclusion that the first fundamental 
change we must make in this place does not involve rule changes 
but lies in an attitudinal change that must be made by the party 
leadership of this House both on the government and opposition 
sides.
<P>
	This change in attitude relates to allowing private members, 
back bench MPs, to exercise some measure of independence 
from the party line when voting on measures in this House.
<P>
	Freer voting among members requires only attitudinal 
change. However such a change in attitude would send a signal 
to the people of Canada that we as politicians are listening and 
are reflecting their views in our decision making.
<P>
	I want to make it clear at this point that I am speaking about 
freer voting which means a relaxation of the established 
informal rule that private members vote the party line on all 
legislative matters.
<P>
	This is to be distinguished from free votes when the party 
leadership actually tells members that on a particular piece of 
legislation they are free to vote either for or against it.
<P>
	The declaration of free votes by the leadership of this House 
does not solve the problem of exercising independence by the 
members. It is my understanding that in our Canadian political 
system the leadership of political parties have taken the 
confidence convention to extremes. It has been linked to a view 
whereby virtually all votes both in committee and in the House 
of Commons are matters of confidence so that any member who 
votes against the wishes of the leadership, whether that member 
is in government or opposition, is being disloyal and is subject 
to reprimand.
<P>
	A simple review of the voting practices in Great Britain 
illustrates that this does not have to be the case. In recent times 
backbench independence has been asserted with members 
voting against the party line. In some cases this defeats 
government legislation. Once this independence was exercised 
it could not be stopped and has successfully resulted in allowing 
members to influence the public policy agenda. It is important to 
note that punishment by the party leadership did not materialize. 
A participatory attitude prevailed.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="167"> 167 </A></B>
<P>
	What I am saying today is not new. Attitudinal change in 
relation to the confidence convention and freer voting was one 
of the major recommendations of the special committee on 
reform of the House of Commons in 1985. This committee even 
went so far as to categorize the types of confidence votes so 
that on all other matters private members, at least on the 
government side, would feel free to vote against the 
government position without fear of bringing down the 
government.
<P>
	It is appropriate to recognize that today's Minister of Foreign 
Affairs represented the Liberal Party and the hon. member for 
Winnipeg Transcona represented the NDP on that committee.
<P>
	While in opposition the government participated in other 
committees and advanced a policy paper on January 19, 1993 on 
reform of the House of Commons. This also formed part of the 
red book giving more freedom to members to voice their 
concerns in the House.
<P>
	Leadership on this issue must come from the government. A 
clear statement should be made by the Prime Minister that 
dissent will be allowed and only certain legislative matters will 
be looked upon as confidence matters requiring strict party 
discipline.
<P>
	It must also be made clear that anyone exercising 
independence will not be punished. Opposition parties must 
agree to this so that their members are free to voice their own 
views. It is also important that opposition parties not treat 
government members voting against the government line as 
special or as lightning rods of dissent within the government 
caucus.
<P>
	Opposition parties should not call on the government to resign 
if a few of its members break with party discipline or if the 
government loses the occasional vote in the House or in 
committee.
<P>
	Finally, I would like to emphasize that this change of attitude 
will require political courage on the part of all concerned. For 
the first few times that members break with party discipline the 
media will pounce on the situation as a sign of weak leadership. 
Political parties must resist the temptation to capitalize on this. 
In fact they should stress that allowing dissent is a sign of 
strength.
<P>
	While we listened with interest to the speech from the throne 
and the promise of the government to create a greater 
opportunity for members to contribute to the level of public 
policy and legislation, I was disappointed that no specifics of 
how this was to be done were presented.
<P>
	If members are to become a vital part of the policy making 
process in committee and in the House then dissent must be 
allowed to be articulated and occur without retribution.
<P>
	If this occurs the House of Commons may become a more 
accurate reflection of Canadian public opinion and the policies 
of government may become more attuned to the needs of 
Canadians.
<P>
	It is unfortunate that the Bloc in its amendment had not dealt 
with the major issue of parliamentary reform, that is free votes 
and relaxation of the confidence convention. Then I would have 
moved a subamendment in this House as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should permit members of 
the House of Commons to fully represent their constituents' views on the 
government's legislative program and spending plans, or, by adopting the 
position that the defeat of any government measure including a spending 
measure, shall not automatically mean the defeat of the government unless 
followed by the adoption of a formal motion.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1315 ) </B>
<P>
	Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for recognizing me today. I thank the 
voters of Mission-Coquitlam for placing their trust in me.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin by 
congratulating the member on her maiden address in the 
Parliament of Canada. She touched on the very important issue 
of the freedom of members of Parliament to express the views of 
their constituents and not be reprimanded.
<P>
	I rise as a member of the government party to clarify a 
position of our party. It would be unfair to leave the impression 
with the viewing audience or Canadians in general that we on the 
government side do not have the ability to be creative, to debate 
our views, or even to have the ultimate option of dissenting or 
not supporting a particular government measure. I want to try to 
explain the fine line.
<P>
	In our party we have always been encouraged to work at new 
ideas and develop policy initiatives. We debate them in our 
caucus committees and at our policy conventions. From those 
experiences we ultimately develop a consensus and a party 
position. Once a party position is taken we have to decide 
whether or not we want to continue as members of that party.
<P>
	In our particular case we as members of the Liberal Party 
signed on to campaign under the red book. It would be 
inappropriate for us not to support the measures in the red book, 
seeing as that is in fact what got us elected. However that does 
not preclude us from participating in debate in committee or in 
the House.
<P>
	Having been a member of the past Parliament I just want to 
say to the member that there was more than one occasion when 
we constructively debated publicly in the House. Some of us had 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="168"> 168 </A></B>
<P>
different opinions than the party thrust but ultimately when the 
time came and some of us  differed we were not punished. The 
member mentioned that members could be punished or used as 
lightning rods. That is mythology. That really does not happen.
<P>
	The Liberal Party is very vibrant and encourages creativity 
and debate but ultimately, seeing as we have campaigned on a 
certain position, it is incumbent upon us to stick with the 
position that our electorate supported us on.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jennings:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
comments regarding my speech. I was very pleased to hear that 
in fact Liberal members of the House are encouraged to speak 
freely and to use their own thoughts and ideas in the process of 
deliberations. I am very encouraged by that.
<P>
	I want to point out that while I recognize the red book has been 
used in the campaign and the red book has alluded to certain 
ideas which I think correspond with many of the Reform ideas, I 
still feel strongly that there has been much reprimand in the past. 
We have seen the results of it.
<P>
	I honestly would like to say here today that allowing MPs to 
do their jobs in the House and freeing them up to represent their 
constituents properly can only improve the legislative process.
<P>
	Differences of opinion are healthy. As long as members are 
constructive in their criticisms of all members' proposals, all 
members of the House will witness the parliamentary process as 
it was meant to be, as it actually has been in the earlier part of 
this century. The relaxation of the confidence convention will 
strengthen the proceedings in the House, not weaken them.
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
	I look forward to working with all members of the House, and 
particularly with the hon. member opposite, in both a 
co-operative and a constructive way.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, let me offer my sincere congratulations on your 
appointment to the chair. I also thank your colleagues who are 
willing to share in the responsibilities of overseeing the 
proceedings in this Chamber. I take this opportunity to 
congratulate members on both sides of the House on their 
election. I look forward to getting to know all of them. I trust we 
can be friends even if we agree to disagree from time to time.
<P>
	I also thank my wife, Gail, and our three children, Ehren, 
Byron and Marlyn, for their love, support and encouragement. 
They are a big reason why I am here in this Chamber.
<P>
	Indeed it is a pleasure and a privilege to address the House on 
behalf of the voters of the federal riding of 
Kindersley-Lloydminster in west central Saskatchewan who 
have sent me here to be an agent for constructive change. I thank 
the residents of Kindersley-Lloydminster who put trust in me 
by placing  an <I>x</I> beside my name. I pledge to work on behalf of 
all residents of my riding regardless of how they voted.
<P>
	Last October 25 Canadians from coast to coast sent an 
unmistakable message to politicians saying: ``You had better 
begin to listen to us like you have never listened before and you 
had better act on our behalf more responsibly than you have 
acted in the past, or we will remove you from office''.
<P>
	The results of the last election decimated an old, proud federal 
political party, sending it the way of the dodo bird. Another 
party has been delegated to the equivalent of whooping crane 
status.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Every member in this House, whether Reform, Liberal, Bloc 
or independent, has thought about the very clear message sent by 
his constituents. Compared to our predecessors, we have 
improved our performance. Canadians will accept no less.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I commend the government for many of the reforms it has 
listed in its speech from the throne. Some reforms it now 
proposes are the same ones for which Reformers have been 
working so hard for three, four, five and even six years. I trust 
our efforts are not in vain now that the government is talking 
about reform. Talk is a good start but mere talk without 
substantive action becomes rhetoric, and rhetoric is not what 
Canadians want from us.
<P>
	I also join my colleagues who have expressed grave concern 
that no mention of agriculture or energy was made in the speech 
from the throne. I hope this is not an indication of the 
importance the government places on industries vital to 
Kindersley-Lloydminster.
<P>
	I was disappointed the government's parliamentary reform 
measures outlined in the red book and in the speech from the 
throne overlook one of the most embarrassing institutions of 
Parliament. Canadians have rightfully called the other place, the 
Senate of Canada, a disgrace to the nation. Over one-quarter of 
the legislators in Parliament are not accountable to the people 
they are supposed to serve. With regard to Parliament and its 
occupants, second only to the bloated MPs' pensions, my 
constituents expressed their absolute disgust with the Senate 
and demanded that something be done about it.
<P>
	Many Canadians disillusioned with the inability of previous 
governments to fix this problem are calling for the abolition of 
the Senate. Just because our political leaders of the past have 
been unable to find the constitutional key to unlock the gate 
barring us from Senate reform it in no way precludes us from 
taking giant steps toward fixing the other place.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="169"> 169 </A></B>
<P>
	Before we look at ways to begin to address the 
embarrassment of a Senate that does not work, we would be 
wise to review reasons why the Senate cannot only be useful 
but invaluable.
<P>
	Canadians are demanding more balance and fairness in 
national decision making. Having only a lower House where 
members are elected by the people has left the most sparsely 
populated regions of the country like my province of 
Saskatchewan feeling handicapped when important legislation 
is debated and passed in Parliament, because no accountable 
federal institution by its very nature is designed to protect us 
from the overwhelming political clout of the more heavily 
populated regions of Canada. For instance, the people of 
Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Alberta had no effective tools to 
prevent the infamous and unfair national energy program from 
being foisted upon them by a Liberal government dominated by 
Ontario and Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1325) </B>
<P>
	The current infrastructure program which has the economic 
stimulative capabilities of a one legged kick-boxing sparrow is 
based on population and unemployment levels and this concerns 
the residents of Saskatchewan. Our province has suffered severe 
economic depression for a decade resulting in lost jobs and 
depreciating infrastructure such as roads.
<P>
	Saskatchewan people have left the province looking for work 
rather than going on unemployment insurance or social 
assistance. With a declining population, low employment rates, 
high taxes, and deteriorating infrastructure one would think 
Saskatchewan would be a prime target for the benefits of the 
government's infrastructure program but in fact the criteria for 
the program penalizes. I am certain the criteria would be much 
better if Canada had an elected Senate with equal seats from 
every province.
<P>
	The government has the opportunity to take a great leap 
forward in the cause of Senate reform. We know it can be done 
because it has been done. One province, Alberta, enacted 
legislation allowing the people, not the Prime Minister, to 
indicate their choice in filling a vacant Senate seat. By 
democratic election at less cost than the cost of political 
patronage the people of Alberta said they wanted Stan Waters to 
be their senator to represent their interests in Ottawa.
<P>
	The Prime Minister of the day was playing a game with dice 
and one of his moves in the game was to appoint the people's 
choice to the vacancy in the upper House. He later undid this 
good by stacking the Senate with friends who lacked 
commitment to represent people over parties in the GST debate.
<P>
	The current membership in the Senate is dominated by 
Conservatives, a party rejected by Canadians right across 
Canada. Rather than the Prime Minister replacing them with his 
friends, it is only right that the government give Canadians an 
opportunity to select women and men to sit in the upper House.
<P>
	If the Prime Minister and his government really want to move 
Canada out of the 19th century and into the 21st century, they 
could take a first step to Senate reform by asking the provinces 
such as my province of Saskatchewan to pass legislation similar 
to bill 11 in Alberta. They could then assure that every province 
with such a measure would see the democratically chosen 
candidate for the Senate appointed by the Prime Minister to the 
upper House. This does not require an amendment to our 
Constitution. What a step forward this would be in the evolution 
of an elected, equal and effective Senate.
<P>
	In closing I wish to assure members opposite that Reformers 
are prepared to support measures the government introduces 
that will help fix this place. If the government will not fix it then 
we will wait until the next election and fix it ourselves.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philippe Paré (Louis-Hébert):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to comment on what was said by the previous speaker, who, 
I am glad to say, is a member of the Reform Party, because I have 
the impression that if we consider the causes behind the 
emergence of the Reform Party in western Canada and the Bloc 
Quebecois in Quebec, there are a number of similarities.
<P>
	There is of course the aspect of voter dissatisfaction in the 
west and in Quebec. That explains why these parties suddenly 
emerged. It is also the very obvious difference between the 
aspirations of Canadian and Quebec voters, and an apparent 
inability on the part of the government or governments, and I 
was going to say the big national parties, to meet people's 
expectations. I think Canada's very nature makes this 
inevitable, considering the size of the territory, different needs 
and the fact that the Conservative and Liberal parties have 
always insisted on proposing the same solutions from coast to 
coast.
<P>
	Where the Bloc and the Reform Party differ is on how to deal 
with the situation. The Reform Party seems to think it is possible 
to change the system. Quebecers, after 30 years of attempts at 
constitutional reform, have concluded, and there is a broad 
consensus to that effect, that reform is impossible.
<P>
<B>(1330) </B>
<P>
	Finally, I want to put a question to the previous speaker. He 
mentioned the Senate, and my question will deal with this 
institution. At the present time, Senate reform would require the 
unanimous consent of the provinces. Last summer, in a 
nationwide survey, more than 60 per cent of Canadians said we 
should get rid of the Senate.
<P>
	Considering that the member of the Reform Party seems to be 
saying his party is concerned with the needs of the people, and 
considering that the premier of Newfoundland, an old friend of 
the Prime Minister of Canada, says he will never agree to 
abolish the Senate, how can the members of the Reform Party of 
Canada still believe the Canadian system is open to reform?

<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
his question. What I suggested in my speech, had the hon. 
member listened, was not a constitutional change to make the 
Senate more effective but to actually have it elected. We have 
already had one elected senator in the upper House. He was 
elected by the citizens of Alberta and appointed by the Prime 
Minister.
<P>
	The purpose of my speech was to challenge the government 
and to challenge our current Prime Minister to follow that 
precedent and encourage the provinces to pass similar 
legislation across Canada so we could bring some respect and 
legitimacy to the Senate. This is so that people who live in the 
more scarcely populated provinces such as mine would feel that 
they have somewhere in Parliament to appeal their case and have 
regional interests heard.
<P>
	Just to expand a little further yes, with the observations of the 
hon. member from the Bloc, we are both unhappy with some of 
the current situations in the country and we are both working to 
improve them.
<P>
	However, coming from western Canada, when we have a 
problem we usually roll up our sleeves and try to fix it. That has 
been the approach of the Reform Party. If you see a problem, fix 
it. That is why we are called Reform which means constructive 
change. We think that Canada is a wonderful country which 
should contain ten equal provinces, each represented equally in 
the Senate. We recognize that in some ways Quebec is unique 
and should have its own cultural and linguistic needs 
represented at a provincial level.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Prior to resuming debate, 
this is our first week in this 35th Parliament and we are all 
learning our new responsibilities. It has come to my attention 
and I want to share with all members in the House that there is a 
tradition that we do not refer to the Senate. We refer to it as the 
other place.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Traditionally, in the House we never refer to the Senate as 
such. For instance, you could say ``the other place''. This is just 
for your information.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is only for the information of all members that I share this 
new information I have just discovered, even though this is my 
second term here.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Brent St. Denis (Algoma):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is truly a 
pleasure and an honour for me to participate in the throne speech 
debate. We heard earlier today that one of the Telesat Anik 
satellites is out of commission. I will ask you to decide in 15 or 
20 minutes whether it is good or bad that this is not on live 
television across the country.
<P>
	I would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate you 
and your colleagues on your appointment to the Chair. It is my 
firm belief that you will be presiding over one of the best 
Parliaments that this country has seen in a long, long time.
<P>
	I do not agree with the media pundits who refer to this as a 
potentially fractious Parliament. I do not agree with those who 
think we are going to be faced with problems day in and day out. 
I am not naive but from what I have seen so far and in talking to 
colleagues in my own party and colleagues from other parties 
everyone I have spoken to has agreed that we have the potential 
to have a truly great and productive Parliament. No doubt that 
will be partly due to the great contribution you and your 
colleagues in the Chair will make.
<P>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
	I would also like to pay tribute to my colleagues, the member 
for Victoria-Madawaska and the member for Bruce-Grey 
who moved and seconded this debate. Like the speakers we have 
heard from our ministry and from other private members, they 
have given me great confidence that this place will truly reflect 
the views of Canadians in a way we have not seen in at least 10 
years. I dare say that we will be very proud of that in the years to 
come.
<P>
	We have this honoured section to your left that at times has 
been disparagingly referred to as the rump. I would like to 
disabuse members of this House of that name. I am pleased and 
proud to take my turn over here. When the others have their turn 
here I am sure they will be pleased with the view and the chance 
to see what is going on. They will have a chance to speak directly 
to our fellow members in the government. Maybe we can come 
up with a more creative description for this area. Take note that 
three of the Speaker's team are part of this area.
<P>
	We should look at this section of the House as evidence that 
Canadians have put great trust in our party. It is impossible to 
reflect that confidence any other way except to have some of us 
over here because of our great numbers. If things work out there 
will be government members over here for a long time to come. 
Therefore we may as well look at this area as an honoured place 
to be. I feel very proud to be here, for now.
<P>
	I would like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to 
the voters of Algoma riding. I will talk a little about my riding in 
a moment before getting to the thrust of my comments on the 
throne speech.
<P>
	The confidence my constituents placed in me has made me 
very proud. I have assured them at every opportunity and do so 
again now that I will work very hard for them. We talk about 
serving the country and individual Canadians. There is no 
greater honour than to have a chance to serve our fellow 
Canadians in this place. There are many callings in life where 
service is the thrust of an individual's activities. I cannot 
imagine a better way to serve our fellow man than as a parlia-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="171"> 171 </A></B>
<P>
mentarian. I am sure  we all feel that way regardless of the 
ideological differences we might have.
<P>
	I truly look forward to getting to know better all the members 
of this House in all parties. Whenever I am in this place I want it 
to encourage me in the work I do. I want it to strengthen me in 
my work here and in the riding.
<P>
	For a while we are going to feel a little bit schizophrenic. It 
seems that the work here is different from the work in the riding. 
The nature of the day is obviously very different. Over time we 
will find that these two different lives will come closer and 
closer together. I would certainly defer to the opinion of those 
who have served in this place for a long time to confirm that. 
However it is my belief that our work here and our work in the 
riding is really one. It is only a matter of time before we actually 
feel that in our experiences. I look forward to that.
<P>
	I would like to thank my family, particularly Julie. Those of 
us with families know the great sacrifices they have had to 
endure to allow us to serve in this way. It goes unnoticed by 
Canadians in general and it is important that we say in this 
public place that our families also serve the country. I am truly 
grateful to mine and to all our families who in some ways are 
forced to contribute. We appreciate that.
<P>
<B>(1340 ) </B>
<P>
	We all had many volunteers working for us in our campaigns 
and we would not be here without them. The whole exercise of 
democracy is built on the building blocks of volunteers. The 
volunteers that work in the political process are as valuable as 
any volunteer raising funds for heart research or the kidney 
foundation. All those activities are important and the volunteers 
that work in the political realm are equally important. They 
make this country run. They are the lifeblood of democracy, in 
my view.
<P>
	Of course we all depend on staff and I can assure you that the 
staff I have working for me are among the best.
<P>
	I have the honour of representing the riding of Algoma which 
for the last 25 years was represented by a colleague of many of 
the returning members, Dr. Maurice Foster. I had the pleasure of 
working closely with him as his parliamentary assistant for a 
number of years. It was an experience I will never forget. He will 
be my adviser, at $1 a year shall we say, for quite some time 
whether he likes it or not. He distinguished himself as a 
committee chair, as chairman of Ontario caucus for a number of 
years, as a parliamentary secretary, and as a representative of 
this country in several international delegations. He was the 
kind of parliamentarian who was truly Canadian and truly 
motivated by service. There is not an ounce of self-serving in 
Maurice Foster's attitude toward service and I could not let this 
chance go by without paying tribute to him and his work on 
behalf of Canada and Algoma.
<P>
	Dr. Foster followed in the footsteps of Lester Pearson who 
represented Algoma East. I dare say I feel humbled to follow in 
the footsteps of such great Canadians as Lester Pearson and 
Maurice Foster.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I would like to invite you as well as the other 
members of this House to visit Algoma riding. We all claim to 
have the greatest riding in the country and if there is such a thing 
as the greatest among equals then I will claim that title for 
Algoma.
<P>
	Algoma riding is situated in the northern area of Lake Huron. 
It includes Manitoulin Island and the north shore of Lake Huron 
approximately from Georgian Bay to the eastern shore of Lake 
Superior. Like some other ridings it is very large. It takes over 
seven hours to drive from one end to the other. It is a 
spectacularly beautiful riding with many unique features, but 
like many ridings it is suffering difficult economic times.
<P>
	We have a mining sector in Elliot Lake that has suffered 
tremendous downsizing. In the months ahead you will hear me 
make numerous interventions on behalf of Elliot Lake where 
thousands of jobs in the mining industry have been lost, but 
where tremendous effort is being made to revitalize the 
economy.
<P>
	We have a substantial tourism industry. Our proximity to 
Michigan is helpful but the tourism industry needs revitalization 
too.
<P>
	Forestry is a major industry for us but the constant badgering 
by the U.S. of our softwood lumber industry has had an impact.
<P>
	I certainly appreciate the attitude of our government, of our 
leader and Prime Minister that he will take a firm businesslike 
stand with the Americans. We can no longer tolerate being 
pushed around. The Americans are our friends on a personal 
basis but I believe when it comes to country to country relations 
those have to be conducted in a businesslike manner. In fact 
during the campaign I asked the then leader if he would commit 
not ever to go fishing with the U.S. President. His response was 
that he did not think he would but it certainly seemed to me that 
the relationship between our previous Prime Minister and the 
U.S. President was too cosy.
<P>
	We also have some farming. Believe it or not in northern 
Ontario there is a substantial farming sector. We have dairy 
farmers. Like many members who have dairy farmers or other 
supply managed sectors in their ridings, the GATT has been a 
tremendous exercise in frustration. I believe though that our 
government took up the challenge after October 25 and has 
produced for us a result that was the very best that could be 
obtained under the circumstances.
<P>
<B></B>

<P>
<B>(1345) </B>
<P>
	In Algoma riding we are blessed with over 40 small 
communities including over a dozen First Nation communities. 
I will not dare start listing them for fear of forgetting or leaving 
one out. One has to visit.
<P>
	I would like to come to the point of this exercise. I hope I did 
not leave myself too short on time. I am thinking back to the 
campaign where one was required to speak longer than one 
should too many times. I would like to make reference to a 
comment made by the member for Broadview-Greenwood 
yesterday. He made an intervention in response to the speech by 
a member from the Reform Party. That member from the Reform 
Party talked about the bottom line and generally the need to run 
Canada like a business.
<P>
	I was very proud to hear the member for 
Broadview-Greenwood say that this country is not just a 
bottom line, this country is people. After all if there is any vision 
of this country that we should have front and foremost it is that 
of its people. When I look at the commitments made in the 
throne speech, the comments made by the member for 
Broadview-Greenwood and our famous red book, line after 
line after line, it is people first.
<P>
	We cannot have a vision about a technological revolution or a 
vision about being a major trading country without first having a 
vision about the people who make up this country. I dare say, and 
with all due respect, the agenda of the Reform and Bloc parties 
really misses the mark. The deficit is important. The issues that 
the Bloc bring forward on behalf of their particular constituency 
are important, but they really ignore the fact that above all it is 
people and people want to have dignity. People want to have 
jobs. People want to be able to put food on the table using money 
that they have earned, not money that was given to them because 
they could not find a job.
<P>
	The whole thing goes back to mobilizing and energizing the 
creativity of our people, mobilizing the capital resources, 
coupled with creativity to get this country moving again, get it 
out of the starting blocks.
<P>
	I do not want to blame all our ills on the last 10 years, but let 
us blame some of the ills. Members will seldom hear the right 
hon. Prime Minister blame the last government for the 
predicament we are in, but those are the facts.
<P>
	It really requires of us now that we always put people first. If I 
go through the list of the throne speech initiatives I do not see 
one that does not put people first, even something like the Rural 
Residential Assistance Program, the housing program. I can say 
that in my riding of Algoma where there are a lot of older people 
who are trying to stay in their homes longer so that they do not 
have to go into nursing homes that it is important to have access 
to funds to improve their homes so they can stay in them. That is 
a program about people.
<P>
	Let us look at municipal infrastructure. That is a program 
about people. It gets people, I do not want to say at the bottom of 
the economic ladder as I do not mean that, but labourers, 
contractors and equipment operators, working. It gets money 
into the economy at the local level and gets it there quickly. We 
are talking about putting people back to work.
<P>
	When I was preparing for my earlier S. O. 31 statement today 
on literacy I was reminded of how many of our adult population 
have difficulty functioning in our modern society because they 
cannot read. I just beamed with pride when our government's 
commitment to literacy, not only in the red book and not only by 
the appointment of a minister responsible for literacy, was given 
major mention in the throne speech.
<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
	If we do not have strong building blocks and if we do not have 
strong people, how can we have a strong country.
<P>
	As I mentioned earlier in the statements, literacy is an 
important issue in my riding of Algoma. We have people who 
spent years working in the resource sectors of mining, forestry 
and so on. When times were good it was easy to get a job. Maybe 
they did not get the education that was required or for economic 
reasons they had to go to work. Now with our country having to 
restructure itself economically these people are being left out. I 
think it is important that we do not leave anybody behind.
<P>
	When we talk about the social safety net we are talking about 
people again. The social safety net without a doubt has become 
frayed over the years. There may be a few holes in the safety net. 
We would not want any trapeze artist falling into that safety net 
and hitting the wrong spot. That is what happens too often 
unfortunately.
<P>
	I believe we have to honestly look at our social safety net 
programs to make them better. It does not mean that it is going to 
cost more. I really appreciated the comment in the speech by the 
member for Madawaska-Victoria, the seconder of the reply to 
the throne speech, that we can have a leaner government without 
a meaner government. We can do things better.
<P>
	I am prepared and I am sure that my constituents are prepared 
to look honestly at changing constructively our social safety net 
program. We want it to do a better job. I campaigned openly, 
saying that there were abuses and that I was prepared to look 
honestly at making changes. I look forward to working with 
other members in this House to that end.
<P>
	Even our initiative on crime talks about people. Who is it that 
is worried about getting mugged? It is people. Whatever we can 
do to make people feel safer on their streets, to make people feel 
that the justice system serves not only the victim but the 
community and deals effectively and constructively with the 
criminal will be moving this country forward.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="173"> 173 </A></B>
<P>
	Why is it that this country is singly the most desired country 
in the world in which to live? As long as we do not tell people 
how cold it can get here sometimes, I am sure everybody in this 
world would like to move here.
<P>
	We have a community of peoples. Just imagine, this country 
was really built on three founding nations.
<P>
	When one considers that we have such a desirable country, 
what better chance do we have than to serve together to move 
this country forward into the next century.
<P>
	I would like to conclude my remarks by saying that we as a 
group certainly have many tough decisions to make in the 
months and years ahead. I think if we continue to be transparent 
in our dealings with the public they will look at us with 
confidence. If we try hard and we listen to the people I believe 
we will be successful. Fortunately for us and unfortunately for 
the other parties in this House, we will be here for a long time.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to thank the member for Algoma for his 
speech. However, before making some comments and asking a 
question, and since this is my first speech before the House, I 
would also like to take this opportunity to extend my thanks to 
the people from the riding of Anjou-Rivières-des-Prairies, in 
the east end of Montreal, who elected me.
<P>
	As you know, many newspapers are describing Montreal as 
the capital of poverty in Canada, and the east end of Montreal is 
one of the most disadvantaged areas of all the metropolitan area. 
Therefore, I want to make the commitment to my constituents, 
those who elected me and even those who did not vote for me 
and whom I represent today, that I will promote their interests in 
the best way I know how.
<P>
	I would also like to thank all members who, probably for the 
first time, rose or will rise in the next few days in this House. I 
think that most people, and this has been stressed, realize that it 
is a difficult task. I believe we all did an excellent job and that is 
a good sign for the days to come. Surely, we will learn very 
quickly the technicalities of government. I should point out that 
this will be extremely important for the debates to come.
<P>
<B>(1355) </B>
<P>
	You know that, to a certain extent, we are here to learn. In 
view of the economic situation, Mr. Speaker, I believe that we 
will have lively and, hopefully, spirited debates in this House. 
All parties are committed to raising the level of parliamentary 
debates which people have considered a bit too low over the last 
few years.
<P>
	We are presently in a political situation quite peculiar as in a 
few months, I strongly believe, Quebecers will be called upon to 
determine their own future. We will probably have a referendum 
within 18 to 24 months and, in due time, this referendum will 
generate some debate in this House where, for the first time, 
there will be clearly defined positions on both sides. Canadians 
will no doubt follow that debate. We will have to approach it in a 
very professional way.
<P>
	I listened carefully to the speech given by my colleague from 
Algoma, and I thank him. He mainly spoke of something I also 
believe in, something he referred to by using the terms ``people 
first''. I would like to ask him a question in this regard. Clearly, 
the first role of government and of people in government is to 
represent and defend the citizens who elected them.
<P>
	I believe that the Conservative Party-if you allow me this 
political digression-lost the elections when Ms. Campbell said 
that she would reform social programs. We know that the 
Liberal Party did not make that promise, on the contrary, it 
promised to stimulate employment. However, statements by the 
Right Hon. Prime Minister lead us to believe that the 
government do indeed plan cuts in social programs, either 
directly or through cuts in transfer payments to the provinces.
<P>
	My question to the hon. member for Algoma is this: How can 
you say that you put ``people first'' when in actual fact you are 
planning cuts in social programs?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. St. Denis:</B> I would like to thank the hon. member for 
Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies for his question and offer my 
good wishes on his first intervention.
<P>
	It is because we are putting people first that we have included 
in the throne speech a number of initiatives. It is because we put 
people first that we need to look at the social safety net so that it 
better serves Canadians. Maybe all of us, certainly I did during 
my campaign, have people approach us and talk to us about what 
they perceive as abuses to the system and ways to improve it and 
make it serve the public better. I am not saying that we have to 
make cuts to improve it, but we have to look at what we do. We 
always have to renew our contract with each other and consider 
the terms of our contracts with the public. If we do not 
constantly update and reflect the current situation in our 
relationships with others we will lose track of where we are 
going.
<P>
	I have great confidence in the minister of human resources 
who is, as members know, now undertaking a review along with 
the provinces in consultation with people across this country. I 
am very confident. I have faith that changes will be proposed 
that will be constructive, acceptable, fiscally responsible and 
reflect the realities of today.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to congratulate the hon. member for Algoma on his maiden 
speech in this House, but I feel I must comment and set the 
record straight on one thing regarding the position of my party 
on the bottom line. That position on the bottom line, through you 
Mr. Speaker, to the hon. member is people related.
<P>
	As a small businessman I appreciated the importance of the 
bottom line because if I did not have a bottom line my people 
lost their jobs. Therefore, as a businessman I was constantly 
concerned about the bottom line and how it related to my ability 
to employ people and pay fair wages.
<P>
	The concern of my party is that the government is a business 
with a bottom line. Our taxpayers support that bottom line. Our 
bottom line is in danger of collapsing and then who will be there 
to look after those who are truly in need? We want to save the 
social safety nets for those who are truly in need. It is the deficit 
and the debt that is the real threat to those social safety nets. 
That is the threat to this economy and the creation of jobs. Our 
party is dedicated to doing something about that. That is why I 
say to all members of the House that our party's position on the 
bottom line is very much people related toward the people who 
need us most.
<P>
	<B>Mr. St. Denis:</B> Mr. Speaker, governments are not businesses. I 
do not disagree with conducting our affairs in a businesslike 
manner. However, one cannot lay off a citizen. One can lay off 
an employee from a business but one cannot lay off a citizen. 
One cannot tell them to go away because one cannot afford to 
provide a certain fundamental and essential service.
<P>
	When I talk about my concern about a single minded focus on 
the deficit as not being people oriented it is in recognition of the 
fact that people have to be working to pay the taxes that will 
allow the deficit to be managed.
<P>
	I had this debate numerous times during the campaign. I really 
appreciated the other candidates in the campaign. They were 
excellent, all of them.
<P>
	It is a matter of what comes first. It is not a chicken and egg 
problem because people must really be working first. If it 
requires investment to bring that about then I think we have to 
do it. If we have to use bottom line then we have to look at it in 
longer terms.
<P>
	Consider the motion that was put forward about limiting the 
expenditures this coming fiscal year. Without thinking that 
through I have to question if it is people first or is it just a blind 
devotion to the bottom line without that consideration for 
people?

	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve):</B> Mr.

the responsibilities vested in you, at the beginning of the week, 
by the parliamentarians of this House.
<P>
	I am confident that you will discharge these new 
responsibilities of yours with a firm yet courteous hand, and 
above all with a keen sense of fairness, a sense a fairness which 
the veterans of this House did not fail to mention.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, tradition has it that on the occasion of our 
maiden speech in the House, we are allowed to tell our fellow 
members what inspires and motivates us. As the member for 
Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, I will be guided by three principles.
<P>
	The first one is never to forget that all of us are 
parliamentarians, elected by the people, and as such our 
behaviour must constantly reflect and be based on the right to 
express our diversity.
<P>
	The second principle deals with the fact that we live in a 
representative democracy .
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, if I can address you today, it is because people 
put their trust in me. These people, you will have understood, 
are my constituents in Hochelaga-Maisonneuve to whom I 
would like to express my deepest appreciation; they can rest 
assured that I will defend their interests with all my energy and 
enthusiasm.

working class riding.
<P>
	I am the son of a labourer and proud of it, and I think this is the 
best guarantee for my constituents that I will never let the 
government cut social programs, drop its plans for tax reform or 
downgrade the extent of our economic problems.
<P>
	Finally, my third principle arises from what we must conclude 
from the last election on October 25, and my conclusion is that 
Quebecers rejected the constitutional status quo once and for all.
<P>
	By electing 54 Bloc Quebecois members, the people of 
Quebec rejected a government that attacked the most vulnerable 
members of our society. For instance, we had the notorious 
measures to reform the unemployment insurance system, when 
Canadians saw their benefits reduced from 60 to 57 per cent. 
Canada also made dubious history when it became the only 
OECD member that does not contribute to a public 
unemployment insurance fund.
<P>
	On October 25, Quebecers chose to support a national 
liberation movement. This movement, as you know, is rooted in 
the recent and not so recent history of the only French-speaking 
people in the Americas.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="175"> 175 </A></B>
<P>
	Quebec, as lawyer André Brassard reminded us, is the only 
example in the world of a people living within a federation 
where 82 per cent of the same population has a territory, 
democratic institutions and common aspirations.
<P>
	The election on October 25 made it clear to the political elites 
that the concept of national unity, so dear to Pierre Elliott 
Trudeau and his followers, died with the demise of Meech Lake 
and the clear rejection of the Charlottetown Accord.
<P>
	The arrival of a strong contingent of Bloc and Reform 
members is eloquent testimony that Canada has entered the era 
of regional identities. As these identities mature, Canada will 
have to make a thorough review of its institutions. I am firmly 
convinced that as a result, Quebec will be able to propose new 
forms of political co-operation with English Canada. These new 
forms of co-operation will reflect a generous, modern and 
effective approach and together they represent sovereignty. 
Sovereignty as defined by international public law, that is to say 
the power for the State to collect all taxes on its territory, to see 
to its own external relations and to enact all the laws that apply 
to its citizens.
<P>
	Now, Mr. Speaker, I would like to comment on the Speech 
from the Throne read by His Excellency the Governor General 
on behalf of the government.
<P>
	First of all, I would like to take this opportunity to 
congratulate the Prime Minister and his cabinet, and wish them 
the best of luck in their responsibilities.
<P>
	Among the positive aspects of the Speech from the Throne, I 
would like to mention the commitment of the government to 
enhance the credibility of Parliament and insist on integrity and 
honesty. This is to the credit of the government.
<P>
	I cannot but concur with the intention of the Prime Minister to 
change the rules of the House of Commons to give Members of 
Parliament a greater opportunity to contribute to the 
development of public policy and legislation.
<P>
	However, on the financial side, the Speech from the Throne is 
rather disappointing. This is because it is so vague, so nebulous, 
because as the philosopher Pascal would have said: ``It is a 
speech where the centre is everywhere and the periphery 
nowhere.'' It is so conservative that it looks like a commitment 
to the status quo.
<P>
	We would be hard pressed to find any project of significance, 
capable of giving some hope to out-of-work Canadians and 
Quebecers.
<P>
	There is no indication that the government is determined to 
get out of the rut we are in, to innovate and create the conditions 
that should lead us to what is really needed, and that is full 
employment.
<P>
<B>(1410) </B>
<P>
	We cannot limit our economic development policy to the 
national infrastructure program. Even if that program does 
address some of the issues raised by the municipalities, we must 
admit that the tripartite financing could create problems since 
municipal administrations are tragically short on resources and 
provincial governments are not much better off.
<P>
	What is disturbing is that the national infrastructure program 
is likely to create temporary jobs that will only bring 
disappointment to workers.
<P>
	Finally, the Speech from the Throne was totally silent on the 
question of tax reform.
<P>
	For now, let me examine the Speech from the Throne from the 
point of view of research and development since my leader has 
chosen me as our party's critic in that area.
<P>
	It is easy enough for me to deal with that issue since there is a 
consensus on research and development. I think I can safely say 
that all parties in this House recognize that research and 
development is a necessity for the future, a pathway to the next 
century.
<P>
	We all know that industries who want to be competitive in the 
near future have to invest considerably right now in research and 
development.
<P>
	Why is research and development so important? Simply 
because the strength of any economy no longer resides in the 
possession, the processing or the transformation of raw 
material, as the Minister of Industry indicated this morning.
<P>
	Competitiveness lies mainly in a worker's ability to master 
new production technologies and deliver new goods and 
services. This translates into a demand for a more educated and 
better trained labour force willing to continuously upgrade their 
skills. It is in such a context that the relationship between 
competitiveness, training and research takes its full meaning.
<P>
	Several advisory bodies, in Quebec as well as in Canada, 
warned that in the next 10 years, half of all new jobs will require 
up to five years of postsecondary education.
<P>
	The increased significance of research and development will 
shape a society in which economic growth will rest first and 
foremost on skilled labour.
<P>
	In the eyes of the Bloc Quebecois members, research and 
development is particularly important. If there is an area in 
which Quebec has been the poor relation of the federation, in 
which Quebec has been systematically discriminated against, it 
is in that one.
<P>
	It is important to remind Quebecers that the federal 
government is a main player in that area. For example, in 1990, 
the federal government invested around $6 billion in research 
and development.
<P>
	No matter how you look at this issue, disparities are painfully 
obvious when it comes to Quebec. One fact is clear, the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="176"> 176 </A></B>
<P>
distribution of research and development  expenditures has 
constantly been unfair to Quebec and, consequently, has 
hampered its future economic development.
<P>
	This fact is so clear that even Robert Bourassa's former 
government had to recognize it on the strength of the now 
famous study carried out by the ministry of industry and 
commerce, which can hardly be suspected of being a 
sovereignist sympathizer.
<P>
	The great merit of this study performed under Étienne 
Grégoire in 1991 is that it assessed the distribution of federal 
funds allocated to research and development over the past 
decade, using four seldom considered criteria: the size of the 
population in each province; federal spending in relation to the 
size of the provincial economy; as well as regional support for 
research and, last, development and the federal support in that 
area as compared to that of each province.
<P>
	The study shows that over the last decade a mere 18.5 per cent 
of research and development funds went to Quebec, while 
Ontario got the lion's share, receiving 50 per cent of the funds. 
These findings are both disturbing and unacceptable, especially 
knowing how pivotal R and D is in societies intent on expanding 
their share of the market on the international market.
<P>
	It is imperative that the Minister of Industry and the Secretary 
of State for Science, Research and Development develop 
corrective action to put an end to this underfunding affecting 
Quebec.
<P>
	I can assure you that my colleagues and myself will fight 
relentlessly to put a stop to such discrimination.
<P>
<B>(1415) </B>
<P>
	Quebecers have invested too much in their development over 
the last 20 years to put up with this situation. We will act and be 
vigilant to ensure that Quebecers do not tolerate any unfairness 
in research and development.
<P>
	While federal investment in research and development in 
Quebec is far from satisfactory, R and D in Canada is also cause 
for concern on several fronts as well. First, Canada is one of the 
industrialized countries which spends the least on R and D, on 
average, a mere 1.44 per cent of its gross domestic product, 
while the other OECD countries spend 3 per cent on it. Second, 
most Canadian and Quebec companies do little or no research. 
Third, Canadian industrial research is concentrated in a few very 
limited sectors.
<P>
	What does the Speech from the Throne offer us in terms of 
research and development? Very little, actually, except for a 
centre of excellence for women's health, with which we agree. 
Nevertheless, in the last election campaign, the Liberal team 
and its leader, the present Prime Minister, swore to heaven that 
R and D would be a priority in a Liberal government.
<P>
	These promises did not make it as far as the Speech from the 
Throne.
<P>
	The greatest disappointment of the scientific community is 
the government's silence on the Liberal team's commitment to 
spend $1 billion in support of research and development. I want 
to say it loud and clear: the Official Opposition will not accept 
the government shirking its responsibilities in such an important 
area as research and development.
<P>
	The scientific community is concerned, for two reasons: first, 
no one in the inner cabinet is responsible for science, research 
and development as such. Mr. Speaker, you will tell me that 
there is a secretary of state responsible for these issues, but you 
will agree that he does not sit in the council of ministers. Will he 
be able to influence the government on policy development? 
Will he be able to convince the government to invest the billion 
dollars promised in the last election? That is very uncertain!
<P>
	Secondly, will the government allow the main granting 
agencies such as the Social Sciences and Humanities Research 
Council, the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research 
Council and the Medical Research Council to play their proper 
role by stabilizing their resources and giving them a five-year 
funding plan? In this regard, I heard about the concern of some 
social science researchers following the departure of the former 
president of the Social Sciences and Humanities Research 
Council, Dr. Paule Leduc. I take the opportunity to thank her for 
her services to the scientific community and urge the 
government to fill the void left by her departure, in consultation 
with the interested agencies.
<P>
	The Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council has a 
key role to play in reaching Canada's and Quebec's R and D 
objectives. Therefore it wants its funding to continue to come 
from the same envelope as the other two granting agencies, thus 
showing the public that social science research is also scientific 
research.
<P>
	Rumours have been going around that the Social Sciences and 
Humanities Research Council could be transferred to the 
Department of Canadian Heritage. Such a move would disturb 
the scientific community in that it would suggest that the social 
sciences are closer to culture and the arts than to science.
<P>
	One sector that must receive particular attention from the 
government is biomedical and biological research, especially 
since Canada and Quebec have solid experience in this area.
<P>
	A coalition, the coalition for biomedical and health research, 
was created a few weeks ago. This coalition brings together 16 
medical schools and 6,000 biomedical and biological 
researchers.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="177"> 177 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	I submit that a novel approach to curbing the growth of health 
costs and the deficit would be to invest significant amounts in 
biomedical research.
<P>
	Disease and its accompanying harmful effects create not only 
personal hardship but also a financial burden that we must strive 
to alleviate.
<P>
	Did you know that, each year, loss of productivity due to 
short-term or permanent disability costs $21 billion to the 
Canadian economy?
<P>
	In order for biomedical and health research to constitute a 
viable solution and to help curb health costs significantly, the 
Minister of Industry and the Secretary of State for Science, 
Research and Development must be urged to take three steps. 
First, to restore funding to federal research councils to their 
1992 levels. Second, to develop a mechanism to protect R and D 
activities carried out in federal laboratories from 
government-wide budget cuts. Third, to call a summit 
conference bringing together representatives of the stakeholders 
in the area of biomedical research and health as well as the 
Prime Minister and his ministers responsible for finance, 
science, health, human resources and labour to develop an 
integrated research and development strategy with a long-term 
view to improving Canada's international competitiveness.
<P>
	These suggestions, which take into account the present state 
of government finances, would enable the government to honour 
a number of election promises and above all send a strong signal 
about this government's commitment to biomedical research.
<P>
	In closing, I want to reiterate that federal investment in 
research and development in Quebec is a great tool afforded this 
government to correct the injustices Quebec has been suffering 
for much too long already. This is an area where economic 
development and constitutional reform are not incompatible. I 
hope to have persuaded the hon. members that the horizons of 
the Bloc extend way beyond sovereignty, even though this is 
indeed our ultimate goal.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the member on his 
opening remarks. I would like to deal specifically with those 
remarks in his speech pertaining to research and development.
<P>
	I would also like to make a general statement through you, Mr. 
Speaker, to members of the Bloc Quebecois. I have been sitting 
here listening to their speeches over the last few days. Quite 
frankly I am impressed and encouraged because I find many of 
the things they are representing and fighting for, with the 
exception of independence, are the same things that we and our 
constituents are fighting for. If we could somehow get them to 
rekindle their spirit toward Canada rather than give up on 
Canada, this could probably be a very  interesting Parliament. 
However we will not try to get that all accomplished in the first 
week.
<P>
	I want to make a point about research and development 
funding. Proportionally the amount of funding for R and D in 
Quebec and in Ontario is relatively the same. We inherited a 
situation where a lot of the cuts were made for us. We are not 
going to cry over a mistake that was made in the past. I want to 
give an assurance that we on this side of the House are looking 
forward to a renewed commitment toward research and 
development in all regions of the country with laboratories 
because funding is more organized around the labs than on an 
across the board basis.
<P>
	If the member reads the red book closely he will see we have 
made a very serious commitment to enhanced research and 
development in the up and coming session.
<P>
<B>(1425) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ménard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my hon. friend for 
his kind words. From the outset I noted that he was an excellent 
parliamentarian and it is a pleasure for me to debate these issues 
with him.
<P>
	I know the Bloc Quebecois is concerned about a number of 
issues, including independence, which it will have the 
opportunity to address.
<P>
	However, I disagree with him when he says that 
proportionally, Quebec and Ontario receive relatively the same 
amount of research and development funding. Moreover, I 
would be happy to provide him with some material on this 
subject so that we can discuss the matter with full knowledge of 
the facts.
<P>
	Which brings me to the role the Official Opposition will be 
called upon to play in the next few years. It will be our job to 
make our friends in the government party understand that 
sovereignty is first and foremost a form of political 
organization, one that is inevitable when one belongs to a 
minority.
<P>
	As for the rest, as a number of members have said in this 
House, there is nothing to stop us from sharing the same 
interests. My hon. friend will agree with us that States share 
interests first, and feelings second. I think we will be able to 
demonstrate in this House that as parliamentarians, in areas of 
mutual interest, we will not hesitate to recommend associative 
formulas.
<P>
	There have been a number of references to an economic 
union. In our program, we speak of sharing the same passport 
and of the free flow of goods. There are many areas in which 
Canada and Quebec can find common ground as two distinct 
nations. Where it hurts, however, is when one is in a minority 
position, and that is why the government will be unable to avoid 
a proper debate on the Constitution.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="178"> 178 </A></B>
<P>
	As Maurice Séguin, a celebrated Quebec historian and the 
first of his kind to advocate independence, once said, a nation 
must demand the right to take full charge of the development 
of its economy, culture and language. And in order to 
accomplish this, it needs to have all the political levers 
required.
<P>
	What we are demanding, with magnanimity and an open 
mind, is the economic leverage we lack to initiate this 
development. I know I can convince my hon. friend that this is 
certainly a debate worth getting into.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John English (Parliamentary Secretary to President of 
the Queen's Privy Council for Canada and </B><B>Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs):</B> Mr. Speaker, I too would like to 
express my congratulations to the member on his address.
<P>
	I was particularly interested to hear his references to the 
Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council. They were of 
particular interest to me because I had a grant from the council 
that I had to give up when I joined this Chamber. I was the first 
person to do so since the member for Winnipeg South Centre 
gave his up in 1974. Also the remarks about Madam Leduc were 
appropriate. She has been an excellent leader of that 
organization.
<P>
	In addition to the possibility of support from the SSHRC in 
the province of Quebec there is the possibility of support from 
the provincial government which I did not have in the province 
of Ontario. In other words, social scientists in Quebec have 
more substantial opportunities for funding for their social 
science research than do social scientists in Ontario.
<P>
	Second, having served on juries for the SSHRC, I recall that 
the province of Quebec received a proportion that was higher 
than the portion of its university population. In terms of the 
member's larger remarks about sovereignty, in considering 
these questions he should recognize that over the past 25 or 30 
years these councils have developed social science research. 
The province of Quebec has had an extraordinary amount of 
research supported by the SSHRC and the federal government. 
Social science research in the province of Quebec has benefited 
admirably by this contribution. In a sovereign Quebec it would 
be lost.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ménard:</B> Mr. Speaker, like my colleague, I appreciate the 
excellent job done by the former chairperson, Dr. Paule Leduc.
<P>
<B>(1430) </B>
<P>
	True, Quebec is particularly active in social studies. There are 
historical reasons for that, and I would like to remind the hon. 
member that, when we consider such issues, the first criterion to 
use is the specific amount of money invested by the government. 
But since the accepted proposals have to go through a peer 
assessment process, there is a second criterion to take into 
account,  and that is the number of requests and research 
proposals received. My colleague would certainly agree with me 
that, historically, in the past, Quebec has submitted more 
proposals than a number of provinces.
<P>
	When we talk about sovereignty, it is not that we do not want 
to recognize but first, we have to recognize a significant and 
historical event, which I am not afraid to refer to in this House. 
The people who were 20 or 30 years old during the fifties felt 
freedom in the air, a feeling originating from Ottawa. I can 
appreciate that and I know some people who can testify to that 
effect, namely Gérard Pelletier and Pierre Elliott Trudeau. A 
number of them published articles in <I>Cité libre</I>, a publication 
which had a lot of influence on intellectuals. What has changed 
today is the fact that Quebec built itself a modern State and 
seems capable of handling all the levers and responsibilities 
granted to a modern state. That is why sovereignty is supported 
by more and more people in our province.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Harvard (Winnipeg St. James):</B> Mr. Speaker, first 
of all I want to congratulate you on your appointment this week. 
It is an appointment much deserved. I am sure that the good 
people of Stormont-Dundas are very proud of you.
<P>
	I also want to offer my sincere congratulations to my good 
friend and colleague and now former room-mate who was 
elected Speaker this week. It is a great honour. I know that he 
will serve us and the whole country very well.
<P>
	Over the past five years I have come to know the Speaker well. 
I can tell Canadians with utmost certainty that he is kind, decent 
and a man of great integrity. We parliamentarians would do well 
to emulate our new Speaker. I will do everything in my capacity 
to do that.
<P>
	I also want to thank the people of Winnipeg St. James for 
electing me to my second term. It is indeed an honour to 
represent the people of Winnipeg St. James. I promise to 
continue to do my best to represent their best interests.
<P>
	It is a privilege to participate in this debate. Before I get on to 
the economy, which is the number one priority for this new 
government, I want to talk about restoring integrity to 
government which is a preoccupation of the Prime Minister.
<P>
	Over the past 10 years Canadians came to believe that they 
could not trust their government any more. In fact, it spilled 
over to include almost all politicians. Canadians thought that 
they could not trust anyone any more. They saw sleaze 
everywhere. Sometimes they saw sleaze when none existed. 
People were in the grips of cynicism. Such was the mood of 
Canadians. They were distrustful and cranky and they used the 
last election to make a point: ``Mess around with me and mess 
around with my country and you're gone, you're history''. The 
people across the way, the Bloc Quebecois, would be very clever 
to take note of that.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="179"> 179 </A></B>
<P>
	That explains, at least in part, why there are so many new 
faces in this the 35th Parliament, over 200 new MPs, an 
unprecedented number.
<P>
	The message we Liberals received, one which we have 
already acted upon, is that Canadians want a government they 
can respect, a government of integrity, a government that works 
with Canadians not against them, a government that says what it 
means and means what it says and, in these difficult times, they 
want a government that is lean but, as the Prime Minister has 
pointed out and as the seconder to the throne speech pointed out, 
not mean. That can be done. A compassionate government can 
make difficult financial decisions. I think that the government 
has made a good start in that regard. We understand that people 
do not want a big spending, pompous government. They want 
one which is down to earth. They want practical managers who 
are careful with the public purse.
<P>
<B>(1435) </B>
<P>
	Examples of such careful decisions were the cancellation of 
the Pearson airport contract, cuts in government departments 
and staff, and the Prime Minister's services such as the sale of 
the so-called Mulroney air force 1 aircraft or the bulletproof 
Cadillac and the proposed reforms to the House of Commons 
budget and procedures where we will see a significant reduction 
in the services offered to members of Parliament.
<P>
	I am enthusiastic about our government's promise to delegate 
more power to opposition MPs in standing committees in 
influencing public policy and determining legislation.
<P>
	These actions all highlight the characteristics of our 
government, frugality, rationality and openness which we 
solidly stood for during the election campaign. These are some 
of the things that reflect the style of this new government, a 
government that wants to earn the respect and trust of 
Canadians.
<P>
	If this is done, and I am confident that the government is well 
on its way to that goal, Canadians will I believe be more 
understanding of the difficult decisions which are bound to 
come. I think the electorate has already responded positively to 
the messages and signals that we have set out.
<P>
	I have taken note of some of the letters I have received and I 
want to read into the record a few of the comments made by 
constituents in letters to me.
<P>
	``Mr. Chrétien is an honest man and I am sure he will work for 
the people in Canada to the best of his ability''. Jean Cutting 
from St. James.
<P>
	Joyce Chapman of St. James writes: ``I am impressed with Mr. 
Chrétien. I have a feeling he is an honest man. What a difference 
from King Brian''.
<P>
	There are more letters. ``I do not know what is involved in the 
job of the Prime Minister but it seems to me that he has a frugal 
nature that will extend to all of his work,'' writes Cathy McLean 
of St. James.
<P>
	Here is one from Carey and Christine Lee of my riding: ``So 
far the Liberals have shown that you don't need all the bells and 
whistles that the Tories had to run a government. I hope it stays 
that way. Keep up the good work''.
<P>
	Those are just some of the comments made by constituents. 
You can tell they are listening and watching, as they should.
<P>
	Let us hope that the days of bad mouthing everything the 
government tries to do are gone for good. We have had enough of 
the neo-Conservative nonsense that government is essentially 
bad, that it is an enemy of the people.
<P>
	Over the period of Thatcher, Reagan, and Mulroney we were 
told that the government should just get out of the way and leave 
most big decisions to the marketplace. I can say that I have the 
utmost respect for the marketplace and, yes, government is far 
from perfect. The neo-Conservative approach to government 
certainly proved that. But in a democracy, Sir, there is a major 
role for government. It can lead. It can act as a partner. It can 
work toward equality and justice for all and it can be a unifying 
force for good.
<P>
	The Prime Minister understands that perhaps better than any 
person in this country. Instead of dismissing government as 
ineffectual this Prime Minister is committed to making 
government work better for all Canadians.
<P>
	Specifically we were given the mandate to turn the economy 
around. Our main objective as stated so often during the 
campaign and in the red book is to create jobs. We were 
committed to that through the throne speech and we will 
continue to be so in the upcoming budget.
<P>
	Canadians want the opportunity to work. Our focus on 
developing opportunities for small and medium sized 
businesses by improving access to capital such as the Canada 
Investment Fund to help high technology firms means better 
employment prospects.
<P>
	The tripartite infrastructure program has already been 
welcomed by politicians at all levels of government and the 
public in general. The reintroduction of the Residential 
Rehabilitation Assistance Program and the establishment of the 
Youth Service Corps will give young people and others who 
have limited opportunities a chance for a good livelihood and 
prosperity. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="180"> 180 </A></B>
<P>
Through partnerships, streamlining and improved accessibility 
to  capital our Canadian economy will bounce back with much 
needed job opportunities.
<P>
<B>(1440) </B>
<P>
	We have already heard criticism on our policy on the deficit 
and the debt. The hon. member for Calgary Southwest 
apparently did not hear alarm bells go off during the throne 
speech debate on Tuesday with regard to the deficit and the debt.
<P>
	I would suggest that the hon. leader of the Reform Party check 
his hearing. The throne speech did mention the importance of 
deficit reduction. Let me just quote a couple of the sentences in 
the throne speech: ``The budget will be tabled in February and 
will include measures to bring the federal debt and deficit under 
control in a means that is compatible with putting Canadians 
back to work''. The throne speech continued: ``The government 
will work with the provinces to ensure that our shared fiscal 
challenge is dealt with co-operatively and creatively''. I think 
that is pretty clear.
<P>
	The throne speech did mention the importance of deficit 
reduction. That is why we proposed a prudent balance to the 
economy as mentioned in the red book. Members can be sure 
that the budget will reflect that.
<P>
	As the Prime Minister so clearly pointed out yesterday the 
best way to control the deficit is through job creation. It creates 
revenues and thus lessens the need for cutbacks to important 
government services.
<P>
	Let us not hear any more talk about the government not being 
serious about the deficit and the debt. Instead of rhetoric and 
corny analogies the opposition should offer alternatives and 
ideas.
<P>
	I am excited about the government restating its commitment 
to a national forum on health. I find a touch of irony here that the 
hon. Leader of the Opposition should come out in defence of 
medicare and social programs. On this issue we agree. However 
this is the same man who wishes to take the province of Quebec 
out of Confederation. Let us try to understand the situation. He 
wants to save our most cherished social program which brings 
Canadians together, but at the same time would rather forsake it 
to break up the country. I do not believe that the people of 
Quebec see it that way. I cannot envisage a Canada without 
medicare and I cannot see Canada without Quebec.
<P>
	The government is completely committed to maintaining 
medicare and the social safety net. Admittedly there are 
problems with the system and we in the Liberal Party have been 
long concerned by the situation, not just since becoming 
government. How better a way for Canadians to influence the 
future of health care in this country than through a national 
forum. We have agencies and ordinary citizens who may come 
together with federal and provincial politicians to strengthen, 
not weaken, universal health care. Not only is medicare a way to 
cover service costs, but it is available to all, not just the rich. The 
only qualifier for our health care system is that one be a 
Canadian resident. We pledge  to keep this inherent right for all 
Canadians in the future.
<P>
	I cannot forget the riding and the province which I am 
privileged to represent in this House. Growth in the Manitoba 
economy in the last 10 years has been well below the national 
average. My good friend from Winnipeg South has done 
research on this and has made that case forcefully, not only here 
in Ottawa but in the Manitoba legislature when he served the 
people of the provincial constituency of Osborne so well. He 
showed graphically with strong evidence that Manitoba when it 
comes to its own economy, compared to the economies of other 
provinces, has not kept up to the national pace, if I can put it that 
way.
<P>
	We now have 12 government MPs from the province of 
Manitoba and as the chair of the Manitoba Liberal caucus I am 
confident that this fine group of experienced and some rookie 
members will work together as a team. I can assure the House 
that we are all Canadians first and foremost.
<P>
<B>(1445) </B>
<P>
	As we say though, we believe Manitoba should have a just 
share of the nation's prosperity. We have an excellent senior 
minister in the hon. Minister for Human Resources and Western 
Economic Diversification. He knows the province of Manitoba 
as well as he knows the back of his hand. His assurances of 
economic growth in our province give me optimism for the near 
future.
<P>
	Manitoba will benefit in the short term through the 
infrastructure program, a $68.3 million investment by the 
federal government and over 10,000 direct and indirect jobs. We 
have also heard of a revamped core area initiative with a wider 
scope. This means good news on the horizon for all the people in 
Winnipeg and not just those in the downtown area.
<P>
	In my riding a vibrant aerospace industry exists. Part of this 
industry took a serious hit when the helicopter contract was 
cancelled. Our party made very clear during the election 
campaign our intention to revoke approval of this deal because 
of its enormous costs. The Prime Minister carried through on 
that promise just days after the election.
<P>
	While layoffs brought all of us pain, especially to the workers 
involved, I still believe there is a strong future for aerospace in 
Winnipeg-St. James. Our government I am sure will do 
everything to make this happen. We have taken a leap of faith in 
our defence conversion program which proposes to adapt 
aerospace technology to civilian projects. With the right policy 
we will see more, not fewer, jobs coming to the province of 
Manitoba.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="181"> 181 </A></B>
<P>
	I also consider the Winnipeg International Airport a 
constituent of sorts. As a regular stop for several domestic and 
international airlines the Winnipeg International Airport can 
become a major centre for air cargo facilities. Studies prove 
that Winnipeg is in an ideal location, at the heart not only of 
North America but between western Europe and the Pacific rim.
<P>
	Government and the private sector are now working to create 
what is called an intermodal transportation service at the 
Winnipeg International Airport. I can see no reason why it 
cannot become a world class facility worth billions of dollars 
and hundreds of jobs for Winnipeg and Manitoba. I believe our 
government will be committed to supporting this initiative.
<P>
	While I am on the subject of the Winnipeg International 
Airport and before I close I would like to voice concerns relating 
to the proposed privatization of the airport. The previous Tory 
government introduced a plan toward privatization but that plan 
has been put on hold by the new government pending a review. I 
think that is prudent on the part of the new government because 
the plan as proposed by the Tories raises many questions.
<P>
	I would like to bring to the attention of this House the Auditor 
General's report on this matter. The report warns that 
privatization could cost taxpayers millions of dollars. In fact the 
Auditor General states that at Montreal, Calgary and Edmonton, 
airports which were recently privatized, revenues are much 
lower than forecast. That shortfall could mean another hit on the 
taxpayer or it could mean slapping user fees on air travellers. 
Air travellers through Vancouver airport are familiar with such 
user fees and I can say that they do not like them.
<P>
	Therefore, airport privatization, at least Tory style 
privatization raises concerns and a government review of how 
that is to be carried out is very much in order. Over and above 
cost concerns I have a concern about accountability or perhaps 
more precisely, a lack of accountability. That accountability as 
proposed by the previous government amounted to little more 
than the printing of an annual report and holding a public 
meeting once a year. To me that is not accountability.
<P>
	If we are going to have a local airport authority to run the 
Winnipeg International Airport, and I am not opposed to this 
change in principle, there must be transparency and openness. 
Business cannot be done behind closed doors. Business plans 
proposed by such an authority that have a substantial impact on 
air travellers, people, or business around the airport or the 
airport itself should be scrutinized publicly. Such an authority 
should manage the airport on a sound business basis. However, 
the airport should make room on its board for people 
representing air travellers, labour and the public at large.
<P>
<B>(1450) </B>
<P>
	This government promises greater accountability. That 
accountability starts here in Ottawa, but it must extend right 
across the country and include all institutions of government. 
The Winnipeg airport is a public facility and it must be managed 
accordingly.
<P>
	This approach fits in with the style of this government, a 
government committed to openness and whose Prime Minister 
is committed to restoring integrity to government.
<P>
	In closing I would like to say that we face some daunting 
problems, repair of the economy and overhaul of social 
programs to name just a couple, and things cannot be turned 
around over night. I believe that if we offer good honest 
government, and I think we will, Canadians will give us the time 
needed to get the job done. The throne speech shows that that job 
has already begun.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean):</B> Mr. Speaker, since this 
is my first speech in the House, I would like to take this 
opportunity to convey my congratulations to you as my hon. 
colleagues have done.
<P>
	Before I put my questions to the hon. member for Winnipeg 
St. James, I would like to focus in on some remarks he made to 
the effect that the Bloc Quebecois and its leader wanted to break 
up this beautiful country. In my opinion, this is not only a 
pejorative, but also an inaccurate statement. I would like to draw 
his attention to several historic footnotes to this debate.
<P>
	First, there was the Act of Union which, in my estimation, 
may have been the beginning of the emergence of the two 
solitudes. As we know, Upper and Lower Canada were united in 
1840. Lower Canada came out on the losing end since at the 
time, it had a much more effective and efficient administration 
than did Upper Canada. The situation was unfair from the 
beginning.
<P>
	I will not review the events of the past 200 years, since it 
would only bring me to cite examples of the way Quebec has 
been treated by English Canada. Specifically, in the case of the 
Meech Lake agreement which set out five minimum conditions 
for bringing Quebec back into the constitutional fold, English 
Canada was unable to accept these conditions and these were 
just our minimum demands.
<P>
	Charlottetown ultimately signalled the end of this debate and 
for one very simple reason. English Canada as a whole rejected 
the Charlottetown accord, claiming that Quebec was asking for 
too much and that the accord was slanted in its favour. Quebec 
rejected the accord for exactly the opposite reason. Our goal is 
definitely not to break up the country. It is to build a nation that 
would work side by side with Canada, share the same economic 
space and viability.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="182"> 182 </A></B>
<P>
	I would like my hon. colleagues to think of our objective as 
being not to break up the country, but rather to complement it 
on our terms.
<P>
	Now then, as far as the economy is concerned, I fail to see how 
the Liberal Party can resolve the problem of the deficit which 
will hit $45 billion this year, tackle the national debt which just 
surpassed $500 billion and create jobs without touching social 
programs. This would seem to me to be a Herculean task, one 
that I personally think is impossible to accomplish. Therefore, 
as we can already see, there are some glitches in the throne 
speech which lead one to believe that this government says one 
thing, but when the time comes to follow through, it will find 
that it cannot.
<P>
	Does the hon. member for Winnipeg St. James agree that a 
parliamentary committee should be set up to look at ways of 
resolving the country's economic problems? This is the course 
of action we are advocating. Why not make this a priority, sit 
down together and review each budget item separately? And 
everybody knows that the bureaucracy must be streamlined. So, 
let us start there before embarking on a crusade against social 
programs, which is what could well happen now. I would like the 
hon. member to answer a question. Would it not be better to have 
an all-party joint parliamentary committee instead of a red book 
or a throne speech which is only wishful thinking?
<P>
<B>(1455) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harvard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
comments. I will try to answer his questions as best as I can.
<P>
	In so far as this Parliament examining the kinds of issues that 
he raised and wants examined, of course we are in favour of that. 
The committees will be up and running in the next few days and 
they are going to be working very hard.
<P>
	The Prime Minister has already pointed out when it comes to 
tax matters, especially the GST, the finance committee will be 
given instructions to do a very thorough job. The finance 
committee will also be taking into consideration not only the 
budget that will be brought down next month but future budgets 
as well.
<P>
	I say very sincerely to the hon. member from the Bloc that 
there will be plenty of opportunity at the committee level to 
discuss all the issues that weigh so heavily on his mind.
<P>
	Let me respond for a moment to his remarks about his leader 
not being a man who wants to take Quebec out of Canada. As far 
as I know, the leader of the Bloc Quebecois calls himself a 
sovereignist.
<P>
	My definition of sovereignty is a country that is sovereign, 
separate from another country. It seems to me when a party 
leader says he wants to establish a country that is sovereign, that 
is a country which is separate and apart from Canada. As far as I 
know the province of Quebec, which is a terrific province and 
one that is as good as any other province in this country, is still 
not a separate country.
<P>
	Let us not try to treat this as some kind of semantic argument. 
This is a political problem and a political issue. No fancy 
dancing with semantics will change it. What we are talking 
about here is a faction in this House that wants to break up the 
country.
<P>
	If the Péquistes in Quebec win the next provincial election 
and if, God forbid, they win the referendum as they promise to 
do, does anyone think that these ladies and gentlemen who call 
themselves the Bloc will be sitting around here representing the 
best interests of Canada? Not on your life.
<P>
	Let us put a stop to this talk about semantics. One more thing. 
The hon. member tries to misquote the Prime Minister when he 
said that the Prime Minister was indicating that we were going 
to solve all our economic problems and revamp our social 
programs in the coming year. Nobody ever said that.
<P>
	When it comes to government and politics, a year is a very 
short period of time. In fact, one never completely solves all 
economic problems and one never completely solves all social 
problems. This is an ongoing thing.
<P>
	We have promised to tackle these problems head on. We are 
going to make some changes. We are going to create jobs. We are 
going to turn this economy around, but it will not be overnight 
and it will not happen in one year.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will try 
to be brief.
<P>
	As you know, my name is Jean-Guy Chrétien and I am 
referring to the letters read earlier by the hon. member for 
Winnipeg St. James. I wonder if the hon. member could tell me 
why the right hon. Prime Minister is so unpopular in Quebec, 
and so well-liked outside that province. The primary problem 
which I encountered in my riding during the six weeks of the 
election campaign was my surname. People would say: ``Your 
name is going to work against you. Some will think that they are 
voting for Jean Chrétien, the leader of the Liberal Party.'' Much 
to my surprise, the name of the party on the ballot was written in 
very small characters.
<P>
<B>(1500) </B>
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> You only have two minutes left.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> I only have two minutes left. Mr. 
Speaker, perhaps the hon. member for Winnipeg St. James could 
use that time to try to explain to us, Quebecers, why the 
popularity of our Prime Minister varies so much?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="183"> 183 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harvard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not pretend to be an expert on 
Quebec politics but I can tell you one thing. I do not know what 
his definition of popularity is but I did check the voting results 
in the riding where the right hon. Prime Minister serves and he 
won with an overwhelming majority. I think that in his riding he 
is a very popular politician. I will make this prediction. After 
four to five years of his prime ministership not only will he be 
exceedingly popular in his own riding but he will be exceedingly 
popular right across the province of Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joe Comuzzi (Thunder Bay-Nipigon):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
will be succinct in my question but I cannot respond with any 
degree of authority for my colleague who is going to give the 
answer as to brevity.
<P>
	I first wanted just to rise and compliment my colleague from 
the riding of Winnipeg-St. James for the excellent presentation 
that he has just given this House with respect to comments on his 
speech from the throne. I wanted to do that because of the very 
strong relationship and love between the people in his riding and 
all ridings in Manitoba and those of us in northwestern Ontario 
in the centre of this great country of ours. We have always felt 
that. What happens basically in Manitoba and in the city of 
Winnipeg and what happens in Thunder Bay and northwestern 
Ontario is that we both feel each other's reverberations. There is 
a jointness and a oneness there that we share from the centre of 
Canada.
<P>
	Let me make this comment. I will try to be succinct. From the 
interventions that we heard and the remarks my colleague made 
there are so many things that they both talked about that bring us 
together: the grain business is vital to Manitoba and Quebec; the 
aerospace industry is vital to Manitoba and to the future of 
Quebec; the transportation industry and the local airport 
authority which Dorval and Mirabel have already implemented 
and which the city of Winnipeg is on the threshold of 
implementing brings us together. There are other areas of 
mutual interest that they both spoke about that lead us to being 
together in this country. I just wanted to compliment my 
colleague and my friends on the other side. There are many 
issues that should bring us together.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to begin by adding my congratulations to those which 
have already been expressed to the Speaker of this House on his 
election to a post of great trust and responsibility. I hope my 
words will not be taken as a mere formality because they are 
most sincerely meant.
<P>
	Members of this House chose their Speaker in a free and 
democratic vote. We hope it will be the first of many free and 
democratic votes in this Parliament. I believe their vote was a 
clear indication of members' confidence in the Speaker and his 
ability to preside over this Chamber fairly and effectively.
<P>
	I also congratulate the right hon. Prime Minister and members 
opposite on being given the opportunity to form the government 
of this great country as well as all members here for earning the 
confidence of fellow citizens in their home ridings.
<P>
<B>(1505 ) </B>
<P>
	Voters in the riding of Calgary North have allowed me the 
great privilege of representing them in the Parliament of their 
country. I want to take the opportunity of my first speech in the 
House of Commons to once again express to the citizens of 
Calgary North sincere thanks for the confidence they have 
placed in me and in the Reform program which I intend to work 
for as I work for them.
<P>
	Other members will be interested to know that the riding of 
Calgary North has the largest population of any of the 26 Alberta 
ridings. New residential areas are continually being built in 
Calgary North and our people are forward looking, dynamic and 
working hard to build sound futures for themselves, their 
families and their communities.
<P>
	It has been my pleasure to meet and talk with many of them in 
recent months and I am determined to do my very best to provide 
the competent and trustworthy representation they want and 
deserve.
<P>
	In the many hours I have spent talking with Canadians in 
Calgary North I have heard two messages loud and clear. One is 
a real concern and growing anxiety about the mismanagement of 
this country's finances. The people of Calgary North like most 
Canadians do understand that there is a connection between the 
enormous amounts of debt which successive governments have 
run up and the difficulty people are having in finding stable jobs 
with good incomes.
<P>
	Excessive government spending has led to more and higher 
taxes. Taxes are like weeds in a garden. Let too many grow and 
pretty soon there is not enough soil left to grow flowers.
<P>
	The second message is the focus of my own reply today to the 
speech from the throne. It is this. Canadians have a profound and 
disturbing distrust for the institutions of government and for 
politicians in general. It is no secret how this has happened. 
Politicians tell us they will do certain things. They do something 
different.
<P>
	We try to tell politicians what we want them to do. They do not 
listen. Yet it is our money they are spending and it is our future 
they are deciding.
<P>
	That is why I together with many other Canadians in Calgary 
North and elsewhere applaud the statement in the speech from 
the throne which reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The government is committed to enhancing the credibility of Parliament. 
Changes will be proposed to the rules of the House of Commons to provide 
members of Parliament with a greater opportunity to contribute to the 
development of public policy and legislation.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="184"> 184 </A></B>
<P>
	I would like to inform the government and the members in 
this House that the people in Calgary North would be all for 
this. They want and are prepared to contribute to the 
development of public policy and legislation through me as 
their elected representative. In fact since the election they have 
been working with me to set up mechanisms which will 
genuinely allow me to inform, consult with, and be advised by 
constituents.
<P>
	Less than a month following the election over 300 people 
packed a school gym in my riding for our first constituency 
meeting to discuss how this could best be done. Out of this 
meeting and through subsequent consultations have and will 
come many excellent recommendations. We will hold regular 
public constituency meetings to discuss key issues and 
legislation which come before this House.
<P>
	Constituents have requested regular communications about 
what is happening here and they want to know how government 
activities will affect their lives. They want their say on major 
legislation and that is why we are designing ways to get their 
input before I come here to vote.
<P>
	In early March we will discuss the federal budget at a public 
constituency meeting. The people will tell me which budget 
initiatives they support, which do not carry their judgment and 
where this is so what alternatives they would recommend. This 
is a constructive approach and one which the people of Calgary 
North believe is consistent with the principles of representative 
democracy which this House has been entrusted to uphold and to 
practise.
<P>
<B>(1510 ) </B>
<P>
	Calgary North constituents are also able to participate in 
question period by sending questions they want asked of the 
government to the fax line and voice mail number installed in 
our Reform parliamentary office. People are demanding that the 
parliamentary process must be opened up and made more 
relevant to the real needs of Canadians.
<P>
	Believe me, they will be watching. They are watching these 
proceedings and the highlights of the daily question period on 
the nightly news to see if the decorum and attitude in this place 
will truly change.
<P>
	When Canadians watch television they expect to see the body 
checking, cheering and jeering left to Hockey Night in Canada, 
but when they watch Parliament they want to see us put the puck 
in the net. They want and look to us to work together to find real 
answers to real problems facing this country.
<P>
	The decisions taken in this House must reflect the will of the 
people of Canada expressed through their legitimate 
representatives and not just the will of a small group of 
ministers and bureaucrats who advise them. Government 
proposals must be tested and balanced by the people themselves.
<P>
	In this 35th Parliament I believe the courage to demonstrate 
faith in the democratic system by making this possible would 
prove to be justified. It is clear not only to myself as a new 
member but to all members that there now exists an 
unprecedented and genuine desire in this House for new 
directions and new approaches.
<P>
	I sincerely believe that we want this Parliament to operate for 
the people of this country by consulting them meaningfully and 
by seeking direction from them. I and the Canadians I represent 
are willing and waiting to see whether the good intentions which 
have been expressed in the speech from the throne to enhance 
the credibility of Parliament will be implemented and whether 
the words will be matched by the deeds.
<P>
	I would appeal to this government to allow members of 
Parliament to do the job we came here to do. I hope it will not 
allow our reports and recommendations to this House and to the 
government to gather dust on some shelf. I would ask that all 
members be allowed to vote freely in consultation with the 
people they were elected to speak for. We want this House to 
operate in such a way as to provide us with the opportunity to 
make a real difference and to carry out the wishes of our 
constituents.
<P>
	I conclude by affirming to the people of Calgary North my 
sincere intention to represent to the best of my ability their 
interests, concerns and aspirations for themselves and for their 
country.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jane Stewart (Brant):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
congratulate the hon. member on her speech. It was very well 
presented with some very good ideas.
<P>
	I just wanted to comment that in fact many of the ideas that 
she suggested certainly have been used by my colleagues in the 
Liberal Party. I know in talking with many of the members that 
they have used faxes for a number of years to connect with their 
constituents. In talking to others they have effectively used 
householders to communicate new and innovative ideas with 
members of their ridings.
<P>
	For myself, I have had a forum on finance already as the 
member is suggesting she is going to do in her riding. It has been 
very effective and very useful. I think many of the things that the 
hon. member is talking about are in fact things that are done by 
individual members and they do not require specific legislation.
<P>

Richelieu is raising a point that the translation was not working, 
so I will give the floor back to the member for Brant.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Stewart (Brant):</B> Mr. Speaker, what I would like to say 
to the hon. member is that her suggestions are very good. I think 
some of them are not necessarily new. Perhaps they felt out in 
the wilderness in the west because they have not been 
represented by Liberals in the very recent and in the long term.
<P>
<B>(1515 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ablonczy:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the kind remarks of 
the hon. member for Brant whom I have met and hope to get to 
know better. Her remarks underscore the fact that there is a 
genuine and possibly unprecedented desire in Parliament for 
new directions and for doing things differently. Members are 
very much determined to consult their constituents and to 
represent them truly.
<P>
	That is the point at which we have some question marks, or at 
least I do as a new member. It is all very well to consult with 
constituents, talk to them, to have meetings and to hear what 
they have to say. However if we come back here and we are told 
how to vote, what is the point? Their input does not mean 
anything.
<P>
	When our constituents tell us they want us to represent them 
and voice their desires and concerns because they are paying us 
to do so since they cannot be here, we have to be free to do that. 
We cannot have our parties telling us: ``You cannot vote that 
way. We have decided to do something different''.
<P>
	That is the reform we must have in the House and that is what 
we are going to keep working for. We have to support that 
together. If not just our particular caucus but all members have 
the drive and determination to achieve that, it will turn this 
House upside down and make it truly a House of the people 
which it was meant to be.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> There is one minute 
remaining in the five minute question and comment period. I 
will allow one short question and, hopefully, the answer will be 
equally short.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères):</B> Mr. Speaker, first of 
all, I would like to congratulate and thank my hon. colleague 
from Calgary North for her speech. Listening to our colleagues 
from the Reform Party, I note an underlying concern having to 
do with members gaining the ability to make a greater 
contribution as well as reducing government spending and 
generally putting government finances in order. We must, I 
think, salute the sense of initiative and determination of the 
Reform Party in that area.
<P>
	However, I am somewhat surprised to hear them go on and on 
about the need to put government finances in order, after having 
heard yesterday the hon. member for Calgary Southwest blame 
the Bloc Quebecois for bringing up the constitutional issue a 
number of times in this place. The speakers who spoke after him 
asked questions dealing with various issues, like free votes, free 
trade-which reflected the obsessive fear you can often find in 
English Canada on that subject-and self-government, but very 
few questions relating specifically to government finances and 
fiscal consolidation.
<P>
	Of course, I would like to press on with this issue. So much so 
that I will ask my hon. colleague from Calgary North if the 
Reform Party would consider supporting the proposal the Bloc 
Quebecois put forward several weeks or months ago to strike a 
special committee to examine, item by item, all the tax and 
budget expenditures of the federal government.
<P>
	I would be interested in hearing what my colleague from 
Calgary North has to say on that. This would allow us, in fact, to 
know better where to make cuts, so that social programs and 
those intended to provide assistance to the poor would not be 
such easy targets.
<P>
	Can our hon. colleagues from the Reform Party tell us 
whether or not it would be possible to set up a parliamentary 
committee to go over all government tax and budget 
expenditures, item by item?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ablonczy:</B> Mr. Speaker, that does not sound like a set up 
for a one-minute answer.
<P>
	In answer to my colleague's question I would say that Reform 
certainly would be very open to anything that could help the 
government get its spending under control. I believe many 
people in Quebec voted against the past government very much 
because they rejected the fiscal policies and mismanagement 
that have practically ruined not only the province of Quebec but 
our entire country.
<P>
	We have to get a grip on that. I think as members we have a 
mandate to do that. Our people want us to do that. We would be 
very happy to co-operate with and support anything that would 
assist in doing that.
<P>
<B>(1520) </B>
<P>
	On what we would cut back, I would commend to my 
colleague a study of the program we put forward during the 
election called our zero and three plan to balance the federal 
budget over a three-year period of Parliament. It would be 
interesting for the member to know-and a lot of people do not 
know it-that our plan balances the federal budget while 
preserving funding for important social programs like health 
care, education and pensions for people who need pensions.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="186"> 186 </A></B>
<P>
	A lot of people are not aware that is something that has been 
done, with figures attached. We have been promoting such a 
program during the election and will continue to promote it. 
We know that Canadians put the highest priority on social 
programs like health care and education. Our program to 
balance spending does not jeopardize those programs. In fact 
it ensures, we believe, that those programs will be sustained 
into the foreseeable future for when I am older and need most 
of them and many Canadians are in the same boat.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to take this opportunity to congratulate you on your appointment 
as a deputy speaker. I also want to take this opportunity to 
congratulate the Speaker on his election to that office. While 
this position has been a challenge over the years, the 
unprecedented number of new members in this 35th Parliament 
may provide the most difficult challenge of all.
<P>
	As one of the new members I will do my best to learn the rules 
as quickly as possible and in so doing make both our jobs a little 
easier. Under your guidance, Mr. Speaker, I sincerely hope the 
House will enjoy the same harmonious relationship that exists in 
the Ontario caucus of my party.
<P>
	My congratulations go out to all members on their election or 
re-election to this new Parliament. From the number of new 
members it would appear that being re-elected was a much more 
difficult task, so a special bouquet goes to those members.
<P>
	To those who voted for me in my riding of Simcoe Centre, I 
want to say how much I appreciate the honour and the 
opportunity to represent them in this House. The trust my 
constituents have placed in me will not rest lightly on my 
shoulders as I work hard to be deserving of that honour.
<P>
	A special thanks also goes to my wife and my family for their 
love, support and hard work on my campaign.
<P>
	I have always regarded my riding of Simcoe Centre as 
grassroots Ontario with a good mix of industry, tourism and 
farming. It has been said that as Simcoe Centre goes so goes 
most of Ontario.
<P>
	My riding is named for the first Lieutenant-Governor of 
Upper Canada, John Graves Simcoe, and like the governor the 
riding has played an important role in the development of this 
province and this nation.
<P>
	The agricultural community in Simcoe Centre has been a 
mainstay of the local economy since the land was first opened up 
in the early 1800s. Towns have gained prominence such as 
Alliston, Ontario's potato capital. Alliston is also famous as the 
home of Nobel prize winner Sir Frederick Banting, 
co-discoverer of insulin.
<P>
	As a place to work and play, Simcoe Centre offers a quality of 
life that is second to none. Hundreds of thousands of people 
come to visit each year, to shop and dine as they enjoy both 
skiing and cottaging in the region. Between the shores of the 
world's largest fresh water  beach in Wasaga and beautiful Lake 
Simcoe we offer outstanding year-round recreation and leisure 
activities.
<P>
	My riding also includes Canada's largest military training 
base, Base Borden, which has played an important role in the 
defence of this country since World War I.
<P>
	I would be remiss if I did not speak about my own city of 
Barrie which is central to my riding and is the largest city. Barrie 
enjoys its location around the tip of Kempenfelt Bay. Its 
manufacturing base and service economy are prime examples of 
what the hard work and entrepreneurship of Barrie residents can 
produce.
<P>
	Being situated just an hour's drive north of Toronto, one of the 
world's truly great cities, we can enjoy the best of both worlds in 
Simcoe Centre.
<P>
	When I made the decision to seek office I was certainly aware 
of the low image of politicians held by many Canadian people. 
However as I went door to door I was surprised and shocked at 
how deeply these feelings were held. Voter after voter 
complained that politicians had lost touch with them, were only 
hearing what they wanted to hear, and were not to be trusted. Far 
too often I heard this comment: ``I will not be voting. You are all 
the same''. To me that hurt more than any other response.
<P>
<B>(1525) </B>
<P>
	In addition to the cynicism and lack of trust, the main issues 
within Simcoe Centre were the never ending and ever increasing 
tax burden as well as the economy and job creation. Simcoe 
Centre and indeed all of Canada is on the verge of a tax revolt. 
The huge underground economy is evidence of how close we 
are.
<P>
	As a youngster I was told there were only two sure things in 
life: death and taxes. Little did I know then that one was going to 
cause the other. Unless we are going to get government spending 
under control we will never eliminate the deficit so that we can 
offer Canadians tax relief.
<P>
	Deficits and debt are the most serious issues we face. All 
others are pale by comparison. Indeed the answer to job 
creation, stimulating the economy and saving our social safety 
nets, is directly tied to the solution of this problem.
<P>
	I campaigned very hard on this issue and was disappointed the 
throne speech contained no plans for substantial reductions in 
government spending. Many times I have been asked why I 
chose to seek office. There are two words that best describe my 
desire and conviction to come to Ottawa. They are Jessica and 
Nicholas, my grandchildren. The realization that I have been 
part of a generation that had lived beyond our means and was 
now leaving a huge debt on their shoulders did not sit well with 
me. I had to run for office and try to do something about it.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="187"> 187 </A></B>
<P>
	The decisions we make in this 35th Parliament will not 
greatly impact on our lives, but they will influence 
tremendously the Canada our children and grandchildren 
inherit.
<P>
	One of the most encouraging points in the speech from the 
throne was the commitment to parliamentary reform. Trust is a 
two-way street. If we are to earn it from our constituents we 
must be prepared to place a level of trust in them.
<P>
	Canadians have said very clearly they want more voice in the 
decisions affecting their lives. The Citizens' Forum on Canada's 
Future chaired by Mr. Spicer listened to 400,000 Canadians as 
well as another 300,000 Canadian elementary and secondary 
school students.
<P>
	One of the strongest messages the forum received was that 
Canadian people had lost faith in their political leaders. They 
did not feel their governments, especially at the federal level, 
reflected the will of the people. They did not feel that they had 
the means at that moment to correct it. Many of the participants 
were prepared to support substantial change of the political 
system if they would result in a responsive and responsible 
political process and in responsive and responsible political 
leaders. The forum cost the Canadian taxpayers about $27 
million. However, if we can change and respond to this message, 
it will be a bargain.
<P>
	If there is a constant in today's world, it is change. After 48 
years of Tory representation Simcoe Centre voted for change. I 
thank it for that. With the improvements in communications and 
technology changes are occurring within an ever shrinking 
timeframe. Many of us are reluctant to change but change we 
must. This Parliament must examine new approaches to the way 
existing institutions and procedures are used. Changes must be 
made so that members can be made more responsive to their 
constituents and more responsible in the exercise of their 
judgment.
<P>
	The time to look at these things differently has never been 
more important or opportune. With over 200 new members we 
have a window of opportunity for parliamentary reform that 
must be taken advantage of. There should be changes such as 
amending the Canada Elections Act to eliminate clauses that 
place members of Parliament in a position beholden to their 
national party executive or party leaders rather than their 
constituents.
<P>
	We should amend the MPs' oath of office such that they swear 
a fundamental allegiance to their constituents as well as to the 
Queen. We should place restrictions and limitations on the 
number and types of orders in council permitted by a 
government during its term in office. In the interim my caucus 
will strive to make parliamentary committees effective in 
reviewing any regulations before implementation.
<P>
	We should insist all laws that apply to individuals in the 
private sector should apply equally to the Government of 
Canada, its personnel, its agencies and Parliament. On Monday 
the Hon. Gilbert Parent in his acceptance speech indicated the 
comfort he felt in the comments made during the past weeks 
about restoring dignity and respect in the House. Doing things 
differently, civility and parliamentary reform are words that I 
have heard and give me hope that the will exists to bring about 
change.
<P>
<B>(1530) </B>
<P>
	In closing I will again make reference to the Spicer 
commission report. The final paragraph in the report was not a 
quote from Mr. Spicer or one of his commissioners. These are 
the words of one of the citizens who participated and I quote: 
``No hyperbole or political hedge can screen any member of any 
legislature who thwarts the will of the people on this matter. The 
voters are watching and waiting''.
<P>
	The previous government ignored this message at its peril. I 
trust and hope this 35th Parliament will not make the same 
mistake.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John English (Parliamentary Secretary to President of 
the Queen's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to 
congratulate the member for Simcoe Centre for his excellent 
address. Like him when I campaigned in my constituency I did 
hear those kinds of remarks about politicians.
<P>
	However, there is a larger problem with the question of 
representation that he is talking about. In the House of 
Commons over the last few days we saw the example of a 
question from a constituent that was sent in to the hon. member 
for Calgary Southwest. This person was a doctor. It seems this 
method of gaining public opinion, replying on a fax which you 
pay for and secretaries in some cases when you can afford it, 
illustrates the kinds of difficulties faced with making 
democracy more representative. The previous speaker from the 
Reform Party related the same difficulties.
<P>
	We have heard questions from the Reform Party about reform 
of RRSPs. I recall reading recently in the newspaper that only 
four out of ten Canadians use RRSPs and there is certainly a role 
for government if that is the case. Only about 20 per cent of 
Canadians make the maximum contribution allowance to 
RRSPs.
<P>
	When I was canvassing in my constituency I encountered 
people who were in opposition to the gun control legislation. I 
make these comments with respect because it is a broader 
question for all of us who are seeking to represent our 
constituents. These people said they were joining the Reform 
Party because they were told to do so by their local executive. 
All of these things strike me as a real problem with the 
member's definition of what representative democracy is. I 
believe it was the Prime Minister who said that you are the 
grandchildren of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="188"> 188 </A></B>
<P>
the Social Credit movement. The Social Credit  movement 
raised these questions in the province of Alberta many years ago 
and it did not follow through with them despite three decades of 
government.
<P>
	How can you ensure that those who are not wealthy and those 
who do not represent special interests and those who do not have 
access to fax machines can be heard as well as the people we 
have heard from before.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Simcoe Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. 
member for Kitchener for his question. I do not think I indicated 
in my speech that solving the problem of representing 
constituents was an easy one. It is not and there is no member of 
my party who is confused about that.
<P>
	I feel that what has happened in the past is that governments 
have responded to the special interest groups. They are the ones 
who have had the ear of government to a larger degree. Average 
Canadians, the ones who are paying the bills, are the ones who 
have not been heard from. It is incumbent on me and I believe 
my party members share this feeling that we must go out into our 
ridings with town hall meetings, meet the people, talk to the 
people but more importantly to listen to the people about what 
they have to say about what is going on in this place, what we are 
talking about and the decisions that are being made. That is the 
challenge that faces me. I am going to meet that challenge 
because when I go back to my riding I am going to maintain that 
contact with the people.
<P>
	I believe that is the main factor that caused the upheaval we 
experienced in this House after this past election. The people 
who sat here had lost touch with their constituents and the result 
is what we have here today. We want to make sure that we do not 
lose that contact, that we keep in touch with the average 
Canadian and not be heavily influenced by those special interest 
groups that have captivated our ear.
<P>
<B>(1535 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pat O'Brien (London-Middlesex):</B> Mr. Speaker, let 
me join in congratulating the hon. member for Simcoe Centre on 
his maiden speech and on his election to the House. He was the 
only member as we know to resist the Liberal juggernaut in 
Ontario and he is therefore extra due for congratulations.
<P>
	I share one thing with the hon. member. Simcoe is the 
birthplace of Sir Frederick Banting and London is known as the 
city where he began to do his important work at the University of 
Western Ontario.
<P>
	That leads me to my question for the hon. member. The 
Reform Party is very concerned with deficit reduction as indeed 
all members of this House are or should be. In the campaign it 
became clear to me that the Reform Party proposals on the 
health care plan for Canada would give too much leeway to the 
provinces, that in fact in the name of deficit reduction it would 
threaten the universality of our health care program. I have yet 
to hear that adequately explained by a member of his party.
<P>
	I give the hon. member the opportunity now and I ask through 
you, Mr. Speaker, how they can ensure that when provinces are 
given such leeway to decide what health care would be like in 
their provinces that does not in fact jeopardize in an insidious 
way the universality of the health care system of which all 
Canadians are so proud.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Simcoe Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. 
member for his compliments on my election. I am considered 
the green dot in a sea of red. It was the subject of much media 
attention to see what this giant killer looked like. They were 
some shocked when they found I was only five-foot-four.
<P>
	To deal with the question, health care in this country is in 
grave peril. Our position is that the system must be saved. Our 
provinces have the constitutional responsibility for health care. 
When we brought in health care the federal government was 
supporting the provinces on a 50-50 cost-sharing basis. That 
position has declined to the point where I think it is something 
like 30 per cent coming from the federal government and is 
heading in an even lower direction to the point where the federal 
government in a few years time will no longer be participating in 
a cost-sharing plan for health care.
<P>
	By virtue of that mere fact it will end up with the provinces 
having that responsibility which I and my party members feel is 
properly their responsibility. They are the ones who are closest 
to the people in delivering health care. They are the ones who 
will ultimately answer to the voters on the job that they do in 
running the health care system. We think the responsibility 
properly belongs there.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Roger Simmons (Burin-St. George's):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it has been a marvellous week and this kinder, gentler House is 
soothing. It is absolutely soothing. I am hearing rumblings 
among the old boys and girls that it is not like it used to be. I 
admit I used to love having a spar or two with John Crosbie from 
St. John's West and we are going to miss fellows like Crosbie, 
but we are also going to miss people like Bernie Valcourt and 
Michael Wilson. You know there are some things you do not 
mind missing.
<P>
	I am proud to stand as I have done either here or in the 
legislature in St. John's for the past 20 years and represent the 
people of the south coast of Newfoundland and since 1988 a 
chunk of the west coast of Newfoundland as well with the 
expansion of the riding that is now Burin-St. George's.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="189"> 189 </A></B>
<P>
	Let me tell you about those people. There is George Sam 
Fudge, a fisherman in his forties from a community called 
François, a community of 150 people, who until a year or so 
ago when I last spoke to him personally had never in his 30 
years of fishing drawn a cent of unemployment insurance. 
There is at least one Newfoundlander out there who is not on 
UI 42 weeks a year.
<P>
	There is Minnie White who was here in Ottawa a few weeks 
ago to receive the Order of Canada because she is one of the best 
accordion players in Canada and is making quite a contribution 
to preserving the Irish tradition in Newfoundland from her 
community of Tompkins.
<P>
	There is Misel Joe, a proud Micmac in his late thirties, who 
has been both chief and spiritual leader of his Micmac band at 
Conne River in my riding. There is Lisa Cheeseman who is for 
the moment in Kingston, in the riding of my colleague, the hon. 
member for Kingston and the Islands, at the Royal Military 
College, but who before that was at the Collège militaire royal 
de Saint-Jean where she had taken second place in her 
engineering class there.
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	There is Tommy LaFitte who is 103 years old and whose 
father came from France. Tommy, his son and I celebrated his 
100th birthday at the SkyDome in Toronto.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Yes, these are the people for whose voice I am here, these and 
86,000 others in 158 communities stretched along 1,500 miles 
of rugged coastline.
<P>
	I am, as I have been for 20 years, their man in Ottawa. I am not 
Ottawa's man in Burin-St. George's. I have not come here to 
blindly support government policies, but rather to help craft 
policies which will help my people in Burin-St. George's and 
to oppose those which do not help them. That is why I support 
the extension of custodial management beyond the 200-mile 
limit to preserve our fisheries, but it is equally why I oppose 
with everything in me the GST.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, as you can see, I represent 
franco-Newfoundlanders. There are three small villages on the 
Port au Port peninsula: Grand'terre, l'Anse-aux-Canards and 
Cape St. George where people protect their tradition, their 
culture and the language of their Acadian ancestors who came to 
Newfoundland following the 1755 deportation. Furthermore, 
many others decided to stay in my riding when they came off 
French ships during the last century.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Yes, the Micmacs are there also and the Scots came and the 
Irish, the Welsh and the English so that today Burin-St. 
George's is one of the more culturally diverse areas of eastern 
Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I was not born a Canadian. In 1948, my parents requested 
voted to become Canadians. My country was Newfoundland and 
it still is Newfoundland. But these days, it is also Canada. The 
people of Newfoundland did renounce their independence 45 
years ago, not at all; they just adopted a larger independence.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	That larger independence will stand us in good stead not far 
from now when Canada takes over custodial management 
beyond the 200-mile limit of our fish stocks.
<P>
	Who in his or her right mind would ever suggest that the 
dominion of Newfoundland, the republic of Newfoundland and 
Labrador could have ever hoped to have tackled alone the entire 
world on that important issue?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Independence and no more semantics. I say this to my Bloc 
Quebecois colleagues. I also want to say something else to the 
Leader of the Opposition and his colleagues, particularly the 
member for Richelieu, the member for Saint-Hubert and some 
others who were here during the last session and who surely 
remember what I said in this House two years ago, and I quote:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``I will vote for a motion any day that runs this crowd clean 
out of this place once and for good. I will go for that motion 
because they do not belong here.''
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Yes, Mr. Speaker, I said that. But I was wrong, very wrong. In 
fact, during the election campaign, I was offended from time to 
time with some people suggesting that the Bloc candidates did 
not have a right to sit in the Parliament of Canada. That 
suggestion is ridiculous and even insulting. Those people 
wanted to deny others what they were claiming as having the 
right to do. The day that we start considering some viewpoints as 
acceptable or unacceptable in this Parliament, we will be 
imposing limits on democracy.
<P>
<B>(1545) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	There are only three requirements to get here: We have to be 
18 years of age, and good Lord most of us look 18 to me; we have 
to be a Canadian citizen; and we have to get ourselves elected. 
Those are the only three requirements to get here. Nobody looks 
behind and says: ``The member for Simcoe Centre, now what 
does he represent? No that is not acceptable. What does the 
member for Nanaimo-Cowichan represent? Oh, that is 
acceptable''. We do not do it that way. We say: ``You  are 18, you 
are a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="190"> 190 </A></B>
<P>
Canadian and you got yourself elected. Come on in''. You get 
past the bar if you satisfy those three requirements. That is how I 
got here. That is how the NDP got here and even a couple of 
Tories made it here that way. How democratic can we get? Why 
should it be any different for the Bloc?
<P>
	My new friend from Simcoe Centre voiced his 
disappointment here yesterday over the focus during 
Wednesday's sitting on the issue of constitutional matters. I 
have to tell the member that I share his view on that. The 
constitutional future of Quebec, I say to my friends in the Bloc 
and also to my friends on this side particularly my friends from 
Quebec, is a crucial subject, but it is not going to be resolved in 
this Chamber.
<P>
	Parliament has no mandate to arbitrarily decide the future of a 
province. Imagine the uproar there would be if the government 
leader stood up one day and put down a motion to talk about the 
future of Saskatchewan or New Brunswick without having 
consulted the people most directly affected, the people of that 
particular province. Surely it is the people of that province who 
must decide.
<P>
	I say this kindly but I say it firmly and with conviction, those 
who insist on pursuing the Quebec debate here do a disservice to 
the people who sent them here. I trust Quebecers to make the 
right decision when the time comes. The time is not now and the 
place is not here.
<P>
	I have a lot of new-found friends and I do not know what to do 
with them all. My new-found friend, the leader of the Reform 
Party, the gentleman from Calgary Southwest, said that the 
credibility of Parliament would be enhanced by the institution of 
genuinely free votes. He is right. I have to check with my 
colleagues because I am up here agreeing with two Reformers in 
a row and I am about to be run out of here. However, he is right.
<P>
	It is too late on a Friday afternoon, I say to the member for 
Winnipeg St. James, to take him on. It is too late. I am in too 
charitable a mood. I am trying to get psyched up for Sunday.
<P>
	I agree with the leader of the Reform Party. This place does 
need free votes. This place does need a bit of a shaking up. It is 
in that context that I believe the Reform caucus, together with 
the 199 people who are here for the first time, are a breath of 
fresh air around here because there are enough of the old guys 
and girls to keep what is good from the past but not enough to 
block some change and we need some change.
<P>
	I want to say just a word of caution as it relates to the issue of 
the concept of free votes. Do not oversell the idea and do not get 
carried away because it is not the panacea that it looks like at 
first glance. Let us not inadvertently mislead the public on the 
issue that free votes somehow will suddenly double their 
paycheques, lower their taxes and solve all their other problems. 
It is not that simple. Hear me out for a moment.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	Even if we embrace immediately the concept of free votes, I 
give you notice now, Mr. Speaker, that in the overwhelming 
majority of cases I intend to vote with my caucus. I will tell you 
why. I submit that so will the member for Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia. I submit that so will the gentleman from 
Hochelaga-Maisonneuve. I submit that so will people from 
other parties. Why? It is for a very good reason. It has nothing to 
do with being sheep. It has nothing to do with being servile putty 
in the hands of relentless party leaders who will not bridge 
dissent.
<P>
	If I support a government measure perhaps to spend money on 
a youth service corps or to cut defence spending, both policies of 
our government, both of which I support but I throw them in as 
examples, it will be because I have had a hand in crafting those 
policies in my caucus.
<P>
	I assume that when the Reform stood yesterday en masse 
without exception and voted for the subamendment it was not 
because they were a bunch of sheep. It was because they had 
consulted each other on that issue. More to the point, they were 
carrying a pretty strong mandate from their electors on that 
matter.
<P>
	Therefore you can get your jollies out of talking about free 
votes all you want and I will too-and I want some free 
votes-but do not let anybody think, suggest or mislead the 
public on the idea that somehow everybody is going to be voting 
all over the place every day of the week. If that is the case, this 
country is not going to be well served. We would have to wait for 
this Chamber to have a meeting of 295 minds. It is better to have 
Wednesday morning meetings of 52 minds in one room, 54 in 
another room, 177 in a third room, 9 in a fourth room and the 
other 2 in a telephone booth. For my hon. friend from Beauce, of 
course all he needs is a fair-sized mirror.
<P>
	Then when one gets a good consensus after it is fought out in 
that caucus room, come here and let us take a vote on it. If 
someone does not like what the caucus is doing, stand up and 
have a free vote. If five of us do not like what the other 172 are 
saying, stand up. That is a free vote. We did it in this caucus and I 
can name names but will not. Two of them are still members of 
this caucus and the other is not here because he elected not to run 
again.
<P>
	We had the situation a year or so ago on gun control. Three of 
our members stood up in this House and opposed the party 
position on gun control. We were supporting the government 
measure for tighter gun control, the government being the 
Conservative government. All but three of us supported that 
legislation. Three of our people opposed it. Two of them 
continue to be in the caucus and the other would have, had he 
decided to run and got elected.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="191"> 191 </A></B>
<P>
	The government of the day led by a fellow, Mulroney-that 
is his name. He had two people, one of whom is now the Deputy 
Speaker of this Chamber and the other who was the member 
for Calgary Northeast. What happened to them when they voted 
against the GST? They not only had a free vote, they got a free 
ride right out of their caucus the same day.
<P>
	We will in the overwhelming majority of cases be voting with 
our parties, not because we are sheep but because we have 
hammered out our compromises behind closed doors.
<P>
	I will get suspicious if I see a free voter voting free too often. I 
will say to myself: Can he not convince his colleagues of 
anything? Is he a lone ranger? Has he no clout in his own 
caucus? Does he have to come here and vote his own way all the 
time? Why is he not back in his caucus room convincing his own 
caucus of the rightness of his ways? That is what the caucus 
system is all about.
<P>
<B>(1555 ) </B>
<P>
	Yes, we will have free votes, but will it become the order of 
the day. I cannot see why it would. As a Canadian let alone as a 
politician I think it would be a fairly messy way to do business. 
We did not get here by our good looks. One or two of us did 
maybe. The people of Canada did not take us as individuals. 
They embraced the Liberal message in one riding. They 
embraced the Bloc message in another riding and the Reform 
message in another. Each of our parties had very specific 
platforms. And now for someone to stand up and say that has all 
gone out the window and that from now on we are going to be 
real free around here. Real free. Remember that mandate you got 
back there in so and so riding? Forget that buddy, just be free.
<P>
	Some of us understand that any freedom attaches to it 
responsibility. If I exercise my freedom when I stand and vote 
for cuts in defence spending, I will be having a free vote. Just 
because another 176 members happen to be of the same mind on 
that free vote is not my problem. I will be voting because I 
believe in it. I will be voting because that is what my 
constituents told me to do. Now that is about as free as you can 
get. Free does not have to mean being alone. If you want me to be 
an isolationist I will pick some ``comma'' legislation some day 
and stand up against the government just to show that I am a free 
spirit. But who have I helped? How have I helped my 
constituents with that bit of grandstanding?
<P>
	The people of Canada want us to do the right thing and if we 
carry this free vote thing to its conclusion, what we ought to do 
is what the gentleman from Beauce did. All 295 of us should go 
out and get elected without a party label. But Canadian people 
like choices now. They like to say that here is what the Liberals 
stand for, here is what the Bloc stands for and here is what the 
Tories stand for. I think we will take those. I cannot willy-nilly 
having gone through that process say: ``Okay people of Canada, 
thanks now forget it because I am going to be my own man''.
<P>
	Finally, in my last minute or so let me deal directly with the 
amendment put forward by the Leader of the Opposition 
together with the subamendment of the leader of the third party. 
Both of them are well-intended I am sure. I will not read the 
wording because I see my time is running out. But you all know 
the wording. You had better because you voted on it. Both asked 
me, I say with candour but deference, to say that I have no 
interest in putting public finances on a more sound footing. That 
is not true. I do have an interest.
<P>
	Therefore why do they ask me to vote a lie? Why do they ask 
everybody on this side to vote a lie on that particular issue? 
Surely the wording of these motions are classic examples of 
what is wrong with this place. That clever use of well chosen 
verbiage in the hope of creating one-upmanship in the hope of 
sucking somebody in to get him to vote for something he does 
not believe in. That is what is wrong with this place. Oh, that 
clever use of verbiage.
<P>
	I was a bit disappointed that it came from the leader of the 
Reform party and the leader of the Bloc. That they would ask us 
to say that we have no interest. Mea culpa, mea culpa. I have a 
great interest in seeing that public finances are put on a sound 
footing.
<P>
	Did the framers of those two amendments honestly believe for 
one minute, for one millisecond, that nobody on this side, not 
one single soul of the 177 including the crowd over there in the 
Siberian rump on the other side, not one of us is concerned about 
the state of the country's finances? Does anyone in the Reform 
Party believe that for a second? What an insult to 176 people.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Richard Bélisle (La Prairie):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to thank the member for Burin-St. George's for his brilliant 
speech. I would also like to tell him that the province of 
Newfoundland-he will remember for sure when he reads his 
history books-joined the Confederation in 1949.
<P>
	We will recall that the citizens of that province voted in more 
than one referendum before joining Canada in the late 1940s.
<P>
	Would the hon. member from Newfoundland not agree that, 
conversely, Quebecers can vote for their full sovereignty, in a 
second referendum, according to the democratic rules that 
prevail in Canada and in this Parliament?
<P>
	If the citizens of Newfoundland were able to join the 
Canadian federation freely, why would it not be possible for 
Quebecers to withdraw from it freely? That is the essence of the 
democracy that exists in this country and millions of people 
around the world envy us for that.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="192"> 192 </A></B>
<P>
	Being a democrat, the member for Burin-St. George's 
should agree with the Opposition and abide by the Quebecers' 
ultimate decision.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simmons:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for La 
Prairie for his question. In fact, that is precisely what I said in 
my speech. I said that the decision will be made by Quebec 
voters and I also said that it should not be made in this place. I 
am convinced that the time has almost come for Quebecers to 
examine that question. I cannot agree more.
<P>
	As to his reference to the referenda-there were two in 
Newfoundland, in 1948-my father and my mother took a 
decision they believed to be right. I do not dispute the fact that if 
the various areas of a province can decide one way, they also 
have the power and the right to decide another way. This is what 
I said; I said people in Quebec will decide, not the citizens of the 
whole of Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval-Est):</B> Mr. Speaker, following 
consultations with my colleagues on the government side and in 
the Reform Party, I would like to ask for unanimous consent to 
allow the hon. member for Bellechasse to give his speech in 
response to the Speech from the Throne.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Is there unanimous 
consent to authorize the hon. member for Bellechasse to deliver 
his speech in full?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keyes:</B> Mr. Speaker, if the House is adjourned at the 
conclusion of the hon. member's allotted time then given the 
new era of co-operation in the House we would be in agreement 
with that suggestion.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Is there unanimous 
consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse):</B> Mr. Speaker, allow 
me, as is the custom, to congratulate you and all the others who 
will sit in the Chair and play such an important role in this 
House. I have been here just a few days, but I can already 
appreciate the tact and the competence of the Chair.
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
	I especially want to thank the hon. member for Burin-St. 
George's for his eloquent speech on the right to 
self-determination. The member is himself from a nation, in 
fact the only nation to do so in this country, which has freely and 
voluntarily decided, through a referendum held in 1948, to join 
the Canadian federation. If a referendum is the process used to 
join the Canadian federation, it is now clearly established that a 
referendum is also the proper way to create a sovereign State.
<P>
	Since the House started sitting, I have not been surprised by 
the fact that our Liberal friends across the floor keep referring to 
their red book. This book was their election platform and they 
won a majority of seats by referring to it. As well, I am not 
surprised when I hear my friends from the Reform Party talk 
about changes, even cuts-we are not yet dealing with the 
details regarding social programs-and talk about reforming the 
voting process or adopting a different approach regarding 
ministerial responsibility. Indeed, this comes as no surprise 
since the Reform Party's campaign was based on that theme. 
Therefore, why should you be surprised to see a Bloc Quebecois 
member, who campaigned on the sovereignty of Quebec, come 
in this House and talk about Quebec's sovereignty? We were 
elected to do just that. It is our raison d'être. It is the mandate of 
our party to defend and promote Quebec's sovereignty, a 
sovereignty which is not directed against anybody but, rather, 
which is premised on the self-determination of our nation in 
order to be able to treat on an equal basis with any other nation, 
including our Canadian friends and neighbours, who are of 
course particularly close to us geographically, but more 
importantly because of our common past which has promoted 
the development of such strong friendships over decades and 
even centuries.
<P>
	We asked ourselves the question raised by the hon. member 
for Papineau-Saint-Michel who said: ``But who speaks on 
behalf of Quebec?'' I disagree with a lot of comments made by 
the hon. member for Papineau-Saint-Michel, but it is true that 
this question will have to be answered.
<P>
	The hon. member for Burin-St. George's said earlier that 
this is not the place to decide over Quebec's sovereignty. I agree 
with him. The decision will not be taken here; it will be taken in 
Quebec, by Quebecers, who will be asked to vote on the issue 
following a debate which we hope will be as open and as 
enlightening as possible. So, we need to hold a referendum to 
settle once and for all the issue of the legitimate right to speak of 
Quebec, because Quebec never was a truly sovereign state, 
unlike the Dominion of Newfoundland, which, before 1949, was 
as independent as the Dominion of Canada.
<P>
	Without going back to ancient times to establish the rights of 
aboriginal people, we know that Canada existed before 1867. 
We can describe the institutions which have made Canada what 
it is today. I will touch briefly on some of the events.
<P>
	Our first very own institution was set up in 1663 and was 
called the Sovereign Council of New France. Of course, this 
council emanated directly from the French monarchy, an 
absolute monarchy which did not stand for any division of 
power with a Parliament.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="193"> 193 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	We were governed by the Council for nearly a century. Until 
September 1759, we were subject to the authority of the 
Sovereign Council of New France, and as we know from our 
history books, then came the battle of the Plains of Abraham. 
One party's victory was the other's defeat, so that the victory by 
General Wolfe on the Plains of Abraham ushered in a British 
military government.
<P>
	For four years we lived quite peacefully under the authority of 
a military government. Historians do not mention any rebellion. 
The ``Canadiens'', today's Quebecers, although in the majority, 
tolerated and accepted this British military presence.
<P>
	The war between Britain and France ended in 1763, when by 
royal proclamation, Canada was ceded for all time, if there is 
such a thing in this world, to Great Britain.
<P>
	The proclamation of 1763 vested authority in a British 
governor appointed by His Gracious Majesty, the King or Queen 
of Great Britain. Without parliamentary institutions, Quebecers 
became subject to British private and public law.
<P>
	In 1774, the Quebec Act entitled us to the restoration of our 
civil law and to certain parts of British criminal law, which have 
expanded over the years. This was probably the most enduring 
legacy of the British: the principles of British criminal law, 
criminal procedures, habeas corpus and trial-by-jury, which we 
did not have under the French regime. This is a legacy we intend 
to preserve in a sovereign Quebec, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	Around 1778-80, Americans who had remained loyal to the 
British Crown left the American republic and came to Canada. 
Some settled in New Brunswick, others in the eastern townships 
in Quebec and some Loyalists emigrated to Upper Canada, 
today's Ontario.
<P>
	Subsequently, Loyalists in Canada decided to ask Canada, the 
Parliament in Westminster and the British government for the 
same institutions they had in the American colonies. Parliament 
and the British government were in a poor position to refuse 
their loyal subjects, who had often given up land and property to 
come and settle here, to refuse them these institutions.
<P>
	But so as not to put the minority, which was then 
English-speaking, under the French speaking majority, Canada 
was divided in two, Upper Canada and Lower Canada, with a 
legislative assembly for each part that was elected by the people. 
This was the first time that we had a legislative assembly 
directly controlled by the people and answerable only to the 
people. What a fine step in our historical progress!
<P>
	Neverthless, at that time we did not have ministerial 
accountability as it had existed in Great Britain since the 1750s 
or thereabouts. The governor still held most of the powers and 
there was also the legislative council, which he appointed and 
which could object to measures coming from the legislative 
assembly.
<P>
	Problems arose fairly quickly. In the 1820s, conflicts between 
the governor, the legislative assembly and the legislative 
council easily degenerated. As we sadly remember, these led to 
the events of 1837, the Patriots' Rebellion, when twelve of our 
people were hanged following a trial by a court martial 
composed of fifteen members, none of whom was French 
speaking.
<P>
	This was a far cry from trial by jury. Those people were 
hanged under the Durham government and the special council of 
1837.
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	After studying the situation, Lord Durham, as his mandate 
from the British government required, submitted a report saying 
that in order to assimilate the Canadian nation, today's 
Quebecers, the British government should pass a law merging 
the two Canadas.
<P>
	Although we had some 150,000 to 200,000 more people, the 
Union Act of 1840 gave equal representation to both parts. 
Moreover, the Constitution of 1840 said that English was to be 
the only official language. There were no provisions regarding 
ministerial responsibility. We would get that in 1848, at the 
same time as the repeal of the constitutional provisions banning 
the use of French.
<P>
	We now come to 1855, the year of reversal. This is a date we 
should never forget. That was the year that English speaking 
people outnumbered French speaking people for the first time. 
What happened then? As soon as English speaking people 
realized they were in a majority they asked for proportional 
representation. From 1855 on, and increasingly until 1867, they 
were asking for what was refused to the ``Canadiens'', today's 
Quebecers, in 1840. The demand was so pressing that, in 1867, 
the parties agreed on what I call a compromise based on a 
misunderstanding.
<P>
	On one side was Sir John A. Macdonald, who wanted a 
legislative union of all provinces of British North America, with 
a single Parliament. On the other side, representing the Quebec 
way of seeing the issue, was Sir George-Étienne Cartier who 
wanted strong, autonomous provincial governments sovereign 
in their field of jurisdiction, a fact acknowledged in 1883 by the 
British Privy Council in its decision respecting the Hodge v. 
Regina case.
<P>
	This compromise based on a misunderstanding resulted in a 
single document, then known as the British North America Act, 
and now as the Constitution Act of 1867.
<P>
	It so happens that to reconcile two visions so diametrically 
opposite it became necessary to play around with sections of the 
Constitution so that people would be on opposite sides. It is no 
wonder that the courts are constantly being asked to give their 
interpretation of the Constitution. Indeed, the Constitution 
cannot reconcile black and white, cannot say yes and no in the 
same breath.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="194"> 194 </A></B>
<P>
	Every time a province is granted a power, somehow, 
somewhere another section gives the federal government more 
power. The judicial power is a case in point.
<P>
	Under subsection 92(14) of the British North America Act, 
1867, the constitution of provincial courts, both of civil and of 
criminal jurisdiction, is a provincial responsibility; it is very 
clear. However, if you read beyond section 92, you will see with 
great surprise that under section 96, the Judges of the Superior 
Courts, of criminal and even of civil jurisdiction, are appointed 
by the Governor General. A province can set up a court, even a 
superior court, but cannot appoint the judges to that court.
<P>
	They even took further precautions since, in 1867, we did not 
have a Supreme Court. Appeals were launched directly from 
provincial appeal courts to the Privy Council in Great Britain.
<P>
	As a further precaution, section 101 of the British North 
America Act gave the Parliament of Canada sole power for the 
constitution of a general court of appeal for Canada, without the 
consent of the provinces. A few years later, in 1875, the 
Supreme Court of Canada was constituted; the judges there are 
appointed by the governor in council, without having to consult 
the provinces.
<P>
	Which led one of our former Quebec premiers, the hon. 
Maurice Duplessis, to say that in view of the way judges were 
appointed to the Supreme Court, it was akin to the tower of Pisa 
as it was almost always leaning towards the same side.
<P>
	A referendum was never held, despite the repeated calls for 
one by the Leader of the Opposition at the time, Antoine-Aimé 
Dorion, who also happened to be a Liberal. Over and over he 
introduced motions calling for a popular referendum to ratify 
the agreement reached by the Fathers of Confederation, but such 
a referendum was never held. Newfoundland and Labrador were 
the only ones to hold a popular referendum on the issue. Soon 
there will be a referendum in Quebec. Events will run their 
course and we are betting the Quebecers will make the mature 
decision. The fact of the matter is that we have been excluded 
from the process since 1981 when this House asked the 
Parliament of Westminster to amend the Constitution without 
Quebec's consent and in fact over the virtually unanimous 
objections of the National Assembly.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	Of course, we had reached an impasse at the time. The 1980 
referendum had failed to give the Quebec government a mandate 
to negotiate sovereignty.
<P>
	On the other hand, the Prime Minister who had been elected in 
1984 promised at the time to do everything he could to bring 
Quebec into the federation and to make it possible for it to ratify 
the 1981 and 1982 agreements with honour and dignity. For 
some, this was the last chance. All of the Bloc members are 
sovereignists, but we did not all follow the same path to get here. 
Some of us were members of the RIN, the Rassemblement pour 
l'indépendance nationale back in the sixties, while others 
became sovereignists following the failure of Charlottetown. 
They saw that the minimum conditions set out by Mr. 
Bourassa-and we know the meaning of the word ``minimum'' 
when it comes from Mr. Bourassa's mouth-really amounted to 
very little. Some came to it on October 26, 1993, when they saw 
that it was no longer possible to renew this country and that the 
time had come to make a choice, as the hon. Leader of the 
Opposition and some of our colleagues mentioned the other day. 
The time has come to choose between the status quo as we know 
it, since there will be no further amendments to the Constitution, 
and an opening to the world, a willingness to consider all 
possible arrangements, including and mainly, of course, 
arrangements with Canada, since we have already so many 
things in common.
<P>
	We cannot afford to miss this historical opportunity, because 
for our generation and probably the next, it is the last chance. It 
is somewhat like a spacecraft that has to be put back in orbit or to 
get back to Earth: if it misses its window of opportunity, it might 
have to orbit a long time before getting another one.
<P>
	So we have to work very hard in Quebec as well as here in this 
House, where we belong of course. And here I digress for a 
moment to say that I was asked recently in a survey whether I 
sing ``O Canada''. But of course I do, for this anthem was the 
work of Calixa Lavallée and Basile Routhier, referring to the 
French version of ``O Canada''. Read in French, it is the national 
anthem of Quebec. The English version is something entirely 
different. We used to sing ``O Canada'' when our friends 
opposite were singing ``God Save the King'' or ``God Save the 
Queen''. There is a gap between the two versions, through 
nobody's fault though. We followed parallel courses, each 
people created its own destiny.
<P>
	Whether we decide to become sovereign, whether we now 
want boundaries, because we feel that our territory has been 
encroached upon a bit too much, that will not keep us from being 
good friends. Boundaries with your neighbor do not necessarily 
make an enemy of him. When the hedge is put in, you know the 
limits of your territory, you know when you must give and take 
and when you can do whatever you like within the limits of 
decency and acceptability in a free and democratic society.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="195"> 195 </A></B>
<P>
	Therefore, it is to this great gathering that I am inviting 
Quebecers, the referendum gathering that will soon take place, 
the first step being the Quebec election where, in all likelihood, 
a sovereignist government will be elected in Quebec City, and 
then, a provincial referendum that will be, we are all hoping in 
this side of the House, in favour of Quebec sovereignty, but in 
keeping the friendship of Canadians from anywhere in Canada.
