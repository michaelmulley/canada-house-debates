point of order raised deals with a specific aspect of the 
business of supply.  Supply is the process by which the 
government asks parliament to appropriate the funds required to 
meet its financial obligations and to implement programs already 
approved by parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On or before March 1 of the fiscal year that is coming to a 
close the main estimates to cover the upcoming fiscal year for 
every department of government are referred to specific standing 
committees for scrutiny.  Once that consideration is complete a 
committee reports its estimates back to the House.  Committees 
that have not reported by May 31 are deemed to have done so. The 
only exception to the May 31 deadline first implemented in 1986 
is by virtue of Standing Order 81(4), which reads in part: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(a) not later than the third sitting day prior to May 31, the 
Leader of the Opposition may give notice...of a motion to extend 
consideration of the main estimates of a named department or 
agency and the said motion shall be deemed adopted when called on 
“Motions” on the last sitting day prior to May 31; 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is evident from the text I have just quoted that there are no 
provisions in the standing orders to allow anyone other than the 
Leader of the Opposition to propose this extension.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, the standing order does not require that such a 
motion be proposed.  The text is merely permissive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must acknowledge the ingenuity of the hon. member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough in suggesting that an analogous 
situation exists in citation 924 of Beauchesne's sixth edition 
which discusses the division of allotted days among opposition 
parties.  However, I must agree with the hon. government House 
leader when he concludes, on the issue of extension, that the 
standing orders leave the Speaker no discretionary power at all. 
Thus, I cannot grant the hon. member's request to allow his 
motion to proceed in the absence of a motion by the Leader of the 
Opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, the challenge of making the supply process more 
effective continues to bedevil many members of all parties.  If 
members have suggestions and concrete proposals that will enhance 
the quality of the work of the House and its committees, then I 
would encourage them to bring these ideas forward, notably to the 
attention of the Standing Committee on Procedure and House 
Affairs which has the ongoing mandate for scrutiny of our 
procedures and standing orders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the hon. member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough for 
bringing this matter to the attention of the House.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I appreciate your ruling. 
If I might, given the fact that the Leader of the Opposition has 
not availed himself of Standing Order 81(4), and as a result, all 
opposition members, and I would suggest even members of the 
government, cannot avail themselves of this extended period of 
time for examination of the main estimates, I seek unanimous 
consent, as House leader of the fifth party in the House, to 
avail ourselves of that motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  As the Speaker's 
ruling very clearly indicated, the standing orders are permissive 
in that it is a responsibility which lies with the Leader of the 
Opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will consult with the clerk on the request for unanimous 
consent before I ask the question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though the Speaker has just made the ruling that it is out 
of order, the hon. member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough is 
perfectly within his rights as a member to request the unanimous 
consent of the House to proceed as he has suggested.  Therefore, 
the hon. member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough has requested 
the unanimous consent of the House that his motion stand in the 
place of that of the Leader of the Official Opposition.  Is there 
unanimous consent?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to speak today to an issue of concern certainly to 
the residents of Waterloo—Wellington, but also to the people of 
Canada and all members of the House.  It is the issue of 
addressing the needs of victims of crime within the criminal 
justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-79 is an act to amend the Criminal Code (victims of 
crime) and another act in consequence.  It was tabled by the 
Minister of Justice on April 15, 1999.  The bill has been widely 
supported by the public, by victim advocates, by service 
providers and by members of all parties in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The history of Bill C-79 predates its introduction in April. The 
amendments to the Criminal Code were shaped by the work of the 
Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights which thoroughly 
reviewed the role of the victim in the criminal justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to note that the recommendations for Criminal 
Code amendments were unanimous.  These recommendations were based 
on the submissions of victims of crime, victim advocates, victim 
service providers and many others who were actively involved in 
and knowledgeable about our criminal justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These amendments demonstrate the commitment of the Government of 
Canada to engage the people of Canada in discussions on important 
issues.  It also demonstrates how parliamentarians can work 
together collaboratively to achieve shared goals and to work 
together in the interests of all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the past decade we have witnessed many improvements to the 
criminal justice system to ease the burden of victims and 
witnesses.  Clearly there remains room for further improvement. 
While laws, policies, programs and services are available, 
Canadians are largely unaware of the current initiatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The standing committee, in its wisdom, in its review of the 
victim's role in the criminal justice system, carefully examined 
the current legislation of both the federal and provincial 
governments before identifying gaps and recommending change. The 
Criminal Code amendments in Bill C-79 build upon the existing 
provisions regarding the victim impact statement, the victim 
surcharge and the various provisions to make it easier for 
victims and witnesses to provide their testimony. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments also enact new provisions to address the concerns 
of victims regarding their safety, to enhance and expand the 
opportunities for their views to be considered and to encourage 
the provision of information to victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before highlighting the key provisions of Bill C-79, which I am 
certain all members are familiar with, I would emphasize that the 
Government of Canada regards a response to the needs and concerns 
of victims of crime as an ongoing process.  Bill C-79 amendments 
are part of that process, not the beginning nor the end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I indicated, many initiatives have been taken to reform our 
laws to improve the situation for victims of crime, including the 
sentencing amendments in 1996 which required judges to consider 
victim impact statements, and the amendments in 1997 to govern 
the production of personal records of sex offence complaints and 
complainants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government will continue to be responsive to the needs of 
victims of crime.  We will be looking to all members of the House 
for their continued support for current and future initiatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-79 amendments will implement the unanimous 
recommendations of the standing committee.  They will improve the 
existing provisions and enact new reforms.  While these 
amendments will enhance the voice of victims of crime in our 
criminal justice system, they will not, I repeat, will not in any 
way infringe on the rights of persons accused of crime. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1020"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT5"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT5"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1020
<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provisions have been carefully drafted to ensure that all 
rights are respected.  Moreover, the preamble emphasizes that the 
rights of both victims, witnesses and accused persons are to be 
accommodated and to be reconciled where possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments deal with several needs identified by victims: 
the need to enhance the victim impact statement provisions; the 
need to expand protection for victims and witnesses to facilitate 
their participation in the process; the need to ensure that the 
concerns of victims and witnesses regarding their safety and 
security are taken into account when determining whether an 
accused person should be released on bail and the need to revise 
the victim surcharge provisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are important changes and certainly worthy for the House 
to note.  The victim impact statement amendments further expand 
the current regime which provides that the judge consider any 
impact statement prepared at the time of sentencing the offender. 
As a result of the amendments where the victim wants to read the 
statement to the judge at the time of sentencing they shall be 
permitted to do so. This opportunity to present their statement 
will ensure victims that in addition to the requirement that the 
statement be considered it will be listened to by the judge and 
anyone else present in the courtroom at sentencing, including the 
accused. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments will also address a significant concern of 
victims that they did not now know about the opportunity to make 
an impact statement.  I think that is also important in terms of 
its change and what it represents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The code will now require that the sentencing judge ask whether 
the victim has been informed of the opportunity to prepare and 
submit a victim impact statement.  The judge may adjourn the 
sentencing hearing to permit a victim impact statement to be 
prepared in appropriate circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to point out that the victim surcharge provisions 
will be significantly reformed to place the obligation to pay the 
surcharge squarely on the offender as a consequence of 
conviction.  The amount of the surcharge will be fixed at a 
mandatory minimum amount.  The judge, however, will have the 
discretion to impose an increased amount in appropriate 
circumstances or to waive it completely where the offender 
establishes that a payment of this additional penalty would cause 
undue hardship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new surcharge regime will result in a significant increase 
in the revenue available to provinces and the territories to help 
victims.  Moreover, the victim surcharge is a way for offenders 
to account to victims of crime as a group and to acknowledge that 
victims need assistance and services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments will also address the need for the victim's 
safety to be taken into account when an accused person is being 
released on bail.  As a result of these amendments, the 
responsible judicial officer, whether it is the officer in 
charge, a justice of the peace or a judge, may then consider the 
safety and security of the victim in any decision about an 
accused's bail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, where an accused is released pending trial, the 
judge must consider including as a condition of bail that the 
accused abstain from any direct or indirect communication with 
the victim.  Any other condition necessary to ensure safety and 
security of the victim can also be specified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To address the difficulties faced by certain witnesses during 
their testimony because of their age, disability, the nature of 
their victimization, amendments have been included to do the 
following:  to extend to the victims of sexual or violent crime 
up to 18 years of age protections which restrict personal 
cross-examination by self-represented accused persons, by 
providing for the appointment of counsel to conduct the 
cross-examination.  It also permits a victim or a witness with 
mental or physical disability to have a support person present 
while giving testimony.  Finally, it permits a judge to restrict 
publication of the identity of a wide range of victims or 
witnesses where the victim establishes a need for the order and 
where the judge considers it necessary for the proper 
administration of justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This provision will codify the prevailing common law and 
procedure as established by the Supreme Court of Canada and will 
fully respect the need to balance the rights of the victim, the 
accused and the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These amendments will significantly improve the experience of 
victims of crime within the criminal justice system. 
We know that our work is not over and that much more can be done 
to encourage the expansion of services for victims, and to 
encourage the provision of information to victims of crime and to 
all Canadians about our criminal justice system, and to bring 
forward necessary reforms where needed.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-79 amendments are necessary and reasonable reforms.  For 
the 10 years that I sat on the Waterloo regional police service 
as chairman, we very much valued the importance of victims and 
the role they play in the criminal justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I view these amendments to Bill C-79 as a great improvement in 
this area, and I do so on behalf of the residents of 
Waterloo—Wellington and all Canadians.  I thank all hon. members 
in the House for their support of these amendments and for their 
concern for the victims of crime.  This is a very important issue 
that we must deal with expeditiously. 
<P><A NAME="LINK17"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am also very pleased to take part in the debate. I 
noted the comments of the member opposite and I echo much of that 
sentiment having worked in the court system as well.  I know 
there has been an ongoing need and a need that continues with 
respect to the recognition of victims and the need to give them 
the dignity they require after having been victimized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sadly, time and time again in the country there have been 
occasions where victims have felt the wrath of the criminal in 
the community in the first instance, and then once again felt 
victimized by a system that was sometimes not sensitive to their 
needs and their overwhelming feelings of loss after having been 
victimized or preyed upon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a great deal of positive impact that will be felt from 
the implementation of Bill C-79.  I had the pleasure of 
participating in the round table that was referred to by the 
member opposite.  We had an incredible representation of 
stakeholders from across the country from victims' groups.  I am 
very proud to say that from the province of Nova Scotia we had 
tremendous participation, some might argue disproportionate 
participation, but it speaks well to our justice system and the 
sensitivity of my home province of Nova Scotia toward this need 
and this problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The victim impact statement is a matter of law that has been 
around for some time.  It is, for those who might be unfamiliar 
with the concept, an opportunity for a victim to speak directly 
not only to the court but to those assembled and, perhaps most 
importantly, to the offender.  It is an opportunity for victims 
to voice the feeling they might have encompassed as a result of 
what the offender had done to them personally, to their property 
or to a loved one.  The expansion of the victim impact statement 
in its use and in its utilization within the courtroom is a very 
important step forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The knowledge that victims have of these processes that are 
available to them is something that is equally important because 
those tools, if not made familiar to victims, will not serve the 
purpose for which they are set out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Victim impact statements are a very important aspect of the 
healing that has to take place subsequent to the commission of a 
crime and subsequent to the often arduous process that victims 
experience in the court.  That includes the delay, the appeal, 
and often the very rigorous cross-examination and rigorous 
examination of circumstance that occurs in a courtroom.  This is 
part of our legal system.  It is part of the need and necessity 
to observe principles such as the presumption of innocence.  Due 
process has to run its course, but the victims are often left 
feeling that this sterile process does not show enough compassion 
to the pain, not only the external pain but the internal pain 
that comes about as a result of criminal activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through heightened awareness of the use of victim impact 
statements and the necessity now of the codification of the 
requirement that a judge inquire of the crown prosecutor, the 
victim or their representative as to whether they have availed 
themselves of a victim impact statement is an important step 
forward.  I do have some reservations as to the broad application 
of this. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1030"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That matter was also raised by provinces, particularly New 
Brunswick.  It brought forward a concern about the current 
wording of the sections in Bill C-79 which requires that a judge 
must make these inquiries of the prosecutor.  It would be left 
open to interpretation by the judge in all instances or cases 
including victimless crime.  I am speaking of a situation where 
damage is done to public property or an impaired driving case, 
which sadly still remain very prevalent in terms of the caseload 
in the courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we have the requirement or the necessity for a judge in 
every instance, including victimless crimes, to make such an 
inquiry, my submission to the justice department would be that 
this will cause further delay because of the volume that exists 
in the courts.  Although it may seem momentary in a single case 
that a judge makes this request or inquiry, when it is done time 
and time again it will result in a massive amount of wasted court 
time.  Sadly we simply do not have the luxury to waste court time 
in this day and age. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My amendment is aimed specifically at denoting in a very 
straightforward way a suggestion to streamline this section that 
a judge must make these inquiries when a victim exists.  I 
believe the language is such that it is made very clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sadly we have seen time and time again legislation being drafted 
in a cumbersome and onerous way and being left open to all sorts 
of judicial and legislative interpretation that what is intended 
in the legislation is often misdirected and often misinterpreted. 
This does not serve the purpose the legislative drafters would 
hope to accomplish.  It certainly would not serve the purpose 
that members of parliament who are involved in this process want 
to accomplish.  We need streamlined, tight legislation, 
particularly in criminal law where there is a tremendous amount 
of problems and a tremendous backlog in courts throughout the 
land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what lawyers do.  Lawyers look for an interpretation 
that would be advantageous to their clients.  That is part of the 
process.  It will always be implicit in our legal system. 
However, common sense is something that should prevail.  I 
believe it should begin at the very first instance, in the 
drafting process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am suggesting that through this amendment we can accomplish 
more because we can remove some of the delay that will flow from 
this current section of Bill C-79. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To speak to the larger issue of the impact of the bill, we have 
seen some very positive legislative initiatives which will touch 
upon some of the shortcomings that have existed prior to this 
time and will exist for some time until the actual implementation 
of Bill C-79 takes place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of those initiatives has been mentioned.  It involves the 
use of victim fine surcharges.  I have some reservations as to 
the actual practical application.  I hope the revenue that will 
be generated by the application of victim fine surcharges will 
find its way into the hands of victims who are feeling aggrieved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know it will not be possible to put victims back into the 
situation which existed prior to their victimization. We will not 
be able to remove the bruises, to unviolate a sexual assault 
victim.  We will not be able to erase from their memories or 
remove the injurious effects which flow from an assault. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At least with some monetary compensation there is an attempt and 
a recognition.  Oftentimes I would suggest strongly that it is 
recognition victims are looking for, a respect from not only the 
system but to some small degree perhaps from the accused, from 
the offender.  Monetary compensation for personal damage to 
property or personal damage to clothing in some small way is a 
recognition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the victim fine surcharge will be administered properly. 
I hope it will not be used for administrative purposes as opposed 
to the intent, which is to put money or compensation into the 
pocket of the victim.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very pleased to have been a part of the process that brings 
us to this stage, the deliberations that took place in the 
justice committee.  I was very pleased to see the positive and 
non-partisan approach taken by all members of the committee. That 
is very apparent in the House today and we will see it again when 
it comes time to vote on this legislative initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate members of the committee.  I have no reservation 
in acknowledging the Minister of Justice and her commitment to 
this issue.  I must recognize as well the late Shaughnessy Cohen 
as having played an integral part in getting this piece of 
legislation to the point where we see it today.  It is a very 
fitting tribute to her memory that these implementations will be 
coming about, to use the minister's words, in a timely fashion.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
will be quite brief and restrict my comments to the Group No. 1 
amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have no problem with Motion No. 1 of my colleague from 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough.  It simplifies the intent of the 
section.  I appreciate his foresight in addressing this issue. To 
those of us with no legal training it seems rather 
inconsequential, but I understand that the hon. member, with his 
experience in the courts, knows how things can fall apart and why 
one would want to propose this amendment.  I certainly have no 
problem with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for Motion No. 2, we are adding the Young Offenders Act to 
the list of statutes for which the victim surcharge will apply. 
The reason for that is that the amendment follows Recommendation 
No. 13 of the justice committee in its report “Victims' Rights: 
A Voice, Not A Veto”.  The committee actually reported and 
recommended that victim fine surcharges should apply to young 
offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal-provincial-territorial working group also 
recommended permitting the surcharge against young offenders. 
Alberta, Manitoba, Prince Edward Island and Ontario are on record 
as supporting victim surcharges applying to young offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Young offenders create victims in similar ways as adult 
criminals do.  A victim is a victim is a victim, regardless of 
who is the perpetrator of the offence.  As such, young offenders 
should be held responsible to provide assistance to the victims 
of crime in a similar fashion as adults do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the 1994-95 fiscal year there was a total of 4,472 cases 
across Canada whereby a fine was the most significant disposition 
by the youth court.  The vast majority of these fines were 
between $50 and $500.  If these young offenders can pay those 
fines, a minimum surcharge scheme as laid out in Bill C-79 should 
not prove to be any great problem for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 5 merely applies the same line of reasoning to the 
proposed youth criminal justice act, if it ever in fact sees the 
light of day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will finish my comments there.  I will have more to say at 
third reading on the main body of my thoughts on this bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, we will 
not support the amendments brought forward by the Reform Party, 
but we will support the one brought forward by the House leader 
for the Progressive Conservative Party. We are generally in 
favour of this bill because we think it gives victims of crime 
the increased protection they need, particularly in the case of 
sexual offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the members of the Standing Committee on Justice 
and Human Rights have worked constantly in a spirit of 
co-operation on this issue. I think we must give them credit for 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Crime has been a concern of mine for a long time. It is an issue 
of great interest to me as the member for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will certainly recall that, in 1995, I tabled a bill 
that was called, wrongly perhaps, an anti-gang bill, when in fact 
it was an anti-mafia bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are different levels of crime. There are lower levels of 
crime, which exist within the communities and for which we, on 
this side of the House, have always thought the rehabilitation 
process was possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there are higher levels of crime, which require more 
drastic measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We think that one of the ways to reduce crime would be to 
withdraw the $1,000 bill from circulation, a proposal the member 
for Charlesbourg himself has on several occasions made to the 
House.  Canada is the only country with a $1,000 denomination 
and we know who benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we were to conduct a test and ask how many members in the 
House had $1,000 bills in their possession, I think the answer 
would be very few, with the notable exception of yourself, Mr. 
Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> The Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard:</B> Perhaps the Minister of Finance, someone is 
telling me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason we will not be able to support the Reform Party 
amendments is not because we are against the principle of victim 
fine surcharges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the contrary.  We know that they are a feature of the 
Criminal Code and that they are also used in connection with 
certain provisions of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, 
but we do not see any need to extend the principle to the Young 
Offenders Act, as the Reform Party would like. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just now, our colleague rose and reminded us that young 
offenders can create victims.  That is very true.  A criminal 
act remains a criminal act.  However, we believe that resources and 
hope must be put into rehabilitation.  Sentencing someone who is 
14, 15 or 16 years of age is not the same as sentencing someone 
who is 40 and who has risen through the ranks in the underworld. 
These are two very different situations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As regards the victim surcharge, we believe that, in the case of 
young offenders, there is a requirement that would not be met 
because of a lack of financial resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must never forget that there are a number of prerequisites 
for organized crime to flourish. These are the conditions that 
we as legislators must take into consideration. The fact that 
criminality is most prevalent in large cities is no coincidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At least three conditions must be present for organized crime to 
exist. First, organized crime emerges in places where there are 
communications facilities. Highway, port and airport networks 
are necessary, because organized crime members must be in 
contact with various continents and countries. Organized crime 
is very much a global reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a second prerequisite. 
Organized crime exists in highly bureaucratized states. It 
cannot flourish in third world countries. Some types of crime 
exist in these countries, but we cannot talk about organized 
crime as we know it in the United States, Australia, Canada and 
other developed countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Organized crime needs a bureaucratic system with charters to 
make it possible for criminals to invoke a number of rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> And for victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard:</B> And for victims. We must also talk about this 
side of the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third condition for organized crime to flourish is, of 
course, the degree of wealth in a society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, we support the amendment proposed by the 
Progressive Conservative Party. We also support the bill, 
because we believe that greater protection ought to be afforded 
to victims, particularly victims of crime. However, we cannot 
support Motions Nos. 2 and 5, or the amendments proposed by the 
Reform Party.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak to Bill C-79 at report stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend the member for Surrey North for the leadership he has 
taken to ensure that victims have a right and a say within our 
justice system. They have been ignored for too long.  As the 
member is often prone to say, victims need a voice, not a veto 
which is unfortunately what has happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to focus on Motion No. 2. It deals with the issue of 
victim surcharges.  This is innovative.  Not only will it help 
victims, but it will also help those who have committed offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Essentially it asks that a young offender who has been convicted 
of a crime provide restitution to the victims.  Why is this 
important?  For one thing from a victim's perspective, too often 
victims have been ignored in our criminal justice system.  They 
have been shunted to the side.  I could give countless examples 
of victims who have received less help than the criminals who 
have committed the offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are countless cases of children who have been abused, 
women and men who have been raped, people who have been 
assaulted. They have sustained long term ongoing devastating 
psychological trauma from what they have endured, yet after all 
is said and done within the justice system, the criminals have 
received more help than the victims.  That simply is not fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Surrey North is trying to add some balance and 
fairness so that victims get the help they require through our 
system.  It also places the onus upon the criminal.  If a person 
commits an offence, they will pay a price not only to society, 
but also to the victim. There are some innovative ways of doing 
this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my province of British Columbia there are some innovative 
ways in which the convicted person can, if the victim is in 
agreement, pay restitution directly to the victim.  The convicted 
person can also say that he or she is sorry and pay some visible 
and vocal emotional restitution to the victim. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The benefit is it enables the victim to understand that the 
person who has been convicted is genuinely sorry.  It also has 
been found to diminish the number of times the convicted person 
commits future offences. In other words, it breaks the cycle of 
crime and punishment we have found in our society.  So often it 
goes around and around in a circle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 2 is very important from a restitution perspective. 
It is important to give victims rights.  It is important from the 
convicted person's perspective to show that if a person commits 
an offence, there will be a penalty to pay. In the long term it 
has been shown to decrease the amount of times the person 
reoffends.  It decreases the reoffence rate. It also decreases 
the costs to the taxpayer in that it diverts the convicted person 
from the expensive incarceration in juvenile institutions. It 
costs $95,000 a year for a juvenile to be incarcerated in an 
institution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we could divert those convicted to do other things such as 
making restitution to the victim and society and working for 
society as part of the penalty, then the criminal would actually 
learn some very useful skills.  It would be beneficial to the 
criminal from a societal perspective, from a professional 
perspective and would decrease the number of times the criminal 
would reoffend in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a win-win situation.  We applaud this motion and support 
it.  We look forward to speaking again at the third reading stage 
of Bill C-79.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Hamilton West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
hon. member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough seeks to amend 
Bill C-79, in particular the proposed section 722.2, which is 
found in clause 18. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This section in issue will require the judge before sentencing 
to ask the prosecutor, a victim or any person representing a 
victim whether the victim has been advised of the opportunity to 
prepare a victim impact statement.  This provision is exactly 
what the standing committee unanimously recommended. It is based 
on concerns raised by victims and victim advocates, and these are 
persons and organizations with strong roots in and around my 
hometown of Hamilton, that victims often do not know about the 
opportunity to make a victim impact statement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member's motion would reword the provision so that the 
judge would make this inquiry only where the victim exists.  Let 
us be clear about this, only where the victim exists.  I plead 
with the hon. member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough to think 
through the purpose of this amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely where there is no victim, the judge will not waste his or 
her time asking whether the victim has been advised of the 
opportunity to make a victim impact statement. For example, in 
sentencing an accused for impaired driving where no one is 
injured, there is no property loss, no victim other than society, 
the judge would not make this inquiry.  Clearly there would be no 
victim impact statement where there is no victim. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By inserting the words “where the victim exists” we are 
suggesting that for example in the case of a murder where the 
victim is deceased the survivors would not be considered as 
victims in order to make a victim impact statement.  While I do 
not think this is really the hon. member's intention, this would 
be the result of this particular amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The family members of homicide victims are indeed victims in 
their own right and the Criminal Code recognizes them as victims 
for the purpose of submitting victim impact statements.  The 
proposed amendment would only cause confusion and concern among 
surviving family members that they would be denied both 
information and the opportunity to prepare a victim impact 
statement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whatever the purpose of this amendment is, let us be clear, it 
is not necessary.  The Criminal Code does not define victim. 
Rather Bill C-79 clarifies that victim includes the victim of an 
alleged offence.  Common sense and understanding dictate who is a 
victim.  Where there is no victim of an offence, there will be no 
need or obligation on the judge to inquire whether the victim has 
been informed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this motion is intended to restrict the obligation on judges 
to make this inquiry for only certain crimes or certain types of 
victims, it does not achieve its objective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment clearly cannot be supported. One, it does not 
reflect what the standing committee recommended unanimously. Two, 
it does not reflect what victims of crime and victim service 
providers have told us. Three and maybe most important, it does 
not achieve any valid purpose and it will cause confusion in the 
interpretation of this provision ultimately at the expense of 
victims of crime. I am certain that the hon. member does not want 
to see that happen.

less of their hard earned income.  Today Statistics Canada says 
once again this year that their take home pay has been reduced 
because the finance minister continues to gouge more and more tax 
dollars out of their pockets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is even worse when we compare it to an American family.  The

much money as they used to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The president of the chamber of commerce says that politicians

the statistics not warming the heart of the statistician over 
there? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is when average families pick up their paycheques and 
look at the bottom line, they say that although statistics mean a 
lot they get less money this year than they had last year under 
this tax and spend Liberal government.  That is what it amounts 
to.  That is the bottom line.  Families spend more on taxes than 
they do on food, clothing and shelter combined under this 
government's system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the government not understand that it needs to give tax 
relief to these families, that it needs to give it now, and that

individual income.   Personal disposable income growth 
strengthened to 3.5% from only 1.1% in the first quarter.

Mr. Speaker, I suppose the definition of doing nothing is sending

more value, however, on the initiatives of the hon. gentleman and 
on the other initiatives we have taken on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the hon. member of something very important.  Just 
about one year ago, India and Pakistan both engaged in nuclear 
tests which broke the fundamental principles of nuclear 
non-proliferation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As part of the G-8 membership, which includes all major 
countries and where Canada has taken a lead against 
non-proliferation, it was up to us to try to tell India and 
Pakistan that they should not be testing nuclear weapons and 
helping the spread of those horrible weapons.

</I></B></P><P align=left>How does the Minister of Canadian Heritage explain, barely two

we find it very hard to understand why the Minister of Canadian

disappointed while their American counterparts are elated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the Minister of Canadian Heritage claim that the 
Americans backed down from anything on this issue, since the

the Minister of Canadian Heritage does not seem to realize that 
she and her Liberal colleagues are the only ones who are elated 
in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When she looks at the reality, does the minister not get the

a humanitarian tragedy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To relieve the pressure on the camps and the entire region, the

escalate the evacuation program, the airlift out of the area. 
Canada has provided sanctuary for 5,000.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I had occasion last week to meet directly with Mrs. 
Ogata, UN High Commissioner for Refugees.  At that time I 
specifically asked if she would like Canada to accept more 
refugees.  She said no, that she would like to see Canada help in 
terms of the ongoing resettlement program in the region and in 
terms of reinforcing the ongoing work in the camps. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can report to the hon. member that in direct discussions with 
the high commissioner she did not request that.  In fact she said 
at this point in time she would rather have us look at alternate

met with the program director of the UN High Commissioner for 
Refugees in Macedonia.  The message then was an urgent need to 
escalate the evacuation program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another situation arises.  Those refugees who are settled here

they choose to become landed immigrants they will be charged a 
head tax, a $975 landing fee.

Mr. Speaker, first I would like to underscore a comment that was 
written not in a Canadian newspaper but in the Washington 
<I>Post</I> yesterday when it said in a line story: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—for the first time the United States was forced to accept the 
principle that, even in a free trade environment, foreign 
countries could take steps to limit access to their markets by 
American firms in an effort to protect the viability of local 
culture, in this case the Canadian magazine industry— 
</UL></UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That precedent could eventually come into play as the United 
States continues its campaign to tear down barriers— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a first not only for Canada but it is a first in 
international agreements.  The U.S. should respect the agreement 
that it signed on subsidies and countervailing duties which 
specifically denies national treatment in the area of subsidies. 
It is as simple as that.

the possibility of a $400 million loss in the economy in the

be sold on a same day basis.  This would be a blatant non-tariff 
trade barrier and could spread to other shellfish.  What is the 
minister of fisheries doing to ensure a continued European market 
for Canadian oysters and all other Canadian shellfish?

fishermen and in ensuring that we have a good quality product. He 
will continue to do that and to ensure the Europeans abide by all 
trade agreements.

income tax returns have been received by Revenue Canada since the 
beginning of the 1999 filing season. Over 16 million returns have 
been processed to date.  As of May 20, 10.4 million Canadians had 
received income tax refunds totalling over $11.2 billion.  Those 
Canadians who used either e-file or telefile and who asked 
Revenue Canada to deposit their funds directly received them

</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to Chapter 17—National Parole Board—of the 1994 
report of the Auditor General of Canada: (<I>a</I>) what measures of

offenders are on release; (vii) the number of successful

measurements were not developed, please state the reasons why 
they have not been developed? 
</UL>
<P><A NAME="LINK218"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor general of Canada, Lib.):</B> 
The National Parole Board has responded to Chapter 17 of the 1994 
report of the Auditor General of Canada regarding performance 
measurement as follows: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(a) The National Parole Board has established a performance 
measurement regime to ensure that management has the information 
required to monitor and assess its performance.  The key 
component of this regime over the last three years has been the 
annual statistics package.  This package provides detailed 
information on the performance of the board's conditional release 
and pardons and clemency programs over a five year period.  As 
well, this package currently includes over 650 tables of 
statistical information on everything from crime in Canada and 
offender population to more specific information on parole grant 
rates, parole and statutory release success rates and charges for 
serious offences.  This information is also included in other 
publications such as the Canadian Centre for Justice Statistics' 
annual report on adult correctional services in Canada and the 
Department of the Solicitor General Canada's annual statistical 
overview on corrections and conditional release.  The board is 
developing a new statistical information retrieval system, SIRS, 
which is scheduled to be available on the Intranet by the fall of 
1999.  In addition to the annual statistics package, the board 
also produces two yearly performance monitoring reports that 
identify developing trends and possible areas for improvement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(b) The National Parole Board has developed most of the 
performance measures suggested in paragraph 17.65 of the 1994 
report of the auditor general.  Specifically, the board now 
measures: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(i) See (c) (i). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(ii) Recidivism rates by type of revocation; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The success tables present the information based on the four 
ways that conditional release supervision periods end; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Successful completion—releases in which the offender remains 
under supervision in the community from release date to the end 
of the period of supervision—warrant expiry date for full parole 
and statutory release; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Revocations for breach of conditions—these revocations have been 
defined as positive interventions to reduce risk to the community 
in that the offender is removed from the community to prevent 
recidivism; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Revocation with non-violent offence—any conditional release that 
results in revocation for a new non-violent offence—recidivism; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Revocation with violent offence—any conditional release that 
results in revocation for a new violent offence—recidivism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(iii) Recidivism rate by category of offender. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(iv) Recidivism rate by region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(v) See (c) (v). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(vi) Violent crimes committed while offenders are on release—the 
board measures charges for serious offences by offence type, for 
example, murder, sexual assault, major assault, robbery, et cetera, 
by release type—day parole, full parole or statutory 
release—and by region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(c) (i) The board does not specifically measure the recidivism 
rate for the first year after release.  An inter-departmental 
committee is currently working to develop a recidivism rate 
formula based on the date of release, which would not be limited 
by the warrant expiry date.  This rate would provide information 
on recidivism for any number of years after release, for example, 
one year, five years, ten years after release, et cetera, 
including post-warrant expiry recidivism.  Once developed, the 
new recidivism rate should provide better information on the 
success of treatment and reintegration programs and on the 
overall performance of the correctional system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(v) The board does not measures the recidivism rate for cases 
where the board releases an offender though the Correctional 
Service has not recommended release.  While the Correctional 
Service recommendation is an important part of all conditional 
release reviews, board members make independent decisions, based 
on the risk factors presented by the offender during the review, 
and the board's performance measurement regime provides 
information on the quality of these decisions.  That said, the 
board does monitor how often board decisions are in concordance 
with the CSC recommendation.  This measure is called the 
concordance rate.

labour adjustment benefit, LAB program. The successor to LAB was 
the program for older workers adjustment, POWA, program, which 
came into effect on January 1, 1988. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The LAB program legislation became effective on May 1, 1982. The 
purpose of LAB was to assist Canadians in four industries within 
21 designated regions by providing workers with adjustment 
benefits. Benefits were and are paid through the employment 
insurance payment systems. Benefits were provided to laid off 
workers at the following mines: La Nationale, Bell, Carrie 
Canadian and Lac D'Amiante. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A total of 3,751 workers were accepted under the LAB program who 
have been paid a total of $105,778,923 as of September 30, 1998.

</I></B></P><P align=left>(1) be at least 54 years of age on the effective date of layoff; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(2) be a Canadian citizen or a permanent resident of Canada; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(3) have been employed in a generally designated industry or

employment with earnings less than average weekly insurable 
earnings prior to layoff. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In cases of financial hardship, benefits could be payable to 
individuals whose age plus years of service, as previously 
defined, equaled 80 or more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to assure that benefits were maintained, in the spirit 
of a last resort income maintenance measure, the Canada

<A NAME="LINK224">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-79, an 
act to amend the Criminal Code (victims of crime) and another act 
in consequence, be read the third time and passed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK225"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Julian Reed (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a privilege to 
once again reinforce some of the aspects of these amendments that 
we believe will enhance the justice system in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-79 amendments will enhance and expand the opportunities 
for victims of crime to make a victim impact statement and will 
address the manner in which the statement can be made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When determining the appropriate sentence to impose on an 
offender, the judge takes into account a range of considerations 
related to both the particular offender and to the offence, and 
is guided by the purposes and principles of sentencing set out in 
the code and the penalties set out in the code, including any 
applicable mandatory minimum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The victim impact statement must be considered by the sentencing 
judge along with all other relevant information.  The statement 
is a description of the harm done or the loss suffered by the 
victim.  In other words, the impact from their personal point of 
view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-79 makes several important changes to the impact 
statement provisions.  For example, the amendments will make it 
clear that it is the victim's choice whether to read his or her 
victim impact statement.  Note that the current code provisions 
require the judge to consider the written victim impact statement 
which has been prepared and filed. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1215"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT28"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT28"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1215
<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT27"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This will continue to be the case.  In other words, when a 
victim does not choose to present the statement orally, the judge 
will still be required to consider the written statement.  It is 
always the victim's choice whether to prepare a victim impact 
statement and some may not wish to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There may be situations where the victim seeks to present his or 
her statement in another manner, for example by video or audio 
tape or through a third person.  In these situations the judge 
will determine if that type of presentation is appropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments will also require that a judge make inquiries 
after a determination of guilt and before sentencing as to 
whether a victim has been informed of the opportunity to prepare 
a victim impact statement.  In most cases the judge will direct 
the inquiry to the crown attorney, who should be aware of the 
prevailing policy in the jurisdiction for advising victims about 
victim impact statements.  For example, in some jurisdictions the 
police may provide a card to all victims they come into contact 
with which refers victims to victim witness services and/or which 
refers to the victim impact statement program, or the crown may 
have a notation in the file that the victim has indeed been 
advised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment is intended to provide one last check on the 
information a victim should have received.  The ability to 
prepare and submit a victim impact statement is of little benefit 
to a victim if the victim is not aware of these provisions.  We 
note that it is always the victim's choice whether to prepare an 
impact statement.  Some victims will be advised of the 
opportunity and may choose not to prepare such a statement. 
However, the choice cannot be made without adequate information. 
In some cases an adjournment may be necessary to permit the 
victim to be notified and a statement prepared.  The amendments 
will specifically authorize such adjournments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Victim impact statements will also be available to victims where 
the offender is found not criminally responsible for the offence 
committed.  Currently, when an accused person is found not 
criminally responsible on account of mental disorder, there is no 
opportunity for the victim to describe the impact of the offence. 
This is because a mentally disordered accused is not sentenced 
because they are not criminally responsible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current victim impact provisions only apply at sentencing 
proceedings.  The reality, though, is that victims of mentally 
disordered offenders are victims of crime and should have a 
similar opportunity to describe the impact.  The amendments will 
therefore provide that, following a verdict of not criminally 
responsible on account of a mental disorder, a victim may prepare 
and file a statement.  The statement will be considered by the 
court or by the Criminal Code Review Board when making the 
initial disposition regarding the mentally disordered accused. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Criminal Code includes a complete part dealing with mentally 
disordered offenders and sets out criteria for making 
dispositions.  The victim impact statement shall be considered in 
the context of those criteria and, in the case where a 
conditional discharge is appropriate, the statement shall be 
considered in determining the appropriate conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another significant development that has emerged from the 
growing acceptance of the principle that offenders should 
acknowledge the harm done to victims and the community is the 
emergence of community impact statements.  Community impact 
statements, although not legislated, are gaining acceptance as a 
means by which the community has a voice in the criminal justice 
system.  This concept grew out of the increasing acceptance of 
victim impact statements as a valid and worthwhile role for 
victims to play at sentencing proceedings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments to enhance victim involvement at sentencing 
through the victim impact statement recognize that crime has an 
impact on real people.  Community involvement in crime 
prevention, victim advocacy and, as mentioned, community impact 
statements demonstrate that the people of Canada are committed to 
improving the justice system.  Bill C-79 demonstrates that the 
government shares that commitment.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is 
indeed a pleasure for me to speak to this bill today.  After 
years of frustration on the part of victims of crime all across 
Canada, after years of promises, after years of pressure from the 
Reform Party and after repeated failure of the government to 
properly address its supposed priority of the issue of victims 
rights, we appear to be on the home stretch. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are now at third reading and hopefully we will be voting on 
Bill C-79 before the government decides to break for the summer 
recess.  Hopefully this legislation will pass from this place to 
the other place, which hopefully again will give it a high 
priority and pass it in relatively short order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have stated, victims have been waiting for years for the 
formalization of legislated rights for their interests.  As I 
have also stated, we are almost there, but each and every day 
that Canadians are deprived of the effect of this legislation 
means that victims are continuing to be deprived of specified 
rights.  Each and every day victims are continuing to be 
disregarded and abused by our justice system.  It is a travesty 
that victims of crime are further victimized by the very system 
supposedly designed to bring and maintain justice in this 
country.  Until effective rights are provided we will continue to 
witness instances of further injustice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not be critical of the entire process.  I acknowledge and 
I appreciate the work of my colleagues on the justice committee. 
While we do not always see eye to eye, we did recognize and 
accept the necessity to expeditiously prepare the committee 
report entitled “Victims Rights'—A Voice, Not a Veto” which 
formed the basis of this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report and the subsequent legislation are a tribute to 
Shaughnessy Cohen who chaired the committee and created the 
spirit of co-operation to achieve this objective.  I must add 
that I first met Shaughnessy long before I was elected to this 
place, at a time not long after my family became unwilling 
participants in the criminal justice system.  Although we 
differed on some things, I hold nothing but the deepest respect 
for Shaughnessy's compassion and her commitment toward this 
issue.  The committee expedited the process once Bill C-79 was 
passed at second reading and referred for review. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also be remiss if I did not thank all witnesses who 
appeared before the committee and the individuals and 
organizations that provided written submissions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to thank all those individuals who 
participated in the national forum on victims' roles in the 
criminal justice system held in Ottawa in June 1998.  All of 
those individuals and organizations were invaluable in helping 
the committee to form a consensus on many of the shortcomings 
which exist in our justice process with respect to victims of 
crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So that the Liberal government does not get too complacent, I 
will move back to the area of criticism on the shortcomings of 
this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, as stated previously, it is unfortunate that the 
government did not see fit to address the recommendations of the 
justice committee concerning amendments to the Corrections and 
Conditional Release Act.  A number of important rights for 
victims need to be addressed in the area of corrections and 
parole.  This has not been done and there is little indication 
that the issue is on the government's immediate agenda.  It is 
difficult to understand why it has to be continually pressured 
and pushed into amending our laws to provide for the interests 
and rights of victims of crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has used the excuse that the justice committee is 
currently undertaking a review of the Corrections and Conditional 
Release Act.  That is just a red herring.  There is absolutely 
nothing to deter the government from incorporating changes to the 
Corrections and Conditional Release Act within Bill C-79. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result, one must ask whether victims rights are really a 
priority to the government.  The government only did what it had 
to do.  The government had to respond to the committee report, 
but it did so no more than it had to.  For some unfathomable 
reason it has decided to put off victims rights in the 
corrections and parole fields until another day, another year, or 
possibly even another decade.  Hopefully it will at least be a 
millennium project.  This delay is most unfortunate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, this legislation fails to apply the victim fine 
surcharge to the Young Offenders Act.  Why?  I certainly do not 
know.  The justice committee report recommended that young 
offenders be included within the victim fine surcharge scheme. 
The federal-provincial-territorial working group recommended 
permitting surcharge orders against young offenders.  Alberta, 
Manitoba, Prince Edward Island and Ontario are on written record 
as supporting victim fine surcharges for young offenders. 
However, the government chooses to ignore all of this strong 
support. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1225"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT30"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT30"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1225

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>During fiscal year 1994-95 there were a total of 4,472 cases 
across Canada where a fine was the most significant disposition 
by our youth courts.  Some 87% of these fines were between $50 
and $500.  Surely, if these young offenders can pay these fines, 
they can pay the minimal surcharge as laid out in Bill C-79. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Young offenders create victims in the same way as adults.  It is 
indeed puzzling why the government seems to feel that young 
offenders should not be held to the same level of responsibility 
toward providing assistance to the victims of their crimes as 
anybody else.  It is no wonder that Canadians are losing faith in 
our justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A third aspect that I wish to discuss happens to involve the 
highly inflammatory issue of subsection 745.6, the faint hope 
clause.  Once again the government is amending section 745. 
Instead of scrapping it entirely, it continues to tinker with the 
provision of our law that appears to be only acceptable to 
murderers and members of the Liberal Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will admit that the provisions in Bill C-79 improve this 
situation somewhat.  Clause 21 finally forces the justice process 
to be a little more honest or upfront with victims and the 
Canadian public.  Judges will be required to pronounce at the 
time of sentencing that a sentence of imprisonment for life may 
not necessarily be just that.  Now everybody in the courtroom at 
sentencing will know that, in the case of first degree murder, 
the supposedly mandatory 25 years before parole eligibility could 
be significantly reduced at a time in the future when everybody 
but the family members have forgotten about the crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does this government continue to try to make essentially a 
silk purse out of a sow's ear?  Subsection 745.6 is bad law, 
plain and simple, but instead of scrapping it altogether, every 
year or two the government tinkers with it some more in an 
attempt to make it more palatable to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just a couple of years ago, with Bill C-45, the government 
changed this section in an attempt to limit and restrict multiple 
murderers from benefiting from this faint hope provision.  Now, 
in Bill C-79, after some 20-odd years, it has decided that the 
practice of telling Canadians that murderers are sentenced to 
life imprisonment with no chance of parole for 25 years has not 
been entirely upfront.  Victims will now at least be informed of 
subsection 745.6 which permits early parole for our most serious 
offenders.  However, anyway we cut it, it is still bad law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now take a few moments to sum up this legislation.  It is 
a good start, but it is just that, a good start.  Our justice 
system falls over backward to ensure and protect all the rights 
of all our criminals and that is fine.  It sets Canada apart from 
most other countries of the world and reflects the fairness and 
equity of our society.  Having said that, we can also say that we 
have been woefully negligent in ensuring and protecting the 
rights of the victims of crime.  We have been too quick to use 
the excuse of the division of powers between the federal 
government and the provinces to rationalize these deficiencies. 
Hopefully Bill C-79 will see the beginning of co-operation 
between the two levels of government so that victims of crime do 
not continue to fall through the cracks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have indicated, I am disappointed with the government for 
its failure to address the justice committee's recommendations 
concerning the Corrections and Conditional Release Act.  With a 
little intestinal fortitude the government could have easily 
incorporated those recommendations within this legislation.  As a 
member of the official opposition I will continue to pressure the 
government to fulfil its promises in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's failure to include young offenders within the 
victim fine surcharge scheme makes absolutely no sense.  The 
government appears to view victims of young offender crime as 
being somewhat less significant than other victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The faint hope clause still lives.  The tinkering continues but 
the primary problem still remains.  Hopefully one of these days 
the government will get tired of skating around the issue and 
will instead send it off to the scrap heap where it belongs. 
<P><A NAME="LINK227"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to join in this debate at third reading on Bill C-79, an 
act to amend the Criminal Code respecting victims of crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that the loss and financial hardship 
suffered by victims of violent crime can be crushing.  Often 
insurance, unemployment, pension or welfare plans, or court 
ordered restitution or damages are unavailable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to mention that in 1970 Manitoba's New Democrats 
introduced one of Canada's first victim compensation programs and 
it has been considered one of Canada's fairest.  However, victims 
of crime have looked to the federal government to further ensure 
that their rights be recognized.

<A HREF="#LINKT30"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill and the amendments are without question supported and 
have been requested for some time by victims of crime as well as 
the large majority of Canadians.  It is my hope as well as that 
of my caucus colleagues that the Minister of Justice along with 
her government do not delay in implementing this bill as they 
have done with so many others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The justice committee has recommended credible changes on this 
bill.  With regard to the delays by the justice department I want 
to note that the joint Senate and House of Commons committee on 
custody and access has made important and credible 
recommendations and it is unconscionable that the Minister of 
Justice has made the statement outright that it will take three 
years before there is any kind of implementation of those 
recommendations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time the Minister of Justice recognized that Canadians no 
longer have faith in our justice system.  The defence of 
provocation that came up in the discussions earlier today is 
another issue that is on the block for the Minister of Justice to 
look at. We can only wonder how long it is going to take for 
action in that area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to summarize the amendments to ensure that Canadians 
really know what this bill entails.  They provide that all 
offenders must pay a victim surcharge of a fixed minimum amount 
except where the offender establishes undue hardship and provide 
for increased amounts to be imposed in appropriate circumstances. 
This will increase provincial and territorial revenues to allow 
them to improve services currently provided to victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is absolutely important that the provinces follow along in 
this light.  What has happened since the Conservative government 
in the province of Manitoba took office some years back, it has 
literally gutted the dollars that have gone into the program.  As 
well its failure to follow through on collecting the fines has 
left that program terribly short of the funds it needs to provide 
victims with the services that should be there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments ensure that victims are informed of their 
opportunity to prepare a victim impact statement at the time of 
sentencing.  This seems pretty straightforward but it is one of 
those things that so often is failed to be followed through on, a 
simple statement of letting the victim know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Amendments also ensure the victims have the choice to read the 
victim impact statement aloud.  They require the impact 
statements to be considered by courts and review boards following 
a verdict of not criminally responsible on account of a mental 
disorder.  They extend to victims of sexual or violent crime up 
to age 18 protections that restrict personal cross-examinations 
by self-represented accused persons. There is no question that 
this is a very important amendment.  We have seen numerous 
instances where the victim is once again victimized by their 
perpetrator and they have to go through the anguish all over 
again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Police officers and judges will be required to consider the 
victim's safety in all bail orders. That is extremely important. 
The amendments clarify that at court proceedings to determine 
whether an offender who is sentenced to life should have his or 
her parole eligibility reduced, the information provided by the 
victim may be oral or written at the option of the victim.  This 
allows them the opportunity not to be victimized again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another amendment would allow victims and witnesses with a 
mental or physical disability to have a support person while 
giving testimony. This is something a lot of Canadians thought 
automatically happened but that has not been the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments will make it easier for victims and witnesses to 
participate in trials by permitting the judge to ban publication 
of their identity where it is necessary for the administration of 
justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My party supports the overall intention of this legislation as 
it will give victims and witnesses of crime a much greater role 
in the criminal justice system and will increase safeguards of 
protection.  While that is very important, it is also important 
for us that it will not infringe on the rights of the accused to 
have a fair trial.  We are convinced that these amendments in the 
legislation will not infringe on those rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With that in mind and with the number of comments that have been 
made here today, I think it is extremely important that we follow 
through on this legislation.  We must also be vigilant in 
ensuring that the Minister of Justice, her department and this 
government as a whole do not continually shirk their duty to the 
people of Canada and put in place laws that truly reflect and 
represent all Canadians.

Speaker, I am very pleased to participate in this debate and to 
follow the remarks of the hon. member.  She obviously has a great 
deal of insight into this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is fair to say it is a very significant and timely issue when 
we are speaking of victims rights.  Sadly our news is often 
filled with tragedies involving victims.  I speak of most 
recently the Kosovars who find themselves displaced because of an 
extremely cruel and malicious government.  I speak of the victims 
in the Littleton, Colorado tragedy and those in Taber, Alberta. I 
speak of victims like Sheldon Kennedy.  I speak of victims like 
those in the Toronto Maple Leaf Gardens scandal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our news is often filled with heart-wrenching tragedies that 
surround victims and their lives.  There is certainly a 
highlighted need for legislative initiatives that address these 
types of issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As is stated in the report itself and in its title which is 
quite appropriately “A Voice, Not a Veto”, victims are not 
looking to upset the balance that has to exist and the implicit 
degree of fairness that the scales of justice represent. The 
victims are not looking for an ability to overturn the rights of 
presumption of innocence or in any way to offset the entire 
justice system in terms of how they deal with an accused person 
in the first instance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a need however that victims have to seek recognition 
and at times retribution from those who prey upon them.  I feel 
this legislation moves forward but does not go as far as it 
possibly could or should.  However it takes a significant step 
forward and there is that recognition that is ever present and 
ever important in our justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen in many instances the prosecution of cases that 
take a tremendous amount of time.  Delay is often described as 
the deadliest form of denial.  Victims need to have an assurance 
that justice will be done in a timely fashion and in such a way 
that they feel the state has intervened appropriately and in a 
way that is compassionate and understanding not only of the 
strict, sanitized, sterile legal necessities, but of those humane 
aspects that are involved in criminal activity and victimization. 
There is a need to give that assurance and the legislation makes 
strides in that direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Conservative Party wholeheartedly supports this 
legislation.  We were active in the round table that took place 
last summer.  We were active at the committee with respect to the 
study of this legislation.  Numerous witnesses gave their 
testimony in a very forthright and succinct way.  They cried out 
for change and cried out for a law that will perhaps streamline 
our justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the ever present need to get away from lengthy 
bureaucratic and sometimes cumbersome language that pollutes our 
Criminal Code and much of the legislation we deal with 
particularly when it comes to matters of criminal justice. 
Because of the lengthy delays that are often involved, justice in 
the end is denied if it is not brought forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what members of the opposition and members of the 
Progressive Conservative Party were trying to do when amendments 
were moved this morning.  I resent in some way the suggestion 
that it was anything other than a sincere attempt to improve this 
legislation.  There was no disingenuous intent whatsoever in 
trying to define the language that will eventually be in the 
hands of the courts and the prosecution and the defence.  It was 
simply an attempt to simplify and to put a more succinct 
definition forward when it comes to the implementation of some of 
the changes we will see as a result of Bill C-79. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one other glaring omission that I have to point out 
with respect to Bill C-79.  It is the refusal of the Minister of 
Justice and the government itself to acknowledge the need for a 
victims ombudsman office.  The office would be modelled on that 
of the correctional investigator. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it more than perverse that we have an office budgeted for 
the sole needs and protection and furtherance of criminals who 
are currently paying their debt to society incarcerated behind 
bars. I am not saying they do not need that protection at times, 
but we do not have a similar office set up for those who are 
victimized by those same individuals who are currently 
incarcerated.  I find that an affront to everything that is true 
about our justice system.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been some discussion about the need for this and 
although I believe the Minister of Justice does have some 
sensitivity and fairness to this and although I believe the late 
Shaughnessy Cohen also supported the government's moving in this 
direction, we have not reached that point. I believe it was a 
missed opportunity under this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Politicians sometimes get bogged down with the legalities and 
politics of an issue and forget the human side. As an overall 
statement it is fair to say that the debates surrounding this 
legislation both in committee and here on the floor of the House 
of Commons have been fairly non-partisan in nature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-79 is an attempt to give recognition to and to change and 
enhance some of the current laws, particularly when it comes to 
issues such as victim impact statements.  As has been previously 
enunciated by other members, these statements are a very 
important part of the healing process and a part of the codified 
recognition victims play in a courtroom.  It is an opportunity 
for them to speak directly to the judge, to all present, and 
equally important, to the accused.  At the end of the day when a 
conviction has been rendered on the perpetrator in the matter, it 
is an attempt for the victim in some small way to put into words 
what the victim's ordeal has been. I suspect that for many this 
is a very important part of the healing process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With all of that said, there are other problems in the justice 
system we are currently aware of that impact directly on victims. 
Some of those problems stem from areas outside of this 
particular legislative scheme. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am speaking now of the difficulty within Correctional Service 
Canada. We know a very dangerous and insidious plan has been put 
forward and perpetrated on an unsuspecting public. I am talking 
about the 50% release plan that was dreamed up by some genius to 
see that 50% of the current inmate population is released back 
into society by next year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a very dangerous thing when quotas are put in place and 
targets are put forward.  One would suspect this to override the 
existing legislative safeguards, the existing criteria to be met 
in the decision on whether a person will be released from 
incarceration, particularly when one looks at the degree of 
violence and often the lengthy accumulation of a violent record 
that it takes for a person to eventually be found incarcerated in 
a federal institution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I realize that is somewhat outside the gamut or the scope of 
what we are discussing today but it is something I find to be 
extremely alarming.  It impacts on victims.  We know the victim's 
plight does not end after a conviction has been rendered.  It 
does not end after the person who has preyed upon the victim has 
been incarcerated. It continues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately there is an unbreakable link between a victim and 
the person who has perpetrated violence or some form of an 
injustice upon them.  That link remains.  It is not one the 
victim asked for or certainly desired but it is there and it is 
often lifelong and life altering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Victims are spouses, children, parents, siblings and those not 
only affected in a direct physical way by the violence but the 
members of a family who are often left suffering in the wake of a 
direct attack on a loved one.  They can also benefit from victims 
services and improvements in legislation that can impact directly 
on the delivery of victims services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer to my comments about the need for a victims ombudsman 
office where direct information could be disseminated to victims, 
to those persons in need of information.  It has been pointed out 
time and time again that one of the real downfalls of our justice 
system is our inability to get this information into the hands of 
those who need it most and those who wish to be informed and 
those who wish to be forewarned of the release of a person from 
incarceration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With proper amendments, improvements could be made to this bill. 
However because of the need to bring it forward with the steps 
that have been taken, the Conservative Party will be supporting 
this bill when it comes to a vote in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our party certainly supports the entrenching of the victim 
surcharge that will be brought about as a result of this 
legislation. 
The fact that there will be financial compensation will never 
fully compensate a person for a crime that has been perpetrated, 
but it will at least be some recognition that a crime has been 
committed which has impacted upon a person. Although it does not 
compensate for the emotional and sometimes physical harm, it is a 
recognition that there is a loss.  Sometimes a dollar figure will 
not be adequate but at least it is a recognition.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the hope of the Conservative Party, in fact I suggest the 
hope of all members, that this money will not be eaten up or 
misdirected in terms of cumbersome administration, but that the 
legislation will ensure that the money is in the hands and the 
pockets of those directly affected by criminal activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is much to talk about in the area of victims and victims 
rights and the ability to bring victims into a system that is 
often very insensitive and sometimes very sterile when it comes 
to the approach taken to those who are most directly affected. 
However, in the interest of balance and the interest of 
protecting the integrity of the system, one has to be very leery 
of putting too much in motion.  I am sometimes reticent to say 
that because this is a very emotional issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard testimony time and time again before the committee from 
victims themselves, from parents, and from those affected by the 
perpetration of crime.  There is no denying that it is a very 
emotional issue.  However, in the courtroom there is an attempt 
to sometimes remove or ignore the emotion in the interest of 
getting to the truth of the matter and moving a case through the 
court in perhaps a more timely fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would not say the bill was the brain child of any one 
particular person or any one party, but Shaughnessy Cohen's name 
is very closely associated with this government initiative, and 
rightly so.  She worked as a crown prosecutor in the city of 
Windsor and was obviously an advocate of victims.  It is very 
important that her name be inextricably attached to this 
legislative initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The position of my party with respect to victims has been 
unwavering.  In 1997 the election platform of the Conservative 
Party proposed the creation of a victims charter of rights.  This 
is again not a new initiative, not something that one party can 
claim ownership of, but it is a recognition that certain 
inalienable rights have to be entrenched in our law to ensure 
that victims are protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are very positive aspects of the bill with respect to the 
publication of the name of a victim or witness.  Those 
initiatives are there for the protection of identity.  They make 
very clear that victims oftentimes are in great jeopardy if their 
names are known publicly or published through some form of media. 
Protection and the ability to put into the hands of the court the 
tools to protect those whose names if published would be 
vulnerable is a very important initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a great deal of jargon associated with the practice of 
law.  Victims need information, particularly in matters such as 
parole ineligibility or eligibility and court proceedings. There 
is a significant effort now to ensure that the victim is given 
basic information on where they sit in a courtroom, what the 
proceedings mean, and what certain references and legal terms 
mean. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Victims services throughout the provinces will be enhanced by 
some of the initiatives in Bill C-79.  In the constituency of 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough in my home province of Nova 
Scotia there are those who are currently involved in victims 
services.  There are working very diligently and will be very 
thankful for this legislation.  I am speaking of individuals like 
Judy Whitman, Coreen Popowich and many others involved in the 
furthering of victims rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This evening in Nova Scotia I am attending a fundraising event 
for the Tearmann society located in New Glasgow.  It is a home 
for battered women.  Once again I will be very pleased to bring 
word on the bill moving forward through the House in the fashion 
we have seen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not have any further negative comments to make other than 
the fact that the legislation before us today is long overdue. 
The provinces have some concerns with respect to the consultation 
process, but we understand like others and like those who have 
spoken previously that any step forward is seen as a positive 
step. 
It is something that we do not intend in any way to hinder.  We 
are trying to move it forward as quickly as possible.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Alberta, Manitoba and Ontario have increased the funding to 
victims services.  If there is any other shortcoming it would be 
that the government has not necessarily provided the significant 
resources required for the implementation of some of the programs 
that will stem from the legislation.   As well, the federal 
government should now be perhaps looking specifically at funding 
some of these programs and avoiding duplication with the 
provinces, which is again something that all of us would be very 
reticent if we did not point it out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Young Offenders Act has been revised and the new youth 
criminal justice act will be coming into effect at some point, I 
suspect in the fall of the coming year.  It is very important 
that there be an attempt made to ensure that these two pieces of 
legislation work in unison.  I am speaking now of the areas of 
victims services and their administration and the costs 
associated with victims who are preyed upon by violent youth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sadly, without getting into a long diatribe about the new youth 
criminal justice system, I am reticent to say that much of the 
need that has been identified time and time again in the 
shortcomings of the old youth justice act will not be met by the 
new legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to victim surcharges and with respect to the 
identification and protection of victims, these legislative 
initiatives will attach to the new youth criminal justice system 
and must be viewed in a positive light. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard a number of graphic examples not only in the House 
but through the media.  At committee level we have heard horror 
stories about individuals who were crying out for the attention 
and protection of this place through legislation: the courts that 
inevitably interpret and decide much of the law and our law 
enforcement agencies and our frontline workers like children's 
aid and social services, those tasked with the very weighty and 
sometimes extremely difficult task of delivering services.  It is 
somewhat sad that we do not see a greater emphasis and a greater 
amount of priority placed on individuals on the frontline and in 
the trenches of the administration of laws such as Bill C-79. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To its credit the government has brought forward the legislation 
through the co-operation of members of the House and members of 
the committee.  There are very positive initiatives that come 
from it.  I know that victims advocates and victims themselves 
will be benefiting from the legislation when it becomes 
incorporated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Conservative Party of Canada continues in its commitment to 
furthering the rights of victims, to furthering the rights of 
those who are downtrodden in our justice system generally and are 
looking for positive change, in a non-partisan fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate all those who have been involved in moving the 
legislation forward.  We look forward to continued attempts to 
bring forward these types of positive initiatives.  I caution the 
government that if this is not happening, through the diligence 
of this party we will try to bring these matters forward to 
ensure that Canadians get the protection they need, deserve and 
should expect from their government.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise on behalf of the people of Surrey Central and in fact all 
Canadians to speak to Bill C-79, the government's proposal to 
change the Criminal Code to accommodate the rights of victims of 
crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for 
Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca who is also equally keen to speak to the 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The victims bill of rights only came about because of the 
pressure and input of all members of the Reform Party.  In the 
last parliament the hon. member for Langley—Abbotsford pursued a 
victims bill of rights. 
A Reform supply day motion was successfully passed in 1996 to 
cause the government to review and introduce legislation to 
improve federal laws to consider and recognize the rights of 
victims of crime.  The hon. member for Surrey North was also 
responsible for many of the committee recommendations.

<A HREF="#LINKT35"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill does not go far enough.  It is not what Canadians 
wanted.  Obviously victims were not a priority to the Liberal 
government of the 36th parliament.  The justice minister listed 
victims rights as one of her three top priorities, but despite 
that she has been stalling any action under the pretext of timely 
fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any time we ask her to take any action, or she is supposed to 
take any action, she has been using the excuse that she will be 
doing it in a timely fashion.  I do not know how long the victims 
can wait for her timely fashion while the minister is sitting on 
her hands doing nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though the bill does not go far enough we will take it.  It 
is not what Canadians wanted but still we will take it.  At least 
it is a start.  The bill has not been changed since it was 
introduced by the government.  Up until now it has yet to accept 
any amendments to the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has dug in its heels and said the bill includes 
all the rights it is prepared to grant the victims of crime. That 
is not enough.  We will continue to talk to the government until 
it places the rights of victims above the rights of the criminals 
in our criminal justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has not done enough.  Let us see what the 
government has not done in the bill.  It has not incorporated 
changes to the corrections and parole systems which are quite 
important.  Victims will still not have the right to participate 
in release hearings, be advised of escapes from custody, 
temporary absences and other important information that a victim 
of crime, particularly violent crime, would want to know in order 
to remain safe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about the people who have had to appear as a witness in a 
prosecution that resulted in a jail term for the guilty party? 
Let us say that an elderly person testifies that a certain person 
was the one who robbed him or her at knifepoint.  Would that 
Canadian not be very concerned about when the aggressor is out of 
jail?  Maybe the accuser would be afraid and would appreciate 
being alerted to the fact that the person who assaulted him or 
her was now out of jail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us imagine that.  Maybe the accused even threatened the 
accuser at the trail.  We should protect the victim.  It is not 
so difficult, as the amendments proposed by my colleague from 
Surrey North have demonstrated.  Let us see some of the 
initiatives included in Bill C-79. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Victims are to be informed of their right to prepare a victim 
impact statement at the time of sentencing.  That is good. 
Victims will have the choice to read the victim impact statement 
in court.  Victims of sexual assault or violent crime up to the 
age of 18 years are to be protected from personal 
cross-examination by self-represented accused persons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another initiative included in Bill C-79 is that police officers 
and judges are to consider the safety of victims in all bail 
decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are some of the initiatives in the bill. There are some 
more that I will not elaborate on but probably I could mention 
one or two.  Judges are required to inform the public of the 
possibility of section 745 applications for early parole for 
those who receive life sentences.  I understand in private 
members' hour today we will be talking about consecutive 
sentencing.  I will elaborate more then. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Victims and witnesses will have protection through banning 
publication of their identity where it is necessary for the 
proper administration of justice.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the concerns have been taken care of in this bill. 
However, we are concerned about the definition of victims within 
the Criminal Code.  We intend to pursue broadening the 
definition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is room for improvement.  There is room for amendment.  At 
least this is a step forward by the government in recognizing the 
rights of victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the government has done only half the job in 
looking out for the victims of crime.  However, I will support 
this bill in the end and I will limit my comments so that I do 
not delay its passing one more minute. 
<P><A NAME="LINK230"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, what initiatives does my colleague feel can be taken to 
ensure that victims have a greater say within our justice system? 
Does he feel the federal government should move away from 
focusing on the rehabilitation of criminals to protecting 
innocent civilians? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is a very good 
question.  There is a broad outlook of issues which are not 
included in this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Particularly, the government has not incorporated changes to the 
corrections and parole system, as I mentioned.  Also the victims 
will not have the right to participate in the release hearings. 
That is very important because there is information on temporary 
absences and other important information that a victim of crime, 
particularly violent crime, would want to know in order to remain 
safe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a whole host of issues which I believe this bill 
should have included, but I am glad that it is a step forward. 
We will take the view that at least we are stepping ahead and 
this is a step forward toward achieving what we want to achieve. 
<P><A NAME="LINK231"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate my hon. colleague allowing me to share his 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again I would like to compliment the hon. member for Surrey 
North on all the hard work that he and my colleagues have done in 
trying to change the justice system to make it a more realistic, 
pragmatic and effective justice system to ensure that there will 
be a balance:  those people who are a danger to society will be 
dealt with strongly and forcefully so they will not be able to 
victimize innocent civilians again and new initiatives can be 
utilized to prevent crime from occurring.  That is something in 
which my colleagues and members of other political parties have 
been taking a leadership role.  I hope that one day the 
government will listen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-79 has some very important points in it in terms of 
ensuring that victims have rights.  It ensures that we will be 
able to make a change to reverse what a Liberal government did 
some years ago.  I want to bring to the attention of members that 
in the early 1980s the justice minister of the then Liberal 
government said “From now on we are going to change our justice 
system from one of protecting society to one of rehabilitating 
the criminal”.  As a result, we have seen the faith of the 
public and the police forces in the system substantially eroded. 
It is our job to change that; not to do it in a grossly punitive 
and blind fashion, but to do it in a manner which strikes the 
balance that I spoke of earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to ensure that victims have a greater role within the 
justice system than the convicted.  In many cases we have seen 
convicted criminals who have greater access to social programs, 
rehabilitation and care than the people they victimized.  I can 
tell members of some tragic cases of families, adults and 
children who have been victimized and left out in the cold alone 
with little or no help, while the person who victimized them 
receives the lion's share of the help. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1305"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT38"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT38"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1305

<A HREF="#LINKT37"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that should change.  The first priority of the 
justice system should be the protection of innocent civilians. 
The second priority should be to ensure that those who have been 
victimized are taken care of and get the help which they require. 
The third priority should be to ensure that rehabilitation takes 
place so that we can break the cycle of crime, punishment and 
incarceration that we have been unsuccessful in accomplishing in 
so many unfortunate cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other side of the coin is how we deal with people who are in 
the justice system now and what we can do to prevent these 
situations from occurring.  I draw the attention of the House to 
the National Crime Prevention Council.  This council was enacted 
by edict from the justice department.  It has done excellent work 
in looking at ways in which we can prevent crime.  I want to 
outline a pragmatic way of doing it, which is to implement a 
national headstart program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This program was in a motion that was passed in the House last 
year.  The motion was based upon existing programs that work, 
such as the Hawaii healthy start program, the Ypsilanti Perry 
preschool program and the Moncton headstart program which the 
Minister of Labour and her husband took a leadership role in 
constructing in 1974. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These programs are modelled under the premise that if we can 
ensure that children have in the first eight years of life their 
basic needs met, then those children have a greater chance of 
developing a normal psyche than those who are subjected to child 
abuse, violence or more subtle negative factors such as improper 
parenting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we ensure that children have their basic needs met, if we 
also ensure that parents have the parenting skills to be able to 
do the job, to raise their children in a well defined system with 
boundaries and good discipline, where their children are in a 
caring, loving and secure environment and where they have proper 
nutrition, then those children have the greatest opportunity of 
being well adjusted, productive, integrated members of society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the model and the basis of the three programs that I 
mentioned.  Do they work?  Let us take a look. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Hawaii healthy start program the child abuse rate dropped 
99%.  What they did was very innovative, which I think we can do 
in our country.  They brought mentors, women who had children and 
good parenting skills, and they linked them up with parents who 
had children at risk.  By engaging in this mentoring program, by 
developing a trusting and secure relationship with these 
families, we saw a 99% reduction in child abuse, massive drops in 
drug abuse rates and an improvement in the socioeconomic welfare 
of these families.  It was a huge saving for the taxpayer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Perry preschool program, which has been in existence for 
some 30 years, there has been a $6 saving for every $1 invested. 
There has been a 50% reduction in youth crime.  There has been a 
40% reduction in teen pregnancy, which, as we know, unfortunately 
is usually a one-way route to poverty for both the mom and the 
baby.  We have seen children stay in school longer, with less 
dependence on welfare, which again results in savings to the 
taxpayer of $6 for every $1 invested. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Moncton headstart program, which the Minister of Labour 
championed with her husband, has shown similar effects.  All 
three of these programs are based on the premise that if we work 
with parents and families, if we ensure that their basic needs 
are met and if we encourage them and teach them how to do this 
for their children, we have a better, more integrated, safer and 
productive society because individuals are able to develop their 
psyches in a normal fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not a guarantee that this is going to happen by any 
stretch of the imagination, but the cold, hard facts prove that 
headstart works.  If this government is serious about preventing 
crime, it can do this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am calling for over 70 groups in the country to put pressure 
on the federal government to enact a national headstart program 
using existing resources.  We can use the medical community at 
time zero, because every pregnant woman goes to the doctor to 
have prenatal exams, and then we can address issues such as drug 
abuse.  Hopefully by doing that we can prevent the devastating 
effects that fetal alcohol syndrome have on our society.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Secondly, we could use the mentoring programs in the middle 
years, from the time the child is born until about age four, and 
then use the school system between the ages of four and eight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Moncton program was ideal in that it brought parents into 
the school system.  Parents came to the classroom once a week to 
learn basic essentials, such as proper discipline, setting 
boundaries and proper nutrition.  They would learn that a bag of 
chips and Coca Cola is not dinner and is bad for the child. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what we are asking the federal government to do.  That 
is what we are pushing for.  We started a massive campaign last 
week to push the government to pursue this.  It is a win-win 
situation for everybody. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will digress a little on the issue of victims.  As we said 
before, victims need rights.  Victims need to be appropriately 
represented within the justice system.  They do not at the 
present time have official status.  My colleague from British 
Columbia, our House leader, has put forth a victims bill of 
rights that would entrench the rights of the victim.  I hope the 
government pursues this because it is an act of fairness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to ensure that the government listens very clearly 
to us to ensure that victims get the care which they require 
because they are not getting it now.  They are being excluded 
from the social services that they need to patch up the sometimes 
extraordinary damage that has been inflicted upon them through 
assault, rape, battery, abuse and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have an opportunity to truly put balance into the justice 
system.  I hope the government takes it.  I also hope that it 
listens to our judiciary.  I hope it listens to the police 
departments who are saying very clearly, as the police chief from 
Vancouver said as a parting shot before he left, that we have a 
revolving door justice system.  Criminals come into the justice 
system who have made some serious errors.  Some of the hardest 
criminals go into the system and are tossed out the other end as 
quickly as they came in.  Justice is not being served. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we separate those high risk criminals who are dangerous to 
society and put the full force of the law against them, we will 
be saving people's lives.  If we take the rest who are low risk 
people and try diversionary tactics, diversionary methods through 
the justice system, if we try alternative methods to ensure that 
they pay back and engage in restitution with their victims and 
society, we will have a chance of building a safer, fairer 
society for all.

am pleased to rise to debate Bill C-64 at report stage.  I am 
very disappointed the government has put forth an amendment to 
the bill.  The official opposition certainly cannot support it 
and therefore I would like to move an amendment: 
<A NAME="LINK240">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the motion be amended by inserting after the word 
“committee” the words “of the elected House”. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that time is of the essence so I will be brief.  We 
believe this act should be reviewed by a House of Commons 
committee and not by just any committee of either House. The 
authority to legislate for the people of Canada rests with this 
House and not the other place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I really do not have a lot to say about the bill.  We have 
debated it in depth at committee stage.  If my memory serves me 
right, my understanding coming out of committee was that all 
parties agreed with the unamended Bill C-64. Bill C-64 is 
important and necessary.  It certainly will encourage the travel 
of historical exhibits around the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The amendment as

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Inky Mark:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the bill without any 
amendment is certainly a first step.  There is a lot of agreement 
with that statement.  Hopefully the legislation is not written in 
stone and that changes can be made down the road. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments put forth by the government have slowed the 
process down considerably.  As the opposition we want to see the 
bill pass all stages before the summer recess and will certainly 
support it in its unamended form.

I am pleased to speak to Bill C-64, an act to establish an 
indemnification program for travelling exhibitions, at report 
stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This program will save museums several hundreds of thousands of 
dollars in insurance. The Bloc Quebecois supports the bill in 
principle, but regrets that the amendments it suggested were 
rejected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, the Bloc Quebecois agrees with the idea of supporting 
museums by relieving them of some of the financial burdens they 
face.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In passing, I might mention that, right now in Quebec, from May 
16 to 30, there is a festival focusing on Quebec's museums 
called Musées en fête.  Today's topic is therefore very apt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to point out, as my colleagues did earlier, that 
Canada already had an indemnification program for exhibits.  It 
was introduced in 1985 and eliminated in 1995 under program 
review. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois feels that the motion moved by the party 
in power provides the federal government with a propaganda 
opportunity.  The assessment criteria for indemnification 
agreements set out in the bill include the educational and 
professional quality of the exhibition, as well as the significance and 
relevance to Canadians of the exhibition's theme and contents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These two criteria are purely subjective.  As a member of the 
Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage, I wish to cite an 
extract from the testimony by Michel Perron, CEO of the Société 
des musées québécois, on this topic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the committee's May 11 hearing, which I attended as a member, 
Mr. Perron said as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should it be necessary, we suggest that peer committees be used 
to help the minister decide and make the most appropriate choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The energy required to set up a travelling exhibition, the costs 
involved, the impact for visibility of the institutions involved 
means that the museums already exercise a great deal of judgment 
in making decisions relating to public interest, intellectual 
value and ethical considerations before getting involved in such 
projects. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois agrees with Mr. Perron. Museum 
curators are competent people with good judgment.  Unlike the 
minister, they are not out to propagandize. One of the finest 
examples of good management is the arts council. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois is also opposed to the motion proposed by 
the government which involves the Senate in a parliamentary 
committee. 
We are, however, in agreement with the opposition amendment to 
the motion, because it is along the lines of what we 
ourselves want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People from the community are needed here, including the museum 
curators.  In connection with the other place, incidentally, the 
1991 auditor general's report made 27 recommendations for 
corrections to the way the other place operates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like our colleagues across the way, we want to see this bill go 
through as quickly as possible, because its economic 
repercussions, for the arts community, among others, are huge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding of Argenteuil—Papineau—Mirabel, there are several 
really interesting museums.  I take this opportunity to 
congratulate their administrators on the highly professional job 
they are doing.  I encourage people to visit these museums. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the amendments proposed by the Bloc Quebecois we tried 
to include the small museums, so that there would be a greater 
selection of museums with more modest insurance risks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the Bloc Quebecois is in favour of Bill C-64 in 
principle, but against the motion proposed by the government. 
We are in favour of the amendment to the motion by the 
opposition, because we do not believe that the Senate ought to 
play this role for all of the reasons I have already set out.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise before the House to discuss proposed amendments 
to Bill C-64, the Canada Travelling Exhibitions Indemnification 
Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I speak to these amendments on behalf of our heritage critic, 
the member for West Nova, and on behalf of museums in Nova 
Scotia, many of which are in the riding I am fortunate enough to 
represent: Ross Farm Museum, small museums like DesBrisay Museum 
in Bridgewater and the Fisheries Museum of the Atlantic in 
Lunenburg. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we discuss these amendments to Bill C-64 let us keep in mind 
the importance of this piece of legislation to our museum 
community.  Let us focus some attention on the reasons why the 
legislation has become so necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ever since the Liberal government discontinued its cost sharing 
insurance arrangements with our Canadian museums, curators across 
the country have been calling for some kind of federal government 
assistance to help offset the huge costs associated with insuring 
travelling exhibitions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the indemnification for travelling exhibitions?  In 
essence, it means that the Canadian government will assume all 
financial risks for damages to contents contained within 
travelling exhibitions.  Not only will this indemnification 
program relieve some of the financial burden that is affecting 
most of Canada's museums, but it will help them to negotiate the 
loan of other prestigious foreign exhibitions.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1972 the initial budget for the museum assistance program 
hovered at around $8 million per year.  By the early 1990s the 
budget was increased to a maximum of $15 million, despite a 
Canadian Museum Association recommendation for a budget of $25 
million annually. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year the Liberal government reduced this amount to a paltry 
$6.5 million, leaving the museum industry reeling to find 
alternative financial resources.  The Minister of Canadian 
Heritage has since announced subsequent increases to the MAP of 
$2 million and $1 million respectively, putting the 1999 budget 
at $9.4 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This amount does not come close to responding to the grave 
concerns expressed by museum representatives.  As it now stands 
our museum directors barely have the resources necessary to 
maintain present exhibits, let alone to expand their collections. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Museums are more than just an historic account of time and place 
in Canadian history.  Museums contribute enormously to our local 
economy.  According to Mr. Robert Janes, president and chief 
executive officer of the Glenbow Museum in Calgary, Alberta, 
museums in Canada contribute $1 billion annually to the gross 
domestic product which includes 35,000 jobs, directly and 
indirectly, as well as $650 million in labour income.  These 
figures suggest that this cultural industry is a very significant 
contributor to Canada's economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada Travelling Exhibitions Indemnification Act could be a 
very effective tool in helping Canadian museums bring in more 
attractive exhibitions, enticing a greater participation from 
both Canadian and foreign audiences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Already current statistics indicate that over 55 million 
visitors a year enter Canada's approximately 2,000 museums.  This 
is a very impressive number of visitors.  The credit for this 
success belongs to our dedicated museum staff along with the over 
50,000 volunteers who devote their time and energy toward helping 
maintain an important element of Canadian history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned previously, the bill responds to certain needs 
within our museum industry.  Therefore I believe we should 
proceed with the passing of this piece of legislation as quickly 
as possible.  The proposed amendments will not weaken the bill 
but instead will open the door to greater participation and 
greater input from all parliamentarians.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that 90% of Canadians polled by Pollara last year agreed 
that multiple murderers and multiple rapists should receive 
consecutive rather than concurrent sentencing.  I believe that 
Canadians support consecutive sentencing because Canadians think 
that every victim should receive some measure of justice and that 
every victim should count in the sentencing equation where rape 
or murder is involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is because of those victims and the many, many families of 
victims I have met over three years that I have chosen not to 
accept the dismissal of Bill C-251 by any committee or 
subcommittee without a final vote in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have also been encouraged by the continuous support of so many 
members who have shown that they care most about the impact of 
laws on victims and families.  They have proven that it is 
possible for members from all sides of the House to put 
partisanship aside and work together to achieve a real 
improvement in our justice system.

support the bill but I have also listened just as carefully to 
colleagues who do not support my bill.  I have listened and I 
have learned that there is indeed a virtual consensus among MPs 
on one point, that being that the current system of automatic 
concurrent sentences for murder and virtually automatic 
concurrent sentencing for rape is wrong and must be changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What remains is a debate on the extent of judicial discretion. I 
have heard colleagues say that they are not against consecutive 
sentencing but they are against mandatory consecutive sentencing, 
that they want to let judges decide what sentence should be 
imposed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As all members well know, judges have no discretion to impose 
consecutive sentencing for murder.  A concurrent sentence must 
always apply no matter what the circumstance.  So we have no 
judicial discretion in the courts today on this point.  The law 
is that the second murder victim does not count regardless of 
what a judge may think. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that the second murder or sexual assault victim should 
always count. We should not continue to send a message to 
multiple murderers and rapists that the number of victims does 
not matter.  That is wrong and dangerous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in my estimation, our priority must be to change the 
current system and its mandatory bulk rate for murder to provide 
at least for a judge to be able to impose consecutive sentencing 
for murder, something that they cannot do right now. I have 
agreed to support an amendment to my bill to provide the judicial 
discretion sought by my colleagues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment submitted by the member for Leeds—Grenville will 
provide full judicial discretion as to whether a concurrent or 
consecutive sentence should apply for murder.  This will give a 
judge the latitude to give the next Paul Bernardo a sentence that 
denies him parole for 25 years for the first murder and up to 25 
years for the second murder. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The alternative is to maintain the current system where multiple 
murderers face not even the possibility of an incremental 
sentence for additional murders.  The status quo is not 
acceptable to the majority of Canadians 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of sexual assault, even the most prolific multiple 
rapist of the 1990s received concurrent sentences.  These 
discounts were given because concurrent sentencing has become the 
norm from which judges are shy to deviate. A second amendment to 
my bill also submitted by the member for Leeds—Grenville 
proposes to maintain judicial discretion but present consecutive 
sentencing as the standard.

concurrent rather than consecutive sentences in a particular 
case.  I believe this is a significant and positive change from 
the current law and one which will provide more justice for women 
and children who fall victim to sexual predators in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With these amendments, Bill C-251 boils down to one single 
question.  Do members of this House support the status quo of 
automatic concurrent sentences for all multiple murderers and 
virtually automatic concurrent sentences for all multiple sex 
offenders? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask members to end the hopelessness of that injustice and the 
anguish it causes to the victims and the families of victims.  I 
ask members to look on the amended Bill C-251 as a measured 
advance toward fairness and proportionality in sentencing with 
all the safeguards that complete judicial discretion can offer.

amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK255"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):</B>   Mr. Speaker, 
Bill C-251 calls for anyone convicted of sexual assault to serve 
that sentence consecutively to any other sentence.  It also calls 
for consecutive parole ineligibility periods for those who commit 
multiple or serial murders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current discretion judges have to impose consecutive 
sentences for sex offenders is unacceptable.  Consecutive 
sentences for these offences should be mandatory.  One of my 
motions in the House as a new member of parliament was along the 
same lines as Bill C-251. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My motion M-23 calls for the House to provide that in cases 
where an accused person is convicted of multiple criminal 
offences, that person should receive consecutive sentences.  My 
motion at that time was even broader and tougher than the scope 
of Bill C-251. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We on this side of the House have been calling for truth in 
sentencing for many years.  Without truth in sentencing we lose 
confidence in our criminal justice system, and the justice 
minister admitted that in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bernardo brutally killed two people. Clifford Olson committed 
multiple murders.  We feel that these individuals should serve 
multiple consecutive sentences.  Justice must be done and seen to 
be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today with the passage of this bill, criminals would know that 
when they commit crimes they will serve the time.  We must hold 
criminals accountable and punish them for all the crimes they 
commit.  We must make a difference in the punishment for one 
murder versus more than one murder. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should all support the bill for at least it is a start.  It 
is a long way from providing sufficient protection within our 
communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should be looking through the lens of issues and not through 
the lens of political stripes.  We should support any member of 
the House when he or she is doing the right thing.  On this side 
of the House we are allowed to do that and we expect the same 
courtesy from the government side as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, I was pleased to swap my speaking spot with the hon. 
Liberal member so he could move the amendment on this important 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My will end my comments now because my constituents of Surrey 
Central do not want to hold this bill up for one more minute. The 
people who elected me to represent them in the House want me to 
do everything I can to get tough on crime.  We believe that 
consecutive sentences for consecutive crimes is very fair.  If 
they do the crime, they will do the time. 
<P><A NAME="LINK256"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to take part in the debate.  I am 
also very pleased to support the efforts of the hon. member who 
moved this particular motion and who has been so diligent in her 
pursuit of this particular issue.  Her perseverance is certainly 
noted by Canadians, by victims and by those who work closely in 
the justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of quick facts that I want to bring to the 
attention of members present and the Canadian public with respect 
to the effects of consecutive versus concurrent sentencing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After being convicted of a savage and sadistic murder of three 
teenage girls in the 1990s, Mr. Bernardo was sentenced to receive 
three concurrent life sentences. 
This individual, although subject to dangerous offender 
provisions, under the old sections could apply for judicial 
review of his sentence in the year 2008.  He would be eligible 
for day release in the year 2015, after taking three lives. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1350"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT46"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clifford Olson is currently serving 11 concurrent life 
sentences.  He will not spend one extra day in jail than if he 
had taken only one life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pedophile John Roby had been convicted of 35 counts of sexually 
abusing children.  The victims' families were shocked to learn 
that, after being convicted to 27 counts of sexual assault on 
children, Mr. Roby was sentenced to a two year prison term. After 
several other victims came forward, the Ontario Court of Appeal, 
in its wisdom, did increase the sentence but only to five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995 serial killer John Martin Crawford was charged with 
three counts of first degree murder and he will be eligible for 
parole after 15 years under the old faint hope clause, again, an 
abominable section of our Criminal Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1977 there were 296,737 violent crimes committed in Canada. 
Included in that number were 581 homicides.  These are telling 
statistics.  Just imagine if these murderers realized that they 
could continue to take lives of victims without any fear of a 
stronger punishment, which is the current situation.  Parliament 
is ultimately encouraging, as the hon. member has repeated time 
and time again, volume discounts with respect to the most high 
end, most serious and heinous crimes in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To that end, the perception is what is sometimes most important, 
the feeling among the criminal element that the justice system 
will not react in an appropriate and proportional way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1994 a top Italian judge made this commentary on Canada's 
justice system.  He stated that Canada is becoming a haven for 
organized crime due largely to Canada's lenient judicial system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-251 passed second reading by a vote of 81 to 3 in the 
House.  This is an overwhelming majority with respect to a piece 
of legislation such as this.  This particular bill then proceeded 
on to the justice committee where it was gutted by the Liberal 
majority on that committee.  I would suggest that this is an 
affront to parliament because certainly this shows a lack of 
respect for the original will that was passed in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Department of the Solicitor General has released statistics 
that show that a released child molester who targets male victims 
had a 77% recidivism rate.  For 100 of those largely repeat 
offenders who are released that is 77 more young lives that could 
be shattered as a result of repeat offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This particular debate taking place today is the third 
incarnation of what have been many years of diligent effort and 
perseverance on the part of my hon. colleague from Mississauga 
East.  The House has displayed in the past a lack of courage to 
approach this type of legislation.  The House can be assured that 
it will be proposed again and again unless the House fulfils its 
responsibilities to the victims of repeat offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many critics of the bill will look south of the border, point to 
the United States and say that consecutive sentences do not 
reduce crime.  However, many will also recognize, including the 
hon. member opposite, that crime rates will go down with respect 
to the perpetration of crime by those specific individuals who 
would be sentenced to longer periods of incarceration if the bill 
were to pass. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's obligation is to ensure the protection of its citizens 
first and foremost.  The rudimentary principles of justice 
dictate that a judge take into consideration issues such as 
general and specific deterrents.  Reformation and rehabilitation, 
of course, always play a part of it.  Deterrents and denunciation 
is often whispered in the halls of justice.  It is not something 
that individuals seem quick to discuss.  However, the protection 
of the public is the primary duty and obligation of those tasked 
with enforcement of law in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rate of violent crime has increased by an average of 4% 
every year from 1978 to 1993.  It is now 400% higher in the 
country than it was in the 1960s.  There has, however, been a 
slight decline of 3% between 1993 and 1994.  According to 
victimization studies undertaken by Statistics Canada, in 1993 
24% of all adult Canadians were victims of at least one criminal 
act within the preceding 12 months.  Canadians are 50% more 
likely than Europeans and 500% more likely than Japanese to be 
victims of burglary, assault, sexual offences or robbery. 
This comes from Statistics Canada, 1993, CCJS, <I>Juristat</I>, 
Vol. 14, No. 17, 1994 edition.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to a 1996 Pollara survey which was conducted 
independently by the hon. member for Mississauga East, 90% of 
Canadians support this legislative initiative in some 
incarnation.  That number also includes the support of the 
Canadian Police Association, the victims resource centre 
spokesman Steve Sullivan and other interested groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The entire issue of consecutive versus concurrent sentencing has 
received a great deal of debate in this place. The principle is 
quite simple.  There are very strict guidelines that direct 
judges in the country currently with respect to the imposition of 
sentencing.  Proportionality is something that must always be 
kept in mind.  Judges do not have a cookie cutter approach when 
they are faced with the imposition of a sentence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member in this legislation has increased discretion on 
the part of a judge.  A judge is not mandated by this legislation 
to impose a consecutive sentence; a judge is however in extremely 
aggravated circumstances in a situation at the high end of 
violence with repeat connotations of sexual assault or violence. 
In those instances why would we hesitate to put into the hands of 
a judge the discretion to respond in a more appropriate and 
proportionate fashion?  Why would we shirk that responsibility? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member has brought this matter forward. She has been 
extremely patient with her own government in putting water with 
the wine when it came to amendments to this bill.  She does have 
the support of many on the opposition side and I suggest many on 
the government side.  She has also expressed quite fairly and 
accurately in her statements here today that this is a matter 
that should be put to a vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The democratic will should be expressed on an issue of such 
great importance. A vote would be the expression of the 
democratic will of parliament.  Without it, it will not reflect 
the democratic will of the people of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Concurrent sentences ignore the individuality and the pain and 
violation that is suffered by victims of crime.  A specific 
recognition of each crime, of each victim is what this 
legislation seeks to achieve.  Violence must be met by the state 
with strength.  This bill allows the state to respond 
appropriately in very limited circumstances where high end 
violence is at the centre of the court proceedings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what this bill seeks to do.  It puts greater discretion 
forward. Why would we not want to put the trust in the hands of 
our judiciary to exercise that discretion appropriately? We are 
infinitely aware in this place of the checks and balances and the 
safeguards that do exist with respect to courts of appeal and the 
Supreme Court of Canada.  Let us not miss this opportunity today 
to bring this legislation to a point where a vote will occur, 
where the expression of the people of Canada will be heard.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jacques Saada (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this bill has some extremely 
important human implications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to begin by reading a very short quote from a brief 
presented to the committee studying Bill C-251.  It says, in 
substance: 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“We cannot rely exclusively on the sentence in finding just the 
right number of years to satisfy what can never be satisfied 
fully and certainly not in a courtroom or a penitentiary.  No 
number of years, be they 25, 50 or 150 or more can return a loved 
one nor restore innocence”. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This quote is from the Church Council on Justice and 
Corrections. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, the amendments we are discussing today came 
along very late, and we could have done with a little more time 
to examine them in depth in order to make informed decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would prefer to speak, if I may, of the underlying principles 
that guide me, as well as of certain myths that need to be done 
away with.  Then at the end I shall indicate my support or 
non-support of this bill. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1400"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT48"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, let us deal with the myths.  We often hear it said 
that life sentences are not life sentences.  This is false.  A 
life sentence means that the inmate will never again be free in 
his entire lifetime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is much reference made to the Bernardo and Olson cases. 
People seem to forget that there have already been amendments 
made to the Criminal Code to deal with this type of problem. 
Section 745.6 of the Criminal Code does not authorize a judicial 
review for such cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, the present Criminal Code allows judges to impose 
consecutive sentences.  They have that latitude. 
Judges already take recidivism into account.  Do they take it 
sufficiently into account?  Should they accord more 
importance to it?  Are there messages that should be sent?  All 
this is possible, but, technically, these tools are already in 
the hands of the judiciary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another popular myth is that the Canadian justice system is not 
very tough.  Our justice system is the toughest, after the 
United States, of all comparable nations.  I am thinking of 
France, Great Britain, Japan, Australia, and so on.  We have the 
second toughest justice system of all these countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the average time someone sentenced to life spends 
incarcerated—meaning behind bars—is over 28 years.  This puts us 
second behind the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not passing a value judgment.  I am not saying that this is 
good or bad.  I am merely pointing out the facts.  This is how 
it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the United States, mandatory consecutive sentencing is not 
working.  Like me, members have probably read the article in 
<I>Time</I> magazine.  This was not for sex-related crimes.  It was for 
drugs in particular.  The principle was the same. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The title in question is “A get tough policy that failed”. 
Mandatory sentencing was once America's law and order panacea. 
Here is why it is not working. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to see that the amendments proposed today include a 
return to judicial discretion and a departure from this kind of 
automatism.  I would like to explain why I think this is 
important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I will speak to judicial discretion.  Canada's first 
Criminal Code, in 1892, already gave judges discretionary power. 
This power still exists today.  I am referring to section 
718.3(4) of the Criminal Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Judges must give reasons for their decisions. 
This means that the public has access to the reasons on which 
the judge based his or her decision whether or not to impose 
consecutive sentences. It is important to maintain judiciary 
discretion because, if judges do not want to do it, it will be 
done by the crown attorneys, who are not required to make their 
reasons public. Therefore, it is important that judiciary 
discretion be maintained. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Automatic sentences would be more or less like having the 
sentence determined by a computer. A person would feed all the data 
regarding the circumstances of a crime into the computer and it 
would indicate what sentence must be imposed. That is why I am 
against automatic sentences. I believe an amendment was put 
forward to change that. I am looking forward to reviewing it in 
detail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before deciding whether I will support this new version, 
I will need to make sure that nothing will get in the way of 
judiciary discretion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will need to make sure that nothing in this bill will 
perpetuate the myths I mentioned a few moments ago.

delicacy such questions require. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one thing in my career as member of parliament that I 
will never forget. It was an event that occurred in 1995 in 
Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, a few feet from my office, when a 13-year 
old child was killed as the result of an explosion in a car 
bombing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the parliamentary secretary, who said the last 
thing we need as parliamentarians in considering these issues is 
to be revengeful or bitter. I do not think that was the case 
with our colleague when she introduced the bill before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She is right to remind us that there are provisions in the 
Criminal Code—and I am thinking specifically of section 
718.3—containing guidelines for the imposition of cumulative 
sentences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I would like those watching us today to understand we 
are discussing a private member's bill. It is the prerogative of 
all members of the House of Commons to initiate debates on 
issues of concern to their voters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope we have this debate. 
I have not yet decided whether I will vote in favour or against 
the bill, but I can tell the member that I am very moved by her 
arguments. I have in fact asked for a meeting with her in her 
office next week so we may discuss matters further, and I do not 
exclude the possibility of supporting her initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I belong to a political party that believes fundamentally in the 
value of rehabilitation. Clearly, the Bloc Quebecois, its 
justice critic, the member for Berthier—Montcalm, and all those 
in the Bloc caucus believe in rehabilitation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are times in life when inappropriate behaviour occurs and 
petty criminals commit offences that must be sanctioned, 
but at the same time we want the legislator to put resources at 
the disposal of people who, through a community involvement that 
begins with the assistance provided by health care professionals, 
will firmly embark on a rehabilitation process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also realize, as the hon. member for Mississauga East pointed 
out, that there are people for whom rehabilitation will not 
work. Rehabilitation is not an option in the case of serial 
killers or rapists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am grateful to the hon. member for Mississauga East for 
reminding us that her bill applies only to a very small 
percentage of criminals. I believe she said 1%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Still, it is important to hold this debate, because when some 
individuals in a community destroy the lives of others through 
their actions we have a right to expect the judiciary, the 
various courts of law, including the supreme court, to make fair 
rulings.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My understanding is that, with her bill, the hon. member seeks 
to provide greater flexibility to the courts and the judges so 
that when they deem it appropriate they will have the power to 
issue a verdict commensurate with the offence that was 
committed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that my party will discuss these issues. Again, I am 
grateful to the hon. member for assuming her role of 
parliamentarian and making us aware of these important issues. I 
can assure her that all Bloc Quebecois members will give 
very objective and serious consideration to her bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for what happens later, I am certain that, as a parliamentary 
team, we will be the most respectful of her intentions and the 
most respectful of what we are as a party, which is to say a 
party that is well aware that there is an extremely small number 
of people for whom rehabilitation does not make any sense.  They 
represent perhaps 1% of those who are criminalized. 
It is therefore important that judges be able to take this into 
account in their verdicts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will at all times remind others, as the member for 
Bertier—Montcalm has done, as all of my colleagues who are taking 
part in the proceedings of the standing committee on justice 
have done, that the great challenge we face is also to make 
ourselves available, to call on this parliament and on 
provincial legislatures to allocate resources for those who 
stand to benefit from rehabilitation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the second hour of debate we will again be able to take a 
look at this bill. 
Again, we are deeply indebted to the member for taking her 
parliamentary duties so seriously.
