</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Karygiannis (Scarborough—Agincourt, Lib.)</B> moved:

</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House:

</I></B></P><P align=left>(a) join the members of the Canadian Armenian community in 
honouring the memory of the 1.5 million men, women and children 
who fell victim of the first genocide of the 20th century; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(b) condemn the genocide of the Armenians and all other acts of 
genocide committed during our century as the ultimate act of 
racial, religious and cultural intolerance;

such dark chapters in human history to ensure that such crimes

to deny or distort the historical truth of the genocide of the 
Armenians and other acts of genocide committed during this

as a day of remembrance of the 1.5 million Armenians who fell 
victim to the first genocide of this century; and 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(f) call on the Government of Canada officially to condemn the 
genocide of the Armenians and any attempts to deny such crimes

</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, I thank the Armenian World Alliance for 
its inspiration to draft this motion as well as Mr. Haig Misakyan 
and Hratch Tourikian for their support and guidance; also, Mr. 
Aris Babikian of the Armenian National Federation and Apkar 
Mirakian of the Canadian Armenian National Committee for their 
continuous support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of this motion is to give official Canadian 
recognition of the Armenian genocide which started April 24, 1915 
and lasted until 1923, during which over 1.5 million Armenians 
were subjected to systematic extermination through a policy of 
deportation, torture, starvation and mostly massacre. 
I would like first of all, just so that we are clear on what is 
at the heart of this motion, to read the Oxford Dictionary 
definition of genocide which defines it as “the deliberate 
extermination of a race or nation”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The facts of the Armenian genocide are well known and I will not 
take up the time of the House with a long list of historical 
references.  I would, however, like to point out that this 
recognition of the death of 1.5 million victims is long overdue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliament passed a motion with regard to this event in April 
1996.  The motion was, however, changed in a critical manner by 
dropping the word “genocide” and replacing it with the term 
“tragic event”.  To my mind, the sinking of the <I>Titanic</I> 
and the great Halifax fire were tragic events.  What happened was 
and is nothing other than genocide and to call it anything else 
is to deny its existence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In March and April 1980 the Ontario legislature and the Quebec 
national assembly passed a resolution asking the Government of 
Canada to recognize and officially condemn this genocide and the 
atrocities committed the Ottoman government against the Armenian 
people. The United Nations recognized Armenian genocide in 1986 
and the European parliament voted to recognize this genocide in 
1987, as well as the Belgian, Greek, French and Australian 
parliaments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that the House made a mistake by trivializing this 
horrendous act of barbarism and I am disappointed that this 
motion was not made a votable motion so that the House could take 
the necessary steps to right this wrong once and for all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other section of my motion such as the designation of April 
24 as a day of remembrance would I believe be most fitting under 
the circumstances and it would not involve making it a national 
holiday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The condemnation of attempts to deny or distort what happened 
during the years of the genocide is to ensure that the Ernst 
Zundels of this world cannot refute what is fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned, April 24 was the beginning of the Armenian 
genocide committed by the Ottoman empire in 1915.  On that day 
300,000 intellectuals were rounded up from their houses and taken 
into the desert.  The leadership of the community was taken so 
there would be no resistance to this crime that was to be carried 
out over the next eight to twelve months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of this holocaust 1.5 million people were murdered 
and another 500,000 were deported from their homelands.  As of 
now the crime remains unpunished. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know very well what happened to the Jewish population in 
World War II beginning in 1939.  The world was silent.  It stood 
silent while six million Jews were slaughtered.  Nobody said a 
word until the war was over.  Why did we have to wait until the 
number reached six million before we spoke out?  Why do we have 
to wait until the numbers reached 1.5 million before we spoke 
out?  Why can we not make our position known to everyone that 
this will not be tolerated? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1939 when Adolf Hitler was giving his orders to SS units to 
slaughter the Jewish population he said “Who remembers the 
extermination of the Armenian people today?”  That was on August 
9, 1939. Today is February 15, 1999.  I hope and pray this House 
will remember that the message of Adolf Hitler was wrong in 1939. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I and many members of the House have spoken against this 
genocide.  We should continue to do that because it is very 
important to remember. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to conclude with what has been a rather overused 
cliché but one I believe is apt under the circumstances, that 
those who forget the past are condemned to repeat it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not forget. 
<P><A NAME="LINK5"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Julian Reed (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I seek the unanimous 
consent of the House to divide my time with the member for Laval 
West. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Does the House give its consent to 
divide the time, I presume equally? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Julian Reed:</B>  Mr. Speaker, there is an ongoing dispute 
between people of Armenian and Turkish descent about events that 
took place during World War I in the Ottoman empire. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see Armenians in Canada and elsewhere asking for recognition 
that genocide was committed in 1915 against Armenian populations 
of Anatolia. 
This request is often associated with suggestions that 
restitution should be paid to the Armenians or that territorial 
adjustments should be made to the existing border between Turkey 
and Armenia. Turkey has rejected these claims.

<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, we see the Turkish people profoundly hurt by 
the accusation of genocide.  The Turkish government, expressing 
views of Turkish public opinion in general, reacts sharply 
against such an accusation.  Turkish authorities also fear that 
the kind of terrorism used in the past by some fanatic Armenian 
underground organizations to promote their claims could 
resurface. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In trying to understand the points of view of both sides in this 
conflict we should always remind ourselves that there was 
enormous suffering for all the people involved in the 1915 events 
and that in addition to the death of solders there were literally 
millions of innocent civilian victims in this conflict on both 
sides.  We have to be respectful of that suffering and therefore 
tread carefully and avoid making hasty judgments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a tendency nowadays to use the word genocide in a 
non-technical manner and even sometimes almost as a metaphor. We 
have all heard expressions like economic genocide or cultural 
genocide.  One should realize, however, that genocide is a very 
specific crime and a particularly horrendous one.  When making an 
accusation of genocide implied is the fact that there are 
criminals who are responsible for the crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened in 1915?  Both sides in the dispute have their own 
parts of view and generally highlight different events.  The 
Turkish side emphasises particularly events at the beginning of 
World War I.  The Ottoman empire entered World War I on November 
1, 1914 on the side of the central powers and became 
automatically at war with the Russian empire. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to historians favourable to the Turkish side, an 
Armenian rebellion against military conscription had begun in 
August 1914, even before the beginning of the war.  Particularly 
in eastern Anatolia, Armenian guerrilla bands organized and 
obtained some arms and support from Russia.  In theory, young 
Armenian males should have been conscripted into the army along 
with Muslims, but tens of thousands escaped to join guerrilla 
bands or fled to Russia, ultimately to fight alongside the 
Russian army when it marched into Anatolia.  The general picture 
that is created is that of a rebellious Armenian population which 
had particular affinities with the Russian invading army, one of 
them being the Christian religion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One particularly noteworthy episode of this war was the 
rebellion in and around the city of Van in March 1915 when the 
imperial Russian army was approaching Van.  The uprising quickly 
took the character of an intercommunal war.  Armed Armenian bands 
attacked Muslims, mainly Kurdish villages.  Kurdish tribesmen 
retaliated by attacking Armenian villages. Victims fell on both 
sides.  The Armenian rebels eventually took control of the city 
of Van were some 30,000 Muslims perished between February and 
April 1915 according to Turkish estimates.  These events are 
still commemorated every year in Van.  Similar episodes 
reportedly occurred in other cities and villages as the Russians 
advanced in eastern Anatolia.  The victory for the Russians was 
also the victory for the Armenians.  Large Muslin populations in 
turn had to flee to central Anatolia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Armenians focus on particular episodes of the conflict starting 
in April 1915.  On April 24, soon after the events in Van, 
Ottoman authorities proceeded to arrest some 235 Armenian leaders 
for activities against the state.  This is a date which has a 
symbolic value for Armenians and they claim that these 235 
leaders, the elite of the Armenian society at the time in the 
empire, were the object of a massacre.  This claim is rejected by 
Turkish authorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Soon after, in may 1915, the Ottoman council of ministers 
ordered the forced relocation of Armenian communities of central, 
eastern and southeastern Anatolia to Syria, Lebanon and Iraq, 
which at the time were Ottoman provinces.  The decision was 
implemented gradually over the next two years.  Of the estimated 
700,000 Armenians who were thus forcefully relocated, many died 
due to the manner in which the relocation was taking place at a 
time when the Ottoman empire was collapsing. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1115"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They perished mainly due to disease, harsh weather, exposure and 
hunger.  This is the episode that many Armenians believe 
constitutes genocide.  They portray this deportation as a 
decision aimed at exterminating the Armenian population in 
general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Turkish authorities argue that this was not the case and that 
although many people died as a result of the relocation it was 
not intended as a measure to kill Armenians and that there is no 
proof to that effect.  Turkish authorities have argued that the 
so-called Andonian papers which appeared in the 1950s and 
attributed genocidal decisions to high Ottoman leaders of the 
time were simply forgeries, not corroborated by any official 
documents of the time.  On the contrary, they contend that the 
evidence of the official archives of the time, which are open to 
historians, reveals that the relocation was intended to be 
conducted in a humanitarian manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened after World War I?  The armistice that put an end 
to World War I in 1918 sanctioned the collapse of the Ottoman 
empire.  The empire no longer existed as a sovereign state. 
Istanbul was occupied by the allies, the ports of northwestern 
Anatolia by the British, southern Anatolia by the Italians, 
southeastern Anatolia by the French and the Armenian legion, 
western Anatolia by Greeks, and northeastern Anatolia by 
Armenians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was in the spring and summer of 1919 that General Mustafa 
Kemal Ataturk decided to mobilize the country and to wage war 
against all occupiers, thus laying the foundations of modern 
Turkey.  For all population groups of Anatolia this meant further 
war.  The Turkish army reconquered eastern Turkish cities and 
territories still occupied by the Armenians and marched north 
more or less up to the present Turkish borders with Armenia and 
Georgia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was enormous suffering on both sides.  There was also 
immense suffering on the part of innocent civilian populations. 
The succession of wars and conflicts that took place during this 
period in that part of the world is staggering.  Exact figures of 
people killed during such a troubled period of history are 
extremely difficult to determine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the Paris Peace Conference in 1919 the head of the Armenian 
delegation set the figure for Armenian losses at 300,000.  By 
1989, 1.5 million had become the number generally used by the 
Armenians.  Turkish scholars argue that a more realistic figure 
based on data available would be around 600,000.  The same 
scholars estimate that the civilian Muslim losses during the same 
period could be between 2.5 million and 3 million people.  In any 
case the figures of those who died, both Armenians and 
non-Armenians, are very large. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How should Canada respond?  What we should do today is to try to 
encourage reconciliation, tolerance and respect for the suffering 
of all groups in the region and their descendants for whom these 
events are not far away in history but unfortunately all too 
present in their daily lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The resolution before the House is not what is needed.  It is 
not helpful in bringing about tolerance, a more dispassionate 
look at the past, and eventually reconciliation.  It asks us to 
take one side in a matter which is offensive to the other side. 
If we as Canadians want to be helpful in this respect we should 
be careful not to exacerbate old and bitter conflicts.  We should 
try to bring closure for the Armenians and Turks and encourage 
each side to see and recognize the terrible suffering through 
which the other side went. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the sense of government that the House of Commons as an 
institution should not do anything that would bring new tensions 
between Canadians of Armenian and Turkish descent. 
<P><A NAME="LINK6"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to recognize the members of the Armenian National Committee who 
are in the gallery, members of the Turkish community who are 
here, and all those who are watching this issue so carefully. 
What we have just seen indicates probably how volatile the issue 
is. 
We are talking about a time period from 1915 to 1923.  Among all 
parties and all Canadians we find a great deal of 
misunderstanding and hostility which shows how volatile the issue 
is. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1120"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In reading the documentation on both sides of the issue, one 
starts to realize how terrible the word genocide is and the type 
of killing that can go on over religion, various ethnic mixes and 
so on.  We have listened to some of the history and we could get 
the same history on either side.  I was moved by the severity of 
the information we can read on the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to talk about four points.  The first is a motion 
like this one being dealt with in the House.  In the ethnic 
communities across Canada, of which we are all very proud and 
which are an intricate part of the country, we so often fail to 
let them know how the House of Commons works.  A motion like this 
one is put and they actually have hope that their particular area 
will be dealt with, that they will get something from the House 
of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, you have been here long enough to know that will 
not happen.  A motion like this one is not really a debate.  It 
does not put all the issues on the table.  It is not coming to 
any kind of a conclusion.  I think that is wrong and is one area 
we must change in the House of Commons.  We must make these 
things more meaningful because they are so deep in the hearts of 
the people who are involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second is the issue of genocide itself.  We could get out the 
dictionary and talk about what it is.  I probably could bring 
forward the best meaning from my visit to Bosnia where we went 
out and actually talked to the people.  We went into churches, 
mosques, bars and restaurants.  We stopped little old ladies on 
the street and asked them what they thought of what was 
happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was in nine different schools where I asked the students to 
write in their own words what it meant to be part of ethnic 
cleansing.  I asked them to tell me what their futures were and 
what would really happen.  The words of those kids were pretty 
touching.  They made us cry.  If we talk to Serbian children they 
tell us about the terrible killings that went on and about the 
600,000 people who died.  They would describe it like it was 
yesterday, but they were talking about back in 1943. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could talk to Croat children and Muslim children and they 
would tell us about things as if they happened yesterday.  I will 
always remember one little girl's face when she was telling me 
about the killings.  She was talking about the killings in 1536 
like it was yesterday.  That is what genocide is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether we are talking about the Roman empire, the Greeks, 
Napoleon, the Vikings, the African tribes, the first world war or 
the second world war or whomever, we will find incidents of what 
we would classify as genocide, a holocaust.  Whatever words we 
use they are all horrible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In parliament we often have a double standard in the way we 
think about things.  Quite often we do not have all the 
information.  Every time I hear that our prime minister or 
foreign affairs minister has visited Cuba again—I know about the 
horrible human rights abuses in that country—I get mad because 
of that standard.  People are being persecuted in Cuba. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I read all the material and to try to put some real meaning to 
it I took some quotes at random from either side. 
I heard things like: “People fled with whatever property they 
could carry.  On the road they were robbed, the women were 
repeatedly raped and then the men were killed.  Women and young 
children were then killed systematically.  My mother's cousin, 
with her child still nursing at her breast, was shot.  Later that 
still nursing baby was killed with a bayonet”.  That is 
genocide. That is horrible.  All of us would say that is inhuman. 
We cannot let that happen. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1125"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about this sort of thing, it is the human issues we 
are talking about.  I can see why people feel so emotional about 
them and why they remember 1915 and why they remember 1536 and so 
on.  The events are so horrible that they would undoubtedly 
change people who witnessed them for the rest of their lives and 
it would be passed on from generation to generation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time to move on.  We need to get all the information on 
the table, whether it is the Armenian-Turkish situation, what 
happened in World War II or what happened in Nanking, China, when 
the Japanese came.  Wherever it happened it is time to get 
historians to put all the cards on the table. In a House like 
ours we look at the history but most important we move on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has an important world role.  We are members of almost 
everything.  We are members of all important organizations and 
have a very important role in them.  The level of respect for 
Canadians gives us that role.  Our role is one of a negotiator. 
We are good at that.  It is one thing we can do well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has a role whether it is solving the problem of the 
Armenian-Turkish-Ottoman crisis that is so real to people, or 
whether it is something between India and Pakistan, between 
Israel and Palestine, in Sudan between the north and the south 
and 43 years of war, or north Korea and south Korea.  The list 
goes on and on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could talk about the genocide and the killings on both sides, 
but if there is one message to send it is what should Canadians 
be doing in foreign affairs.  I do not believe a soft power 
approach is the way to go.  I do not believe in simply waiting 
and seeing what happens, kind of coasting along and making 
grandiose statements about people and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us do something.  Let us not let the Rwandas happen.  Let us 
not let the Kosovos happen.  Let us take an active role and let 
us back it up with a modern, well mandated military that knows 
what it is doing.  Let us back it up with some power.  We need to 
do some real reform of how we look at the UN and of how we handle 
all these issues.  It is diplomacy.  That is what it is about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Canadian politicians we should be putting forward, instead of 
more conflict, an academic approach to the records.  Some of 
these countries will not even open up their records or files so 
we have to do that.  If there is one message it is that we must 
move on.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois—Salaberry, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak today on behalf of the Bloc Quebecois to the 
motion by the hon. member for Scarborough—Agincourt on 
recognizing the Armenian genocide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion allows the Bloc Quebecois to reiterate the position 
it has stated many times before in this House, which is that it 
should recognize the existence of the Armenian genocide and add 
its voice to those of other parliaments affirming this genocide. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1130"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT7"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT7"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1130

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois in fact, through the voice of its member for 
Ahuntsic at the time, Michel Daviault, initiated a major debate 
on this issue in April 1996, when we devoted an entire 
opposition day to this matter and tried to convince the members 
of the House to accord such recognition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague, the member for Laval East, has since then, in both 
1997 and 1998, drawn attention to this unfortunate anniversary 
of the genocide, which falls on April 24 each year.  So, the 
members of this House and all interested individuals and groups 
will not be surprised that we in the Bloc Quebecois support 
Motion M-329. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support it because it is part of a movement whose aim is not 
to rewrite history or revise it, as some claim or would claim, 
but to commemorate it.  The great moments of history must be 
commemorated, but so must its darkest moments, and the Armenian 
genocide is one of the darkest moments in the history of 
humanity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must not be forgotten, and must not be obliterated from 
people's memory.  This Parliament, like the National Assembly 
and the Ontario legislature, must write a page in history by 
giving recognition to the Armenian genocide.  Parliament must 
take the route traced by other parliaments in the international 
community, the Russian Duma, the Israeli Knesset and more 
recently the French National Assembly and the Belgian senate as 
well as the supranational institution that is the European 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a page of history the successors to the Ottoman Empire 
would like us to forget, which the Turkish ambassador to Ottawa 
presented to me in a different light.  I listened to him.  I 
read the documents and commentaries he provided me with, but I 
also read and reread the testimonies of Armenians about the 
genocide of which they say they were victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spoke to Garine Hovsepian, who was one of my students in the 
past and is now studying law in the United States.  She is of 
Armenian origin and has told me of the sufferings of a people 
which, like so many others, has had to disperse all over the 
world, reinvent itself, create a diaspora.  That dispersion was 
not ended with the creation of an Armenian state in 1918, and 
its rebirth in 1991.  This created a land for the Armenians, a 
place for them, but did not bring back the dead, it did not 
erase the memories of the massacres of children, women and men. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The memory of the massacre in which 2.5 million Armenians met 
horrible deaths between 1915 and 1923 continues to shock the 
conscience of humanity 84 years later.  What continues to shock 
that conscience, as do the more recent atrocities committed in 
Cambodia, Rwanda, Bosnia or Kosovo, is the barbary of that 
massacre.  It was described in one of the most eloquent and 
credible descriptions of the Armenian genocide by the allied 
powers in a statement made on July 17, 1920, which has been kept 
in the French national archives: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Armenians were massacred in conditions of incredible 
barbarity. During the war, the Ottoman government's actions in 
terms of massacres, deportations and mistreatment to prisoners 
went far beyond anything it had ever done in these areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is estimated that, since 1914, the Ottoman government has 
massacred, under the untenable pretence of a presumed revolt, 
800,000 Armenian men, women and children, and deported more than 
200,000 Greeks and 200,000 Armenians. The Turkish government has 
not only failed to protect its subjects of non-Turkish origin 
against looting, violence and murder, but a large body of 
evidence indicates that it also took a hand in organizing and 
carrying out the most ferocious attacks against communities 
which it was its duty to protect.

</I></B></P><P align=left>After hearing the hon. member for Brampton Centre, who often 
speaks on behalf of the Armenian community in the House, refer 
to the Der-zor River, a historic site for Armenians scattered 
around the world, as a place where bones and human remains lie 
under a mere six inches of sand, there is no choice but to 
demand that responsibility be taken a step further, by 
acknowledging this fact as others did, such as Germany following 
the Holocaust, making an act of contrition and taking whatever 
steps are necessary to ensure this is not devoid of any real 
meaning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not for me to elaborate, because I realize the frustration 
of people, who wish this chapter in history had never been 
written, are not proud of what their ancestors did and the fact 
that their government denies these crimes were ever committed, 
and take refuge in silence, something they should not feel duty 
bound to do, no matter how strong their sense of solidarity is. 
However, it is my duty and it is the duty of the Bloc Quebecois 
to make a statement of principle that crimes of genocide and 
crimes against humanity must be recognized. This will heal the 
deep wounds, help the victims of genocide make their peace with 
those they hold in contempt and help those who, generation after 
generation, have been held in contempt to cast off the burden of 
history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an internationalist, I would be remiss if I failed to mention 
that the crime of genocide, as a concept, has long been accepted 
in international law. 
The Turkish government cannot hide behind that fact there was no 
word in the League of Nations terminology between 1919 and 1923 
to describe it—the term was coined in 1944 by a Polish lawyer 
named Raphael Lemkin—to contend that the crime was not 
committed. Did one of the first resolutions passed by the United 
Nations General Assembly on December 11, 1946, not state that 
genocide was a crime under international common law and thus may 
have been committed even before it was decided to give it that 
name? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, this is in no way altered by the 50th anniversary 
of the adoption of the Convention on the Prevention and 
Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, which we celebrated even 
more solemnly than that of the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights on December 9, because it codifies the existence of a 
crime and provides the legal framework by which states agree to 
prevent and punish the crime of genocide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A recorded division on this motion would show every member of 
the Bloc Quebecois in favour. 
They were hoping to be able to vote on a motion that government 
members had not watered down, the way they did in 1996, 
relegating the genocide of the Armenians to the status of a 
tragedy.  They would not be afraid of offending the Turkish 
government, which must face up to history and prepare to enter 
the 21st century by recognizing the first genocide of the 20th 
century. For they know, as do the Turks and many other nations, 
that although the truth hurts, it also frees nations to grow, to 
mature, to be appreciated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nor are they afraid to say to the other countries of the world 
that the existence of nations, on whatever continent, must never 
be threatened, that nations and their cultures enrich humanity's 
common heritage. 
They will not be afraid to say that this is also a question of 
justice and freedom, about which Albert Camus wrote the 
following, “If humanity fails to reconcile justice and freedom, 
it has failed at everything that matters”.

Speaker, I am pleased and honoured to rise to strongly support 
the motion which has been placed before the House today by my 
colleague from Scarborough—Agincourt, not only speaking on my 
own behalf but on behalf of my colleagues in the New Democratic 
caucus. 
In doing so I want to pay tribute to the ongoing leadership of 
the Armenian National Committee of Canada which has kept this 
issue alive through a number of parliaments.  Today we are joined 
by a number of of representatives of the Armenian National 
Committee and I want to salute them:  Giro Manoyan, Rouben 
Kouyngian, Sylvia Baronian and Aris Babikian. It is important to 
acknowledge these individuals for the leadership they have shown 
on this issue, along of course with others such as the president, 
Girair Basmadjian.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened to the debate with interest.  I appreciated the 
eloquent remarks of the mover of the motion.  The official 
spokesperson for the government, the Parliamentary Secretary to 
the Minister of Foreign Affairs, was very clear.  The Liberal 
government does not support this motion.  That was quite obvious. 
He was quite up front about that which is no surprise given the 
position the government took in 1996 on another motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to confess some bewilderment in listening to the 
spokesperson on behalf of the Reform Party.  He talked about 
Bosnia.  He talked about Rwanda.  He talked about the United 
Nations.  He talked about international law.  But the one thing 
he did not talk about was the motion.  Did he support the motion 
or did he oppose the motion?  No one in this House and no one in 
the country knows what the position of the Reform Party is after 
that speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that perhaps another spokesperson, maybe the member for 
West Vancouver, might have an opportunity to clarify exactly 
where the Reform Party of Canada stands on this motion, because 
certainly we did not find out from its official spokesperson. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was very pleased to hear the Bloc Quebecois member for 
Beauharnois—Salaberry supporting the motion.  I recall clearly 
the very eloquent speech given by Michel Daviault on the subject 
in April 1996, during the last debate. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear where most of the parties stand on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has been an issue that my colleagues and I have been 
involved in for some time.  I have a motion before the House that 
states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should 
officially recognize and condemn the Armenian genocide of 
1915-1923 perpetrated by the Turkish-Ottoman government, which 
resulted in the murder of over one and one-half Armenians; 
designate April 24 as the day of annual commemoration of the 
Armenian genocide; and press the Government of Turkey to 
recognize and acknowledge the genocide and provide redress to the 
Armenian people. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That motion is before the House and it is also before the 
foreign affairs committee where it will be coming to a vote in 
the not too distant future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the privilege of travelling to Armenia shortly after the 
devastating earthquake some years ago.  I had the opportunity to 
meet with leaders of Armenia and to hear of the terrible and 
tragic legacy of suffering of those people. The greatest tragedy, 
the greatest suffering and yes, the genocide, was in 1915 to 
1923, the first genocide of this dark century, the 20th century, 
a century in which we also witnessed genocide in other parts of 
the world, the Nazi Holocaust of World War II, the genocide in 
East Timor, in Rwanda, in Cambodia and elsewhere. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Beauharnois—Salaberry quoted French archival 
material from 1920, which describes exactly what happened in 
this genocide. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While this was a tragedy, it was far beyond that. It was 
genocide and it was shameful that in this House in April 1996 
when we had an opportunity to tell the truth, to be honest, to 
speak about what actually happened, instead some Liberal members, 
speaking on behalf of the government, watered down that motion.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to ask why they are taking this position.  Could it have 
something to do with economic relations or trade relations with 
Turkey?  It might just have something to do with the fact that we 
are trying to sell Candu reactors to Turkey. My goodness, we do 
not want to offend the Turkish government if it might interfere 
with the sale of Candu reactors.  Good heavens no.  We do not 
want to offend the Turkish government if it might interfere with 
our sale of military equipment to that country.  Of course that 
has nothing to do with the position the government members are 
taking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to speak for a moment about the Turkish government. The 
Turkish government has for too long displayed contempt for 
international law not just in this area but in too many others. 
Its contempt has been displayed in its reluctance to apply the 
principles of international law in its ongoing disputes with 
Greece; the continued illegal occupation by Turkey of part of 
Cypress; the profound violation of human rights of the Kurdish 
people in Turkey; the lack of respect for human rights, 
individual collective freedoms, attacks on journalists and 
others, attacks on freedom of religion; the continued 
imprisonment of elected members of parliament like Leyla Zana and 
others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time our Liberal government showed some courage and 
honesty and spoke out on the genocide, condemned the genocide and 
recognized the truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following the Holocaust of World War II, nations of the world 
adopted a convention on genocide.  Canada was one of the 
signatories to that convention.  Why today are we not prepared to 
acknowledge the truth of what happened?  It is a very 
straightforward matter.  We owe it to the victims of that 
genocide and to their families.  We owe it to all Canadians to 
ensure that this genocide that killed 1.5 million Armenians is 
never repeated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today what we are asking for is the truth.  That is all.  This 
parliament has an opportunity today to allow the truth to be told 
and honesty to be our policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I once again appeal to all members of this House but 
most importantly to the Liberal government to end their silence 
and their revisionist history.  Listening to the history lesson 
from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Foreign 
Affairs was an astonishing experience because it flies in the 
face of reality in that region and denies the truth of the 
genocide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of my colleagues in the New Democratic Party, it is an 
honour to join not just with Armenian Canadians but to join with 
parliaments such as the Belgium Senate, the French National 
Assembly, the European Parliament, the Israeli Knesset, the 
Russian Duma and many others that have taken this step.  If they 
can take this step and acknowledge the truth, why can we not do 
the same in Canada?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Price (Compton—Stanstead, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to thank the member for Scarborough—Agincourt for 
bringing this important matter to the House of Commons.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Prior to the wars of the French Revolution in 1792, war was very 
much a matter of battle between opposing armies.  Few civilians 
were ever killed.  There were episodes in every war where cities 
were sacked and women assaulted after decisive battles outside of 
city gates, but few civilians were killed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The wars of the French Revolution changed all that. The past 
pattern of warfare between small professional standing armies 
came to an end when the French instituted the conscription of 
troops in 1793 to fight the Austrians and their allies.  The days 
of the small professional armies manoeuvring across country and 
only giving battle to punish a strategically placed inferior 
opponent were over with.  Henceforth armies were large, unwieldy 
mobs of civilians in uniform trying to kill each other and battle 
was given quite freely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The advent of the industrial revolution just made warfare far 
more deadly and machine dependent.  Due to the combination of 
conscription and the industrial revolution, the foundation of a 
nation's military strength changed.  By the 1850s the true 
foundation of a nation's military strength had begun to rest on 
the size of its civilian population and its industrial 
infrastructure.  Modern warfare was born. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It took almost the next 100 years to perfect it to a point where 
in World War II one could argue that civilians and industrial 
infrastructure had become the real targets.  That is the real 
evil of modern war.  In World War I, 20 million people were 
killed, the majority being soldiers, but in World War II, 50 
million people were killed, the majority now being civilians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many Canadians know the horrors of the Holocaust and the evils 
of Nazism, but few Canadians know of the misfortune of the 
Armenians butchered because they were stuck between the Ottoman 
empire and the Russians.  The decaying Ottoman empire found them 
to be a threat.  The Armenians were an industrious, energetic 
Christian community awash in an Ottoman Turkish sea. Out of a 
population of two million Armenians, one and one-half million 
were killed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The massacre of civilian populations has always been the ugliest 
aspect of modern war.  The Armenians suffered from what today 
would be termed ethnic cleansing.  The survivors escaped into 
Russia or faced forced resettlement. Indeed the Geneva protocols 
were brought forward by like-minded nations to protect civilian 
populations like the Armenians from the ravages of war. Later the 
League of Nations attempted to protect civilian populations 
between the wars.  After the second world war, the United Nations 
took on the challenging job of trying to prevent war and protect 
civilians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The terrible truth is that even though we see ourselves as more 
civilized than our forefathers on this planet, we are not.  Every 
day we hear of the terrible human cost of modern war: Rwanda, 
Burundi, Bosnia, Croatia, and now Kosovo; where ethnic groups are 
the targets of the most reprehensible acts known to mankind, 
places where Canada has always dispatched peacekeepers and 
peacemakers to end these brutal practices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada sent troops to Rwanda under the command of the United 
Nations and led by a Canadian, a brave Canadian, Lieutenant 
General Romeo Dallaire. They were forced to witness one of the 
worst episodes in man's inhumanity to man. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians were also in the former Yugoslavia, in Bosnia and 
Croatia and again witnessed unspeakable atrocities, atrocities 
similar to what one and a half million Armenians suffered.  In 
Sarajevo a group of Canadians led by General Lewis MacKenzie 
distinguished themselves at an airport trying to help the 
unfortunate in Bosnia.  Again outside a small village in Croatia, 
in an area known as the Medak Pocket, Canadians attempted to put 
a stop to ethnic cleansing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately for Canada's badly neglected military, they will 
likely find themselves soon in Kosovo trying again to protect 
civilians from harm.  Canada has always stood up for those who 
need our assistance and who could not protect themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that wars, horrible wars, both state on state and state 
on sub-state or ethnic group continue on this planet is the key 
reason that the Government of Canada must commit some of its 
coming budget surpluses to its neglected, cut to the bone 
military. 
Indeed, the government must re-equip our forces so that Canada 
will be able to play a more important role on the world stage in 
trying to stop the horrors of war and ethnic violence.

this House and to all Canadians.  Armenian Canadians have 
contributed greatly to the fabric of Canadian society and culture 
and we are all richer for that. It is only fitting that we

that we take steps to prevent this past tragedy and other 
inhumanities from ever taking place again.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I was shocked, really shocked, to hear the parliamentary

have here an article from the <I>Globe</I> dated January 28, 1916. 
It speaks of atrocities.  I do not know who wrote the speech for

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  The hon. member will

he probably does not believe what he said.  I know what he said 
was probably something that was put in front of him this morning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today's Turkish government is 75 years old, having celebrated 
its 75th birthday.  It started in 1922.  My colleague kept 
referring to Turkey Ottoman, Ottoman Turkey. Obviously we can see 
clearly that the member does not have his facts straight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The atrocities of that particular time happened by the Ottoman 
empire.  The Ottoman empire was collapsing. Everybody in that 
part of the world was committing atrocities. The Armenian 
genocide did happen. The 350 Greeks of the Black Sea were killed. 
People were moved. An exchange of population happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder, would the hon. member also refute the fact that my 
ancestors had to flee Anatolia, that my grandfather had to go on 
a ship and had one arm cut off?  If the member refutes that, I 
will certainly point out to him the December 1922 issue of 
<I>National Geographic</I>.  His picture is there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not muzzle history.  Let us not cover up history. 
Atrocities happen.  The Armenian genocide happened. Is my hon.

Warsaw did not happen?  Is my hon. colleague going to say the 
Jews just stood there and took it and they did not defend 
themselves?  The Armenians defended themselves.

<P><A NAME="LINK17"></A></P>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>SECOND READING 
</H4><P align=left>

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from February 8 consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-65, an act to amend the Federal-Provincial Fiscal 
Arrangements Act, be read the second time and referred to a 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  When this bill was last under 
consideration in the House, the hon. member for Mississauga South 
had the floor.  He has six minutes remaining for his remarks. 
<P><A NAME="LINK18"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, in 
my previous comments I outlined a number of points with regard to 
the overall equalization program.  I thought it might be helpful 
to the House simply to review some of those basic facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, the equalization program is one of the 
cornerstones of our country and has played a major role in 
defining the Canadian federation. 
Equalization ensures that all provinces have the resources they 
need to provide reasonably comparable services to Canadians no 
matter where they live without having to resort to higher levels 
of taxation in other provinces. That point particularly should be 
noted for Canadians with regard to the mobility rights that 
Canadians all enjoy as citizens of this country.

<A HREF="#LINKT14"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Equalization is also an unconditional federal payment and the 
provinces can use it as they wish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are seven provinces that receive equalization payments, 
Newfoundland, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, 
Quebec, Manitoba and Saskatchewan. The proposed legislation 
before the House would renew the equalization program for a five 
year period, from April 1, 1999 to March 31, 2004, and the basic 
structure of the equalization program would remain the same 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I repeat, the purpose of this bill is to renew the equalization 
program, and the fundamental program as we know it today would 
remain the same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill does include some changes to the program to ensure that 
it continues to measure the ability of provinces to raise 
revenues as accurately as possible.  These improvements will 
increase the cost of the equalization program by an estimated 
$242 million.  The changes will be phased in over the course of a 
five year renewal period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also includes changes to the ceiling and floor 
provisions of the equalization program which protect against 
unusually large fluctuations in equalization transfers. The 
proposed amendments are the results of two years of extensive 
consultations and review of the equalization program by the 
federal and provincial governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think members will remember from the debate that was held in 
the House when we last dealt with this bill that there was much 
concern about the disincentive for provinces that receive 
equalization to pursue economic growth and job creation because 
it would reduce the equalization payments they were otherwise 
entitled to.  I think many hon. members would like to speak to 
the issue with regard to disincentive of equalization payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the time of the 1998 budget it was projected that the 
equalization in 1998-99 would amount to $8.5 billion.  The last 
official estimates released in October show an increase to $8.8 
billion.  The new estimates of equalization will be provided in 
the 1999 budget tomorrow evening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would also renew the provincial personal income tax 
revenue guarantee program for the same five year period. This 
program protects those provinces participating in the tax 
collection agreements from any major revenue reductions that may 
be caused during the course of a year by changed in federal tax 
policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By way of summary, these are some of the principal elements in 
Bill C-65.  In my view one of the important elements raised in 
debate was whether there was a disincentive to provinces that 
received equalization.  I thought there was also some interesting 
commentary with regard to the distribution of equalization to 
certain provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that debate with regard to the significant amount of moneys 
transferred to Quebec, there was an awful lot of suspicion raised 
that somehow this was improper or incorrect.  When I gave my 
initial speech on this subject, I laid out substantive reasons to 
point out to the opposition that it is not enough simply to 
identify the numbers of differences between how much one 
provinces gets compared to another.  The important question is to 
ask why do those numbers differ and is it fair and equitable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After two years of consultation between the provinces, the 
territories and the federal government those people have 
determined that indeed the equalization program as it exists and 
as it is proposed to be extended is fair and equitable. 
<P><A NAME="LINK19"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
very pleased today to have the opportunity to say a couple of 
words on this bill.  It is a bill that is evidently very 
important to at least seven provinces, the seven provinces that 
receive equalization payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was taken aback a moment ago by the member for Mississauga 
South who mentioned that this bill is a major cornerstone of 
Confederation.

<A HREF="#LINKT15"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He can make that statement but five minutes ago his government 
invoked one of the most hideous procedures available to 
government today, closure, on one of the major cornerstones of 
Confederation.  The hon. member's words are not consistent with 
what the government did a moment ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very important bill to the provinces that receive 
equalization payments.  It is very important to Atlantic 
Canadians.  It is very important to Newfoundland.  It is very 
important to Nova Scotia.  It is very important to New Brunswick. 
It is very important not only to Atlantic Canadians but to 
western Canadians. It is very important to Manitoba.  It is very 
important to Saskatchewan.  It is very important to Quebec.  It 
is very important to Prince Edward Island.  But today the 
government, in spite of the importance we attach to Bill C-65, 
has decided to cut off debate.  It has decided to invoke closure. 
It has decided to stifle, to muzzle the opposition from making 
the comments it wants to make on this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is very important to all members of the PC caucus.  It 
is very important to Manitoba, to Saskatchewan, to Newfoundland, 
to Nova Scotia and to Quebec.  But these provinces are highly 
dependent on equalization payments to better their economic 
situation.  It is even more important to have this bill fully 
debated by all members to make the federal government fully aware 
of the impact that equalization payments have on at least seven 
provinces in Canada.  Obviously we will not have that opportunity 
to make the federal government aware of the impact these payments 
have on Atlantic Canadians in particular because it has brought 
in closure today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was told that before this bill came to the House of Commons 
the province of Newfoundland requested some significant changes 
to the way the formula treats offshore resources, offshore oil 
and gas.  The government has rejected the request of the province 
of Newfoundland and Labrador.  Instead it is only going to make 
some very minor housekeeping changes to this bill, completely 
ignoring the request of Premier Tobin and the province of 
Newfoundland that Canada's poorest province should not be 
penalized because of the current equalization formula before it 
is given a chance to catch up and become equal to the rest of 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There cannot be any chance for catch-up for Atlantic Canadians 
or for that matter western Canadians in provinces like Manitoba 
and Saskatchewan who receive equalization payments. There cannot 
be any opportunity given to these provinces to catch up.  There 
cannot be a chance of equality of provinces unless there is some 
recognition given to the fact that the very pool of money that 
keeps a particular province from falling into economic despair 
and economic disaster is the same pool of money that will keep 
that province permanently poor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the unfairness and injustice associated with the way 
this formula is written.  There will never be an opportunity for 
the provinces that receive these equalization payments to be 
brought up the same quality of life and the same standard of 
living that other Canadians enjoy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not saying we should put in place a new formula for ever 
and a day. 
What I am saying is that there should be an arrangement worked 
out for the have not provinces which will see resource revenues 
clawed back on a more gradual basis.

<A HREF="#LINKT16"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, a Voisey's Bay development in Newfoundland could 
have its resource revenues clawed back not dollar for dollar but 
on a 50% basis.  The Sable Island gas find could be clawed back 
on a 50% basis.  In that way there is an opportunity to bring 
some fairness to the equalization formula and to bring the 
unemployment rate and the quality of life for the receiving 
provinces to some kind of acceptable standard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not expect the government will make any changes in the 
equalization formula today.  Obviously it will not.  It has 
invoked closure on one of the most important bills ever to come 
before parliament in quite some time.  I am not expecting the 
government to make any kind of substantive changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few months ago I had a private member's bill on Newfoundland's 
unemployment problem selected and debated before the House.  In 
my final remarks I made the point that if we had a fairer 
equalization formula applied to Newfoundland as it relates to our 
resource based revenues, not only would the province of 
Newfoundland be a lot better off but the federal government would 
be a lot better off as well.  Eventually the province would 
become less dependent upon federal resources to keep it going. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the long run there is every reason for the federal government 
to want these provinces that receive equalization payments to be 
brought up to an acceptable standard so that the federal 
government will not have to inject funds into the poorer 
receiving provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we are all very much aware the Canadian equalization program 
redistributes throughout the nation.  Last year the province of 
Newfoundland received roughly $996 million in equalization 
payments.  That is quite a great deal of money.  In this fiscal 
year we are expected to receive roughly $925 million.  There will 
be a reduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That number can be greatly affected by the overall wealth of the 
nation, the overall wealth of the economy. If the economy is good 
in any one particular year, the provinces receiving equalization 
payments will obviously see their payments go up.  If the economy 
of the nation declines in any given year the provinces will 
expect to receive less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing that determines how much equalization a province will 
get is the population of the receiving province. The population 
of Newfoundland has gone down significantly over the last number 
of years.  I believe over the last six or seven years in 
particular the province's population has gone down by 7,000 or 
10,000 people per year. That is quite a decrease in population 
for a small province like Newfoundland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Ontario, for instance, were to have a decline of 10,000 
people per year it would not matter a great deal. When a province 
like Newfoundland with a population of half a million people 
loses 10,000 people per year it is very serious.  Because of that 
our equalization payments go down as well. 
Over the last six or seven years Newfoundland has lost in the 
neighbourhood of 70,000 people.  As a result its equalization 
payments have gone down dramatically.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the out-migration factor is very important to a province 
like Newfoundland, the main variable I would be concerned about 
is the fact that with any new influx of resource revenues, 
revenues are deducted dollar for dollar over time from the 
equalization payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To make it a bit clearer, if a province has taken in a billion 
dollars in additional resource revenues in the 1997-98 fiscal 
year, it would have only $4 million in equalization payments 
because $996 million of the revenues would have gone to replace 
equalization payments over time.  It may not happen in any one 
given year but over time the entire amount would be clawed back 
by the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are not many incentives for a province to want to develop 
major resource developments.  There is not much of an opportunity 
for a province that receives equalization payments to boost its 
standard of living comparable to a province that does not receive 
equalization.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I served for about 14 years as a member of the Newfoundland 
House of Assembly.  In that period of time I served during the 
administration of the PCs and of the Liberals.  I remember both 
those governments making the case year after year after year to 
the federal government for a change in the way the equalization 
formula was written so that the province could have an 
opportunity to catch up to other provinces in Canada.  I believe 
that was brought into focus by the massive Hibernia oil 
development on the Grand Banks of Newfoundland.  When the 
particular resource was discovered back in 1979 Newfoundland held 
a promise of jobs and revenues for its beleaguered provincial 
economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the early eighties oil prices were high and the prospect of 
annual oil revenues were not out of the realm of reaching 
billions of dollars.  Given that fact, overcoming the 
equalization hump was at least a possibility for the province of 
Newfoundland and Labrador.  It would lose probably the first 
billion but we would keep subsequent billions and millions of 
dollars as the case may be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It proved impossible for the government of the day to negotiate 
an offshore oil deal with the Trudeau administration when oil 
prices were very high.  An agreement had to be held up until the 
PC government came in power under Brian Mulroney and there was a 
decent offshore contract negotiated with his government.  By that 
time oil prices had fallen dramatically.  There was not any 
possibility of a multibillion dollar oil revenue, so we could see 
all oil revenues simply going to replace equalization payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At about that time the government of the day negotiated with the 
federal government a change in equalization entitlements as they 
applied to the Hibernia resource development. 
Instead of having the dollar for dollar clawback it was 
negotiated that the federal government would only take 70 cents. 
Some recognition was given to the fact that oil prices were low 
at the time and Newfoundland would not be receiving all that much 
revenue from resource development in that project.  That could be 
easily done again for other developments in Atlantic Canada like 
Sable Island, Voisey's Bay and other developments in general.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We are quite pleased to have an equalization program that keeps 
us from economic disaster, but we are not at all pleased it is 
the formula that keeps the receiving province from getting ahead. 
How can we ever catch up if every new dollar we earn is 
subtracted from our equalization payments?  We have to catch up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For as long as I have been in public life in Newfoundland the 
unemployment rate has been double the national rate.  During that 
same time the federal government has cut transfers to the 
provinces by 35%.  Not only do we have to use our equalization 
payments to help the province get ahead.  We also have to use 
them to make up for the fact that the federal government has cut 
transfers to the provinces by 35%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When that was done, in Newfoundland's case thousands of 
provincial public servants were laid off.  The public services 
are now under a great deal of strain especially in rural 
Newfoundland.  The federal government has cut the federal public 
service in the province by a full 30% as compared with 15% 
nationally.  It is hard to believe but the province with double 
the national unemployment rate was saddled with double the rate 
of federal job cuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because the public service in general plays a larger than usual 
role in Newfoundland's economy, the cumulative effect of these 
cuts has been very devastating upon the province and probably 
more devastating on Newfoundland than it has been on other 
provinces in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need a new deal.  Atlantic Canada generally needs a new deal 
in Confederation.  If we are to move out of park and into high 
gear, the federal government needs to recognize we are a have not 
province which needs a greater say over the resource revenues 
that come into our province.  We need revenues that would more 
than merely replace equalization.  We need revenues to augment 
our economic situation, to catch up and to make progress. That 
will never happen unless the federal government is willing to 
recognize the plight of Atlantic Canadians generally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To sum up, we need economic development and jobs.  We need to 
maximize the impact of any resource development on our economy 
and the provincial treasury.  The federal government has not 
helped today by invoking closure on the bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, near as I can gather from the member's remarks, he is 
saying the equalization payments which are designed to bring all 
the provinces up to the same sort of minimum national standards 
and opportunities should continue to be paid even when a province 
on its own back can raise the money through its own resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, what he is saying is that if a worker is on 
employment insurance, for example, he should be entitled to get a 
job as well with which he doubles his income, one from the 
government and one from the job.  Or that a person on welfare 
should be able to get the social assistance and also get the 
money from a job or any other resources.  What he is saying if I 
gather correctly is that rather than the people of Newfoundland 
wanting to earn their own way from their own resources, they 
should continue to tap the governments, the federal resources, 
federal social assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I submit this is indeed the type of agenda, the type of pattern 
that we saw in the Conservatives of the past.  I do not believe 
it speaks actually to the other parties in Newfoundland, the 
Liberals perhaps or the NDP.  I think it is a Conservative 
philosophy where not only do we get as much money as we can from 
our own resources but we get as much money as we can from the 
central government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I submit that is not what produces independence, that is not 
what produces dignity among people.  I suggest the Conservatives 
should understand that people now have to get off the gravy train 
unless they need help.  If they need help, yes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member suggested that closure has somehow been something 
that is interfering with the ability of Newfoundlanders and other 
people in the have-not provinces getting these equalization 
payments.  Rhetoric is not what these people need right now. 
What they need is this legislation to go through as fast as 
possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Norman Doyle:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for his rhetoric.  That is all it was, rhetoric.  As I suspected, 
he was not listening to a thing I had to say on this very 
important bill.  He was talking to his colleague all the while I 
was speaking and he never gave me a moment of thought nor 
listened to a word I said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not saying we should put in place a new equalization 
formula for ever and a day.  What I am saying is that we need to 
work out some kind of an arrangement for have-not provinces that 
will see the resource revenues they generate clawed back on a 
more gradual basis than dollar for dollar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said a moment ago, Newfoundland receives about $1 billion 
in equalization payments.  If the Hibernia development for 
instance were to bring in $900 million in the run of a year, we 
would be only $100 million better off.  Is this not what we need, 
an opportunity to catch up to the other provinces in Canada?  Put 
in place a formula that will see a more gradual claw back, a 15% 
claw back for Voisey's Bay, a 50% claw back for Sable Island gas 
development that will see the province given an opportunity to 
become equal with the other provinces. It will see that province 
given an opportunity to improve its quality of life and to raise 
its employment opportunities and then let that province make the 
contribution that it should be making to the country. That is all 
we ask, a new arrangement that would see claw backs made on a 
more gradual basis. 
<P><A NAME="LINK21"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the member has raised an issue which has been raised by the 
Premier of Newfoundland with regard to resource revenues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ask the member whether he has actually considered 
whether the impact of the resources revenue and the additional 
taxation from those additional resource revenues is only a dollar 
for dollar reduction of the equalization payment. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1320"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT21"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT21"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1320

<A HREF="#LINKT20"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if he has considered the new economic development and 
that those additional jobs created from that have very 
substantial benefits over and above simply the direct taxation 
revenues, the fact that there are substantial benefits for 
employing people and getting them off welfare, off social 
assistance and off other program grants like the TAGS program or 
the ACOA program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There seems to be much more at stake here than simply dollar for 
dollar on equalization.  The point is that Newfoundland is poised 
to take a more substantive role in the economy of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Norman Doyle:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we are well aware of the 
fact that we are poised to take a more substantive role in the 
economy of our country. Again I have to remind the hon. member 
that what we are talking about here is a province moving ahead 
and a province being given the opportunity to become equal to 
other provinces in Canada.  Simply put, what we need is economic 
development and jobs.  We need to maximize the impact of our 
resources and resource development.  We cannot do that with the 
current equalization formula the federal government has in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have lost so much wealth in our economy due to federal 
government cuts in programs and the fact that the federal 
government has cut our health care system to such a great extent 
over the last five year period, a 35% cut in transfers to the 
provinces. We have use our equalization payments to make up for 
the cuts the federal government has inflicted on us in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I have been talking about here is an opportunity for not 
only Newfoundlanders but for Atlantic Canadians generally and 
provinces that receive equalization payments to have some sort of 
renegotiation of that formula to reflect the fact that they are 
have not provinces and that they should be given the opportunity 
to become equal, to catch up and to raise the standard of living 
in their province and increase the employment rate as well. 
<P><A NAME="LINK22"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
wonder if the hon. member would clarify briefly why Newfoundland 
should have a separate side agreement in terms of equalization 
and revenues that would handle the natural resource revenues 
differently in Newfoundland than it would say for the province of 
Alberta.  Why should Newfoundland, for example, have only 70% of 
its revenues counted for equalization purposes when in Alberta it 
is 100%? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could he explain exactly how that would work and whether he 
would be in support of having the same kind of treatment across 
Canada and have it done through equalization rather than to have 
some separate side agreements that really change the whole 
equalization formula? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Norman Doyle:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am not talking about 
Newfoundland alone here.  I am not talking about a separate side 
agreement for Newfoundland.  I am talking about a separate 
agreement that would apply to seven provinces, not including 
Alberta, Ontario and B.C.  Alberta, Ontario and B.C., by virtue 
of their geographic locations, in some respects have been able to 
move ahead because of their prosperous economies. We thank these 
provinces for being able to share their wealth with the rest of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we simply want to do is make our contribution to the rest 
of Canada as well.  I believe in order to do that we need the 
federal government to look closely at this bill, to think about 
the have not provinces and to come up with some kind of formula 
that will enable less clawback on their resources until they 
reach a point comparable to Ontario, Alberta and British 
Columbia. 
<P><A NAME="LINK23"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
thank you for this opportunity to rise on this debate and to 
discuss the equalization transfers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prior to the previous speaker, I was wondering who was the 
biggest whiner in Confederation, Mr. Bouchard or Mr. Harris. 
Having listened to the previous member I am inclined to think 
that the Progressive Conservative Party is the biggest whiner in 
Confederation.  I cannot quite fathom how we should take $1 
billion worth of transfer moneys given to the Government of 
Newfoundland and then heaven forbid they should actually raise 
their own funds, not call on the federal transfer and still 
complain.  That strikes me as a perverse effect of equalization 
and one which I hope this bill in some measure addresses. We are 
all moving I hope toward self-sufficiency.

<A HREF="#LINKT21"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I do want to go back to the two people I consider to be 
the biggest whiners in Confederation, Mr. Bouchard and Mr. 
Harris.  Each receives about $10 billion from the federal 
treasury.  Both complain bitterly about running the independent 
little fiefdoms and both say they do not have enough money to 
live on.  It reminds me of certain people who will remain 
unmentioned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One hesitates to interject fact into the rhetoric that has been 
going on on the opposite side of the House, but the federal 
government raises about $150 billion to $160 billion a year. To 
most ears that sounds like a lot of money.  But the first call on 
the money is by the provinces. The provinces suck up about $25 
billion to $26 billion right out of the pot immediately.  Then we 
add on to that number a further $9 billion approximately that 
goes into equalization.  Before the federal government even 
starts to enter into any debt repayment, any programs or anything 
of that nature, 23% of its revenues are already transferred to 
the provinces to frankly spend as they see fit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I may be permitted a speculation, I am assuming that a bit 
more money in the next budget will be available for the provinces 
to spend as they see fit.  I dare say there will be no 
correlation between whining and transfers of money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These moneys are gone.  They are virtually without strings.  In 
some provinces they account for upwards of 40% of their gross 
revenues.  In my province it is around 20%, in some provinces as 
little as 15%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ontario has about 40% of the population.  I has about 45% to 50% 
of the gross domestic product.  Ontario raises the revenue it 
gives in the form of tax revenues to the federal government which 
in turn redistributes it through the CHST and equalization.  If 
one were totally parochial about this matter one would complain. 
But this is in fact the essence of being Canadian.  This has been 
true since Confederation and I dare say will continue to be true 
for the foreseeable future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is called equalization which is in our country really a 
form of redistribution of wealth.  I will address the House's 
attention to the actual money transferred.  It totals something 
in the order of $8.750 billion, of which quite clearly Quebec 
receives the lion's share, $3.9 billion, just under $4 billion. 
The next largest recipient is Nova Scotia and, as the previous 
member alluded to, Newfoundland receives about $947 million, just 
under $1 billion.  That is a great deal of money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The formula by which transfers are made have become quite 
complex.  I address the House's attention to the bill summary 
which purports to phase in the tax changes over the period from 
April 1, 1999 through to March 31, 2004. This is the reason for 
bringing some closure to this debate. 
These arrangements have to be made by the end of this fiscal year 
so that transfers between provinces are calculated on a formula 
which gives certainty to budgeting processes.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also a provision that adjusts the definitions of 
revenue source and revenue to be equalized.  There has been some 
discussions in the House about gambling and how to treat gambling 
revenues as revenues being raised.  Not all provinces are able to 
raise those kinds of revenues.  There is also a change to the 
minimum and maximum provisions. Those are the three essential 
points of the bill, namely a change to the minimum and maximum 
payment provisions; a redefinition of revenue source and revenue 
to be equalized; and the phasing in from April 1, 1999 through to 
March 31, 2004. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In renewing the federal government commitments we are starting 
to look more carefully at the revenue raising ability of each 
province.  Not all provinces are created equal.  The bottom line 
is that at the end of the day the provinces that receive 
equalization will receive about $242 million additional over a 
period of five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fortunately for both sides of the equation the provinces can now 
expect that their floor revenues will not be altered.  Similarly, 
the federal government can reasonably expect that the 
equalization transfers will not go above $10 billion.  This 
brings some fiscal certainty to the entire process which 
necessarily needs to be done so that all finance ministers in the 
country can plan appropriately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. Leader of the Opposition heaped abuse and scorn on the 
equalization process and said that it was essentially just so 
much politics.  I remind the hon. member that this House talks 
about values.  This talks about the values we are as Canadians. 
If there is a significant value after universal medical health 
insurance, it is equalization.  Equalization is the transfer of 
moneys among provinces so that all Canadians are treated 
equitably.  Arguably it is a hallmark of a civilized society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to quote the Minister of Finance on the very point 
of equalization: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Equalization is a cornerstone of our country—a program that we 
can all be proud of.  It ensures that all provinces have the 
resources they need to provide reasonably comparable services to 
Canadians no matter where they live.  This legislation will 
ensure that the equalization program remain up to date and 
continues to provide dependable federal support to the qualifying 
provinces. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a hallmark of our Canadian civilization. We as Canadians 
redistribute wealth so that all Canadians have a reasonable 
access to government services throughout the country. No person 
in Canada should be limited by his or her ability to access basic 
services simply because of geography.  Geography should not be in 
question.  It is a statement of a civilization and indeed of a 
civilized society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec the total government transfers are $1,414 per person. 
In Ontario similar transfers are $824 per person.  The average 
for all of the provinces is $1,150 per person.  What disturbs me 
is in that process we do not seem to have a similar recognition 
of the role of the federal government in the lives of its 
citizenry.  We transfer to Quebec something in the order of $932 
per person on CHST and $536 per person on equalization for a 
total of $1,414 per person. Ontario receives only $824 per person 
on the CHST. 
Newfoundland, which is the province of origin of the previous 
speaker, receives a total of $2,495 per person, almost $2,500 as 
a point of equalization.

<A HREF="#LINKT23"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know where the cutoff number is.  Maybe we should 
ratchet it up to $3,000, maybe even to $4,000.  Or why not just 
simply collect all the money, put it in one pot and divide by $30 
million.  There are points at which this is a rough form of 
justice but I would submit that it is a form on which all 
Canadians can count and all Canadians can expect that these 
numbers will be there for them over the course of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The average CHST per person is $853.  The average of all the 
transfers is $1,150.  Quebec does quite a bit better than the 
average on both numbers, namely the CHST number and the 
equalization number. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Messrs. Harris and Bouchard had their way, as they pocketed 
their cheques—which I would submit are rather substantial 
cheques—they would simply say thank you very much—and I am not 
sure we would get that—apply for a seat at the UN and say it is 
all over, we are now 10 independent little countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I respectfully submit there is no sense of nationhood or nation 
building out of these moneys.  We have 10 little emperors. Each 
has his hands on ridiculous amounts of money.  They erect trade 
barriers which interfere with each Canadian's ability to move 
from province to province and to practise his or her trade. Then 
they wonder why Canadian productivity lags. I would submit that 
one of the most significant reasons Canadian productivity lags is 
the interprovincial trade barriers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My son is planning on attending university next year. If my son 
applies to go to Queen's University, which is a university both 
you and I share, Mr. Speaker, he will pay a tuition rate which is 
a rate substantially less than he would pay to go to McGill.  At 
McGill he would pay something in terms of double or triple the 
amount of tuition that he would otherwise pay at Queen's. 
Comparable universities; comparable education; comparable job 
prospects at the end of a degree.  Yet the real cost for him, 
merely because he lives in Toronto, will be in excess of two to 
three times, residency costs aside.  This is all because he 
happens to live in Ontario as opposed to Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is unacceptable.  This is an interprovincial trade barrier 
which needs to be addressed and has to be addressed.  These are 
the kinds of things that kill our productivity and send us toward 
this model of 10 little fiefdoms with one tax collecting 
authority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I had any impact on the finance ministers of Canada, and that 
is somewhat dubious, I might ask some rather fundamental 
questions.  How do these equalization transfers help build 
Canada? How is Canada better off at the end of the day once these 
transfers are done?  How will Canadians know that their money is 
well spent?  Strange question.  How about a little 
accountability? Where is the transparency?  Why are kids who go 
to university in one province having to pay two or three times 
more than other people in the same dorm?  Is this on the social 
union talks agenda and if so, where is it going?  Are we asking 
these rather fundamental questions as to what we are as a nation 
and how we back that up with money? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At one level this bill is about money pure and simple: $8.5 
billion, write the cheques.  End of story.  At another level, 
this is about something far more profound.  It is about our 
values and who we are as Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I like the value of equalization.  It does however disturb me 
greatly that once we send the money off to the provincial 
treasuries, it seems to end up in this little fiefdom concept. 
The next stage presumably is the issuance of a passport.

have not provinces slide off the table.  I do not think that is 
what he is talking about.  On the other hand I am not prepared to 
let the have not provinces continue on forever and a day not 
trying to husband their own resources so that they can be kept 
outside of this equalization formula.  As I said, God forbid that 
the money should actually return to the treasury of the federal

what we just heard to be a most enlightening discourse.  It was 
absolutely amazing.  What this man has been able to put together 
as a Liberal backbencher absolutely astounds me.  He is asking 
the ministers of finance to be transparent and accountable.  He 
is asking the provinces to be accountable.  He is asking for 
things to happen.  He is asking the finance minister to explain 
to Canadians how the equalization program actually develops the 
economy of Canada.

him for his ability to understand and to expound so clearly and 
so carefully what it is he heard here last week. It is 
tremendous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He did qualify it a little and said “Well I do not really agree

commend the gentleman for saying that we need to examine our 
values, that we need to consider accountability and that we need 
to make this formula transparent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that he tell this House exactly how he would make this 
formula simpler and a little more transparent, and how he would 
introduce accountability into it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am touched to the core by 
the hon. member's acute observations on the parsement of the 
speech.  I asked some fairly simple and fundamental questions 
which for the Reform Party is somewhat more of a challenge than 
it can usually meet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of transparency is something of extreme urgency in my 
province.  The argument that has been going on in our caucus is 
that all we do is backfill stupid ideas on the part of the 
premier of the province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am absolutely confident the hon. member is aware of many of 
the dumb ideas that come out of the premier's office with respect 
to tax cuts as a priority in excess of all other tax cuts.  We 
have tax cuts that impede our ability to deliver health care.  We 
have tax cuts that impede our ability to deliver quality 
education.  I could not drive to the airport this morning without 
dodging holes on the 401 because the road repair is so pathetic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are asking for transparency and accountability.  When we 
deliver the money, which is all we are doing here with our 
transfer of $35 billion, there should be something coming back to 
the federal government that says how the money was spent.  I do 
not see what the issue is.  That has always been a Liberal value.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, like 
my colleague, I also enjoyed the speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I particularly enjoyed the part where he was pointing out that 
the equalization program, the topic for today, is only one aspect 
of the way this wonderful country runs.  I could not help but 
pick up his point about Queen's University and McGill.  I can 
well understand that there are students in Ontario who might want 
to go to Queen's. The member mentioned that the cost of tuition 
was higher at McGill and he was concerned about that.  Unless I 
am very much mistaken that is not the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The situation is that the province of Quebec, like the province 
of British Columbia, has kept its tuition fees down.  I do not 
compliment either of those two governments very often but I 
compliment them both for doing that.  It is a matter of decision 
of how we encourage young people to go to college or university. 
Tuition fees are only one device for doing that but I compliment 
them on that aspect of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of Quebec and McGill or Laval, my understanding is 
that a student comes from out of the province and the university 
charges them the average of the fees elsewhere in the country. 
Because the fees in Ontario have been raised to an inordinately 
high level, the tuition fees in Ontario are higher than the 
national average.  Unless I am mistaken, and I would like the 
member to comment on this, as a result of that his son's fees at 
Queen's will be higher than the fees at McGill even with the 
additional levies the province of Quebec requires. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe in mobility of students across the country.  We have 
to ask should a province like Quebec suffer because it has 
decided to keep the cost of education low for its own students. I 
believe that is a decision for the province of Quebec.  I suggest 
to the member that even though McGill is much superior to 
Queen's, the fees there are somewhat lower than the fees at 
Queen's. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The hon. parliamentary secretary is 
treading on dangerous ground here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I was with the hon. 
parliamentary secretary until he got to his last point and then 
one does not necessarily need to comment on the patently obvious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate the hon. member's intervention which I think is 
actually quite enlightening and very helpful.  The point in the 
illustration I was trying to draw was on the issue of mobility. 
In truth there should really be no impediment on the part of any 
student anywhere in the country to go to the university of his or 
her choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I would not necessarily want to pursue the Queen's-McGill 
dialogue, except over a football game and a beer, as I write the 
cheque for my son in the fall I am concerned that if he chooses 
to go to an out of province school I will be writing a far 
heftier cheque. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also adopt the hon. member's position that the provinces 
are to be congratulated in keeping their educational costs 
somewhat in line.  This government has done a great deal by the 
$2.5 billion it put up for millennial scholarship money.  That is 
one of the reasons these kinds of numbers can be kept in line.  I 
hearken back to the sitting of the finance committee. President 
Pritchard came before our committee and congratulated the federal 
government on its $2.5 billion initiative. 
<P><A NAME="LINK26"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
hon. member in his dissertation on equalization touched on 
tuition and expressed his concerns about the effect that 
equalization may have on tuition fees for students. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1350"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT26"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the hon. member if he would have as much concern for the 
recent change in government policy which prevents students who 
are hard pressed and who are experiencing extreme financial 
difficulty from declaring bankruptcy until after 10 years has 
expired.  This really works to discriminate against youth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about encouraging students to go to university 
certainly this policy has an adverse effect further down the 
road.  Does the member have any concern about that policy? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not think I was linking 
tuition and equalization directly.  My point was on the issue of 
mobility, that this was a statement of values, that students 
should not be impeded in terms of their ability to go from 
province to province for the course outline they wish as they 
pursue master and doctoral programs independent of considerations 
as to whether one is on one side of a border or the other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As to the financial issues, again, we have put up $2.5 billion 
for scholarship money.  That is fresh money available to 
students.  The only issue I have with respect to the bankruptcy 
provision has to do with the abuse that was going on with respect 
to the never-never payment plan.  We were having students 
graduate and in three, four or five years they had achieved a 
certain financial security and then they were simply walking away 
from the liability. 
<P><A NAME="LINK27"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords—Lloydminster, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise today to discuss the 
equalization bill.  I join my colleagues on this side of the 
House in condemning the irresponsible panic the government uses 
to introduce legislation in this place.   To compound that, about 
an hour ago we had the 46th time that time allocation or closure 
has been moved since the Liberals took power in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a list of comments that could be made by the members 
from that side in the way they handled time allocation when it 
was used against them in a couple of government situations before 
that.  I will not get into that today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not the first time this cabinet has waited until the 
last minute to bring in time sensitive financial bills with no 
consultation or material circulated so that all members of 
parliament and their constituents can get a good, hard look at 
what is being proposed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of Bill C-65 we have the even greater absurdity of 
having this dumped in our laps, so the government knew it would 
have to take a look at the equalization legislation formula every 
five years.  We knew this was coming.  It is nothing new. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general several times has reminded the government 
through his annual recommendations to reform the structure of 
equalization, but like so many other worthwhile things that he 
has had to say lately, it has been totally ignored. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opposition and by extension all Canadians outside government 
circles were given three sitting days notice to consider $35 
billion in spending that will extend well into the mandate of the 
next government.  As the old saw goes, haste makes waste, and 
this government has made haste an art form. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-65 introduces some new variables into an equation that is 
already so complex that even its authors have trouble 
understanding it.  How else can we explain the fact that three 
years out of five the formula for figuring out the amounts to be 
doled out has to resort to exceptions and special definitions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The formula, in other words, cannot even describe what the 
government has in mind for all this money it hands out.  I equate 
this equalization system with the so-called simplicity of the new 
gun registry which one member opposite compared to the simplicity 
of the tax code.  It never seems to occur to this government that 
there is something wrong with a tax code that runs to 1,600 pages 
and still requires thousands of legal opinions every year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not seem to bother this government that it has spent 
$200 million on a gun registry with more waste on the way as it 
struggles to make it work.  No one knows exactly what is supposed 
to be accomplished by it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Equalization as practised by this government suffers from the 
same disease.  It is complex, unaccountable, ineffective and 
unworkable.  On top of built-in special terms and evasions this 
government has had to write up special deals with two so-called 
have not provinces so that, we presume, they can be even more 
equal than the other have nots. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has occurred to me that if Nova Scotia and Newfoundland get 
special discounts on their oil revenues maybe my home province of 
Saskatchewan can make a deal on casino revenues which are now to 
be considered part of the province's fiscal status. 
In future will we see three levels of consideration for lottery 
revenues like we are looking at for oil in those other two 
provinces?  Will there be special calculations for lottery 
tickets versus roulette wheel contributions?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Saskatchewan plans to take a major hit on gaming revenues as, 
right or wrong, it has built up quite a nest egg over the last 
couple of years from that source.  We cannot be sure that 
gambling even represents net revenue in the broadest sense.  When 
we take out the social ramifications and the costs to families 
and so on, is there anything there that we really want to take a 
look at taxing? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the federal government counts the gross amount donated to 
one arm bandits, lottery retailers, will it subtract the social 
cost of gambling addictions and the resulting family break-ups? 
Will it take into account the fact that gambling money may simply 
be money taken from some other spending?  Will it take into 
account, as the member for Surrey Central mentioned on Monday, 
the example of Windsor, Ontario?  There is a great glittering 
casino there surrounded by boarded-up restaurants and shops, and 
Windsor is at least on the boarder with Detroit, a large 
population base to draw from.  One could argue that we are 
fleecing Americans for their loose change, but that is not a 
likely outlet for rural Saskatchewan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not trying to argue that provinces should be able to 
collect billions from their own jurisdiction and pick up handouts 
from Ontario, Alberta and B.C. as well.  Quite the contrary.  The 
fact that ten provinces and soon to be three territories exist as 
autonomous jurisdictions means that all these governments have 
different ways to fulfil the ambitions and desires of their local 
populations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The equalization plan this government is still tinkering with, 
in fact making even more complex, does not even want to recognize 
this.  The equalization wants to arbitrarily level the playing 
field by chopping down all the trees and filling in the ditches. 
It forgets there are reasons why some people need those forests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  My colleague, I see that you are just

<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our flag was raised for the first time in 1965 and for the past 
34 years has been a most prominent symbol of our identity and our 
sense of belonging to Canada.  Because it represents our 
achievements and hopes, our aspirations and all things that we 
hold dear in this country, because it illustrates 132 years of 
collective history, the maple leaf inspires a profound feeling of 
pride in each of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because it symbolizes the values we hold dear, freedom, 
tolerance, compassion and understanding, and because it recalls 
Canada's role in defence of human rights and in peacekeeping and 
rescue missions abroad, the Canadian flag has become the emblem 
of democracy all around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that the anniversary of the Canadian flag will strengthen 
our sense of belonging and our faith in this country as today and 
every day we realize the tremendous blessings of belonging to 
this vast and beautiful land.

addressing the distinctive needs and interests of aboriginal

presents significant challenges that can only be met with

One of the most recent innovations introduced by the National 
Parole Board has been the use of native elders to assist at 
parole hearings.

University of New Brunswick.  The topic of the forum, which is 
being held in conjunction with Fredericton's two universities, 
UNB and St. Thomas, is the role of our universities in the 
community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will be engaging in discussion and debate with the community 
on a wide range of issues, including the role of universities in 
a changing society, how post-secondary education should be 
funded, how to successfully market research and development 
innovations on the global market and what we can do to address 
student debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I invite everyone in the riding of Fredericton to attend this

for students, for low income families, for the disabled, for 
charities and for the voluntary sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In every budget since, we have been able to reduce income taxes. 
In the last budget we cut taxes for 13 million out of 14 million 
Canadian tax filers.  We took 400,000 taxpayers right off the tax 
rolls.  This is the type of tax—

</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact Canadians are paying $1,800 more in taxes this year and 
receiving $1,150 less in health care than when the government 
took power in 1993.  Despite running surpluses in the last two

kindly that the hon. member wait until tomorrow's budget to see 
what our measures on health care are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me say this.  In terms of tax revenues having gone up, it is 
very simple.  If we have more people working we have more 
revenue.  Since we took office 1.5 million more Canadians are 
working.  This is a huge increase and in the last month alone 
employment went up 87,400.  This is the type of real results—

that is an absolute joke.  The finance minister knows that we 
have seen bracket creep wring $1 billion out of Canadians pockets 
every year since they have been in power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that this government implemented the largest tax hike in 
Canadian history, taking $900 from each Canadian who is working, 
lucky enough to have a job these days, over the next several

</I></B></P><P align=left>The government talks a lot about productivity.  I want to ask

out of the pockets of Canadians and give us the highest tax

out before, there are families of Canadian servicemen waiting for 
the answers to these questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ask the hon. member two things.  First, will the 
government commit to tabling a response by Friday or even a 
partial response prior to the parliamentary break?  If the answer

what problem it has encountered in the six months that have

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>FEDERAL-PROVINCIAL FISCAL ARRANGEMENTS ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK198">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-65, an 
act to amend the Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements Act, be 
read the second time and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK199"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords—Lloydminster, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, we are here this afternoon discussing Bill C-65, the 
equalization bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing that concerns me in this bill is there seems to be no 
recognition of costs in creating the wealth, only more confusing 
ways of counting revenues.  The federal government wants to know 
how much the final product is worth rather than simply count the 
number of logs after the fact.  There might be some common sense 
there but it is hard to see how it will work in practice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am thinking about Saskatchewan's agricultural production and I 
wonder if there is any consideration for the greater input costs 
that go into producing the higher value crops.  Presumably my 
province will be penalized equalization payments because our 
farmers will be earning more for pulse crops than they did for 
growing the straight grain commodities.  The problem is that 
growing higher value crops is more expensive and there seems to 
be a disincentive to invest and innovate built into this approach 
to equalization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have no indication that this government is listening to the 
auditor general or the provinces that have an interest in 
removing disincentives.  There is no argument that disincentives 
exist in this equalization scheme.  We hear that from both sides. 
How else can we explain the fact that some of the highest sales 
taxes in this country are charged by the have not governments of 
Atlantic Canada through harmonized governance? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1520"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT44"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These provinces suffer from higher than average unemployment and 
lower than average incomes but their citizens are charged higher 
sales taxes than in Ontario and certainly in Alberta. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By overcharging on certain taxes these provinces suppress 
consumer activity but at least are not penalized equalization 
money because the revenues are below averages enjoyed elsewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If anybody in this House is still under the illusion that higher 
taxes raise more revenues I invite them to look at the examples 
of the successes enjoyed by Ontario and certainly Alberta.  We 
are aware that Ontario is looking at alternatives to the present 
equalization schemes because the world that existed when this 
system was first cooked up 40 years ago is now quite different. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Trade flows across North America and between us, European and 
Asian countries have undergone dramatic change.  This bill seems 
to want to perpetuate a system that Canada has outgrown. In the 
meantime the government, despite promises going back to 1993, has 
failed to address billions of dollars lost through 
interprovincial trade barriers while it thinks up new ways to 
irritate the Americans and interfere with that important market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point is there are many ways to grow the national economy 
that do not include sending wealth through the bureaucratic meat 
grinder here in Ottawa.  Wealth creation is not a zero sum game 
where if the government does not grab a share off the top and 
sends it to where it thinks it is needed that somehow no wealth 
would ever be distributed.  That has never been a true picture of 
economic activity and we are still waiting for this government to 
grasp that simple economic concept. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The urge to tinker and micro manage the economy leads to some 
unfortunate distortions.  Subsidies to have not provinces allow 
them to charge less in some areas than the cost of the service 
and conversely because have provinces are obligated to finance 
those subsidies they must collect more taxes than they might 
otherwise wish to.  We know high taxes penalize low income 
Canadians, proportionately more than high income Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that governments turn around and dish out the high 
taxes in the form of credits and social programs only begs the 
question why take it away from them in the first place.  A C.D. 
Howe study showed that when the extra taxes are taken away from 
low income earners in a have province they are just as likely to 
end up in the hands of a higher income citizen of a have not 
province.  This includes all services and is reflected in the 
fact that Alberta families earning $30,000 to $40,000 a year pay 
9% more in taxes than they receive in government services while 
Canadians earning the same amount in a have not province, like 
Saskatchewan right next door, see anywhere from 2.4% to 15.4% 
more in return than they pay out.  Where is the fairness?  How 
does this constitute equalization? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this was one country where Canadians were welcome to live 
anywhere within our borders then we could not tolerate policies 
that paid people to stay where jobs did not exist at the expense 
of people who sought out opportunities where they did.  My 
province of Saskatchewan has seen its population stagnate or 
migrate over the years but I do not support policies that would 
encourage people to sit at home.  Saskatchewan has tremendous 
potential and I would like to see that explored first.  No one 
should be treated as a liability that their home province has to 
pay for, and that is what this legislation seems to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly what we should be doing is looking at ways to unleash 
the potential of every province and region of this great country. 
We should be examining legislation that average Canadians can 
understand that is so clear that it does not need special 
exemptions and rulings, that focuses the benefits of any program 
on the people who need it most.  I do not think there is a better 
definition of equalization than that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The idea is to help those in need have the same opportunity as 
others, not move everyone to the lowest common denominator.  We 
cannot guarantee the same outcome, and maybe that is what this 
government is going for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As usual, we started out with simple intentions 40 some years 
ago and ended up with a tax code and gun registry that are 
totally unworkable.  Billions of dollars are intended to 
accomplish certain objectives but the objectives end up being 
blurred. Accountability is sacrificed in the name of an ideal and 
the ideal ends up being overrun by events. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By all means let us agree that we want the whole country to 
enjoy the wealth we have generated within our borders but let us 
not keep our citizens from creating their own wealth on their own 
initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must remember there is only one taxpayer whether from Alberta 
or Newfoundland.  The so-called have provinces must maintain 
higher taxes to pay their share of equalization which has an 
impact on poorer people of that province just so programs can 
exist to subsidize not so poor people in have not provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-65 is really all about the federal government maintaining 
control of tax loads, to have a say in provincial affairs.  As we 
know, he who has the money makes the rules, but in the end is 
that the best Canadian taxpayers can expect?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, the member made reference to 
have not provinces and the fact that we are in some sense 
subsidizing have not provinces and that we treat have not 
provinces like liabilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to clarify for the hon. member that we do not treat 
any province like a liability.  The intention of equalization is 
to ensure that all provinces are able to provide a comparable 
level of service to Canadians so that Canadians, regardless of 
where they live, have an opportunity to receive health care and 
social services benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Alberta and British Columbia, which are have provinces today, 
were provinces that did receive equalization payments in the 
past.  So equalization payments are meant to try to support 
provinces as they are continuing to improve their economic 
circumstance and once they improve their economic circumstance 
equalization payments are no longer provided to those provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I guess the true colour of the Reform Party comes through when 
the member says the objective of the government is to try to 
guarantee the same outcome or equal outcomes for Canadians and it 
just cannot be done.  I disagree with the hon. member. 
Equalization is a cornerstone of what it is to be Canadian, and 
that is to try to provide have not provinces with the ability to 
provide equal services or services of comparable value to 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He went on to make an accusation about how low income Canadians 
from have provinces are subsidizing high income Canadians of have 
not provinces.  For a given level of income, all Canadians pay 
the same federal taxes irrespective of which province they live 
in.  So I ask the hon. member to take the time to speak with his 
provincial counterparts about equalization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Saskatchewan is a recipient of equalization and I think 
individuals who live in Saskatchewan appreciate this program.  It 
is a program provided in consultation and collaboration with the 
provinces.  It is renewed every five years.  It is reviewed every 
February and October of each year to assess what the payments are 
and it is a collaborative effort.  It is meant to provide 
comparable services.  I fail to understand how the hon. member 
could disagree with that premise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Ritz:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank the parliamentary 
secretary for his intervention.  I think he misread what I said. 
I said people in the have not provinces should not be treated as 
liabilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we want to create is equality of opportunity, not equality 
of outcome.  We cannot do that.  We have regional disparity.  We 
have different things happening across this country.  But 
equality of opportunity, quality of life, we are all after those 
goals.  It is a great target to shoot for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at equalization across the country, Saskatchewan is 
a have not province for whatever reasons.  I am wondering why 
Saskatchewan oil revenues are not treated the same as 
Newfoundland oil revenues.  Newfoundland is also a have not 
province.  Why do we have different sets of rules for different 
provincial jurisdictions?  Why do we have some extra little 
things written for other areas? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri:</B>  That is on the value of the resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Ritz:</B>  The value of the product, sure. That is 
what I talked about in my speech as well, the value of pulse 
crops.  The value of a tobacco crop in Ontario is certainly 
different than the value of a canary crop in Saskatchewan.  How 
does the government come to a formula that is workable and fair 
to everyone with all of those different codicils and amendments 
to it? 
<P><A NAME="LINK201"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, 
NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I listened to my friend's remarks with 
interest.  I wonder if he shared the same observation that I made 
when I was looking through the transfer payments that were made 
to the province of Saskatchewan over the years. My friend will 
know that Saskatchewan in some years has been a have province and 
in other years it has been a have not province.  Did he notice 
the correlation between which political party was in office 
during the have years and which political party was in office 
during the have not years? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If my friend did not read the reports, it is interesting to 
notice that subsequent years of Liberal and Conservative 
governments inevitably resulted in the province becoming heavily 
indebted and therefore qualifying for equalization payments. 
Then the CCF or the NDP would be elected and over two or three 
years balance the books and get into a situation where there was 
no deficit and therefore lost the status of a have not province.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a curious relationship between political parties and 
being in and out of debt.  Did my friend notice that when he was 
looking at these statistics? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Ritz:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank the member from 
Kamloops for his great intervention on Saskatchewan provincial 
politics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since I live there and he does not, I can tell him that being a 
have not province regardless of who is governing us is not a 
great thing to be.  Regardless of what government has been in 
Saskatchewan the problem we have seen is that we still have not 
fulfilled the potential we have in that great province.  We have 
the resources, the pioneering spirit and the entrepreneurial 
drive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the NDP government we have seen in the last number of 
years utility rates rather than taxes go through the roof.  Those 
are not part of the equalization system.  We have seen a 9% PST 
hike and we have backed off a little on that.  Roads are in 
terrible disarray.  Health care is abysmal with waiting lines 
that are unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not seem to matter what government is in power.  It 
still comes down to some cash transfers from the federal 
government that everybody relies on.  It becomes a disincentive 
to get out there and make things happen on your own. 
<P><A NAME="LINK202"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
perhaps I was not listening correctly.  I heard if not 
disparaging remarks about the equalization program, faint praise 
of that program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The equalization program is one of all sorts of links and flows 
which make up this Confederation.  In this case it is not some 
form of charity which is being given to provinces which at this 
moment under the formula are defined as being have not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, with the case of the province of Saskatchewan, the 
flows back to the Confederation of the other provinces includes 
the wonderful health care system we have now.  This is something 
which Saskatchewan has given to us.  It was developed there and 
tried out there and the whole country was able to take it up.  It 
has flourished in a sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member mentioned oil in particular.  I do not think he 
understands that the equalization part which has to do with oil 
is arranged so it reflects the price of oil, the cost of the 
production of oil in the province to which the equalization 
payments are directed.  This is very clear on looking at the 
simulation I have here of equalization changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the member really saying that he does not like the 
equalization program? Also, does he not think that every five 
years there should be a thorough review of it so it reflects 
current conditions across the country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Ritz:</B>  Madam Speaker, the parliamentary 
secretary talked about the cost of the production of oil. 
Newfoundland's is maybe higher offshore. The problem in 
Saskatchewan is that it is very heavy crude that we are trying to 
pump.  We are into steam recovery. We are into upgrading it and 
all sorts of things.  We have costs involved as well. I am saying 
that if the formula gets so convoluted and tough to work with it 
becomes a bureaucratic nightmare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said in my speech, the average family in Alberta earning 
$30,000 to $40,000 a year pays 9% more in taxes than it receives 
in government services.  The tax load has to be higher from 
Alberta, a have province, to subsidize a have not province like 
Saskatchewan next door.  Those are the facts.  Those are the 
government's numbers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we speak about health care in Saskatchewan, we have closed 
57 hospitals in the last number of years.  We are still spending 
$300 million more in health care than we did before we closed 
those hospitals.  We have fewer doctors and nurses.  We have 
longer waiting lists.  We have a horrendous amount of 
administrators, facilitators, co-ordinators and all sorts of 
paper pushers and nobody servicing anybody who is ill.  It is not 
acceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  Madam Speaker, when we are discussing 
equalization payments, what we are trying to do is establish a 
level playing field for Canadians no matter where they happen to 
live in the country.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Does my hon. friend share the view that perhaps it is time to be 
bold when it comes to funding education and eliminate tuition 
fees?  Tuition fees across the country come to about $3 billion. 
We have a surplus of between $10 billion and $15 billion. If the 
Minister of Finance wished, we could actually eliminate all 
tuition fees from post-secondary institutions like most of the 
other OECD countries did long ago. Would the member support this 
notion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Ritz:</B>  Madam Speaker, it is an interesting 
concept to have everyone receive more education.  That is 
definitely a laudable goal.  We are into a knowledge based 
economy.  Canada leads the world in a lot of the technology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think it is feasible to eliminate tuition fees.  I 
would certainly like to see the government rather than direct 
money to the university, the physical structure and all the 
things that go with it, to redirect it to the actual students so 
the students control the outcome of their own education.

Speaker, I believe I will be splitting my time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I have to advise the 
members we are at the stage of 10 minute speeches with no 
questions and comments.  The hon. member has 10 minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Madam Speaker, I am being heckled by 
members of my own caucus, but for good reason.  Since it is a 10 
minute address with no opportunity for questions and comments, I 
will just have to put my points across. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I want to apologize to my friend for interrupting his 
remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately we have just been informed that we have reached 
the 10 minute period during which the standing orders do not 
allow for any questions and comments.  Because of the interesting 
exchange we have been having, I wonder if I could seek unanimous 
consent to allow 10 minutes at the end of the member's 
presentation to have questions and comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>   Does the hon. member 
have the unanimous consent of the House? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Madam Speaker, I must admit that I am 
somewhat disappointed that it was this side of the House that 
would not allow questions and comments.  I do thank the hon. 
member for asking for unanimous consent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What really matters in this place is the debate that goes on 
between the parties.  I would welcome a response to some of the 
perhaps mildly critical points I wish to make with regard to some 
of the comments and the process that is going on here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard members from all parties talk about their concern 
that we are operating under time allocation on this bill.  Time 
allocation is a very interesting process which has been used by 
all governments in this place and across the country when there 
is an obstreperous and obtrusive opposition party which simply 
wants to oppose and stop the government's agenda from going 
forward.  It does not have to be based on any kind of solid 
rationale.  It simply has to be based on the fact that opposition 
members got out of bed this morning and said “We not know what 
is going on in the House but we are opposed to it”.  That is 
their mentality when they come to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only option for a government, particularly a majority 
government that wants to get on with the business of Canada, the 
business of concerned Canadians, is to use the parliamentary 
tools that are available.  This happens to be one of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also interesting that opposition members would claim that 
there has not been a dialogue or discussion.  In fact, the 
proposed amendments here are the result of over two years of 
extensive consultations and review of the equalization program by 
the federal government and the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is rather interesting that the opposition members would 
suggest there has not been an opportunity for dialogue.  In fact, 
those who are most directly affected by this equalization program 
are the provincial governments, the people in the provinces.  I 
think they agree it is important that we get on with the renewal 
of this particular program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important when people use words, particularly in this place, 
that we try to understand what they mean because they can be 
clouded.  They can be hidden.  They can actually be tricky the 
odd time.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard a member from the Reform Party say that the Reform Party 
is interested in seeing equality of opportunity and not equality 
of outcome.  Interesting.  Put that together with the question 
that was asked of him by one of the hon. members opposite about 
tuition fees in universities.  I would say that equality of 
opportunity to the Reform Party simply means that there should be 
an opportunity to attend post-secondary education somewhere in 
the country but equality of outcome which Reform is opposed to 
means that they are going to have to pay whatever it is the 
Reform Party decides to pass on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We as the national government believe not only in equality of 
opportunity but also in equality of outcome.  They must go 
together, otherwise we end up with disparities around the country 
where the rich will be able to afford to send their sons and 
daughters to universities and colleges, but the majority of 
Canadians will not.  That is what it means if we look at putting 
the opportunity there but do not worry about the outcome or the 
mechanisms that are put in place to help Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer to a speech that was made by the hon. Leader of the 
Opposition, the leader of the Reform Party.  This is important 
because it is an example of a party whose members will stand and 
say what they think Canadians want to hear and then they will 
change the words.  Let me share some examples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Leader of the Official Opposition said in a speech on this 
bill “I do not think it can be stressed enough that equalization 
is an important principle which makes our federation work”.  One 
would assume by that statement that he would be in support of the 
bill.  I do not want to take it out of context but it is a 
reasonable assumption, it makes the federation work. Then he goes 
on to say the official opposition, the Reform Party, is committed 
to equalization and has been from the outset. Once again one 
would think that he is indicating that he supports this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember the Ross Perot presidential campaigns in the United 
States.  We know that most of Reform's positions come out of 
American policies.  Ross Perot would point to a chart and it 
would be a matter of if you want to know why the car does not 
run, you have to open up the hood and look at the engine. 
Terrific. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Leader of the Opposition goes to the Ross Perot school of 
politics.  He wants four columns.  This makes equalization clear 
to him.  It is sort of like a game show. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Column one would show what the province would receive through 
simple equal per capita grants in support of social programs. 
There is nothing in column one to deal with geography.  Take a 
look at what we are going to see when Nunavut starts up.  They 
are having their elections today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The per capita grant in Nunavut for reasons of climate, 
geography and demographics will be substantially higher than the 
per capita grant for Saskatchewan or somewhere else in the 
country. It seems fair that we do not simply look at the number 
of people who exist in a particular province or territory, but we 
deal with the real issues.  How do these people survive?  But not 
in the Ross Perot school, and I cannot say the Leader of the 
Opposition's name of course, since it is unparliamentary—but not 
in that school of economics and politics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Column two would show what the province would receive in terms 
of enhanced and better focused equalization.  He is somehow going 
to magically top it up.  That is the name of the game.  If you 
get the right column maybe there is a top up.  It just depends, 
we are not sure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Column three would show what the people and employers would 
receive through tax cuts.  While he wants to top up the 
equalization plan with increased transfers, he is also going to 
cut taxes.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It reminds me of the Reform Party's position on health care 
funding.  It said that it would put 50% of the surplus toward tax 
relief, 50% of the surplus toward paying down the debt and the 
other 50% that it will somehow magically manufacture I suppose 
will go to health care.  It is voodoo economics without question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Number four would give the total of all this.  I am not quite 
sure whether this is reinventing the wheel or gamesmanship or a 
show business mentality, trying to be different.  I do not see 
the substantive benefits in any way whatsoever.  I mentioned we 
have to be careful about interpreting the words used by people 
who speak in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a quote from the Leader of the Opposition: “The 
premiers should take off their premiers' hats for just a day and 
put on their political leaders' hats. I assure those provincial 
leaders who favour reform of the federation over fossilized 
federalism”—if that is not Ross Perot I do not know what 
is—“that they will find an ally in federal Reformers united to 
create a better alternative to this bankrupt administration”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Very interesting.  I have finally discovered where the words 
united alternative came from.  In reality we are hearing that if 
the premiers will forget about their responsibilities to 
represent all the people of the province, whether those people 
voted for them or not, and if the premiers will simply put on 
their partisan political hats, then the Reform Party will line up 
beside them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a group of people who do not even understand the 
traditional significance of the equalization system in this 
country that ensures Canadians from sea to sea to sea have equal 
opportunity and equal outcome to ensure that they and their 
families will have access to all social programs and economic 
development programs in this country.  It is astounding to me 
that Reformers would be opposed to a bill that would share the 
wealth throughout this great land. 
<P><A NAME="LINK204"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich—Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I will try to bring this debate back to Bill C-65.  It 
is my pleasure to rise today on behalf of the residents of 
Saanich—Gulf Islands and to speak to this bill, an act to amend 
the Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements Act.  As we know from 
previous speakers, the primary objective of this bill is to renew 
the federal equalization program for another five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not take time to simply recount what my caucus colleagues 
and the leader of the official opposition have said with respect 
to Bill C-65.  It has been repeated and eloquently stated by the 
Reform Party and the people of Canada that they do support the 
principle of equalization.  That is very important to remember. 
We support the principle of equalization, but that does not mean 
we cannot improve the delivery vehicle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Equalization transfers will amount to nearly $9 billion this 
year alone and will account for 8% of all federal program 
spending.  That is an incredible amount of money.  Yet with 
regard to one of the government's largest expenditure items the 
Liberal government recoils from any real scrutiny. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is absolutely shameful that the government gave the House a 
single day's notice that it would introduce this bill.  It is 
shameful that it did this without asking Canadians whether 
equalization adequately served their needs.  The government 
claimed there were two years of consultations yet we had one 
day's notice of this legislation's coming before the House. It is 
shameful for this government to invoke closure after only one day 
of debate.  We have seen that over and over again in the House. 
It is shameful that the government is ramming this legislation 
through to avoid any real debate or accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not dwell on those acts but talk about the details of 
this bill.  I want to address the misinformation we hear from the 
members opposite.  I reiterate that we support the principle of 
equalization throughout this great country.  A common theme among 
proponents is that this program works so well that it does not 
need our full attention.  They say things like the formula is 
absolutely clear, transparent, simple.  I have heard it being 
referred to as scientific.  A few members a few moments ago said 
it is very clear. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1550"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT50"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would argue that the opponents opposite are wrong.  It is 
absolutely not transparent.  It is not clear.  It is not 
scientific nor is it precise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us just look at the legislation.  The general formula is 
laid out in section 4 of the Federal-Provincial Fiscal 
Arrangements Act.  It is very important that we read the facts 
and this is what the formula states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(1) Subject to the provisions of this part, the fiscal 
equalization payment that may be paid to a province for a fiscal 
year is the amount, as determined by the minister, equal to the 
greater of 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(a) the product obtained by multiplying 
</UL></UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(i) the aggregate of the amounts obtained by subtracting, for 
each revenue source, the per capita yield in that province for 
the revenue source for that fiscal year from the average per 
capital yield of the provinces of Ontario, Quebec, British 
Columbia, Manitoba and Saskatchewan for the revenue source for 
that fiscal year by 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(ii) the population of the province for that fiscal year, and 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(b) zero. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the equalization formula, word for word right out of the 
act.  I have to note that days before Premier Tobin in 
Newfoundland called his election he automatically received $30 
million, the exact amount of Newfoundland's deficit, so he could 
say he balanced the books before he called the election and that 
met this formula. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am only a short way into my 20 minutes so I will try to get 
right down to it.  I see some members are not interested as we 
get to the facts and give them the specifics of this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a natural response to the bureaucratese that those members 
claim is so transparent and it is not even worth debating.  We 
need a formula that will work, that is truly equalization, and I 
will get to offering alternatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thousands of Canadians could be asked about that formula I just 
read and they would not be able to decipher it.  Even most people 
in this Chamber, members who are used to reading legal jargon, 
would have to carefully read and reread, mull it over for a few 
minutes and attempt a guess.  Then the 301 members of this 
Chamber could be asked to give their definition of how the 
formula works.  I suggest there would be 301 different answers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even if it could be figured out there is a mountain of 
preparatory calculations that needs to be made before actually 
making the transfers.  An army of specialized economists is 
needed to calculate the revenue base and the per capita yield of 
each province for 31 separate revenues. I would wager there is 
not one member here who could list 31 revenue sources without 
looking at notes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is all out of the formula.  It creates a bureaucracy, a 
glass tower of people even to come up with this formula.  They 
work all year long on it.  There are all kinds they have to look 
at, personal income tax, corporate income tax, corporate capital 
tax, general miscellaneous sales taxes, harmonized sales tax, 
amusement tax, fuel tax, motor vehicle, alcohol, medical, 
forestry, mining, water rentals, and the list goes on and on.  I 
have pages of them here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are more such as provincial and municipal property taxes, 
racetrack tax and lottery ticket sales.  All these have to go 
through pages and pages of formulations for every single province 
to come up with this formula. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To suggest it is not politicized is absolutely ludicrous.  In 
only a stroke of a pen the province of Newfoundland received $30 
million to balance the books before the premier called the 
election the next day.  He had a balanced budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is just the tip of the iceberg.  The Federal-Provincial 
Fiscal Arrangements Act and the amendments laid out in Bill C-65 
are complex and confusing to say the least.  They are nothing 
compared to the actual calculations made by the finance 
department number crunchers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have here the results of the revenue source calculations.  I 
have done my homework and looked at this.  I do not know if I can 
get into this in 10 minutes. There are pages and pages of 
calculations in this book.  Each line is a very small step.  I 
cannot get into them all. 
They have to go through this for every single one of the revenue 
sources for every single province.

<A HREF="#LINKT51"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are 95 general steps for each revenue source for each of 
the 10 provinces.  That is nearly 1,000 separate calculations. 
They are all added up, it goes on and on and in the end we have 
tens of thousands of calculations done by the number crunchers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point I am trying to make is that we have this simple, 
clear, transparent amending formula that creates a huge mountain 
of bureaucracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, I believe in equalization for all 10 provinces.  I have 
travelled this country from coast to coast to coast.  I believe 
in this country and that is why I am standing in the House.  We 
could not have a better country.  But just because that is the 
way it has been done for 50 years does not mean that is the way 
it has to stay.  There are better vehicles to do this than the 
bureaucracy we have created. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of the members asked how will the Reform Party meet its 
financial numbers, 50% to tax reduction and 50% to debt.  The 
other numbers come from reducing the size of government, 
eliminating these bureaucracies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There must be a simpler way.  As the leader of the official 
opposition, the finance critic and a number of my colleagues have 
pointed out, we simply cannot stand back and tinker with 
federal-provincial financial relations, with something so 
important and so complex and convoluted we need a task force to 
consult with policy experts and others.  We need to talk about 
substantive reform and about the three pillars that finance our 
social services.  We need to rethink our tax policy, rethink 
Canadian health and social transfers and rethink equalization. We 
need to look at all three because they are tangled up together. 
They are interrelated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Real reforms, real improvements mean first of all we must 
simplify and rationalize federal transfers by providing equal per 
capita grants to all provinces for social purposes. Second, we 
should simplify and refocus the equalization program even more to 
low income provinces. Third, we must introduce substantive broad 
based tax relief to increase disposable incomes of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are issues we must address to improve the social and 
economic well-being of our citizens.  We need to debate these 
issues and we need to act now.  We do not need the status quo. 
Liberal tinkering and half measures that continue to prop up our 
fossilized federalism are not the way to go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could not in good conscience support Bill C-65.  I urge all 
members to reject this bill and demand the government introduce 
real improvements to Canada's social policy. 
<P><A NAME="LINK205"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, 
NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am pleased to say a few words on Bill 
C-65. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I differ a bit from my friend who just spoke.  At this second 
reading stage we will be supporting Bill C-65 but with a little 
qualification.  I think it is fair to say that when we look at 
the formula for determining the equalization payments, it is 
appropriate that in committee we examine this in considerable 
detail.  I think my hon. friend who just spoke pointed out the 
reason for that, that this is a complicated formula and if we are 
to pass this legislation beyond committee stage it is crucial 
that we examine that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to use this as an opportunity to point out one other 
aspect, to simply note the various revenue sources that are 
identified: personal income taxes, corporate income taxes, taxes 
on capital corporations, general and miscellaneous sales taxes, 
harmonized sales taxes, amusement taxes, tobacco taxes, motor 
fuel taxes, non-commercial motor vehicle licence revenues, 
commercial motor vehicle licence revenues, alcoholic beverage 
revenues, hospital and medical care insurance premiums, forestry 
revenues, conventional new oil revenues, conventional old oil 
revenues, heavy oil revenues, mined oil revenues, light and 
medium third oil revenues, heavy third oil revenues, revenues 
from domestically sold natural gas, revenues from exported 
natural gas, sales of crown leases, sales of reservations on oil 
and natural gas lands, oil and natural gas revenues other than 
those just described, mining revenues, water power rentals, 
insurance premium taxes, payroll taxes, provincial local 
government property taxes, race track taxes, revenues from 
lottery ticket taxes, revenues from games of chance taxes, 
miscellaneous provincial taxes, provincial revenues from sales of 
goods and services, local government revenues from sales of goods 
and services, miscellaneous local government taxes and revenues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think I have made my point. 
A lot of taxes have been identified in this legislation.  It 
seems to me that it would be appropriate for us to ask the 
question whether these individual taxes make sense.  At the time 
they were introduced I think it is fair to say there was probably 
some rationale behind them.  People thought they were appropriate 
social or economic policy taxes.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important now to identify each and every one of these tax 
exempt areas and factor in a cost benefit analysis.  What is the 
cost to the taxpayer and what is the benefit?  If it is not clear 
that there is a benefit then these taxes should be dropped.  It 
is a recommendation that any fair-minded person would agree with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously I am not arguing against the principle of the bill. 
The whole principle of equalization and having a level playing 
field for Canadians no matter where they live in terms of access 
to social programs, education, health care opportunities and 
economic opportunities is absolutely crucial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is all about the Canadian family.  It differentiates us 
from any other countries.  Whether one lives in an isolated part 
of Canada, on the east coast, on the north coast, on the west 
coast or in central Canada, one will have relatively the same 
access to programs.  That is what the country is all about.  That 
is what a civilized country is all about.  That is what Canada is 
all about.  This program helps facilitate that whole idea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not be so arrogant that we think it cannot be improved. 
That is what we are saying.  While the principle is fundamental 
to the Canadian ethic, it is imperative when the legislation 
reaches committee that we determine whether this is the most 
appropriate way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard my friend and others raise the point about the 
Premier of Newfoundland and how it would appear that there has 
been some monkeying around with this equalization bill in order 
for him to say he had a balanced budget just days before the 
election, which resulted in a more favourable election result. 
These are the abuses of the system that if in fact they were the 
case we have to find ways and means of mitigating them in the 
future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, on behalf of the New Democratic Party I say that 
we will support the bill enthusiastically at this stage of 
principle, but we have many serious questions that we want to ask 
in committee.  We look forwarding to getting it into committee, 
although not quite in this much of a hurry.  We are under time 
allocation which is, let us face it, an undemocratic use of the 
rules of the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would not want to say we can hear jack boots echoing in the 
hallways just around the corner, but there is something 
fundamentally wrong when the government starts muzzling Canadian 
representatives, when it starts saying to the people of Canada 
that it does not want to hear the view from some part of the 
country because it has heard enough and wants to close the place 
down.  It wants to muzzle parliament.  It wants to bring to an 
end the democratic process.  There is something fundamentally 
wrong about a government that decides it has heard enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember a little while back when the Conservatives were on 
that side and the Liberals were on this side.  They would go into 
a state of absolute hysterics every time some form of time 
allocation or closure was brought in.  They would stand and say 
this was an element of fascism, undemocratic and un-Canadian, 
that this was wrong, not right and ought not to occur.  Lo and 
behold there is an election and they flip across to the other 
side and now they do the same thing more often. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Liberals said before the last election that if they 
became the government they would not act like the Conservatives 
did in the matter of muzzling parliament we thought they meant 
less time allocation.  We thought they meant less use of closure. 
They meant more use of closure, more abuse of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to pay very close attention, as my friend said in his 
presentation, and listen closely to what they are saying.  When 
they say they want to change parliament let us ask them if that 
means improve parliament or make it less democratic so as to make 
it perfectly clear in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not with much enthusiasm that we now look forward to a 
vote at the end of the day, but the sooner the bill gets to 
committee and we find out some of the details, the better we will 
be able to change and amend the legislation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Coderre (Bourassa, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, what a 
perfect time to reply to several ridiculous statements on the 
part of the opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I hear cries of persecution from the Jurassic Park Reform 
Party, the shirt-rending Bloc Quebecois, or the NDP whited 
sepulchres, when they know full well that the government has to 
resolve the situation by March 31 so that the provinces will 
have the money with which to provide services, I find their 
egotistical grandstanding very hypocritical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud to be a member of this party and of this government. 
Bill C-65 is further evidence of the fact that we care about the 
public. We want all Canadians, wherever they live, to have 
access to services. To this end, we have put forward an 
equalization system that has proven itself year in year out 
since it was established, in 1957. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I hear the Bloc Quebecois say—and they do talk a great 
deal of nonsense, acting persecuted and offended—“We are not 
getting our fair share”, it makes me feel proud of being not 
only a Liberal but a Liberal from Quebec because, once again, 
not only are we going to get our fair share but, with the 
improvements contained in this bill, Canadians will receive $242 
million, 78% of this amount going to Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do members want numbers? I feel in great shape. 
I lost my voice last week, but I got it back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, Quebec accounts for 24% of Canada's population. Yet, 
29% of all equalization payments go to Quebec. That is nearly 
$1 billion, ladies and gentlemen from Quebec, and then the 
separatists complain that we are not getting our fair share. 
Canada is a generous country, so much so that Quebec is getting 
much more out of the system than it is putting in. This money is 
coming from all the provinces, and Ontario, British Columbia and 
Alberta in particular. When we tell the Bloc Quebecois members 
that, they get upset. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is probably why the Bloc Quebecois is down to 38%, from 
49%, in the polls today. Clearly, the Liberals are taking their 
responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of complaining, the hon. member for Drummond should be 
listening; it would do her good. 
In 1996 and 1997, Quebec companies received 39% of all federal 
government contracts and subsidies to industry for R & D.  This 
is extraordinary.  We represent 24% of the total population but 
Quebec universities received 28% of total subsidies.  All the 
contracts and subsidies to the universities for R & D represent 
a fair amount. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again on a regional basis, in science and technology we receive 
26%.  Truth will out.  The separatists are moaning, the Reform 
Party bunch from Jurassic Park are moaning, while we get on with 
looking after the interests of the people.  This is the first 
time I have heard dinosaurs speak.  I did not realize they 
could. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Quebec need to be reminded of what the 
equalization payment system is.  It is a system of generosity. 
It is a system of equity.  It is, above all, a system of 
protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-65 will, whether our separatist friends like it or not, 
give them an even larger piece of the pie.  Not only a bigger 
piece of the pie, but the province that gets the biggest share 
among all those receiving equalization payments is Quebec, once 
again.  This is a good reason to stay within the Canadian 
federation, since it has been demonstrated that not only does 
this system work, but it is generous to all, from sea to sea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, this seems not to please the hon. members for 
Drummond and Témiscamingue.  I hear them weeping.  The moaning 
and groaning heard in the background when the truth comes as a 
shock comes from the other side of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Equalization is important in that it accounts for 10% of the 
entire budget of Quebec.  This means that that we are giving 
close to $1 billion.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do not forget that 24% of the population is receiving 29% of the 
transfer payments.  What does all this money represent?  Ten per 
cent of Quebec's budget.  That means that, while Bouchard is 
busy with his little referendum and whines away about Quebec's 
separation, we are looking out for the people of Quebec, because 
we say “We are going to give you some money so you can have 
services”.  So while the others rattle on about Quebec's 
independence, we are providing money to pay for and ensure 
access to services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the other side goes on about “constitutionalitis”, do you 
know what counts?  What counts is that transfer payments are 
unconditional. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government hands out nearly $10 billion in total. 
As I said earlier, Bill C-65 provides $242 million to Canadians, 
78% of which will go to Quebec.  While they go on about 
“constitutionalitis” on the other side, we recognize one thing: 
that this federation is showing once again, through its 
generosity, that we care about the entire population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, they say “We are stuck with a PQ government in Quebec 
City”. But one thing is sure: according to the latest polls, 
support for the people in this government, for the federal 
Liberals from Quebec, is now 49%— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien:</B> Madam Speaker, on a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Coderre:</B> Oh, the member for Frontenac—Mégantic is in 
a state again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien:</B> Madam Speaker, I would appreciate your 
asking the member for Bourassa to withdraw his statement that we 
are stuck with the government of Lucien Bouchard in Quebec City. 
What we are stuck with is the member's Prime Minister but we 
have not said so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> This is part of the debate 
so I am going to ask— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Coderre:</B> The truth hurts, but there is no getting 
around it.  While members opposite are constantly playing to the 
audience—that is what they are doing—I am going to speak some hard 
truths.  I know that Quebeckers are very proud to be represented 
by Liberal members, because they know that, instead of whining 
all the time, we take their problems to the ministers and get 
things done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing is certain:  when the MPs representing Quebec are 
Liberals, the essentials get looked after, and one of those 
essentials is equalization payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, equalization is a system that has proved its worth, a 
system based on generosity that protects all Quebeckers and 
ensures that they have access to services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pauline Picard:</B> What about unemployed workers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Coderre:</B> When we hear the members opposite whining, it 
is obviously because the truth hurts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do over 75% of Quebeckers identify with this beautiful 
country called Canada?  Because they have understood that, since 
we have introduced social programs and equalization payments, 
Canadians have enjoyed an exceptionally high standard of living, 
making Canada the number one place in the world to live.  This 
is because of the system of equalization payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They cannot take that away from us.  Members should get out and 
visit the average person.  They should get out into the real 
world once in a while.  If they talked to real people, they 
would realize that it takes action to resolve problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pauline Picard:</B> Not the same people as in our province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Coderre:</B> That hurts them because, once again, Quebec 
is receiving not just its fair share, but more than its fair 
share.  I would like to see it receiving less because, if Quebec 
received less, it would mean that its economy is in better 
shape. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The day Quebec receives less in the way of equalization payments 
under this bill it will be because the economy is improving, not 
because cuts are being made.  This will be settled within three 
years with a provincial election, when the Parti Quebecois is 
dumped and we have Jean Charest as the premier of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meantime, allow me to simply state that this bill is an 
essential one, because it will make it possible, despite the 
abominable administrative policies of the provincial government, 
in the hospitals and in all health services, to look after the 
interests of the population.  We say to the people of Quebec, 
for as long as there is a Liberal government in Ottawa, and for 
as long as they have Liberal MPs in Ottawa to represent them, 
they are in good hands and we are going to look after their 
problems.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, last Saturday night was one of the few times I had the 
opportunity to sit down and watch television.  I watched the 
performance at Maple Leaf Gardens. The players of the 1930s, 
1940s, 1950s and so on were honoured.  They looked back at the 
achievements of the great players who gave their hearts to 
Canada's national sport.  They had tears in their eyes and were 
so very proud of their accomplishments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder what will be the record of this government when we look 
back at the 35th and 36th parliaments.  The government has set a 
record which is a shame to democracy.  The Liberals shut down 
this House 35 times in the last session.  No other Government of 
Canada has come near that number.  The government has said 35 
times that it does not need the opposition or as one of my hon. 
colleagues just said, it does not even have to consult the 
opposition. We are barely into the 36th parliament and the 
Liberals have shut down the debate in this House 11 more times. 
That is a record no government should be proud of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It really hurts me to sit here and listen to the hon. members 
opposite make certain statements almost bragging about their care 
in hospitals.  A growing number of people will die before they 
get emergency hospital care in this country.  That is not a 
highfalutin statement, that is a fact. This government has come 
in a total of 46 times and said it will shut this House down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the record of the government?  Going back to the 1930s, 
the 1940s and the 1950s we had some great hockey players. What 
will be the record of this government?  It will be known as the 
most undemocratic procedural government in the history of Canada. 
Nobody can deny that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard an hon. member say that the government gives out this 
money with no strings attached.  My question is, what is in this 
bill that will prevent the government from making the same 
bookkeeping manoeuvres as happened just a few months ago in the 
Newfoundland election when all of a sudden it got rid of its 
deficit?  What is in this bill to stop that procedure?  Nothing. 
What is in this bill that will absolutely ensure that the 
government does not intervene during the life of this bill to 
pull strings just to suit itself?  Absolutely nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has had five years to come up with this, not five 
weeks and not five months.  And today it has moved closure on a 
bill which has not really had any discussion in this House.  That 
is Liberal democracy.  This is not good planning.  The one thing 
it does show Canadians is that this is government arrogance at 
its worst. Most people on this side of the House have not had an 
opportunity to provide input on the bill.  This practice is very 
dangerous.  It is a growing practice opposite and an extremely 
dangerous practice for any government in a democratic society to 
use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What will happen if closure is exercised as much in the next 
four years as has been done in the past four years?  There will 
be no point in any member of the opposition even sitting here, 
absolutely none. 
There will be no point in members getting on their feet and 
debating an issue because the government will say it has the 
right to use this procedure and it is going to use it.  I heard 
that this afternoon.  And use it the Liberals have done. 
Forty-six times they have said “The opposition does not count. 
We are not going to listen to them.  We are not even going to 
have a debate on it”.  That is where we are at with this bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left>If equalization works, why are there still seven have not 
provinces?  I draw attention to my own province. It is rather 
interesting.  A member of my family recently had a commercial 
trucker haul two loads of grain to the terminal.  His bill for 
the trucking was in excess of $500.  The amount of money taken 
off was over $1 a bushel for freight.  When we analysed it we 
found that in my province we probably pay more money to the 
government opposite in federal excise fuel tax per capita than 
any other province.  I heard the only member of that party from 
my province say that we will not get any more back from the 
federal excise tax because we are a have not province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rationale the government uses when it takes out millions of 
dollars is simply “We cannot give back even 20% of the excise 
taxes taken out of the province because it is a have not 
province”.  That is the rationale being used. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I watch as our highways go to pieces.  The rural roads are being 
completely ruined.  After the millions of dollars the federal 
government has taken out, what guarantee does this bill give? At 
any given time a minister could decide that 48% of all the 
federal excise tax will be spent in a region of Canada and the 
people who really need the roads will get 3%.  This bill does not 
correct that deficit and the Liberals bring about closure so we 
cannot have a debate on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of the policies of this government and because it told 
the people we had to get rid of this freight rate and so on, 
people are leaving my province like never before.  They are 
saying that this government continues to tax them and the amount 
of money they are getting in return is not equal in any way. 
Three per cent has been the most in the last four years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will this bill ultimately stop political patronage?  Every 
member on the government side of the House says no.  What they 
are saying is “We will use this bill and we will use these 
payments the same way as we have used them in the past. We will 
use them to throw money into any region of Canada we want to, as 
long as we can buy money with that money that is going out”. 
That is what has happened and that is what is going to continue 
to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is more complex than the government admits.  This bill 
is going to committee and we know what will happen in committee. 
The bill will pass all the way through. Opposition members will 
have motions but they will not be heard.   We might as well tear 
our papers up now because the government is on the same old 
course it has been on 43 times before:  shut down the opposition; 
shut down any criticism; “let us decide where we can put the 
money the most”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I found out from reading the paper that there is a little bit of 
skulduggery going on like there was on the toll highway in New 
Brunswick.  Somebody is going to be bidding on highway 407 in 
Ontario. Has anyone else heard about that? 
It is these types of things.  When my friends from the maritimes 
stand up to discuss the toll highway the government responds to 
them in complete mockery.

<P><A NAME="LINK208"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I quite enjoyed the previous speaker's remarks.  I have 
had the opportunity to examine the debate on this legislation. 
Generally speaking despite the complaints that closure is 
forthcoming, the debate has been of a fairly high order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I particularly congratulate the Reform Party because it is 
touching some genuine nerves of concern.  One of the concerns in 
this whole concept of transfers from the federal government to 
the provinces is that of giving money to the provinces with no 
strings attached. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The equalization program involves $8.6 billion being transferred 
to various provinces.  When that is added to the Canada health 
and social transfer annual payments of some $12.6 billion, the 
total is $20 billion being transferred to the provinces by the 
federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The difficulty I have is that traditionally the federal 
government has so respected provincial rights that it has not 
demanded any real transparency or accountability from the 
provinces in terms of how this money is spent.  The idea is that 
both transfers are a provincial tax subsidy.  They lower the 
taxes a province is required to charge in order to provide the 
same standard of social and health services that might be found 
across the country.  The whole idea is, as we recognize in the 
Constitution, that the provinces have the right and the privilege 
to provide for the basic care of their citizens.  There is 
controversy now that suggests the federal government should not 
be involved in any issues pertaining to setting standards or 
ensuring the type of programs have at least a reasonable quality 
all across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we come to the origin of this equalization program, it is 
to give some sense that no matter where Canadians are in the 
country they have the same opportunities to a minimum level of 
programs.  This is so we are not in a situation where people in 
Newfoundland are at an enormous disadvantage in the types of 
social services provided to them when compared to people in 
Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a very peculiar situation.  On the one hand we are asked 
to give the transfers because we want to see national standards, 
and on the other hand the instruments of transparency and 
accountability are not there.  We cannot be absolutely certain 
that any of the provinces is using this money for the purpose 
intended.  It is the same for the Canada health and social 
transfer.  It is in the end simply a subsidy to the provincial 
taxes so the provinces will not have to raise them as high as 
they might ordinarily have had to and they will not have to take 
the flak.  The whole idea is that the federal government is there 
for the provinces to blame for high taxes.  We see this theme 
coming from the Reform Party all the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Portneuf who is here for this part of the debate 
made the observation that Quebec is owed the money. I found that 
quite amusing.  He basically said “Quebec is owed the money. 
Give us the money and keep giving us the money until we declare 
sovereignty”.  And that would be the end to that.

<A HREF="#LINKT58"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to the member for Portneuf that Quebec would probably not 
be a have not province if it were not for the fact that Quebec 
governments over the last 20 years successively and even to a 
certain extent the Liberal governments have pursued an agenda of 
nationalism that has dampened investment in Quebec, particularly 
in the Montreal region.  Montreal was the engine of the economy. 
At one time Montreal was a rival to Toronto.  Since this whole 
thing about sovereignty really took root in Quebec there has been 
a flight of investment.  It is not just a lack of investment, 
there has been a flight of investment.  It is no wonder that the 
province of Quebec wishes to continue to receive its share of 
equalization programs and its share of the Canada health and 
social transfer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier the member from St. John's said that equalization 
transfers should continue to come to Newfoundland even if 
Newfoundland develops new resource wealth.  It should continue to 
get 100% equalization transfers even if it enlarges its tax base 
as a result of the development of Voisey's Bay, Hibernia and 
other projects in Newfoundland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the same type of difficulty as what that member was 
asking.  He said give us our tax subsidy no matter what our 
resource income is.  Give it to us because we would prefer that 
the federal government be blamed for charging high taxes than the 
provinces.  In some respects, certainly in the sense of the 
Canada health and social transfer, this is precisely what we hear 
in my own province of Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a way we may be looking at this equalization program in the 
form we see it for the last time.  The whole of society is now 
moving to a position where Canadians in every province are asking 
their governments to provide a high level of transparency and 
accountability so that the people of those provinces can see that 
the money is being spent wisely and well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason this is very significant is in the context of the 
recent social union talks, ten premiers signed a letter with 
respect to how health spending would be undertaken.  The key 
element of those negotiations was the principle that if the 
provinces were to receive money for social and health programs 
from the federal government the provinces should be in control of 
the programs. But the provinces had to undertake to put in 
instruments of transparency and accountability so that all 
Canadians, including Canadians in those provinces, could see that 
the money regardless of where it is coming from is spent on the 
programs it is intended for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see one of the members of the Bloc Quebecois shaking his head. 
I point out that the province of Quebec is to be one of the 
provinces best able to meet this requirement because that 
province happens to have one of the best freedom of information 
acts of any province.  There is no reason why the member should 
shake his head because it is precisely the type of program he 
should support.  If I had my way I would like to see the federal 
government adopt some of the provisions that exist in Quebec with 
respect to privacy and access to information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no reason why Quebec or any other province should be 
opposed to better transparency in the application of equalization 
payments.  If we are to transfer $8.6 billion a year or $12.6 
billion, a sum total of $20 billion, I agree with my Reform 
members opposite that we should be calling for better levels of 
transparency.  Perhaps it is a little premature right now because 
this legislation has to go forward in order to get the money in 
train.

ideas and initiatives, it is beyond us to understand why it needs 
the hammer of time allocation to ram this thing through 
parliament without proper debate.  One can only assume that it 
does not want any more scrutiny on this bill than it absolutely 
has to because it is afraid of what Canadians will think of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today my colleagues have talked at length about a flawed process 
that has led to a flawed deal.  This is not just about a flawed 
process right now, it is a process that goes back to the 
beginning of the whole notion of equalization and how the formula 
for equalization was to be drawn up and used. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, when I was elected in 1993 one of the first private 
member's bills I brought to the House of Commons was a bill that 
would require that revenues based on hydroelectric sales be 
included in the equalization formula and calculations. Those are 
not included.  Some provinces, for example my province of British 
Columbia, the province of Quebec and other provinces, derive 
significant revenues from hydroelectric sales.  That is not 
included in the equalization formula.  Those revenues often flow 
directly into the coffers of the provincial government.  As we 
know, many provincial governments own many hydroelectric 
installations.  I cannot believe the Government of Canada would 
not take into account this massive influx of revenues based on 
hydroelectric sales. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As many of my colleagues have pointed out, the cost of 
production in many provinces is not taken into account. For 
example, in my province of British Columbia the cost of 
production in tree harvesting is not taken into account.  What 
this leads to is a distortion based on this convoluted formula 
that is all about political manipulation and delivering political 
objectives.  It has very little to do with true equalization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The New Democratic government in British Columbia is in the 
process of taking B.C. from a have province to a have not 
province as we speak.  So I have to be a little careful.  We may 
be in need of some equalization in British Columbia one of these 
days unless we do something about that government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current equalization formula is full of inherent 
contradictions and inconsistencies.  This delivers a distorted 
and easily manipulated formula which invites political 
interference.  We have seen that recently.  My colleagues have 
been referring to it all day.  We saw it with the Government of 
Newfoundland and the things that took place prior to the last 
election in Newfoundland.  There is no doubt or question that 
succeeding federal governments have used equalization as a 
political lever to gain political advantage in different parts of 
the country at different times.  Because it has been used as a 
lever of political interference and political advantage, it is 
inherently unfair. 
The overall effect is really unfair for most ordinary Canadians. 
Equalization is reflected in provincial tax rates.  Have not 
provinces can maintain lower tax rates than have provinces and 
still deliver the same services to their citizenry.  Because 
lower tax rates benefit high income earners the most, the net 
effect of equalization under the Liberals is that poor families 
in rich provinces subsidize rich families in poor provinces.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will repeat that because I think it is a really important 
point.  Poor families in rich provinces subsidize rich families 
in poor provinces which is exactly the opposite effect that 
equalization is supposed to bring about, I submit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government interventionist programs, in particular where they 
are not well thought out or not properly rationalized, tend to 
have unintended consequences.  Let us call it the law of 
unintended consequences. These almost always are unfair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we think of it, a poor family somewhere in Ontario, British 
Columbia or Alberta is subsidizing a rich family somewhere in one 
of the other seven provinces.  That is an unintended consequence 
of this bill.  It is inherently unfair but it is what comes when 
we have a politically manipulated, artificial equalization system 
that is there largely for political ends and purposes rather than 
for a real attempt at equalization of incomes across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After decades of unfairness and the unintended consequences that 
I have talked about, because this policy has been in place for 
decades, we would think the government would be willing to look 
at a new idea, something different, something that completely 
breaks away from the past because the past is demonstrated as a 
failure over and over again. But no, the government cannot.  It 
stands with its back toward the future, gazing serenely at the 
failed policy fields of the past and it thinks if it could just 
tinker with it a little, if it could move these few words over 
here and change that clause over there, it would somehow turn 
this all around and make it fair, make it equitable and make it 
work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Frankly, I think that is the main reason why the government does 
not wish to have any more scrutiny or debate in the House than it 
has to with time allocation.  It does not legitimately want to 
have the average Canadian taxpayer exposed to its own failures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that it is these kinds of government interventions 
that are inherently unfair, that are premised on political 
advantage and not on truly trying to do the right thing which 
lead to divisions in this country.  It is one of things that 
drove me to politics.  I was annoyed by the continued 
manipulation of the federal government and how that affected me 
as a taxpayer in British Columbia and how it affected my family, 
my friends and my co-workers, how it affected all British 
Columbians. It was one of the reasons I got into politics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I never had any intention of being here.  I never had a lifelong 
wish to be a member of parliament.  I never graduated from high 
school with a burning passion and desire to be a politician.  I 
came here because of this kind of nonsense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot for the life of me understand why the Liberals just do 
not get it.  They just do not want to face reality.  They just do 
not want to face the fact that what they have cobbled together 
years and years ago, tinkered with and played with over decades 
is not working and is driving Canadians to distraction. It has 
driven me to politics.  It is the kind of policy that is in part 
responsible for the creation of the Reform Party of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would argue that the Liberal government has not demonstrated 
any capacity for change.  I do not believe that with this 
administration we will see any new ideas come forward. 
It has a legislative agenda that is almost barren.  Yet it does 
not want to give it full and proper debate in the House of 
Commons.

intending to speak this afternoon, but with the inanities—there 
is no other word for it—put forward by some of my colleagues, 
no doubt in good faith—I would not cast aspersions on their 
good faith—I must rise and correct a number of things.  This 
debate could be very technical, but the remarks that have been 
made are not technical but demagoguery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Among other things, they are saying that Quebec would not be in 
a situation of having to receive transfer or equalization 
payments if its economy were in a better state.  And then, 
without further explanation, just like that, they say “Well, 
that will come later, once sovereignty has been gotten rid of”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Confederation was born in 1867, 132 years ago. 
Quebec was born 400 years ago.  In the 132 years since 
Confederation, Quebec has never been as rich as Ontario.  It is 
not alone in that.  The maritimes, the Atlantic provinces were 
flourishing financially some 100 years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Institutions in Halifax, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island 
were doing well.  But the decision making centres moved to 
Ontario, as if by magic, by some miracle, and Toronto started 
expanding. 
So, why is this? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it because the people of Toronto, the people of Ontario, are 
particularly smart and those in the Atlantic provinces and 
Quebec less so?  Is it because we are not good at business?  Is 
it because we have not been blessed with Ontarians' special 
know-how?  Absolutely not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is because the federal system in which we live has 
deliberately and systematically made sure that the rules favour 
Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give a very simple example, one mentioned several times 
by the Prime Minister here in the House:  calls for tender are 
designed to favour the lowest bidder. 
So, when the government does most of its buying here in Ottawa 
and Ontario, naturally the closest suppliers have a better 
chance of putting in the lowest bid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How could someone from St. John's, Newfoundland, bid on 
supplying office furniture here in Ottawa?  There are all the 
transportation costs to factor in.  But the folks in St. John's, 
Newfoundland, pay taxes just like us.  The federal government 
uses these taxes to give Ontario businesses a leg up in the 
manufacture of goods or the delivery of services.  That is the 
fact of the matter.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The so-called poor provinces are not poor because the people who 
live there are less innovative, inventive, entrepreneurial, 
courageous or intelligent; they are poor because the system 
siphons off money to the centre of this nation, of this 
confederation, or in others words here to Ontario, and 
compensates for this by paying out, as a sort of apology, 
transfer payments and equalization payments.  Our money has been 
stolen—stolen is a big word—our money has been made off with and 
taxed, and instead of getting it back in the form of goods and 
services purchased, we get it back in the form of kind 
generosity, charity, transfer payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Transfer payments are not charity, it is a return of the taxes 
we have paid, which ought to have come back to us in the form of 
job creation but instead take the form of payments to the 
government in order to provide services to the population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is something seriously wrong here.  My colleague here 
pointed out that contracts are being awarded in Ontario without 
bidding, up to $150,000 a shot.  This is a considerable amount 
of money, which would enable businesses in the Atlantic 
provinces, in Quebec and elsewhere—the prairie provinces for 
instance—to get people working with the tax money that they pay, 
instead of seeing it go to pay for federal propaganda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Coderre:</B> You are opposed to mobility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye:</B> When the hon. member for Bourassa singles 
out the sovereignist movement as one of the causes of our 
economic problems, he is totally wrong. 
For several years—between 1985 and 1993 or 1994—Premier Robert 
Bourassa had control of Quebec's destiny.  His was a federalist 
Liberal government.  In the course of that period, Mr. Bourassa 
managed to cut jobs in Quebec by a net figure of 1,000 jobs.  On 
the other hand, when the PQ government came to power, first 
under Mr. Parizeau and now with Mr. Bouchard, it created over 
100,000 jobs in a shorter period of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is structural.  It arises from the fact that the 
Canadian federation is based on the impoverishment of the 
provinces surrounding Ontario, with Ontario getting the biggest 
slice of the pie.  It has been that way for 130 years, it 
continues, and so long as we remain in this system, there is no 
way out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, it is time to stop telling us that transfer payments are 
charity.  All we want is what we are entitled to, nothing more, 
nothing less.  But the bottom line is that the only way to put 
an end to this dispute, this gross misunderstanding, is for 
Quebec to acquire its sovereignty and have full control over its 
entire economy.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
member of the Reform Party who spoke previously said that revenue 
from hydro power is not equalized and is not included in the 
equalization formula.  Once again the member is wrong and the 
party is wrong.  It is included in both those ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a couple of comments for my colleague from the Bloc. We 
on this side have certainly stressed that anyone who knows 
anything about the equalization program knows that it is not a 
form of charity.  This equalization program, through which moneys 
are transferred from parts of the country that are technically at 
that particular time so-called have provinces to the other parts, 
is designed to make the country more efficient.  It is not a form 
of charity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have said earlier today and as others have said, there are 
all sorts of flows from one province to another province. 
British Columbia benefits from the maritimes.  The maritimes 
benefit from British Columbia.  Saskatchewan benefits from 
Newfoundland.  Newfoundland benefits from Saskatchewan and so on. 
It is not a form of charity.

</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the Bloc member's remarks about Ontario and 
places on the periphery of Ontario, I heard him say that in some 
way people asked for tenders on contracts and the nearer bidders 
had some great advantage.  There are parts of Ontario which are a 
two day drive by truck, if it is a truck type contract, from 
where we stand today or a day and a half drive from Toronto.  The 
main population of the province of Quebec is a five hour drive 
from Toronto and an hour and a half or a two hour drive from 
Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On this business of where is the periphery, if we think in some 
way where the centre of gravity of the population of Canada is, 
it is in southern Quebec and southern Ontario.  If people have 
concerns about being on the periphery perhaps they are elsewhere. 
Those things are beside the point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind members and people watching the debate that what we are 
discussing today is the equalization program, the program under 
which moneys each year are transferred from some parts of the 
country to other parts.  This equalization program is one of the 
cornerstones of the way we share wealth in Canada and of the ways 
in which we make Confederation work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are debating it now because every five years the way we do 
this is subject to major review.  That review involves all the 
players, all the provinces, whether they be have or have not.  In 
this case the discussions have been going on for two years and 
the decisions have to be made by March 31.  We are doing it now 
with a view to establishing what this program should be like this 
year and for the next five years.  It has to be done by March 31, 
which is why we are going through this trouble. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The thing that shocks me is that I hear literally combined 
opposition from the Reform Party and the Bloc.  It concerns me. I 
think there should be criticism.  That is the purpose of the 
debate.  We should air all these issues.  Members come from every 
part of the country.  They have had the opportunity to talk to 
their provincial colleagues and hear what they think and what 
they have said during the two years of negotiation.  They can 
come to the House and present those views. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I sense is that we have here two parties that are not 
interested in the effective running of Confederation.  I think 
that is because they underestimate the nature and the strength of 
the wonderful country we live in and the way that it functions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have is unique.  Perhaps there is one other jurisdiction 
which could be compared to it.  We have the strongest 
decentralized democracy in the world.  We have strong, however we 
define strong, provincial governments and regional governments. 
Even our territorial governments are becoming stronger and 
stronger year by year, giving their people a voice in their 
regions and in the country as a whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This decentralized democracy, our Confederation, is one of our 
great strengths.  It is based on all sorts of things.  One is our 
Constitution.  Another is constant flows in federal-provincial 
relations.  At the present time we have the social union, an 
agreement to which the premiers and the Prime Minister have just 
agreed.  It is the latest round in how we should run 
Confederation in those particular respects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I like the fact that mobility was emphasized this time.  There 
are advantages to having regional governments, but that should be 
balanced against having proper flows of students, workers and 
others between different parts of the country.  There are huge 
benefits from Confederation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The regions can benefit from the strength of the whole.  A 
recent very simple example of that is that the federal government 
has just put every elementary school and high school on the 
Internet, many years before that same situation is achieved in 
the United States.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I accept the fact that elementary and high schools are under the 
jurisdiction of the provinces and territories.  No one objects to 
the fact that the only government in the country that could very 
quickly modernize our schools and get them onto the Internet is 
the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is an example of the parts benefiting from the whole.  The 
resources of the whole can be brought to bear on this small but 
very important thing in an area by the way of traditional 
provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole can also benefit from the parts.  In some ways the 
members from Quebec, for example, describe the equalization as 
charity and feel somehow beholden to the centre, but the flows 
are in both directions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this country we had the huge advantage when health care came 
in of having one province, Saskatchewan, that had implemented a 
universal health care program, had run and tested it.  I have no 
doubt it made mistakes and modified it so that when the whole 
country came to the idea it might want a health care system all 
it had to do within its own jurisdiction was look at one part for 
a working model already tested that the whole country could take. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know, despite the problems there have been in recent years, 
the success that health care program has been.  I suggest there 
are many other examples of the whole benefiting from the parts 
and I can discuss those at another time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This equalization program is one of the cornerstones of this 
country.  It has played a major role in defining our wonderful 
federation.  The equalization ensures that all provinces have the 
resources needed to provide reasonably comparable services to 
Canadians no matter where they live.  My colleagues have stressed 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Equalization is an unconditional federal payment.  Once the 
money is transferred the provinces can use it any way they wish. 
Given the time constraints, that this must be decided by the end 
of March, I urge all members of the House to support this 
legislation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK212"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, we 
are getting close to the end of this debate today because 
unfortunately we are experiencing time allocation by this 
government.  This is the 46th time the government has time 
allocated a bill in this place since I have been here, 46 times 
it has said debate is a bad thing in this place, it must be shut 
down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It can be seen why.  It is such a small bill involving only $43 
billion in transfers to the provinces over the next five years. 
The government has had five years to prepare for this bill.  What 
has it ended up with?  It has no draft legislation to show to us 
ahead of time, no academic input into potential changes or 
improvement, no committee investigations or public input as to 
whether people want to keep the old system or the new system or 
some changed version.  There has been no debate in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There will be $43 billion in transfers over the next five years 
and we are allowed one day of debate.  That is a shame and it is 
a shame we will come to the end of this debate.  People watching 
should know that at the end of today we will have a vote on this 
and it will be rammed through.  My prediction is that the 
Liberals will win the vote, as they usually do, and they will say 
no debate because that is the way it should be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It reminds me of a debate in British Columbia a few years ago 
when Bill Bennett went on the road.  Colleagues from British 
Columbia will remember.  When he went on the road the rallying 
cry was not a dime without debate because the government had 
arrived at this stage where the arrogance set in to the point 
where it said it is only $43 billion, let us have one day of 
debate and shut it down.  That is what we are experiencing here 
today.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Equalization is an important issue.  It is, as has been 
mentioned on both sides of the House, a cornerstone issue for 
many Canadians and many provinces that want to see some semblance 
of ensuring the people who live in a province that is going 
through some tough times or that does not have the revenue its 
needs deserve some chance of equalization so they can enjoy 
something close to the same services other Canadians enjoy.  I 
have no problem with that.  That is not a bad theory if that is 
the initial theory you are going to head off on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I only have this 10 minute slot to talk, but not about the 
equalization payments per se because that is not really the big 
problem, that is not what gets under people's skin so much.  The 
problem is that it is all the other inequities, the 
inequalization payments that occur day after day in the 
departmental spending and in the program spending of this 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it that when the fishermen are denied the opportunity to 
fish on the east coast the government puts together the TAGS 
program, a social benefit program amounting to $3 billion for 
east coast fishermen, but on the west coast the federal 
government does not even allocate 10% of what is allocated on the 
east coast?  That is called an inequalization program.  It is not 
equal for both fishermen.  Both fishermen are unemployed, both 
are in their coastal communities, both need some assistance to 
adjust to whatever the new reality of the fishery minister might 
be.  Instead what happens?  Ten per cent for B.C. compared to 
Atlantic Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happens when the government allocates the CIDA contracts in 
this country?  CIDA contracts are not part of the equalization 
program but why is it that when the CIDA contracts come through, 
British Columbia gets 3% of those contracts although it has 10% 
or 11% of the population of the land?  The CIDA contracts are 
worth hundreds of millions of dollars a year and the majority of 
them go in this case to the province of Quebec.  What is going 
on?   Why does 3% go to B.C. while the lion's share goes to 
Quebec?  That is not part of equalization.  That is an inequality 
payment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why from the beginning the Reform Party has maintained 
in its policies that programs should go through a regional 
fairness test.  That is not so the west gets more, heaven forbid, 
but so that each region knows it will be dealt with fairly in 
terms of social programs and other government spending.  It will 
not be allocated based on who you voted for last but on regional 
fairness.  That is the way it should be done.  That is true 
equality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I went to a hockey game a while ago. There was a big brouhaha 
from the government.  It was trying to decide how it could help 
out the hockey teams in this land. It is interesting.  In one way 
the government did help.  It gave some direct assistance to the 
Ottawa Senators and its establishment and to the Montreal 
Canadiens.  They got Canadian logos and Canadian government 
advertising in their arena.  It cost hundreds of thousands of 
dollars a year.  But where did they not get any help?  Calgary, 
Edmonton and Vancouver.  Not a single sou went to help out with 
any advertising.  Again, is it fair that one group gets it and 
another does not?  It is not fair.  It should go through a 
regional fairness test.  If you are going to promote the 
Government of Canada in hockey arenas and if you can believe 
anybody thinks that is a good idea, then certainly it is as good 
an idea in Vancouver as it is in Ottawa or Montreal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government spent to $2 million to promote Canadian 
athletes going to Nagano.  I do not think that was a bad idea. We 
should be proud of our athletes.  I do not mind.  I would rather 
give the money to the athletes but even so we promote the 
Olympics.  Why were over half the ads placed only on French 
language television stations in Quebec?  Why do half the ads go 
there when only a quarter of the population is there?  How much 
did my region of the country get?  Where is the regional fairness 
test?  It is not there.  It is part of the inequality of the 
federation that is not addressed.

while fairly new buildings start to crumple?  It has been four 
years now since they have turned the heat off and walked away. 
No development can take place.  No industrial work, no sale to 
local developers, no land to the natives, nothing. It is just 
frozen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why?  It is in British Columbia.  After all, we do not even have 
an land forces base in the entire province of British Columbia. 
Regional fairness would dictate that British Columbia should 
somehow be just shunted aside. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem with the equalization payments is not the 
equalization payments but all the other boondoggles that the 
federal government is involved with.  Why is it that when we 
dealt with the child pornography case a week ago in this place, 
the government said the child pornography case only applies in 
British Columbia.  The law is still really good in the other nine 
provinces.  So if the pedophiles go free it will only be in 
British Columbia.  So don't worry, it is only in British 
Columbia.  That is part of the attitude on that side of the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They came two weeks ago to my riding on a western fact finding 
mission headed up by somebody from Winnipeg, I think, which to 
them is as far west as one can go.  They do not realize that the 
Rocky Mountains are not the end of the country, that there is 
actually another province there.  They came out to my riding and 
said the following what about the future of the CFB Chilliwack 
lands?.  The response was does your member of parliament know 
that it has been closed?  This was said by the secretary of state 
for women's issues.  They said to her in a very kind way yes, he 
does know.  Yes, he has been fighting for fairness for our region 
the same as any other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Liberals come to town and say by the way, sorry about 
this, we didn't even know it was closed, people in British 
Columbia are saying that the issue is not just about 
equalization, it is about the unequal treatment of some portions 
of country often based strictly on who one votes for.  That is 
not the way to run a country and not the way to bring regional 
fairness.  It is the way to create inequality.  If that was the 
object, the Liberals have succeeded masterfully.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise in the House today to debate this 
very important issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly the residents of Waterloo—Wellington and indeed 
Canadians no matter where they live have a great interest in this 
matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The equalization program is an underlying value of what it means 
to be Canadian.  It is a cornerstone of the country, one which 
people recognize and rely on in terms of what it means to be 
Canadian.  It is a sense of sharing, caring and ensuring fairness 
across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over time and through history the equalization program has 
indeed played a major role in Canada and it can be argued has 
played a major role in defining our federation.  I suspect and 
Canadians know our federation is stronger as a result, our 
federation is better off as a result and our people have 
benefited as a result.  As a result of that, Canada has gained 
tremendously and I think that is important to know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want all members to know that it is important that we act 
today to deal with this matter.  We have had a deadline to meet 
and as a result are using time allocation to ensure that we meet 
that deadline of March 31. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not surprised the Reform Party and the Bloc do not support 
the equalization program.  It is not surprising because both 
parties, quite frankly, do not want to see the federation work. 
Rather, both are committed to seeing that Canada does not work. 
That is really a shame but it is the reality of what we have here 
not only in the House of Commons but in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The equalization program ensures that all provinces have the 
resources they need to do what Canadians, wherever they live, 
want in terms of reasonable and comparable services. 
This is done so that hopefully they do not have to resort to 
higher levels of taxation than in other provinces.  While this 
does not always happen it certainly is a goal and a laudable one 
at that.

<A HREF="#LINKT67"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should also point out that the equalization program is an 
unconditional federal payment.  This enables provinces to use the 
equalization program as they see fit and as they wish.  That too 
is an important point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seven provinces receive the equalization program:  Newfoundland, 
Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Quebec, 
Manitoba and Saskatchewan.  They all qualify for this very 
important payment.  That is something that bodes well for the 
country as a whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed legislation, which is excellent I might point out, 
will renew the equalization program for a five year period, 
beginning April 1, 1999 to March 31, 2004.  The basic structure 
of the equalization program will however remain as it, but the 
bill before us includes changes to ensure that it continues to 
measure the ability of provinces to raise revenues as accurately 
as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These improvements will increase the cost of the program by an 
estimated $242 million.  These changes too will be phased in over 
the five year period.  As a result of extensive consultation, 
which I believe underscores the fact that our federation works, 
the bill will change the ceiling and the floor provisions to 
protect against greater fluctuation.  This was done 
co-operatively and in a fashion and spirit in keeping with 
improving the federation for the benefit of all Canadians 
wherever they may live in this great country of ours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill renews the provincial personal income tax revenue 
guarantee program for the same five year period I spoke about. 
This is a key and important provision.  It protects those 
provinces participating in the tax collection agreements from any 
major revenue reductions that may be caused during the course of 
a year by changes in federal tax policy, as an example.  This is 
worthy of our attention and clearly something in the best 
interest of the participating provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally I want to outline that the budget tomorrow will provide 
new estimates of equalization.  We all know that in the 1998 
budget it was projected that equalization would amount to $8.5 
billion in 1998-99.  Official estimates showed an increase to 
$8.8 billion as released in October. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government recognizes that the country we live in is 
continually changing.  That is the reality of the Canadian 
community.  It is also a fact that we must change if we are 
going to survive as a society.  The federal government will 
continue to watch over the interests of all Canadians. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to simply say by way of conclusion that the legislation 
recognizes the importance of working co-operatively and in the 
best interest of all Canadians wherever they may live in Canada. 
It is legislation of great importance which underlies our 
commitment to making Canada work for all our citizens.  It is 
worthy of support and I would certainly ask all members of the 
House to support it accordingly.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, today we are debating Bill C-65, an act to amend the 
Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any time we hear the word fiscal it means money.  When we talk 
about money we mean our money as Canadian taxpayers.  Governments 
have no money of their own but they certainly make free with the 
money that we work to earn.  This involves large amounts of the 
money earned by hard working Canadian taxpayers.  That is the 
reason it is a very important debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the government has decided to cut off debate on the 
spending of billions of dollars of taxpayers money under the 
bill.  For some reason it feels that a mere day of debate is more 
than sufficient to explore the ins and outs of a very large 
expenditure of money.  Naturally the opposition disagrees 
vehemently with this as well it should.

<A HREF="#LINKT68"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole reason we are here is to enact laws and to administer 
the affairs of the country for the benefit of Canadians.  It is 
very difficult to do that job when government keeps cutting off 
debate and saying that it will do whatever it will do.  It does 
not really want to be confused with any facts or any suggestions 
for improving the course of action that it has already decided 
on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This topic not only is very important because it will be 
spending a great deal of money that we worked to earn.  It is 
also at the very heart of our federal system.  It involves the 
transfer of financial resources from the federal treasury, which 
is filled up by our taxes, to the provinces to allow them to deal 
with their responsibility to provide social programs and services 
to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These transfers not only include the equalization payments but 
also the payments to support health care, education, EI payments 
from the EI fund, regional grants and a host of smaller programs. 
The total transfers from the equalization component are close to 
$9 billion a year.  With all the other transfers to support 
social programs it is at least three times that.  We are talking 
about a very important element of the way our federation works. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the best resources I have found is a booklet by Paul 
Boothe, Professor of Economics at the University of Alberta, 
called “Finding A Balance:  Renewing Canadian Fiscal 
Federalism”.  This was produced in October 1998, just a few 
months ago.  It is very current and a very scholarly and lucid 
examination of the whole area of financial transfers within the 
federation.  I commend it to anyone who is trying to understand 
this complex and difficult area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Equalization is an important principle which makes the 
federation work.  It is a principle to which the official 
opposition, the Reform Party, is committed.  I make this point 
clearly and unequivocally.  Those who propose improved 
administration of equalization are often attacked—and we saw 
that this afternoon in the House—by those who lack the vision 
and courage to make needed improvements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is because the principle of equalization is so vital to a 
vigorous Canadian federation that we in parliament must ensure 
co-operation in a fair and effective process.  Equalization 
directly affects the security of important social programs such 
as health care and education.  Equalization directly affects the 
level of income left in the hands of Canadians and Canadian 
parents and families to meet the needs of our children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is a little background on equalization.  Before 
Confederation most of the provincial revenues came from customs 
and excise taxes.  With Confederation it became the exclusive 
purview of the federal government to levy customs and excise 
taxes.  Therefore the provinces did not have the money they 
needed to provide key services to their citizens that they were 
responsible to provide under the Constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under an important recommendation from the Rowell-Sirois 
commission in 1939 it was agreed that the federal government 
would institute a system of national adjustment grants for poorer 
provinces and that general transfers would be made to ensure that 
the provinces had enough revenue to fulfil their constitutional 
obligations without undue taxation.  These formal equalization 
payments began in 1957. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As many speakers on this side of the House have put forward, the 
transfers in support of services to Canadians have become an 
increasingly complex patchwork impacted by a multitude of diverse 
political and economic purposes.  The results, the transparency 
and the understandability of the whole area of the federation 
have become unnecessarily unfair and complex.

<A HREF="#LINKT69"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, for example, the provinces have access to per capita 
revenues equal to the potential average of five provinces to 
raise taxes, and this is based on 33 different tax bases.  With 
that simple explanation we see how complex this whole area has 
become. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To make equalization work clearly and equitably every province 
would need the same kind of tax system, but of course that is not 
the case.  They are all different.  What the federal government 
has done, what the legislation does, is impose an artificial 
hypothetical tax system trying to blend tax systems in 10 
different provinces on 33 different levels and obviously a real 
mess results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general has criticized the whole process.  In his 
1997 report he looked at only one of the 33 elements, property 
taxes which raises almost a quarter of the equalization payments. 
He pointed out that property tax rates vary from province to 
province.  Property assessment methods vary even between 
municipalities, let alone provinces.  Property assessments are 
infrequent and done in different years.  The auditor general said 
that it was just a guessing game. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997 the finance department acknowledged this problem which 
was brought before it by the auditor general.  It promised to do 
something about the problem.  In fact here is a quote of a 
promise it made to the auditor general: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The department expects to address this issue as part of the 
current equalization renewal process. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we are smack dab in the middle of the “current 
equalization renewal process”.  Does the bill say anything about 
the matter of property taxes and their calculation and how they 
are factored into the equalization payment?  No, it does not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet Liberal members opposite have the colossal nerve to stand in 
this place and say that this is a wonderful piece of legislation, 
that it is just ticking along fine.  After a few hours of letting 
the opposition bleat about it, it will go forward exactly as they 
envisioned, even though they have not kept a key promise made to 
the auditor general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of such problems in the equalization process are not 
addressed in the legislation.  My colleagues have been very 
eloquent in pointing out some of the anomalies and the ridiculous 
variations and variables in the way the whole program is 
delivered on behalf of Canadians.  It is a key program.  It is 
important to the proper working of our federation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge the House to examine the systemic changes, the changes to 
our equalization system, needed to deal realistically with the 
tax system and the difficulties that have been pointed out.  Let 
us build a better country through reasoned debate on these issues 
rather than simply sweep them under the closure carpet and move 
on with mere tinkering. 
<P><A NAME="LINK215"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Murray Calder (Dufferin—Peel—Wellington—Grey, 
Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, there seems to be a problem with 
members of the Reform Party on the other side of the floor.  Of 
course there is always a problem with them.  We are talking about 
social responsibility and every once in a while we have to 
redefine and describe for the Reform Party what the word social 
means. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Equalization payments are one of the cornerstones of Canada. 
This country is a family.  The children of the family that are 
better off than the ones that are not take care of each other. 
That is one of the things that has made this country unique 
worldwide.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened to today's debate and a number of points need to be 
clarified.  Questions were asked by members on the other side of 
the House which I want to do my best to answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard over and over again why time allocation?  One 
question that would lead into that is what does the bill do?  The 
legislation amends two programs covered by the Federal-Provincial 
Fiscal Arrangements Act, equalization and the provincial personal 
income tax review guarantee.  Both programs expire on March 31, 
1999.  Today is February 15, which means a month and a half from 
now we have to have something in place because these other two 
programs are going to expire.  There is a good reason right off 
the bat. Also, our flag is 34 years old today.  This is the 
importance of what we are talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before us is designed to extend the programs from April 
1, 1999 to March 31, 2004.  We are basically establishing a five 
year review.  There is nothing wrong with that. Things change in 
this country on a yearly basis, so why would we not have 
legislation in place that we can renew and review on a regular 
basis?  Five years seems to be a very good basis to set it on. 
That will allow the equalization payments to continue to be made 
and revenue guaranteed payments made as required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of points that the bill proposes to change in 
the equalization programs.  I will consider the three most 
important points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One ensures that the changes in the measurement of fiscal 
capacity, that is the provinces' ability to take and raise 
revenue, are provided for in the renewal and will be phased in 
over a five year period. It also amends the floor and ceiling 
provisions that protect provincial and federal governments from 
large and unexpected changes in the equalization entitlements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, it will amend and clarify the list of provincial 
revenues considered in measuring eligibility for equalization 
payments.  That is in addition to the amendments to the act.  The 
regulation will change and make adjustments to the measurement of 
the provinces' relative revenue raising capacity from different 
tax sources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another question I heard was how did the federal government 
decide on the contents of the equalization renewal package?  This 
is something the opposition should listen to.  The answer is that 
the federal and the provincial governments established priorities 
for the renewal in early 1997.  This is not just something the 
federal government came up with.  It is something we came up with 
in conjunction with the provincial governments.  It is another 
example of how the government tries its best to work with all the 
provinces to get the best deal possible for the whole country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I talked about family, and that is what it is all about.  This 
is the government doing its best for the family of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposals for the changes to the equalization program will 
have an anticipated cost of around $48 million in the budget year 
1999-2000.  That will rise to $242 million when it is fully 
phased in in the budget year 2003-04.  That is being put forward 
after extensive review of the issues with the provinces and the 
territories at the official and ministerial level. 
Again, there is extensive review with the provinces and the 
territories. We are not just doing this on our own.  We talk to 
them and find out what is the best way they think we should be 
doing it and we come to a compromise.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague across the way from the Conservative Party just 
does not understand that.  He just does not get it.  One of the 
reasons he is in the fifth party is because he just does not get 
it. If the hon. member would listen to what I am saying here, I 
will try to answer some more of his questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another question I have heard here in the House today is why are 
the changes being phased in rather than being implemented 
immediately.  The phase-in of changes is proposed in order to 
dampen the distributional impact across provinces over time and 
also to ensure that federal and provincial fiscal planners have 
sufficient time to adjust to the changes in a predictable, 
manageable way.  We are not going to say “There it is guys, deal 
with it”; we are saying “Here it is, it is coming.  This is how 
we want to change this after consulting with you”.  It gives the 
provincial ministers of finance a chance to adjust to it. It is a 
good old-fashioned family way of doing it.  It is logical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard other general questions today as to how 
equalization works.  It seems relatively straightforward. 
Equalization transfers are determined on the basis of a 
legislated formula. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the amount of revenue that each province could raise if 
it applied national average tax rates is calculated for revenue 
sources that provinces and their local governments typically 
levy.  The program currently includes around 30 tax bases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, each province's overall ability to raise revenues from 
these sources is compared to that of the five provinces making up 
a representative standard, an average.  Those provinces are 
Quebec, Ontario, and Manitoba for the member across the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  The member who likes the millennium fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Murray Calder:</B>  That is right.  And Saskatchewan and 
British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a province's total revenue raising ability falls short of 
this standard, its per capita revenues are raised to the standard 
level through the federal equalization payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams:</B>  I see. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Murray Calder:</B>  That is the way it is, and the member 
for Peterborough understands it now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams:</B>  If I can understand it, anybody can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Murray Calder:</B>  He is a Liberal and he is a very smart 
MP.  I can understand why he clicks into that so quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a provincial government's total revenue raising ability 
exceeds the standard, it obviously does not receive the 
equalization.  There we have that nice flat line where the ones 
that are making more, like Ontario, the industrial heartland of 
Canada, to the provinces that are experiencing problems, like 
Newfoundland, each one of those governments can come up with good 
solid government within their province and put forward good solid 
programs like all the 10 provinces in Canada do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another question is how do we produce new estimates of 
equalization and when do receiving provinces receive payments.  I 
do not have enough time to go into that so I will have to leave 
that to the next time we speak on this. 
<P><A NAME="LINK216"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
it is very interesting to listen to the Liberals go on and on and 
on trying to explain around the issue of time allocation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality nonetheless is that in the 35th parliament the 
Liberals used time allocation 35 times, 32 time allocation 
motions and three closure motions.  This is the same group of 
Liberals who while on this side of the House decried this kind of 
anti-democratic, dictatorial bullying tactic by the government of 
the day.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this the 36th parliament, there have been 11 time allocation 
motions. It is quite unconscionable.  It speaks to the management 
of the affairs of this House. The fact that this Liberal 
government is incapable of giving the House adequate time to put 
forward the concerns of the people of Canada over issues like 
this one is completely unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a management problem of the affairs of this House that has 
created this situation. We are being bullied into voting on 
second reading of this bill by 6.30 tonight. This is after only 
one day in the House.  After only one day we have to vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The expiry date was no surprise.  The expiry date of March 31 
has been a known quantity for five years.  Why could the Liberals 
not have managed the affairs of the House in such a way that we 
would have had an opportunity to debate this matter perhaps last 
fall or at least get it out into the open? We are not talking 
about nickels and dimes here.  We are talking about countless 
billions and billions and billions of taxpayers' dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The previous speaker, after having used the lame excuse that 
there is an expiry date that has to be met as an excuse for the 
time allocation, said that everything is fine because in fact 
there is a government to government decision making process. 
There again, that just shows the mentality of this government. 
It does not realize it has a responsibility to come to this 
House, to come to the members of this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I represent approximately 87,000 people in the southeast corner

able to speak on this bill in an intelligent way on behalf of the 
people in my constituency. The debate should be full and free 
flowing, hopefully with the government listening and taking some 
direction from the people whom I represent as I speak for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead what is going on is the Government of Canada is getting 
together with Brian Tobin and his government, getting together 
with Glen Clark and his government, getting together with Mike 
Harris and his government, so everything is fine because the 
governments have negotiated this.  The reference to this place, 
the reference to the House of Commons, the reference to 
parliament is inconsequential.  Parliament is being treated as a 
rubber stamp by this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stan Keyes:</B>  Oh, nonsense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott:</B>  The member says “Oh, nonsense”.  How 
else then, if we are not being treated as a rubber stamp, does 
the member explain the fact that we have had a one day time 
allocation on this and debate will be chopped off? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The management of this House works on the basis that the House 
leader and the government know they can whip their sheep into 
line. The sheep just stand and bleat on cue and the legislation 
gets through.  They know that is what is going to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was very appreciative of the member from Kamloops, a long time 
member of this House, an NDP member I should point out.  He stood 
and said that he believed in the principle of the bill.  He found 
a tremendous number of difficulties with the legislation but he 
believed in the principle of equalization to the point that he 
would recommend to his colleagues that on second reading, which 
is where we are right now, the NDP vote in favour of the bill 
passing to committee whereupon they could take care of the very 
serious problems that are in the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned that I have a very high regard for the member, but 
clearly he has a lot more faith in the parliamentary process 
currently in effect as stipulated by the Prime Minister and this 
government than I do.  In fact, if the government is going to be 
treating the House of Commons as a rubber stamp in this way, how 
can we have any confidence?

</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take a look at some of the realities that have already 
been mentioned by a few of my colleagues.  I do not believe that 
anybody has mentioned the interprovincial transfer of wealth for 
example in addition to the equalization program. I will state 
this again very clearly and very slowly so that the members can 
understand my English.  I will go one word at a time and tell 
them that the Reform Party is in favour of the concept of 
equalization.  We do see it as being one of the distinctives of 
being Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope all members caught that because that is a statement of 
fact as to where the Reform Party is coming from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, to equate our rejection of Bill C-65 in principle, to 
equate our rejection of the tinkering around the edges that Bill 
C-65 constitutes, to our somehow not being in favour of 
equalization is something that only a Liberal mind could create I 
am sure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us touch back on employment insurance.  On employment 
insurance in Canada in the so-called have provinces, people 
contributing to that, the individual workers or the corporations, 
for every $1 that they contribute to that they get pennies back 
out.  That is a statement of fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Newfoundlanders, on the other hand, under that program as it is 
presently constituted, for every $1 that they contribute get more 
than $3 back and so it is ranging down from Newfoundland, which 
is the most extreme, on down.  The point being that equalization 
is not the only interprovincial transfer of wealth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The major problem with this formula is that it does not take 
into account all the examples that my colleagues in the Reform 
Party have pointed out where there has been and continues to be a 
transfer of wealth from the so-called have provinces to the 
so-called have not provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been pointed, and it is worthy to remind members, that we 
have a situation, for example, in my constituency where the 
average per capita income is probably significantly less than the 
average per capita income of say Vancouver or Victoria just 
because of the type of constituency with a rural based economy, 
where we have families of four or more earning $20,000 or $30,000 
a year.  Those families are having money transferred to families 
in Newfoundland and in some of the maritime provinces that are 
earning over $100,000 a year.  This is the reality of the formula 
as it is presently constructed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know this may be the third or fourth time that I have said 
this but it seems to be going over the heads of my friends on the 
Liberal side.  The Reform Party believes in the concept of 
equalization because it is distinctive of Canadians that we do 
look after each other.  This is one of the things that we embrace 
as a nation and certainly one of the things we embrace as a 
party.  However, Bill C-65 simply tinkers around the edges, 
creates more confusion, creates more problems and, in effect, 
creates inequality when it is called a bill on equalization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to seek the unanimous consent of the House to move 
a motion to the effect that this House urge the government to

aircraft of the Global Express type produced by Bombardier to be

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, Bill C-65, 
which renews the equalization program, is renewing one of the 
cornerstones of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The equalization program has played a major role in defining the 
Canadian federation. It ensures that all provinces have the 
resources they need to provide reasonably comparable services to 
Canadians no matter where they live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Equalization is an unconditional federal payment.  Provinces can 
use it as they wish.  That is a basic outline of what the 
equalization bill is about but over the years and this year as in 
other years many questions have been raised about the system. Let 
us look at some of these questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some have asked if there is not a simpler approach by which to 
measure disparities among provinces.  Some have suggested for 
example a measure based on gross domestic product of each 
province.  One has to go back to the concept of the equalization 
program.  All provinces are to be brought up to a standard to 
enable them to provide comparable services at comparable levels 
of taxation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The calculation is based on a legislated formula that models 
typical provincial tax systems.  This formula is called a 
representative tax system.  The complexity of the program arises 
as a result of the complexity of provincial tax systems that are 
being modelled.  The representative tax system has proved to be a 
reliable and stable measure of provincial fiscal capacity, a 
measure that has widespread support as a fair and comprehensive 
approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The representative tax system uses around 30 tax bases to 
measure a province's relative capacity to raise revenues.  It 
might be possible to construct a simpler equalization formula 
that works satisfactorily and the federal and provincial 
governments will continue to evaluate and investigate alternative 
methods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One suggestion for a simpler approach has been to use GDP per 
capita as a measure to measure the provinces' fiscal capacities. 
But a great deal more research is necessary before considering an 
equalization based on a new approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another question is whether equalization creates disincentives 
to growth.  The government would respond that when a province's 
ability to raise revenues increases due to growth in that 
province equalization payments decline.  This was how the program 
was designed to work in the first place, but the equalization 
program is not a disincentive to provincial economic development. 
It would be difficult to imagine that a province would turn its 
back on opportunities to increase incomes and jobs for its people 
just because its equalization payments might decline. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party has raised the question of whether the proposed 
changes in Bill C-65 address all the recommendations on the topic 
made by the auditor general.  The auditor general's report 
discussed the design and operation of the equalization program 
and made a number of recommendations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the course of this renewal the federal government 
discussed all these recommendations with its provincial 
counterparts.  Many of those recommendations are being addressed 
through this bill such as those involving the resource tax bases 
and the ceiling design. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But other recommendations were more complex and it is felt by 
both federal and provincial governments that it needs more 
research and discussion, but both levels of government will 
continue this research and discussion once the program has been 
renewed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people have asked why not move to a ten province standard. 
This program is based on five provinces.  The purpose of 
equalization is to ensure provinces have sufficient revenues to 
provide reasonably comparable levels of services at reasonably 
comparable levels of taxation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current five province standard fully meets the federal 
government's constitutional commitment to make equalization 
payments and fully achieves the intended purpose.  The five 
province standard was introduced after the significant volatility 
in the resource sector in the 1970s.  These fluctuations 
generated large fluctuations in equalization entitlements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now the risk of volatility is lower with the five province 
standard than with the ten province standard which increased the 
potential for volatility. 
If implemented again, the ten province standard would add 
considerably to the cost of the program, an anticipated $1 
billion each year.

<A HREF="#LINKT75"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people are confused by the terms floor and ceiling.  The 
floor protects individual provinces against large declines in 
their equalization payments from one year to the next.  Some 
provinces criticize the current floor because the protection it 
offers could fluctuate by large amounts with relatively small 
changes in a province's economic situation. The proposed new 
floor in Bill C-65 provides a similar level of protection to the 
current floor but will not be subject to the same variations 
which have been criticized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about the ceiling?  The purpose of the ceiling is to 
protect the federal government from unsustainable large increases 
in equalization expenditures.  The current ceiling limits the 
total size of the program to an amount equal to the 1992 
equalization entitlements increased each year by the growth of 
GDP between 1992 and the year in question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whenever the size of the program exceeds the ceiling the program 
standard is reduced, lowering each province's entitlement.  In 
1998-99 the ceiling is about $10.4 billion, about $1.2 billion 
higher than the entitlement.  The proposed new ceiling would be 
set at $10 billion in the years 1999-2000.  Like the current 
ceiling, it will grow in subsequent years by GDP growth rate. 
Receiving provinces have argued for the removal of the ceiling. 
The federal government has indicated that the ceiling is 
essential to ensure the program remains affordable and 
sustainable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some have asked why the lottery and gaming revenues base is 
changing.  The current measure of a province's ability to raise 
revenues from this source of revenue is based solely on lottery 
ticket sales in the province.  However, significant changes have 
occurred over the years in the lottery and gaming area.  The 
federal government is proposing changes to the equalization 
program that will take into consideration all types of gaming 
activity and their revenue.  The proposed changes will recognize 
provinces' abilities to raise revenues from new and rapidly 
growing sources, for example casinos, video lottery terminals, 
break open tickets and other games of chance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some have asked why the equalization formula does not take into 
account the different expenditure needs.  The answer is that the 
federal government has undertaken a number of studies to examine 
various measures of expenditure needs.  Both levels of government 
concluded that there were too many issues that needed to be 
resolved before expenditure need could be incorporated into 
equalization such as how to decide what expenditures are needed. 
The federal and provincial governments will continue to study the 
issues surrounding the measurement of need and the inclusion of 
such measurement in equalization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new bill addresses most of the questions that have been 
raised.  It must be remembered by all members that the agreements 
reached at these five year renewal periods are agreements that 
have taken a long time to hammer out between federal and 
provincial representatives.  They have agreed.  Before us in the 
House now is the result of much of that work.  Each amendment 
reflects an agreement that has been concluded between 
representatives of all levels of government.  I hope the House 
will respect the work our colleagues in the provincial houses 
have put into this and which our own representatives have agreed 
to. 
<P><A NAME="LINK218"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
enter this debate from a rather different point of view.  So far 
we have heard all kinds of criticisms of the bill.  I have some 
of those to advance. But I would like to underscore the Reform 
Party position that we do support the concept of equalization 
payments from the richer provinces to the poorer provinces.  I 
underscore that we do this and the kind of reforms we are 
considering in the whole business of equalization payments.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is one thing to suggest that there have been five years of 
consultation among provinces, that there have been five years of 
discussion about the various amendments which have found their 
way into the proposed bill before the House.  Whether or not that 
actually happened I do not know.  The important thing I do know 
is that within less than 48 hours of consultation in the House 
and open debate we will be forced to make a decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know what else went on behind closed doors.  We have to 
accept that hon. members opposite are telling us the way things 
were.  One thing is also true: we in the House have a 
responsibility to reflect upon those kinds of amendments and to 
think carefully about them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lest anyone misinterpret or misrepresent what the Reform Party 
stands for, let it be abundantly clear that we support 
equalization payments.  We would like to suggest some reforms and 
changes that could be made which are not found in the current 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform believes in a system that is open to all Canadians and 
uses a different, simpler basis for comparison.  That is part of 
the issue.  It should be a different, simpler and a more accurate 
and more honest comparison of people.  Rather than micro managing 
equalization, which the current legislation and program do and 
what the proposed legislation maintains, we should use a simple 
indicator to determine who gets what.  This is called a macro 
formula. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A shortfall in per capital provincial GDP as an indicator might 
be a good basis for comparison that would not require arbitrary 
definitions and an army of bureaucrats to apply them.  That is a 
fundamental issue and one that we should address very carefully. 
It is this kind of thing that we should have concentrated on and 
debated in the next while.  It is one thing to have a bill 
proposed to us, but is there nothing else that could be done? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a lot that could be done.  Using such a macro formula 
would eliminate the incentive for provinces to adjust their tax 
bases in inefficient ways to qualify for more federal money.  We 
cannot adjust an entire GDP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under a single indicator system equalization would be more 
focused on the provinces that need it most.  It would be hard to 
argue that we have seven have not provinces in Canada.  Canada is 
one of the richest countries in the world.  That is abundantly 
clear.  All we need to do is look at the population figures to 
see how many people have come into Canada compared to the number 
of people who have left Canada.  In the last 25 years there has 
been no mass exodus or out-migration from Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By focusing benefits more on the poorer provinces the federal 
government could reduce overall taxation, leave the money in 
people's pockets and thereby increase economic efficiency.  That 
is what we are all about.  Any province that experiences reduced 
payments would receive special financing to ease the transition. 
These ideas are worthy of discussion.  They have been discussed. 
My colleague from Calgary—Nose Hill indicated that and quoted 
from a particular study. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes on from there.  I will get very specific on what has 
happened.  In the current situation the average Canadian family 
is a net contributor of $3,500 to the federal treasury.  A family 
in Saskatchewan pays $2,700 and an Alberta family, more than 
$6,000.  On the other hand the average family in Newfoundland 
gains $7,000 per year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To reduce this kind of unfairness the Reform Party has proposed 
a new Canada act.  In this act we call for two basic reforms: 
first, an equal treatment of all citizens with per capita grants 
to provinces for shared cost programs and, second, a single 
equalization grant based on a macro indicator of per capita 
provincial GDP compared to per capita national GDP.  If that is 
the kind of focus to which we would address ourselves we would be 
moving forward.  We would be taking into account the changes that 
have taken place in Canada and the changes that have taken place 
in the world around us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>May I draw the attention of the House to a couple of things that 
have happened in Canada in terms of the GDP.  I want to compare 
population increases and decreases to the GDP.  We will look at 
the last four years, 1994 to 1998. 
We find that Canada had a net increase in its population of 
4.35%.  Newfoundland had a decrease of 5.5%, Ontario an increase 
of 5.3%, Alberta an increase of 7.7%, British Columbia an 
increase of 9.03%, and Yukon an increase of 5.3%.  Those are the 
provinces with the greater gain. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1805"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT77"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us compare the gain relative to the GDP in those provinces. 
Here is what we discovered, using the numbers for 1993 to 1997. 
Prince Edward Island had an increase in its GDP of 19.9%, Ontario 
an increase of 19%, Saskatchewan an increase of 23.6%, Alberta an 
increase of 26.07%, and British Columbia an increase of 16.96%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we begin to compare the increases in GDP in this four year 
period, compared with the population shifts that have taken 
place, we recognize very clearly that there is an unfairness 
built right into the formula which currently determines the 
amount of the equalization payments.  That unfairness needs to be 
eliminated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The formula is so complicated that it takes an army of 
bureaucrats to compute them and it makes it almost impossible for 
anybody to understand exactly how it works.  I dare say a lot of 
people who put forward these amendments do not recognize or 
understand fully the implications that will take place in their 
particular provinces and the country as a whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to recognize as well that the composition of population 
has changed dramatically.  We do not have the same kind of 
population composition in Toronto today that existed there 20 
years ago.  All we need to do is look at the changes in retail 
marketing that have taken place in those marketplaces to 
recognize those that have not changed with the times are 
experiencing very serious financial difficulties at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is exactly the kind of thing we as a country need to 
address.  We need to recognize that the composition of our 
population has changed.  It has shifted from one part of the 
country to another part of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in British Columbia are now experiencing a major shift of 
populations into the province.  If we compare the increase in GDP 
in British Columbia and the GDP increase in Ontario or in 
Alberta, we discover that the GDP has not increased nearly to the 
same degree in British Columbia as it did in these other 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This should tell us something.  In fact it tells us a lot. If 
the government is determined that one part of the country shall 
be preferred over another part of the country, indeed the formula 
can be adjusted in such a way that it can be politically 
manipulated so that it will grant to some and take away from 
others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does it do?  What has happened here is really interesting. 
If we take, for example, the people in Prince Edward Island and 
Newfoundland, they have had a 20% increase over and above what 
they pay into the revenues for Canada.  The program services they 
receive are 20% more than they contribute into the treasury.  In 
Alberta it is the other way around. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Alberta there is a 9% decrease in the amount of services and 
product the people get and the money they pay in.  In other 
words, there is a deficit in the government services received by 
Alberta people and there is a surplus in Newfoundland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps there should be some of this sort of thing, but it is 
interesting that this happens to people at the lowest end of the 
income bracket.  These are $20,000 to $30,000 people who get 9% 
less in government services in Alberta and get 20% more in 
Newfoundland.  That is unfair.

changes to the equalization program?  None.  Does any member of

</I></B></P><P align=left>For members opposite I will try to explain that a co-ordinated 
team effort produced this cornerstone of the Canadian federation 
called the equalization program.  Many of my colleagues on this 
side of the House have articulated the definition of the program, 
the manner of payment in the program, the basic structure of the 
program and the positive constructive improvements which will 
increase the cost of the equalization program.

that he would strike out on the details of the equalization 
program.  Did he address the fact that the program includes 
changes to the ceiling and floor provisions of the equalization 
program?  I heard it on this side of the House.  It will protect 
against unusually large fluctuations in equalization transfers. 
Was that addressed by members of the Reform Party? No, they did 
not touch on that.

equalization in 1998-99 would amount to $8.5 million.  The last 
official estimates released last October showed an increase to

$8.8 billion?  Did they examine the equalization program and its 
importance to the country?  No, they did not.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Kelowna stood in his place with righteous 
indignation.  Did he speak to the issue of the equalization 
program?  No, he did not do that.  Did the member for Kelowna or 
the member for Kootenay—Columbia address the specifics of the 
equalization program?  No.  Did members opposite in the Reform 
Party want days to discuss the equalization program?  Yes.  Are 
they going to discuss the issues?  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Kelowna talks about his party's policy on the 
equalization program.  Maybe the hon. member could save that 
debate for his united alternative meeting this weekend because 
there is a policy on equalization in the country and it is 
working terrifically well.  It has been examined for two years by 
federal and provincial representatives.  Does the member want to 
attack the issue at hand?  Does he want to look at all the points 
that are important to the equalization program?  No, he does not. 
To his constituents in Kelowna I apologize on behalf of the 
member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand my time is up.  I appreciate the opportunity to 
contribute to the debate and to show how government members are 
trying to articulate the importance of this cornerstone of the 
federation.

</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK223"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie—Bathurst, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, on November 
23, 1998, I rose in this House to speak of the 4,000 workers on 
Prince Edward Island who were forced to wait six weeks to 
qualify for employment insurance or to receive benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The response by the Minister of Human Resources Development 
sidestepped the question entirely.  He said, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I keep saying is that this reform has been such an 
important one for Canadians that we as a government will monitor 
very closely its impact and we will make the right changes when 
they need to be made, as we did not too long ago with the small 
weeks to address the concerns of my Atlantic colleagues. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I never said anything about small weeks.  I spoke about the 
4,000 workers on Prince Edward Island who were forced to wait 
six weeks before receiving EI benefits.  That shows how much the 
Minister of Human Resources Development is out of touch with the 
real problems people are facing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his response, he also spoke of the “gappers”.  I did not say 
anything about “gappers”. 
I was speaking about people who have had to wait six weeks for 
an employment insurance cheque. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I got a letter from a lady who wrote “How is a person 
supposed to manage on a starvation income of $636 a month, when 
the rent is $400 and then there is the phone and the 
electricity, not to mention all the little payments that have to 
be made?  Food has to be paid for somehow”.  She continues “I 
often ask God to come and take me away.  I wonder what point 
there is in living, why we are put on earth to live in such 
misery.  Help us.  Urgently”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the kind of message I am hearing from all over.  Our 
people are suffering.  Canadians are suffering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister referred to “7,000 people in a black hole. 
Today, there are only 2,000”.  Only 2,000 suffering.  There are 
only 2,000 with no money coming in from January to May, whose 
refrigerators are empty and who are sending letters like those I 
have received from people telling me they want to kill 
themselves after 27 years of working in plants.  It is a 
disgrace that they are being treated like this by the Liberal 
government after 27 years of work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The members opposite should be ashamed because, when they were 
in opposition, they spoke out against the Progressive 
Conservative Party's UI cuts.  The hon. member for Saint-Maurice, 
the Liberal leader, said that the Progressive Conservatives were 
not attacking the real problem, which was the economy, 
preferring instead to go after unemployed Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member 
asked the question in the past and asked it again tonight about 
people waiting for their claims to be processed in Prince Edward 
Island. He claimed that 4,000 people had to wait for six weeks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We went back and looked at the records and in Prince Edward 
Island from April to October 1998 the average number of claims 
filed was about 2,000 per month.  Ninety-seven per cent of those 
entitled to EI received their first payment within 28 days. In my 
lexicon 28 days is not six weeks and is pretty good service to 
people who apply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His second point was about gappers.  He forgets to mention that 
seasonal workers or workers with irregular working patterns face 
particular issues with regard to accessing EI.  Some gappers are 
unable to find enough work so that the combination of work plus 
EI gets them through an entire year.  This problem is most 
prevalent in his province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are sensitive to the plight of seasonal workers, and a change 
to an hours based system benefits many who work very long hours 
during the work season.  The member has to understand that EI is 
not intended to be a regular income supplement and the Government 
of Canada prefers to put emphasis on creating additional 
employment to address this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have invested $2.1 billion in active employment measures and 
have renewed funding for the Canadian jobs fund which provides 
the most direct response to the gapper issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In New Brunswick alone the federal government has made $5 
million available directly for the gapper issue in partnership 
with that province.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, on October 22, I asked the former solicitor general to 
back away from any decision to implement the so-called alternate 
service delivery at the RCMP depot division training academy in 
Regina, in my riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Alternate service delivery or ASD, as it is called, is the 
latest bureaucratic buzzword for privatization, a bad policy of 
right wingers who do not believe government has or ought to have 
any role in providing public services.  We have lots of 
experience with privatization and right wingers in my province in 
Saskatchewan, lots of fiascos that I wish the federal government 
would try to learn from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Privatization is synonymous with lost jobs, higher costs, low 
wages and reduced services.  ASD or privatization has been tried 
in various federal government departments like CFB Goose Bay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is what happens.  The government fires you and then if you 
are one of the lucky 55% a subcontractor offers you your job back 
at about half the pay.  Privatization: jobs are lost, costs go 
up to the taxpayers, wages do down and public services are 
reduced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>ASD is being invoked as a potential money saver by this right 
wing Liberal government.  The Liberals believe they need to save 
money at the RCMP because the force's budget is in a management 
mess.  Things are so bad that when treasury board realized last 
October that the RCMP had apparently overspent its budget, 
treasury board would not release any more funds without 
undertaking a $1 million audit of the operation of the entire 
force by management consultants KPMG. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How bad a budget management problem do you need to justify 
spending $1 million on an audit?  The RCMP has a budget of $1.2 
billion.  By October it was overbudget by $11 million, mainly in 
B.C. and Alberta.  Ten million was transferred to B.C. from other 
divisions of the force, cadet training was frozen at the depot in 
Regina and other serious cuts in policing were implemented, 
leaving Canadians dangerously under protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now they are looking around for scapegoats and they have seized 
on the civilian workers at the depot as prime targets.  For the 
record, civilian services at the depot account for $1.9 million 
of the division's $40 million budget, or 4.75% of the salaries 
are for the support services by the public servants in that 
depot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I met with many of these workers who are concerned for their 
jobs and their families. They are also concerned about the RCMP 
and the credibility the force has.  They provide a dedicated and 
cost effective service to the depot division and the RCMP, a 
quality service that would be lost if plans for privatization 
proceed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These employees have already participated in one study of 
privatization, a study that proved privatization cost the force 
more money than if they had just kept the status quo.

price. If I were working at KPMG that is certainly where I would 
be looking first. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But in a rush to jump the gun on any other recommendations that 
KPMG might suggest, a last minute report from depot division 
management to old division headquarters in Ottawa is recommending 
that privatization be pushed ahead instead.  The report was not 
done by outside consultants but by area RCMP management.  It was 
based on out of date and incorrect information and in spite of 
claims that they consulted, the so-called consultants never 
actually consulted the affected workers.  It is strange but it is 
true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wrote to the President of the Treasury Board and the solicitor 
general last week based on further meetings with my constituents. 
I have asked them to hit the pause button on the drive to 
privatize and to make sure they receive and read the KPMG report 
before making any fundamental decisions like privatizing the 
civilian depot employees in Regina. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is no laughing matter for the civilian depot workers or 
their families and it is no laughing matter for me or the RCMP. I 
hope the parliamentary secretary can report to me today that 
there will be no new moves to privatize those civilian services 
and that any decisions about the depot will wait for the KPMG 
report.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby—Douglas, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, in late October last year the Minister of Foreign 
Affairs met with Timorese leader and Nobel prize winner José 
Ramos-Horta. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Ramos-Horta was in Canada to urge the Government of Canada 
to support the people of East Timor, in particular to support 
their right to self-determination and to an internationally 
supervised referendum on their future.  On that day I asked the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs what the position of the Government 
of Canada was with respect to support for East Timor's right to 
self-determination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately the Minister of Foreign Affairs did not come out 
in support of the right to self-determination.  In fact, there 
have been 10 votes at the United Nations since the brutal 
invasion by Indonesia of East Timor and the annexation in 1975 
and on not one of those votes has Canada supported the people of 
East Timor and their fundamental right to self-determination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier today in this House we spoke about the genocide in 
Armenia from 1915 to 1923.  There has been genocide in East Timor 
as well.  Since 1975 over 200,000 people, over one-third of the 
population, have lost their lives in the brutal repression and 
genocide that followed the occupation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The East Timorese people have carried out a valiant fight for 
independence.  We know that in 1991 hundreds of innocent marchers 
were massacred at a demonstration in Dili.  The documentation of 
human rights abuses by Amnesty International, the East Timor 
Human Rights Centre and the UN human rights commission is 
extensive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just in the last few months Yayasan Hak, a very reliable East 
Timorese NGO, has monitored complaints filed by victims of 
extrajudicial executions, detentions, torture and forced 
disappearances.  Over 7,000 refugees have been forced to leave 
their homes just in the last few months as a result of the terror 
and intimidation taking place there.

</I></B></P><P align=left>For too long the Canadian government has turned a blind eye to 
these abuses and instead placed the focus on establishing a cosy 
trade relationship with Suharto.  We saw that in spades at the 
APEC leaders summit in Vancouver in 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fall of General Suharto last May provided some hope but 
clearly it is essential that the international community provide 
support for the people of East Timor at this time.  I ask the 
Government of Canada today, I call on the Government of Canada to 
join in the growing call for a United Nations monitored 
peacekeeping force to oversee a referendum for 
self-determination.  I call on our government to provide support 
for a transitional administration to help the territory toward 
independence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Foreign Affairs spoke just last week at the 
security council about the importance of his human security 
agenda and the importance of protecting civilians in armed 
conflict.  What better place to apply those principles than in 
East Timor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call as well on the United Nations to dispatch a monitoring 
force to East Timor as soon as possible to oversee the disarming 
and disbanding of the paramilitaries, paramilitaries that are 
being actively armed and supported by the Indonesian army.  We 
want to see a reduction in occupying troops.  We want to see the 
protection of the population against further human rights abuses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge the secretary of state, who I see in the House today, to 
call for a permanent United Nations office in East Timor to 
support and co-ordinate these very important activities.  The 
time has come for Canada to play a positive role and to send a 
delegation to monitor the elections in East Timor and Indonesia. 
The people of East Timor have suffered long enough.  Canada has 
been silent long enough.  The time for justice is now. 
<P><A NAME="LINK230"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Raymond Chan (Secretary of State (Asia-Pacific), 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is not true that Canada has not paid 
attention to the human rights issue in East Timor. We have 
continuously monitored the situation and raised those concerns 
with the Indonesian government.  At the end of last year I paid a 
special visit to Indonesia on human rights issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada welcomes and is encouraged by indications that the 
negotiations in New York on the future of East Timor included 
discussions of ways of directly consulting the East Timorese 
people.  We maintain that the East Timorese should have a say in 
determining their future.  Now that East Timorese leader Xanana 
Gusmao has been moved from prison to house arrest, this will 
facilitate the consultation process with the East Timorese. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In October last year I personally visited Xanana Gusmao in 
prison.  He was very appreciative of Canada's efforts in East 
Timor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada is engaged in discussions with a number 
of countries regarding East Timor's future at this very pivotal 
time.  These countries include the main parties to discussions at 
the United Nations.  In this context, Canada is closely examining 
its position with a view to providing continuous support to the 
people of East Timor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is the third largest aid donor in East Timor and provides 
about $1.1 million annually through NGOs.  Canada has also 
regularly contributed to the All Inclusive Intra-East Timorese 
Dialogue.  Canada's ambassador to Indonesia visited East Timor in 
December, one aim of his visit being to explore options for 
further Canadian assistance in order to build indigenous capacity 
and further peace in East Timor.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, back 
in December I asked the government how it could in good 
conscience defend its record on poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the Liberal government homelessness is now a national 
disaster.  Poverty is a new growth industry as a result of 
Liberal policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1989 unanimous House of Commons resolution to eliminate 
child poverty is a mere echo as child poverty has now increased 
by approximately 50%.  The attack on the unemployed under the 
dreadful unemployment insurance program is a national disgrace. 
It is not just me who is saying this.  Even the United Nations 
has condemned Canada for lack of compliance with the UN covenant 
on social, economic and cultural rights.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recently completed a cross-Canada tour on homelessness. I saw 
for myself the awful circumstances that growing numbers of 
Canadians live in as a result of the federal government's 
abandonment of social housing in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ask the government:  If the Liberals are genuine about 
eliminating poverty, why is the government not indexing the child 
tax benefit?  Why is the government not ensuring that the child 
tax benefit goes to the poorest of the poor, the families on 
welfare? Why has this government ensured that income assistance 
is being cut across the country so that more and more people are 
living below the poverty line? If the government is genuine about 
eliminating poverty, why are the Liberals not ensuring that they 
return the UI program to its rightful owners, the unemployed 
workers of Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Liberal government is genuinely concerned about poverty, 
why have we not seen a commitment to build social housing in this 
country, something that has not happened since 1993?  Why have we 
not seen a commitment to live up to the UN covenant on social, 
economic and cultural rights? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, why does the government not heed its own report from 
the finance minister?  As an opposition MP in 1990 he said “The 
lack of affordable housing contributes to and accelerates the 
cycle of poverty which is reprehensible in a society as rich as 
ours”.  That was the now finance minister speaking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to know what is the commitment of this government to 
alleviate poverty in Canada? 
<P><A NAME="LINK233"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I applaud 
the member's dedication to and illustration of poverty in this 
country.  Certainly many members on this side of the House share 
that concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I do not think it is helpful to anyone in this House to 
always target and blame the actions of this government.  Nowhere 
in her remarks did I hear any recognition of some of the other 
social phenomena which exist in the 90s and indeed sometimes 
interact to exacerbate poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the technological revolution of which we are in the 
middle is putting us in a period of transition, a transition 
between the industrial age and the information age. Historically, 
social revolutions of this sort actually impede some people from 
moving forward.  Some people adjust quickly and prosper.  We are 
finding that today with the information workers who are training 
themselves upwards and are getting the good jobs with the high 
salaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Often in these periods other people find it difficult to adjust. 
It might be because of where they live or because of the level 
of their education. They fall behind.  This is simply part of the 
period of history we are in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member often talks about the change to our EI system and 
calls it a national disgrace.  Nowhere in her remarks have I 
heard an analysis of the new labour market and understanding that 
the work people do is changing.  All I hear is a nostalgic 
wishful thinking to go backward in time and bring back a system 
that was suitable for the 70s, not for the 90s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government is attempting to eliminate poverty. We are 
moving forward step by step as we have the dollars to afford the 
actions necessary.

<P><A NAME="LINK235"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to have the opportunity to clarify the exchange between 
the minister of Indian affairs and myself during question period 
on October 28, 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to preface my remarks by stating that I have been 
bombarded by aboriginal people begging for forensic audits on 
their reserves since that exchange in October.  Since that time I 
have realized that the confusion on this matter clearly lies in 
Ottawa with the department of Indian affairs which is making up 
the rules as it goes along. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By that I mean the department first stated that it refused to 
conduct investigations unless it is requested by the band 
leadership.  I guarantee that no leadership is going to ask to 
have themselves investigated. Then we heard in the department's 
own words that forensic audits are extremely expensive and time 
consuming and a request from a few upset band members would not 
be enough to warrant one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a message for the minister.  It is not just a few band 
members, it is hundreds, probably thousands.  I was just informed 
last Thursday that a list of 5,500 names from the Yukon to 
southern Alberta has been collected all asking for help with 
forensic audits. 
These people are living in buses, sitting on apple crates, 
freezing and starving in tarpaper shacks.  They are not being 
frivolous when they ask for forensic audits.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister talks of accountability, transparency and working 
in partnership.  She says she is reviewing the management 
practices of every first nation and that she is allowing the 
chief to set the minimum standards for accountability practices. 
Can she not see that this is the problem?  The grassroots people 
say that most chiefs and councils do not have the first clue on 
how to set standards of accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister claims that those who report financial 
mismanagement will lead to pitting members of the community 
against one another.  This is simply not true.  This will bring 
people together and put them all on a level playing field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The largest problem today is the fact that the department has 
repeatedly told the grassroots people that when they have 
documented proof of financial mismanagement by chief and council 
to report it to the RCMP. However, in a letter from the 
commissioner of the RCMP, Phil Murray, he very clearly 
contradicts this statement.  He says that in cases of 
misappropriation of band funds and/or assets, DIAND will 
initially review the allegations.  Should the department believe 
an investigation is warranted, it will refer the case to the RCMP 
for investigation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a few people on one reserve who managed to get hold of 
some documents.  They did those things very secretively. I would 
not disclose who they were because they would be in real trouble 
with their chief and council.  The documents were a list of 
social payments made to members of a band every month for two to 
three years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I looked at these documents and noticed that a few hundred 
dollars was being paid to the odd member from the band from time 
to time.  Then every month one or two names would get a cheque 
for $8,000, or $9,000, or $4,000. When I looked at that I 
wondered why those people would be getting so much compared to 
what the rest of them were on the lists.  Then they produced 
death certificates.  One of the people who were getting these 
cheques had been dead for 13 years. Not being an expert, I 
thought it looked a little suspicious that a dead person would be 
receiving that much money every month. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The band members and I went to the RCMP.  We showed them the 
documents and the RCMP agreed that there was probably something 
serious here.  The RCMP in turn sent it to commercial crimes in 
Edmonton which looked at it and notified me a few days later that 
there was insufficient evidence to carry on an investigation.  In 
other words the department must not have agreed to it and told 
the RCMP to back off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This whole system needs cleaning up.  I would encourage the 
member across the way who is going to respond to me that he get 
out and check with his Winnipeg Coalition for Accountability 
Group.  Let them explain the problems to him.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Iftody (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of

I am pleased to respond to the hon. member for Wild Rose on 
behalf of the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development 
concerning the forensic audits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For too long the solution has been to have the federal 
government come to the rescue and fix all the problems that 
emerge in and around the reserve communities.  We tried this 
approach and we know that having evaluated it in the past 50 
years it has not worked. The Royal Commission on Aboriginal 
Peoples sent us a message to change.  Today our approach is to 
work in partnership with first nations to build a plan that will 
create real change on behalf of aboriginal people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First nations governments are expected to conduct their affairs 
in accordance with the principles common to all governments in 
Canada, namely, transparency, disclosure and redress.  These 
principles are intended to ensure accountability of first nation 
leaders to their communities.  To help build effective 
administration for this responsibility, all first nations are 
required to complete an evaluation of their current 
accountability and management practices. Where weaknesses are 
identified, first nations develop a plan to strengthen them. 
First nations are taking the initiative to build the necessary 
support for this activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First nations governments and the Department of Indian Affairs 
and Northern Development work together.  When problems do occur, 
and they do occur, a remedial management plan is put into place 
to help restore the first nation's financial health.  This plan 
could include placing the first nation under a co-management plan 
or even third party management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where there is evidence of wrongdoing, it should be taken to the 
police as the member has alluded to. 
In this case of course they found there was no wrongdoing.  In a 
first nations community, as in other communities, the police have 
the authority and responsibility to investigate allegations of 
wrongdoing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Accountability is fundamental to self-government.  We continue 
to partner with first nations private sector organizations and 
governments and we will continue to work constructively with all 
first nations to ensure accountability.
