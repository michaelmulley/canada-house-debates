<HR>
<H1>HOUSE OF COMMONS</H1>
<B>Tuesday, January 18, 1994 </B>
<P>
The House met at 3:30 p.m.
<P>
_______________ 
<P>
<I>Prayers</I>
<P>
_______________
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>

<P>
	A message was delivered by the Gentleman Usher of the 
Black Rod as follows:
<P>
Mr. Speaker, it is the desire of His Excellency the Governor General of 
Canada that this honourable House attend him immediately in the Chamber of 
the honourable the Senate.
<P>
	Accordingly, the Speaker with the House went up to the 
Senate Chamber.
<P>
<LI>(1540) 
<P>
	<I>And the House being returned to the Commons Chamber:</I>
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I have the honour to report that the House 
having attended on His Excellency the Governor General in the 
Senate Chamber, I informed His Excellency that the choice of 
Speaker had fallen upon me. On your behalf, I made the usual 
claim for your privileges which His Excellency was pleased to 
confirm to you.
<P></p>


<p>	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister)</B> moved for 
leave to introduce Bill C-1, respecting the administration of 
oaths of office.
<P>
	(Motion agreed to and bill read the first time.)
<P>
 
<P>
<LI>(1545) 
<P>

<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I have the honour to inform the House that 
when this House did attend His Excellency this day in the Senate 
Chamber, His Excellency was pleased to make a speech to both 
Houses of Parliament. To prevent mistakes, I have obtained a 
copy, which is as follows:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<I>Ladies and Gentlemen, Honourable Members of the Senate, 
Ladies and Gentlemen, Members of the House of Commons.</I>
<P>
	The two and a half years that have passed since I last had the 
pleasure of addressing Parliament have brought many changes, 
to Canada and to the world. Our hopes for global peace have 
been raised and, in many places, shattered. In some countries 
today, democracy is under stress, its future uncertain.
<P>
	Canadians, however, continue their unwavering commitment 
to democracy. Elections in this country are carried out as 
peaceful clashes of ideas, not of forces. The very fact that we are 
gathered in this chamber is, itself, testimony to the durability 
and wisdom of the process by which we govern ourselves.
<P>
	Once again, we look forward to welcoming Her Majesty. This 
year she will travel to Nova Scotia and the Northwest 
Territories, and to British Columbia, where she will open the 
1994 Commonwealth Games.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	On October 25, 1993, Canadians chose a new Parliament and a 
new government. The Government has made a number of 
commitments to the people of Canada. They will be 
implemented.
<P>
	On opening the first session of this Parliament, and on behalf 
of the Government, I make the following brief statements of 
government policy, which will be followed by legislation and 
other proposals by the Prime Minister and Ministers 
themselves.
<P>
	The agenda of the Government is based on an integrated 
approach to economic, social, environmental and foreign policy.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In order to achieve this agenda, integrity and public trust in 
the institutions of government are essential.
<P>
	My Ministers will insist upon integrity, honesty and openness 
on the part of those who exercise power on behalf of Canadians.
<P>
	Specifically, an ethics counsellor will be appointed to advise 
Ministers and government officials and to examine the need for 
legislative change. Legislation will be placed before you to 
increase the transparency of the relations between lobbyists and 
the Government.
<P>
	The Government is committed to enhancing the credibility 
of Parliament. Changes will be proposed to the rules of the 
House of Commons to provide Members of Parliament a greater 
opportunity to contribute to the development of public policy 
and legislation.
<P>
	Measures to reform the pension plan of Members of 
Parliament, including the elimination of double-dipping, will 
be placed before you.
<P>
	The Government attaches the highest priority to job creation 
and economic growth in the short term and the long term. To 
stimulate economic activity, an agreement has been reached 
with provincial and territorial governments for a joint 
federal-provincial-municipal infrastructure program. This 
program will proceed immediately.
<P>
The Government will reintroduce the Residential 
Rehabilitation Assistance Program. The Government will also 
create a Youth Service Corps to begin putting young Canadians 
back to work.
<P>
	For longer-term job creation, the Government will focus on 
small and medium-sized businesses. The Government will work 
with Canada's financial institutions to improve access to capital 
for small business. A Canada Investment Fund will be created to 
help innovative leading-edge technology firms to obtain the 
long-term capital they need. To improve the diffusion of 
technology and innovation, a Canadian technology network will 
be created. To strengthen research and development, the 
Government will encourage technology partnerships between 
Canadian universities, research institutions and the private 
sector. The Government will also implement a Canadian 
strategy for an information highway.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The Government will promote better training for the 
managers of small businesses and greater access to strategic 
information on new technologies and new marketing 
opportunities. The Government will also work with the 
provinces to reduce the regulatory and paper burden on small 
businesses and to streamline the delivery of programs.
<P>
	Job creation and economic growth also require Canadian 
firms, especially small and medium-sized businesses, to adopt 
an aggressive trading mentality to take advantage of export 
markets. With the successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round 
and the implementation of NAFTA, the Government will assist 
Canadian companies to translate improved market access into 
greater export sales. The Government will pursue an activist 
trade policy so that Canadians may have improved access to 
expanding markets, particularly in the Pacific Rim and in Latin 
America.
<P>
	The Government will ensure greater cohesion of federal 
activity in international business development and welcomes 
the agreement of the provinces at the First Ministers' meeting of 
December 21, 1993, to explore  opportunities for reduced 
overlap and duplication in this area.
<P>
	At the same time the Government will promote greater trade 
opportunities domestically. The Government is committed to 
working with all provincial governments to eliminate internal 
barriers to trade.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Job creation and sustained economic growth require an 
investment in people. The Government will work in partnership 
with the provinces and the private sector to help young people to 
be better prepared for the transition from school to the 
workplace. The Government will propose measures to improve 
job training as well as the literacy skills of Canadians. Funding 
for the National Literacy Program will be restored to its original 
level.
<P>
	Canada's social security system must be responsive to the 
economic and social realities of the 1990s. The Government will 
announce an action plan for major reform of the social security 
system to be completed within two years. The Government will 
work closely and co-operatively with the provinces and will 
consult Canadians on the modernization and restructuring of our 
collective social security. New legislation will then be placed 
before Parliament.
<P>
	The Government will pursue the fiscal discipline necessary 
for sustained economic growth. The budget will be tabled in 
February and will include measures to bring the federal debt and 
deficit under control in a manner that is compatible with putting 
Canadians back to work. The Government will work with the 
provinces to ensure that our shared fiscal challenge is dealt with 
co-operatively and creatively.
<P>
	In collaboration with the provinces and as a result of 
consultations to be undertaken by the House of Commons 
Standing Committee on Finance, the Government will replace 
the Goods and Services Tax.
<P>
	It will be the policy of the Government to promote sustainable 
development as an integral component of decision making at all 
levels of our society. Special emphasis will be placed on 
pollution prevention and the development of ``green'' 
infrastructures and industries and their associated 
high-technology jobs. The <I>Canadian Environmental 
Assessment Act</I> will be proclaimed.
<P>
	The East Coast fishery, which has provided a livelihood to 
thousands of families in the Atlantic provinces and Quebec, 
confronts significant challenges due to the groundfish resource 
collapse. The Government, working with industry and the 
provinces, will help those involved to become self supporting. 
The Government will take the action required to ensure that 
foreign overfishing of East Coast stocks comes to an end.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The Government will vigorously pursue its commitment to 
strengthen the fabric of Canadian life. The Government will 
introduce measures to enhance community safety and crime 
prevention. There will be measures to combat the high level of 
violence against women and children. Measures will be 
proposed to combat racism and hate crime. The Court 
Challenges Program and the Law Reform Commission will be 
restored. Amendments will be proposed to the <I>Canadian Human 
Rights Act</I>; and the <I>Canadian Race Relations Foundation Act</I> 
will be proclaimed.
<P>
	Canada's universal health care system is founded upon the 
principles of the <I>Canada Health Act</I>. The Government is deeply 
committed to these principles and rejects any measure which 
undermines them.
<P>
	A National Forum on Health chaired by the Prime Minister 
will be established to foster, in co-operation with the provinces, 
a national, public dialogue on the renewal of Canada's health 
system.
<P>
	A Centre of Excellence for Women's Health will be 
established to ensure that women's health issues receive the 
attention they deserve.
<P>
	Prenatal nutrition programs for low-income pregnant women 
will be created and expanded.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The Government will forge a new partnership with Aboriginal 
peoples, particularly in respect of the implementation of the 
inherent right of self-government. Legislation to further the 
implementation of northern claims settlements will be put 
before Parliament.
<P>
	The Government will allocate additional funds for the support 
of post-secondary education for First Nations and will develop 
an Aboriginal head-start program.
<P>
	Our cultural heritage and our official languages are at the very 
core of the Canadian identity and are sources of social and 
economic enrichment. The Government will announce measures 
to promote Canada's cultural identity.
<P>
	The Government will ensure that Canada plays an active, 
internationalist role in the global arena. In light of the radical 
changes that have occurred in international affairs in the last few 
years, the Government will ask parliamentary committees to 
review Canada's foreign and defence policies and priorities.
<P>
	This year will also mark the 50th anniversary of D-Day, and I 
look forward, on behalf of the people of Canada, to participating 
in commemorative ceremonies to mark the valiant efforts of our 
servicemen and servicewomen who participated in the 
liberation of Europe.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The Government will work vigorously to fulfil its 
responsibilities to ensure that federalism meets the needs of 
Canadians, recognizing that all Canadians share in the 
responsibility for making Canada work. It will be the policy of 
the Government to seek to clarify the federal government's 
responsibilities in relation to those of other orders of 
government, to eliminate overlap and duplication, and to find 
better ways to provide services so that they represent the best 
value for taxpayers' dollars and respond to the real needs of 
people.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	By working co-operatively to create economic opportunity; 
by restoring common sense to our public finances; by rebuilding 
a sense of integrity in government; and by pursuing a positive 
and innovative agenda for our society, my Ministers are 
convinced that Canadian unity will be preserved and enhanced. 
They believe that this Parliament can play a historic role in 
preparing Canada for the new century to come.
<P>
	<I>Members of the House of Commons</I>:
<P>
	You will be asked to appropriate the funds required to carry 
out the services and expenditures authorized by Parliament.
<P>
	<I>Honourable Members of the Senate/Members of the House of 
Commons</I>:
<P>
	May Divine Providence guide you in your deliberations.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister)</B> moved:

<P>
	(Motion agreed to.)
<P>
 
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>

<P>
	The House proceeded to the consideration of the speech 
delivered by His Excellency the Governor General at the 
opening of the session.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Bruce-Grey):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is with 
great pleasure and humility that I move the motion on the 
Address in Reply to the Speech from the Throne.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I would like to pay my respects to His Excellency the 
Governor General and thank him for delivering the speech to 
both Houses.
<P>
	I would also like to pay my respects and congratulate you, Mr. 
Speaker, on your election as Speaker of this venerable body, the 
House of Commons. We appreciate the fact that you are going to 
be guiding us. I know personally you are going to do a good job.
<P>
	I hail from the riding of Bruce-Grey, home to two important 
and outstanding Canadian feminists. One was Nellie McClung 
who was a lecturer, author and defender of women's rights. As 
well we had another outstanding woman, the Hon. Agnes 
Macphail, the first woman ever elected to the House of 
Commons.
<P>
	My riding is the birthplace of Billy Bishop, the famous world 
war flying ace. We are immensely proud to be the home of Tom 
Thomson, a famous Canadian artist who was a member of the 
Group of Seven.
<P>
<LI>(1555 ) 
<P>
	Walter Harris, who was born in Kimberly and now resides in 
Markdale, was the finance minister during the session of 
1954-57. I want to remind the hon. Minister of Finance that Mr. 
Harris balanced the budget twice.
<P>
	The riding of Bruce-Grey is bound by the south and east 
coast of Georgian Bay. It includes the entire Bruce peninsula 
which includes Tobermory though to Wiarton, home of Wiarton 
Willy, the groundhog famous for weather forecasting. The 
Americans had to invent a groundhog in order to compete with 
our Wiarton Willy who does such a good job.
<P>
	In the south of the riding are the towns of Walkerton and 
Hanover and to the west of the riding is located beautiful Sauble 
Beach, a destination point and resort area.
<P>
	The city of Owen Sound, my home town of which I was mayor 
for the last four terms, is the regional centre for the area. It 
houses the famous Owen Sound Little Theatre.
<P>
	On the east is the town of Meaford and in that surrounding 
area we have our famous Georgian Bay apples. The towns of 
Durham, Hanover and Chesley have an enviable history for 
their quality furniture manufacturing.
<P>
	In my riding there are also two reserves, the reserves of the 
Saugeen and Cape Croker.
<P>
	In Bruce-Grey, agriculture is an important economic way of 
life for many of my constituents. For the most part farming is 
focused on beef, sheep, poultry and dairy products.
<P>
	The fact that I am standing here today proposing this motion 
of acceptance is a very significant event in the national policies 
of the Canadian government. I say that because somebody once 
mentioned that Canada was half-sister to the world.
<P>
	I am from the Caribbean. Many people elected to this House 
are from that general area. This country of Canada has had great 
relations with Guyana and many countries around the globe.
<P>
	Twenty-six years ago, Barbara Ward, environmentalist, 
thinker and distinguished writer described Canada as possibly 
the world's first international nation.
<P>
	Canada more than lived up to that description in the years that 
followed. Its government and its citizens have shown a mature 
and sensitive concern for global security in all its 
aspects-political, strategic, economic, social and 
environmental.
<P>
	Our international development assistance programs are 
evidence of that concern. Canadians have shown compassion for 
the welfare of the peoples of developing countries with whom 
they have mutual interests.
<P>
	The fact that I am standing here today emphasizes another 
important Canadian characteristic and that is its ethnic 
diversity.
<P>
	If Shakespeare had known Canada as it is now he probably 
would have written ``sweet are the uses of diversity''. Now that 
our country is truly a global village, Canada's multi-ethnic 
character fully coincides with that reality.
<P>
	At no other time in human history have the peoples of the 
world had a greater opportunity to observe each other's values 
and belief systems as now. In Canada, on a daily basis, our very 
diversity accommodates meeting and sharing ideas and 
differing ways of viewing the world. This is an enormous 
Canadian strength because such dialogue is fundamental to us as 
Canadians. It is the base of our democratic process.
<P>
	I entered federal politics because Canada, this wonderful 
democracy, allowed me to be Canadian. Canada has been good 
to me, my wife Verona and our two children, Andrew and Sonja. 
I feel that this country has given me a lot and I hope that in this 
House I can give back some of what it has given to me.
<P>
	On October 25, 1993, the Canadian people gave us their trust 
with a mandate to govern our great country.
<P>
<LI>(1600) 
<P>
	What I heard them say in the message to us was that they 
would like to see honesty and integrity in their national 
government. Not for one moment, as I look around this room, do 
I doubt that the men and women established here today are 
capable of that chore.
<P>
	I also firmly believe that if we work together to maintain our 
heritage and cultural diversity, if we manage our resources both 
human and natural, Canada can continue to be the best country 
in the world.
<P>
	I am noted for telling stories. I am reminded of a story of the 
great Italian Metropolitan conductor Toscanini. He was in New 
York at the famous Metropolitan Opera House; they were 
rehearsing for an up and coming performance.
<P>
	A young soloist was not doing very well so Toscanini thought 
maybe he could give her some advice. The young woman 
scoffed at the advice and told Toscanini that she was the star of 
the show and in fact did not want any advice. Toscanini thought 
for a little while and then reaffirmed to the young woman that in 
a symphony there were no solo performances.
<P>
	In this House one person cannot pass a motion. In this House 
all 295 of us were elected by the Canadian people to do a job and 
I hope we work collaboratively, not separately.
<P>
	As outlined in the throne speech this government has stated its 
intention to keep its promises, specifically the agenda of the red 
book. That is why so many of us are on this side of the House.
<P>
	A commitment to the principles of universal health care, a 
new apprenticeship program, restoration of literacy funding, the 
Canadian youth corps, assistance to small and medium sized 
business and a total redesign of our social programs was stated 
in the throne speech.
<P>
	As mayor I handled economic development. I travelled to 
Europe and to the United States. I want to make a statement to all 
the members of the House. I believe that small businesses are 
extremely important to us. We must take the monkey off their 
backs. We must take away all the red tape from them. We must 
allow people to imagine, to dream and to get those businesses 
going. That is from where we will get the jobs and the hope for 
the Canadians we are talking about.
<P>
	Since the election our Prime Minister has shown an example 
of frankness and frugality in our government. We announced a 
number of cuts the other day. The government whip announced 
that we were going to try to cut down on some of the perks to 
save millions of dollars in the coffers for Canadian people.
<P>
	In conclusion I want to say sincerely to all members of the 
House, regardless of their political stripes, that I would like it if 
all of us would not work solo but would work hard for the 
taxpayers of the country. They are the  ones who put us here. 
They are the ones who voted for us. None of us were elected by 
solo flights. Each one had a wife, a family, an organization and 
commitment to doing work for the Canadian people. I hope this 
Parliament will be the best ever.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, you will be glad to know that finally I come to 
the motion. I move, seconded by the hon. member for 
Madawaska-Victoria, that the following address be presented 
to His Excellency the Governor General of Canada:
<P>
To His Excellency the Right Honourable Ramon John Hnatyshyn, a Member of 
the Queen's Privy Council for Canada, Chancellor and Principal Companion of 
the Order of Canada, Chancellor and Commander of the Order of Military Merit, 
one of Her Majesty's counsel learned in law, Governor General and 
Commander-in-Chief of Canada.
<P>
MAY IT PLEASE YOUR EXCELLENCY:
<P>
We, Her Majesty's most loyal and dutiful subjects, the House of Commons of 
Canada, in Parliament assembled, beg leave to offer our humble thanks to Your 
Excellency for the gracious Speech which Your Excellency has addressed to both 
Houses of Parliament.
<P>
<LI>(1605) 
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Ringuette-Maltais 
(Madawaska-Victoria):</B> Mr. Speaker, first of all I would like 
to congratulate you on your election to this office. You will 
prove yourself to be equal to the task of managing and 
overseeing the business of this House. On my behalf and on 
behalf of all the citizens of Madawaska- Victoria, kindly 
convey my respects to His Excellency the Governor General and 
Mrs. Hnatyshyn.
<P>
	Last October 25, the people of Canada sent an enlightened 
message to the Conservative government. Canadians placed 
their trust and future in the hands of a leader who, in my 
estimation, will provide the energetic leadership we need to 
confront the future with optimism.
<P>
	As I stated several times during the election campaign, our 
leader, now our Prime Minister, is a man of substance and not of 
images. What impresses me most about him are his qualities, the 
fact that he is a realist as well an honest, respectful and visionary 
person.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais:</B> On April 5, 1965, the seconder of 
the motion for the Address in Reply to the Speech from the 
Throne stated the following: ``It is obvious that the Liberal 
party, more than any other, has understood the great currents of 
history, has seen the changes happening throughout the country 
and has found solutions which have brought about the 
collectivist society we know today. In its philosophy, its 
leadership and its policies, the Liberal party has kept in touch 
with the traditional trends of thought and action, but is has 
always understood the evolution of our society. That is why 
today it is advocating the two attitudes necessary to our 
country's development, namely economic planning  within the 
administration and the establishment of a new way of life for the 
two groups which constitute our great nation.''
<P>
	These words were spoken by our Prime Minister, the Right 
Honourable Jean Chrétien, a realist and a visionary. Mr. Prime 
Minister, you face many responsibilities and challenges. You 
can count on me to support you and your team in the delivery of 
new and fair socio-economic policies for Canadians.
<P>
<LI>(1610) 
<P>
	I want to congratulate all my colleagues on their election to 
this House. To represent one's constituents is a responsibility 
that demands both diligence and understanding.
<P>
	I wish to thank the people of Madawaska-Victoria for having 
placed their trust in me, and I intend to represent them to the best 
of my ability. Our riding extends along the valley of the Saint 
John River and borders on the State of Maine.
<P>
	We are the door to Atlantic Canada, a border cross-roads, and 
as such we need a better highway and railway network. Human 
lives, money and potential are being lost as a result of the poor 
condition of our roads.
<P>
	Our economy, based on forestry and agriculture, provides 
mainly seasonal employment. Although we favour greater 
diversification in the manufacturing and tourism sectors, we 
must ensure that our so-called natural resources are stable and 
at the cutting edge of environmental technology.
<P>
	Our government must renew the subsidiary forestry and 
agriculture agreements with the province of New Brunswick. I 
find the riding of Madawaska-Victoria particularly beautiful 
because, to me, it is also a microcosm of our country.
<P>
	In the coming months and years, I intend to submit a number 
of socio-economic pilot projects, projects for a progressive 
society, to various departments in our government.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Our infrastructure program has been well received in my 
riding of Madawaska-Victoria. Municipalities are anxious to 
renew, and some to build, needed infrastructure, but most of all 
these jobs will provide dignity to numerous families in my 
riding.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We Liberals did not win this election with empty rhetoric. We 
won it thanks to a realistic and pragmatic approach. We know 
what the people's priorities are, and we provided sound 
alternatives. We knew that Canadians needed jobs, and our 
infrastructure program is an attempt to deal with this problem.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	For too long we have talked of natural resources as in forestry, 
mining, agriculture and energy. Now let us talk and act for our 
greatest natural resource and that is our  youth. Our government 
will provide in the near future a special youth program. That is 
only a beginning. We must be creative and innovative and design 
job entry opportunities in the private and public sectors. Those 
of generations to come must be optimistic about developing 
their abilities.
<P>
	A Liberal government will have a social conscience for all its 
citizens while being fiscally responsible. A lean government 
does not have to be a mean government.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Canadians want government reforms based on Liberal 
principles of equity for all. Our society's lack of confidence in 
government and politicians is real. A Liberal government 
cannot afford to propose socio-economic policies that are no 
more than band-aid solutions.
<P>
	It is time to review our fiscal and social policies and to 
provide a co-ordinated approach that responds to the needs and 
aspirations of Canadians.
<P>
	As a French-Canadian, I am very pleased with the quality and 
quantity of bilingualism on Parliament Hill. In fact, this is 
thanks to the language policies of a Liberal federal government.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, it is an honour and a privilege for me, as the 
member for Madawaska-Victoria, to second the motion of the 
hon. member for the Bruce-Grey for an Address in Reply to the 
Speech from the Throne.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Today is the beginning of a new, positive era for all 
Canadians. Along with my government, we will work so that the 
future is brighter than the past, so that all from coast to coast to 
coast will find that again after 10 years their federal 
government, a Chrétien Liberal government, is working with 
and for them, not against them.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I move:

of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, I

two o'clock p.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 4.16 p.m.)
