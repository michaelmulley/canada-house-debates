	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board 
and Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, 50 years have passed since the liberation of many of the 
camps that symbolized Hitler's final solution.
<P>
	Canadians began marking the 50th anniversary of the 
liberation of Europe on June 4, 1994 when we remembered the 
sacrifices of thousands of our countrymen on the beaches of 
Normandy. Today we commemorate Holocaust Memorial Day.
<P>
	While we mark the end of a tragic time in human history, we 
must recognize we have all come a long way.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The Nazi holocaust victimized all of humanity. It showed how

<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The Nazi Holocaust victimized all of humanity. It showed 
how blind nationalism, racism and bigotry, a violation of the 
very basic democratic principles on which our society is based, 
can lead to incomprehensible suffering and violence.
<P>
	The names of the death camps liberated half a century ago 
ring out as sacred prayers: Dachau, Buchenwald, Treblinka, 
Bergen Belsen, Auschwitz-Birkenau. These places have 
become holy ground. We must remember them because they 
symbolize what humanity is capable of and remind us of our 
obligation not only to millions of men, women and children who 
fell victim to tyranny but to future generations around the world.
<P>
	Canada remembers the suffering of Europe. We remember the 
deaths of six million Jews and the victimization of millions of 
other innocent people persecuted because of their religion, 
ethnic origin, sexual orientation or political views.
<P>
	Canada remembers the selfless sacrifice of thousands of our 
soldiers who offered their lives for freedom, democracy and for 
a better future for us today. We honour all of their memories by 
ensuring we remember why they died. We honour their sacrifice 
by working for the equality of humanity and being true to our 
values of respect and understanding.
<P>
	Canada remembers.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Godin (ChÃ¢teauguay, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
the official opposition joins the government in giving its 
unanimous support to the motion tabled by the Secretary of State 
for Veterans. Fifty years have passed since the end of World War 
II, a war the likes of which this small planet had never seen 
before. We had to recognize that neither modern institutions nor 
the new technologies had helped us achieve peace on this earth.
<P>
	Toward the end of that great war, the whole world was 
horrified to discover the existence of concentration camps, an 
inhumane, cruel and barbaric practice. No words exist to 
describe this atrocity and express our revulsion towards such a 
monstrous scheme. There is no excuse whatsoever for 
concentration camps.
<P>
<B>(1010) </B>
<P>
	Millions of men, women and children perished under the yoke 
of tyranny. They could only hope that other countries would rise 
up and fight in the name of liberty  and justice. That is the effort 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11844"> 11844 </A></B>
<P>
in which Canada took part. We and our descendants will never 
forget the valour and courage of those soldiers. It is our duty to 
ensure that these defenders of freedom will always be present in 
our collective memory.
<P>
	The collapse of the Third Reich revealed to the world the 
largest extermination effort in history. Millions died in the 
concentration camps set up by the Nazis in occupied Europe, in 
their electrified barbed wire enclosures, blockhouses, 
underground factories, experimental rooms, gas chambers and 
herding areas. Thousands of convoys led victims on the road to 
hell.
<P>
	This planned destruction effort was carried out relentlessly 
until just before surrender. Those convoys let to the internment 
and slaughter of innocents. Arrival in camp often meant death 
pure and simple or an even worse fate: forced labour 
contributing to death. It was a tragedy to witness the torture and 
slow agony of one's neighbour or be subjected to the same 
treatment. Malnutrition and illness led to a point of no return, to 
an exit from life. It is our duty to take a moment to imagine what 
concentration camps were like, to better understand how crucial 
it is that we remain steadfast in our firm commitment never to 
tolerate crimes against humanity.
<P>
	Fifty years ago today, trucks of the International Red Cross 
drove into certain concentration camps, marking the end of this 
hell on earth. Torturers fled. Today, 50 years later, it is our duty 
to look at this tragedy as if it had happened just yesterday to our 
relatives, children and parents, so that we never fall victim of 
such madness. However-sadly for humanity-genocides and 
organized exterminations continue. Last year, more than one 
million Rwandans perished in a carefully planned genocide and, 
to this day, those responsible for this crime go unpunished.
<P>
	More recently, the slaughter of thousands of Hutu refugees by 
the Rwandan Army at the Kibeho camp amounted to carnage. 
The international community witnessed acts of unspeakable 
cruelty in Bosnia, where ethnic cleansing was systematically 
carried out. Such events make us wonder whether humanity has 
learned anything from the lesson we were taught by history.
<P>
	We must ensure that this kind of massacres among inhabitants 
of this planet stop. We must remain hopeful that, one day, we 
will all live in peace, free from these inhuman acts. To 
commemorate the liberation of Nazi concentration camps is, of 
course, to pay our respects to the victims, but also pay tribute to 
all the men and women of this country who made that liberation 
possible, our veterans, who deserve more than our admiration. 
We owe them support, particularly when they paid with their 
health. I hope that this government will take this opportunity to 
ponder over the way veterans are treated. We cannot renege on 
our promise to them.
<P>
	Nor can we afford to relax our vigilance, lest atrocities like 
those committed in Nazi concentration camps be committed 
again. Such is the implacable lesson taught by  history, a lesson 
that we must in turn teach our children, so that we never forget. 
The Bloc Quebecois, for its part, undertakes to do all it can to 
ensure that this knowledge remains in our collective memory. 
Together, let us keep this hope alive.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, it is a great honour to address the House on 
behalf of the people of Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt and 
my colleagues in the Reform Party to solemnly commemorate 
the 50th anniversary of the liberation of the Nazi death camps.
<P>
	We remember the men, the women and the innocent children 
who perished at the hands of the Nazi tyranny and we honour the 
many Canadians who fought for freedom and justice at a time of 
darkness.
<P>
<B>(1015 ) </B>
<P>
	We recall the generation of men, women, and children that 
had to endure the horrors of Nazi tyranny from the 1930s to 
1945. For someone born after the war, the reality of this dark 
period in the history of humanity seems hard to comprehend.
<P>
	We see the pictures of the Warsaw ghetto, the trainloads of 
innocent men, women and children being sent to the 
concentration camps, the deadly gas chambers and the horrific 
mass graves. As I recall these offences of the past I try to 
imagine how man could commit these crimes against humanity.
<P>
	I really began to grasp the magnitude of this tragedy when I 
saw the numbers of people who died in this horrible conflict. 
The death toll rivals the size of Canada in 1945. Though we do 
not have all the names of those who perished, the world must 
remember Yom Hashoah, Holocaust Memorial Day.
<P>
	I would like to reiterate the pledge yesterday by the leader of 
the Reform Party. He spoke for all of us when he stated: ``I 
solemnly vow that we shall honour the memory of those who 
perished in the Holocaust by remaining vigilant against those 
who would divide us by promoting hatred and discrimination''.
<P>
	Those who deny this event must be condemned. Besides 
solemnly commemorating Yom Hashoah and the liberation of 
the Nazi concentration camps, I would like to honour the tens of 
thousands of Canadian men and women who fought for freedom 
and justice. Too many left Canada to never return. In each battle 
Canadians fought, and despite the odds and terrible toll they had 
to pay, they never failed to display great courage and resolution. 
It is a great tribute to our nation to know that most of those who 
fought in this terrible war did so voluntarily.
<P>
	It has been 50 years since the Nazi concentration camps were 
liberated and the guns fell silent. Many soldiers and civilians 
who experienced the horrors of this war are doing their utmost to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11845"> 11845 </A></B>
<P>
make sure all Canadians  and all humanity remember the cause, 
the course, and the consequences of this conflict.
<P>
	Yet in the years to come, as veterans and victims pass on, it 
will be up to my generation and the generation that follows to 
keep alive the memory. I feel entrusted with a sacred pledge to 
be able to go to the Netherlands next week to represent my 
constituents and the Reform Party in the Canada remembrance 
ceremonies.
<P>
	For my part, I vow to keep the memory alive and honour our 
fallen soldiers and the victims of this terrible event. The people 
and events we are honouring today must not be forgotten in the 
dustbin of history. It must be remembered that those who forget 
the past are condemned to relive it.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Audrey McLaughlin (Yukon, NDP):</B> Madam Speaker, 
today we rise in the House to remember. Half a century has not 
erased the memory of the horror of the six million people who 
were killed in Nazi concentration camps, nor the horror of World 
War II, which led to this.
<P>
	Those who fought for the liberation of camps are also 
remembered today. We remember the families and individuals 
whose lives were lost in those camps. We admire the strength of 
those survivors, many of whom came to this country to help, 
with courage, determination, and strength, to build this country.
<P>
	As we remember today, there is truly a lesson for us all, a 
lesson of courage and a reminder of how quickly prejudices and 
biases can turn to hate. As Canadians, we must be diligent and 
we must fight prejudice and racism. However, it is not enough to 
simply issue statements. We cannot be silent in our 
communities, in our homes or in our country. Silence and 
complacency are not options. We cannot rest in the assurance 
that the horrors of the concentration camps are simply a part of 
history.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We must be vigilant, because right wing extremism and 
fascism still exist in every country. We must ensure full 
application of the laws which prohibit hate, and work together to 
promote a strong and healthy democracy in Canada.
<P>
<B>(1020) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The Holocaust in many ways is something that happened to all 
of us. It is a part of our history and it is something we are all 
responsible for in ensuring that peace, justice, and freedom in 
every country in this world are more than just words.
<P>
	Canada will remember. The world will remember.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B> Madam Speaker, I want 
to join with my colleagues in the House in commemorating the 
50th anniversary of the liberation of the Nazi concentration 
camps. We must never forget the millions who were murdered at 
the hands of the heinous Nazi regime.
<P>
	I also want to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the many 
Canadians who fought so that the future generations could live 
in peace and freedom.
<P>
	I shall never forget as a little girl, when I was only five years 
old, when my brothers came in to tell my mother and my father 
that they had signed up to go overseas. They were overseas in 
France, Germany, and Italy. I will never forget the prayers and 
the hard times my mother had, hoping and praying she would 
hear from them. And I will never forget when I was a little girl 
and we went to the train station to greet them when they returned 
safe and sound.
<P>
	If there was ever a war that needed to be won, it was the 
second world war. It hardly needs saying that the world would be 
a dark and different place today if the allies had not achieved 
victory.
<P>
	We must never forget the unspeakable horror the death camps 
brought forth. They are a symbol of what can result from hatred 
and racism.
<P>
	Today we witness the suffering of innocents around the world 
who are the victims of ethnically motivated conflict. Let us 
remember what such hatreds can lead to and be ever vigilant in 
our efforts to make sure it is not allowed to happen again.
<P>
	Yes, Canada will remember.

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House recognize that since the inception of our national health care 
system the federal share of funding for health care in Canada has fallen from 50 
per cent to 23 per cent and therefore the House urges the government to consult 
with the provinces and other stakeholders to determine core services to be 
completely funded by the federal and provincial governments and non-core 
services where private insurance and the benefactors of the services might play 
a supplementary role.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Madam Speaker, I rise to address the Reform motion 
before the House, but before I do so I would like to say a word 
about broken promises.
<P>
	One of the reasons there is so much public cynicism about 
politics and government is that governments consistently break 
their promises. This Liberal government, for example, is not yet 
two years old but already it has littered the political landscape 
with broken promises.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11847"> 11847 </A></B>
<P>
	For example, there was the promise to base key federal 
appointments solely on competence rather than patronage, a 
promise routinely broken almost every week.
<P>
	There was the promise by the now Deputy Prime Minister to 
resign if the GST was not replaced within one year of the 
election, shamelessly broken on October 25, 1994.
<P>
	There was the promise not to alter federal-provincial 
transfers without the full co-operation of the provinces, which 
was broken by the introduction of the Canada social transfer in 
the February budget.
<P>
	There was the promise to provide a new blueprint-
<P>
<B>(1030 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Szabo:</B> Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order.
<P>
	Two days ago a member rose in the House on a point of order 
to indicate that the speaker was not addressing the motion on the 
floor. I believe this is the same case. Therefore, I would make 
the point that the member should be addressing the motion.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Resuming debate with 
the hon. leader of the Reform Party.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manning:</B> There was a promise to provide a new 
blueprint for social reform. It was broken without apology or 
explanation when the Minister of Human Resources 
Development failed to deliver his green paper.
<P>
	There was a promise not to increase the tax load on the long 
suffering, overtaxed Canadian taxpayer. It was broken to the 
tune of $500 million a year with the imposition of a 1.5 cent a 
litre tax on gasoline.
<P>
	There was a promise of a more open Parliament where MPs 
would be free from party discipline. It was dictatorially broken 
when Liberal MPs who voted against the government's gun 
control bill were stripped of their committee positions.
<P>
	The first part of the motion we are considering draws 
attention to yet another broken Liberal promise, one of the most 
serious of all. For the benefit of members, this is the connection 
between broken promises and the motion.
<P>
	When national medicare was introduced at the federal level 
by a minority Liberal government 30 years ago, Prime Minister 
Pearson solemnly promised Canadians, the provinces and the 
House that the federal government would pay 50 per cent of the 
costs. This was the fiscal promise on which medicare rested. 
This was the condition insisted on by the provinces and 
promised by the federal government, a promise without which 
the provinces would not have agreed to national medicare.
<P>
	The Liberals even wrote that promise into the old 1966 
medical care act, section 5, which stated that ``the amount of the 
contribution payable by Canada to a province in respect to a 
medical care insurance plan is an amount equal to 50 per cent 
of''. It then went on to list the various cost components of the 
plan.
<P>
	What is the state of that sacred promise today? Today the 
federal government's contribution to health care funding is not 
50 per cent as promised. It is now less than 23 per cent and 
falling.
<P>
	The Prime Minister and the health minister can profess their 
undying commitment to the principles of medicare until they 
retire from public life clutching their two-tier MP pension. The 
truth of the matter is that every day, every hour in every 
province, in every community, in every part of the country, 
whenever and wherever Canadians draw on national medicare, 
the government is breaking its fundamental promise to pay 50 
per cent of the bill.
<P>
	Because it is breaking that fundamental financial promise it is 
slowly undermining the other principles of medicare. It 
undermines accessibility as waiting lists get longer and longer. 
It undermines comprehensiveness as more and more health 
services are delisted from provincial insurance plans. It 
undermines universality as the system evolves into a multi-tier 
system with access to the various tiers being tied increasingly to 
ability to pay.
<P>
	The second part of the motion before the House proposes a 
solution to this dilemma, which I will get to in a moment. Before 
I do so I would like to clear away one of the myths of medicare, a 
myth to which the Prime Minister and the health minister cling, 
a myth which prevents a clear diagnosis of the problem and the 
solution. That myth is that Canada has a one-tier medical 
system to which all Canadians have universal access regardless 
of ability to pay and opening up the Canada Health Act will lead 
to a U.S. style two-tiered system where ability to pay is the key 
to access.
<P>
	The indisputable fact is that Canada already has a 
multi-tiered health care system, access to which has been made 
more restricted by rising health care costs and declining federal 
support. The challenge is to reform medicare so that one of those 
tiers contains all the essential health services required by 
Canadians, financed by sufficient federal and provincial 
funding so that no Canadian is denied access to those services 
because of inability to pay.
<P>
<B>(1035 ) </B>
<P>
	How to do that I will discuss in a moment. Lest there be some 
simple minded folk among us who still cling to the notion that 
Canada still has a single-tiered medical care system, let me 
submit evidence to the contrary.
<P>
	I could quote from the exhaustive 1994 health care study by 
Dr. Ralph Sutherland and Dr. Jane Fulton entitled ``Spending 
Smarter and Spending Less''. On pages 98 and 99 of that study, 
they discussed the myth of the one-tier system and dismiss it as 
nonsense. They end by saying that the two-tier system is and 
always has been a reality in Canada.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11848"> 11848 </A></B>
<P>
	They then go on to discuss how to make a multi-tier system 
work for the benefit of all Canadians which is the real challenge 
and real problem. Rather than quote extensively from the 
academic or technical literature, I prefer to share with the 
House a note I received just yesterday from a Canadian 
physician to whom I put the question, does Canada presently 
have a one-tier or two-tier system?
<P>
	He says flatly that a two-tier system already exists. Should a 
person be admitted to a hospital, he or she can obtain a private 
room should he or she have the funds to pay for it or an insurance 
program that covers it. Otherwise this is not available.
<P>
	People can hire a private duty nurse for 24-hour care if they 
can afford to pay for it. Many nursing and home care services are 
also available should the patient be able to afford to pay for 
them.
<P>
	Recently midwifery has been introduced. Again this is only 
available to those who can afford to pay for these services. 
People can have access to procedures such as abortions in 
private facilities if they are able to pay the private facility fee.
<P>
	People who can afford to may have an insurance plan to cover 
the cost of pharmaceuticals. Those who cannot afford to pay this 
fee must pay for it out of their own pocket.
<P>
	The Workers' Compensation Board in this province has 
contracted many private facilities to provide services for its 
clients in order for them to obtain these services more quickly 
than possible in the public system and thus get them back to 
work in a more timely fashion.
<P>
	Members of the military have been flown to the base hospital 
in Ottawa to have surgical procedures performed rather than 
being on a waiting list. I have also recently learned that the 
military purchases surgical procedures such as arthroscopies at 
private clinics as it is cheaper than purchasing the same 
procedures through the public sector.
<P>
	As well, we all know the ultimate two-tier system is available 
to those who can afford to pay for it by leaving the country and 
having services provided in the United States.
<P>
	Many leading edge technologies and therapies are not 
available in this country. In order to obtain them one must leave 
the country and purchase them in the U.S. A country of our 
stature should be ashamed of the fact that it is not able to provide 
those services.
<P>
	He concludes by saying: ``As I hope is demonstrated by the 
above examples, almost all aspects of health care in Canada are 
two-tiered and available to people on a private basis except for 
the physician's services. This and certain procedures which are 
only available in public hospitals are the only services that are 
not presently available in two tiers in this country''.
<P>
	Why on earth the Prime Minister and the health minister 
would continue to deny the existence of a multi-tiered health 
care system or to pretend that the five criteria of the Canada 
Health Act preclude such a system is beyond me. Childlike 
belief in the myths of medicare at the highest levels of the 
federal government must end if the problems of Canadian health 
care are to be resolved.
<P>
	The second portion of the motion before us indicates the way 
in which Reform believes the government could guarantee 
universal access for all Canadians to a set of essential health 
services regardless of ability to pay in a multi-tiered system.
<P>
	In order to provide secure funding for health care into the 21st 
century, substantive discussions and negotiations are required 
among all the key players: representatives of health care users, 
taxpayers, health care practitioners, health care administrators, 
health care insurers, the provinces and the federal government.
<P>
	Reform proposes that these discussions and negotiations 
should focus on completing a health care funding matrix such as 
that shown on page 48 of the Reform taxpayers budget.
<P>
	This is the type of framework for refinancing health care, 
saving medicare, which the Prime Minister and the federal 
government should have provided through that national health 
care forum which they have not. This is the framework required 
to produce meaningful amendments to the Canada Health Act, 
amendments which the health minister continues to fail to 
provide. This framework suggests that the first item on the 
agenda should be a discussion of how best to divide essential 
health services into core services and non-core services.
<P>
<B>(1040) </B>
<P>
	The core services would be those health care services most 
essential to Canadians, the financing of which would be 
guaranteed by the federal and provincial governments up to 
some minimal national standard. They would be those services 
which make the most demonstrable contribution to improving 
the health of Canadians and which must be provided in the most 
cost effective way possible.
<P>
	These core services would constitute the heart of medicare. 
All Canadians would be guaranteed access to these services 
across the country up to some national standard regardless of 
their ability to pay.
<P>
	Provinces and individuals would be allowed to provide and 
secure services that went beyond the core services if they so 
desired. The federal government would not be involved in the 
financing of such services.
<P>
	Services designated as non-core services, for example, 
cosmetic surgery as distinguished from more necessary surgery 
or 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11849"> 11849 </A></B>
<P>
fibreglass casts for broken limbs as distinct from plaster casts, 
would be funded through a more flexible combination of 
funding sources, including private insurance and user pay.
<P>
	To those members opposite who will challenge us to elaborate 
on what should be considered core and non-core services, I 
would invite them to listen carefully to my medical colleagues, 
the member for Macleod and the member for Esquimalt-Juan 
de Fuca, and ask questions at the end of those remarks.
<P>
	I would encourage all MPs to refrain from getting too deeply 
into that discussion. It is not our role in the federal Parliament, 
either constitutionally or practically. It is not the role of a distant 
federal government that is paying less than one-quarter of the 
bills to define those services. That is the old way. It is the top 
down way. It is the Meech Lake approach to medicare. It is the 
centralizing way and it is not the way of the future.
<P>
	The definition of those services must primarily come from 
health care users, the people who use them, from the 
practitioners who actually practice them and from the 
administrators at the local and provincial levels. We should do 
everything we can through parliamentary committees, personal 
speeches and dialogue, through the national health care forum to 
facilitate those discussions and to listen. But we should not try 
to dictate the final division of services.
<P>
	After those discussions occur, our role will be to commit 
federal funding to whatever Canadians define as core services, 
up to some minimal national standard in co-operation with the 
provinces.
<P>
	There is no question in my mind that there is an urgent need 
for health care reform in Canada, particularly in light of the 
failure of the federal budget to eliminate the deficit. These 
reforms are required to preserve the best features of the present 
system; to prevent the funding system from being completely 
destroyed by interest on the debt; to provide flexibility to allow 
the provinces' health care administrators and physicians to 
better adapt to the health care needs of Canadians.
<P>
	Canadians are asking and will continue to ask: From whom is 
the leadership for health care reform going to come? I would 
suggest it is not coming from the federal government under the 
current Prime Minister or health minister. They resist every 
proposal for change. They resist the diagnosis that would lead to 
real proposals for change. They charge anyone who advocates 
change with being an enemy of medicare, which is a reactionary 
position, or a proponent of U.S. style health care, charges which 
are completely untrue. They are only dragged into the 
discussion of health care reform at all by their officials telling 
them that if they do not do something, the system is going to 
collapse and they are going to carry the blame.
<P>
	Therefore I suggest that the leadership for health care reform, 
and it is occurring in many spheres, where the public is now 
ahead of the politicians and the government, must come from 
the patient user community, from taxpayers, from the medical 
community, from administrators and local governments, from 
provincial authorities, from the bottom up, not the top down.
<P>
	If in 1960 Ottawa had had the monopoly it has today on setting 
terms and conditions of health care services and financing, the 
present medicare system would not have come into being. 
Canadian medicare did not start in Ottawa. It did not start 
anywhere near Ottawa. It started in Saskatchewan and it really 
started there in an operational sense with the Swift Current 
Hospital District in that province.
<P>
<B>(1045 ) </B>
<P>
	The concept was incorporated by the old CCF into its political 
platform and then stolen by the federal Liberals. I can assure 
concerned citizens and real health care reformers across the 
country they will find allies and advocates of sensible change to 
the health care system in the Reform caucus.
<P>
	I urge all hon. members who wish to save and advance the best 
features of Canadian medicare to support this motion.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, with all due respect to the leader of the third party, he 
has certainly spoken of broken promises and has gone on at great 
length about it.
<P>
	Speaking of broken promises, during the election and 
following I can recall the leader of the Reform Party stating: ``I 
want to make it absolutely clear that the Reform Party is not 
promoting private health care, deductibles or user fees''. Yet, 
today what is he talking about? Deductibles, user fees, getting 
more and more private. That was yesterday; this is today. Talk 
about breaking promises.
<P>
	I can recall the Reform Party rhetoric during the last election. 
How does the hon. member explain his change of thinking or his 
whole party's change in rhetoric? How, pray tell, would that 
ensure that people who needed the care got it based on their need 
and not on whether they could afford to pay for it.
<P>
	Let us face it. This is from a party that does not advocate any 
taxation increases whatsoever. Taxes are based on fairness. If 
you make more money, you pay more tax. They are proposing a 
tax on illness. The sicker you are, the more costly it is for you. 
What kind of a system is that? I would like an explanation.
<P>
	How would the leader of the Reform Party deal with people 
who are very ill who, by the way, tend to be the poorest? Usually 
those who are very sick cannot work anymore. He might be 
charitable to a few and there would be these core services; 
maybe you could have a band-aid if you could not afford to pay 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11850"> 11850 </A></B>
<P>
for it. What kind  of medicare is he proposing except the 
American style of system? And we know what that is about.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manning:</B> Madam Speaker, I would remind the minister 
that while there is only a handful of us here in the House her 
remarks on this subject are being carefully monitored these days 
by the practitioners and administrators and particularly by the 
provinces. The statements made here that completely deny the 
reality of the health care system do no service to this House nor 
to the government's position on the seriousness of the problem. 
They create the impression that we literally do not understand 
how the system works. That is a discredit to the minister and the 
government.
<P>
	From what the minister says, we can tell her views of what 
Reform said during the election are based on what a clipping 
service says Reform is about. They bear no resemblance 
whatsoever to the positions we have articulated, particularly the 
Reform colleagues with medical backgrounds.
<P>
	With respect to her particular question of how we facilitate 
the payment for services for people in this category of poor 
services, the minister could not have been listening to what I 
said. We say we should define a set of core services that are 
essential to the care of Canadians. Those are the services to 
which we would dedicate entirely the federal and provincial 
contributions to the funding of medicare. Those services would 
be brought within the financial reach of every Canadian no 
matter where they lived, regardless of their ability to pay. The 
non-essential services can be provided through other financing 
sources such as insurance and even user pay. That is perfectly 
clear.
<P>
	These proposals have been presented by other health care 
reformers in the health care field itself and in the provinces. It is 
time for the minister to acknowledge them for what they are, not 
to pretend they are something else.
<P>
<B>(1050 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. Hedy Fry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, the hon. member put forward an 
eloquent speech, wonderful rhetoric. It shows a depth though of 
the superficiality of the understanding of what health care is all 
about and what the five principles of medicare actually mean.
<P>
	I would not like to add any further rhetoric but to say that with 
this lack of understanding would the hon. member like to 
explain to me what he understands by the meaning of the term 
``core services''. He bandies it about and uses it a lot. I would 
like to know from him what he means by core services.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manning:</B> I have two comments. I appreciate the fact that 
the member is concerned about superficiality. I would earnestly 
suggest if she reads the speech the Prime Minister gave on this 
subject in Saskatoon and if she reads the speeches that have been 
given by the Minister of Health, we have a superficiality that 
betrays the government's position today.
<P>
	With respect to core services, we think core services should be 
those services deemed essential to the health care of Canadians 
as defined by health care users, practitioners, local 
administrators and provincial governments.
<P>
	I explained in my speech specifically that we should not try to 
say what those services are. That is what got Ottawa into trouble 
in the first place. It made a commitment to a whole range of 
services which it could not continue to fund.
<P>
	At every public meeting and meetings with the medical 
community that I have had where I have put this health care 
matrix up, you can get an excellent discussion and definition 
from those people if you put up that matrix. I suggest that if the 
minister and the member want to know, go and ask the people 
whose opinion on that definition is the one that counts.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, certainly from what is before us in the opposition 
motion on the national health care system the leader of the 
Reform Party has made it clear at least today that he is for a 
multi-tiered system. Therefore it is now clear to Canadians that 
the Reform Party wants to destroy the medicare that we have 
today.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> You destroyed it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pagtakhan:</B> They can say anything, Madam Speaker, but 
Canadians are serious. They are not laughing about medicare. 
Canadians want to preserve medicare.
<P>
	Does the hon. member believe that the single tier system is the 
best system in the world in terms of cost effectiveness? If the 
member does not believe that, I would refer him to the report of 
the Surgeon General's office in the United States. It has shown 
that indeed we have a lot of savings by having a publicly 
administered single tier system.
<P>
	The second point is when the member spoke about health care 
funding I am not clear as to his understanding of funding for 
health. Does it mean only public spending on health or private 
spending on health? I can see from his speech that he would like 
to shift the cost of health care spending from the government to 
private individuals, the citizens. However, he has no proposal 
whatsoever that will contain the cost of proper health care 
spending which is the critical question facing Canadians to 
preserve our medicare system.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manning:</B> In response to the first question: Is the current 
system the most cost effective in the world? No, it is not. This is 
obvious. This is not a matter for debate. Study after study has 
indicated that the costs are out of control with respect to the 
Canadian system and therefore it cannot be the most cost 
effective.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11851"> 11851 </A></B>
<P>
	The fact that more and more Canadians are seeking health 
care outside the Canadian system itself is evident that there is 
something wrong.
<P>
<B>(1055 ) </B>
<P>
	The government itself professes a great abhorrence of the 
American system. We do not agree with the American system. 
We are not advocating anything of the kind. However, because 
of the actions of the government, it is driving more and more 
Canadians to subsidize the American system to the tune of 
hundreds of millions of dollars a year because they will not stay 
on the waiting lists here.
<P>
	The hon. member is a physician himself. Has he ever sent a 
patient to get health care in the United States because they could 
not get it here or were on a great waiting list under our current 
system?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am sorry, the time has 
expired.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I would like to thank the leader of the third party for 
setting forth in his party's motion a proposal which I would 
qualify as almost perfect, almost perfectly wrong that is. The 
proposal demonstrates clearly that Reform Party members do 
not understand how the Canada health system functions, what 
challenges it faces, what is being done to address those 
challenges, and what solutions are realistic and make sense to 
Canadians.
<P>
	In his medicare proposal and in his pronouncements on the 
Reform Party's views, the leader of the third party has managed 
to put together a package that will simultaneously increase 
bureaucracy, decrease flexibility, maximize federal interference 
in provincial jurisdiction and most of all, increase the cost of 
health care in Canada.
<P>
	How would the Reform Party pay for this? It is simple: It 
would push people into buying private insurance, if it is 
available and if they have the money for it, to cover things which 
are presently covered by medicare. Worst of all, it would tax the 
sick by permitting and even encouraging user fees.
<P>
	The Reform Party proposal and pronouncements are not a 
prescription for a healthy medicare system. They are a 
prescription for disaster. Before dealing with the specifics of 
this motion and of Reform's thinking on medicare, let me 
question the proposals of the Reform Party.
<P>
	Reform's so-called budget proposed surrendering additional 
tax points to the provinces for health care. How precisely does 
this square with its concern about a falling federal share of cash 
contributions? Certainly not well at all. How would the Reform 
Party deal with the fact that tax points yield different revenues in 
each of the provinces? It obviously has not thought of that.
<P>
	How would that party enforce the conditions and criteria of 
the Canada Health Act? It certainly appears it would not.
<P>
	What, if any, evidence do members of the Reform Party have 
to support their expectations that provinces would agree on a 
common level of basic or core health services everywhere in 
Canada as they state they would on page 48 of their so-called 
budget? Are they not aware that a number of provincial 
ministers of health have already indicated that such an approach 
is simplistic and they have no interest in developing a national 
list?
<P>
	Which is the federal role? To determine core services, as the 
motion states, or to have provinces agree on a common level of 
core services as stated in Reform's so-called taxpayers budget? 
How would the leader of the third party coerce the provinces?
<P>
	The Reform Party obviously has no answers for these 
questions. That is the reason its arguments have no basis in fact 
and are almost perfectly wrong. It is soapbox rhetoric which 
could lead to the destruction of medicare, and we are not going 
to have any of it.
<P>
	Take this motion, for example. In dealing with federal 
contributions to provincial health insurance plans, the hon. 
member mixes apples with oranges. He does it all the time, so 
this is nothing new.
<P>
<B>(1100 ) </B>
<P>
	The federal share of funding for health care was never 50 per 
cent of total provincial government health expenditures. As a 
result of cost sharing during the 1960s and early 1970s the 
federal share nationally accounted for roughly 50 per cent of 
provincial expenditures for hospital and medical care only. Even 
then provincial governments were spending on health programs 
for which the federal government did not share costs.
<P>
	Let us look at some real numbers, not those fabricated by the 
Reform Party. In 1975-76 after medicare was introduced the 
federal contribution nationally amounted to 39 per cent of total 
provincial health expenditures. In 1992-93 the federal 
contribution, the sum of the cash in transfers to the provinces for 
health, represented 32 per cent of total provincial government 
health expenditures.
<P>
	Another way to look at the numbers is to examine the federal 
share of total health expenditures in the country. On this basis 
the federal share dropped from 31 per cent in 1975-76 to 24 per 
cent in 1992-93.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Let me repeat it again, so that, hopefully, Reform members 
will understand eventually. In dealing with federal contributions 
to provincial health insurance plans, the Reform Party leader is 
mixing apples with oranges. The federal share of funding for 
health care was never 50 per cent of total provincial government 
health expenditures.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11852"> 11852 </A></B>
<P>
	As a result of cost sharing agreements reached during the 
sixties and the early seventies, the federal share nationally 
accounted for roughly 50 per cent of provincial expenditures 
for hospital and medical care only. Even then, the provincial 
governments were spending on health programs for which the 
federal government did not share costs.
<P>
	Let us look at the real figures, not those fabricated by the 
Reform Party. In 1975-76, after medicare was introduced, the 
federal contribution nationally amounted to 39 per cent of total 
provincial health expenditures. In 1992-93, the federal 
contribution, that is the sum of the cash payments and tax 
transfers to the provinces for health, represented 32 per cent of 
provincial government health expenditures.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	These are all real and public numbers. They should be the 
Reform's numbers because they are the facts.
<P>
	Provinces administer the health care system. I want to make it 
clear and acknowledge in the House what I have said elsewhere. 
Provinces and territories are doing a good job of containing 
costs but historically the costs of provincial health plans 
increased in a less controlled manner. It is in part because of this 
that the federal share of health expenditures has fallen over 
time. If health costs had risen at the average rate of OECD 
countries the federal share would be substantially higher.
<P>
	Expenditures in the public sector are being controlled. Our 
cost control problems are now in the private sector. Pray tell, 
why would we shift more to the private sector so we can have 
even higher and less control of costs?
<P>
	In 1993 Canada spent $72 billion on health care. This 
represented 10 per cent of our gross domestic product. Hon. 
members are aware that with the exception of the United States, 
Canada's health expenditures are the highest of any 
industrialized nation.
<P>
	There is enough money in the system. It is a question of how 
better to spend the money we have. Of the $72 billion spent in 
1993 approximately $52 billion was spent in support of public 
health services while the other $20 billion was spent in the 
private health sector. Lately the public component has been 
growing at less than 2 per cent. On the other hand, private health 
spending has been growing by more than three times that rate.
<P>
<B>(1105) </B>
<P>
	The public sector or single payer system has enabled the 
provinces and territories to better control the rate of increase in 
the growth of health expenditures in the public sector. The 
World Bank's 1993 world development report noted the cost 
effectiveness and control advantages of public sector 
involvement in health: ``In general the OECD countries that 
have contained costs better have greater government control of 
health spending and a larger public sector share of total 
expenditures''.
<P>
	The OECD review of health reform and development in 
Canada also recognized the advantage of a significant public 
sector involvement in health. From the 1993 OECD economic 
survey of Canada: ``The structure of Canada's single payer 
health system lends itself to effective supply management and 
control. It seems the problems of the current system are not 
related to its publicness''.
<P>
	With respect to health expenditures in 1994, preliminary 
estimates by my officials indicate public health expenditures 
declined in aggregate by about 1 per cent in 1994, while private 
expenditures increased at about the same rate as 1993. Under 
these assumptions total health expenditures in 1994 were 
approximately $73 billion for an aggregate increase of less than 
1 per cent, or about $600 million. Expressed as a percentage of 
GDP, total health spending probably declined to about 9.7 per 
cent in 1994.
<P>
	There are a number of reasons we have been more successful 
in controlling health costs in the public sector than in the private 
sector.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We have in each province a structure which provides the same 
coverage to everyone. It is not necessary, therefore, to assess 
individual risks. Payments to providers are made in a simple but 
efficient manner. Financing of the system is simple; everything 
possible is done to reduce costs. In fact, researchers from 
Harvard University found that Canada only spends 1.1 per cent 
of its gross national product on health care management.
<P>
	If we spent as much as the United States do on that, health care 
expenditures would increase by $18.5 billion. Americans spend 
almost two and a half times as much as we do on that. And there 
is no evidence that spending more would improve the health of 
Canadians.
<P>
	The second reason we are in a better position to control costs 
is that there is only one purchaser in our provincial health 
insurance plans. Governments have great clout when it comes to 
negotiating the level of costs of services. They can set overall 
budgets for hospital and physician services. In fact, they have 
done so, as indicated by the figures I quoted.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As Minister of Health I want Canadians to continue to have 
access to high quality health care at a price they can afford. That 
is why I am working with my provincial and territorial 
colleagues as well as other stakeholders to address cost drivers 
in both the public and private health sectors. So much for the 
first part of Reform's motion.
<P>
	Let me now deal with the second part which calls for a listing 
of core services. There is a remarkable degree of congruence 
between the provinces. Among them there is broad agreement as 
to what constitutes the core of ensured physician and hospital 
services. There are some differences from province to province 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11853"> 11853 </A></B>
<P>
but these simply demonstrate the flexibility which provinces 
can and do  exercise in providing a range of additional benefits 
to their residents. That is not wrong. That is a strength of our 
system; a system characterized by sound consensus on what are 
core services or medically necessary services.
<P>
	The list of covered procedures and services of necessity must 
be flexible. That is because the way we deliver health care and 
the opportunities which new technologies and procedures create 
dictate changes need to be incorporated over time. There is 
almost no service not medically appropriate in some cases.
<P>
<B>(1110) </B>
<P>
	For example, plastic surgery may be considered medically 
necessary when it is intended to correct a medical condition. 
Reconstructing a nose to correct a breathing problem is labelled 
cosmetic surgery but clearly it is a medically necessary 
procedure.
<P>
	Other examples include removal of minor skin lesions when 
cancer is suspected and tattoo removal in the case of abuse or 
prisoner of war experiences.
<P>
	For the most part in Canada we have left the definition of 
medical necessity to professionals, not bureaucrats. The 
medical necessity of a service is determined at the point of 
delivery of the service. That is what the Canada Health Act has 
allowed. It is based on the medical needs of the patient, not the 
financial means of the consumer. That is the way it should be; 
this is simple fairness.
<P>
	Canadians do not want cash register medicare. This stands in 
sharp contrast to what is happening with managed care in the 
U.S. There, third party insurers tell physicians what they cover 
and what they can or cannot do for their patients. So much for 
clinical freedom.
<P>
	This reality is one of the major reasons why a significant 
portion of doctors who leave Canada to practise in the U.S. do 
come back home.
<P>
	The Reform Party says it stands for smaller government, less 
bureaucracy. Therefore I find it strange it is suggesting a process 
that would actually increase bureaucracy. Let there be no doubt, 
producing the list of medically necessary or core services would 
involve more bureaucracy.
<P>
	Medical necessity is an integral part of the understanding and 
operation of the Canada Health Act. It is at the very heart of the 
principle of comprehensiveness.
<P>
	In the Canada Health Act the words medically necessary are 
used in conjunction with other conditions. This ensures that 
once a service has been determined to be medically necessary 
and insured by provincial health insurance plans it is accessible 
in uniform terms and conditions by all residents of the province 
and available to them when they travel across the country.
<P>
	In a manner of speaking, these become rights of Canadians. 
These are rights the Canada Health Act is there to protect. 
Canadians expect they will have medically necessary services 
available without point of service charges. They are right in this 
expectation. This is why facility fees for medically necessary 
services in private clinics are unacceptable and why I took steps 
to address this problem in January.
<P>
	A rigid list of medically necessary services encourages the 
development of a second tier of health care delivery. It promotes 
privatization and shifting the burden of costs from society to 
individuals. These costs would then be borne by patients or by 
their employers.
<P>
	Reformers, who profess to know what is good for business, 
should ask business people what they think about this idea. Let 
them talk to the owners of small businesses, the independent 
entrepreneurs who account for so much economic growth in our 
country, who have tried to buy insurance to cover the health cost 
of their employees. They know how costly it is already and they 
appreciate how much more expensive it would be if they had to 
cover more services and medically necessary services as well.
<P>
	I ask Reform Party members, in particular the member for 
Macleod who is a physician, to tell us which services they think 
are not medically necessary, which services they think should be 
deinsured and which services they think individual patients 
should pay for.
<P>
	Even the premier of Alberta is unable to provide a list of what 
these should be. The government's agenda is a national one. It is 
aimed at doing what is necessary to renew our health care 
system to make it more efficient and effective. It is an agenda 
based on better health outcomes, not better incomes.
<P>
	The motion before us urges me to consult with provinces. 
Since becoming Minister of Health I have made it clear I want to 
work with provinces and territories and I have. I have met my 
provincial colleagues. I talk to them on a frequent basis. We 
have arrived at a consensus about the need to support the 
principles of the Canada Health Act. Perhaps he should consult 
with more provinces than he has.
<P>
<B>(1115 ) </B>
<P>
	I am prepared to continue this collaboration. Our next regular 
meeting is scheduled for September, but I have already told the 
provinces that I am ready to meet with them earlier. There is no 
lack of willingness by this government and this minister to work 
with the provinces, the territories and others to ensure that 
Canadians continue to have the very best health care system in 
the world.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11854"> 11854 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, the minister concluded her remarks by expressing her 
desire to co-operate, collaborate and work with the provinces, 
and we applaud that. That is constitutionally correct and is the 
only way the system will be fixed.
<P>
	However in the course of her remarks she used an unfortunate 
phrase. I trust it was a slip of the tongue when she asked 
rhetorically how we can coerce the provinces into national 
standards if we do not retain the present system.
<P>
	Surely the minister is aware that she is losing her capacity to 
coerce the provinces as federal cash transfers decline. She is 
also aware that it is possible to have national standards without 
coercion as we have, for example, in the field of education 
where there is the universal standard that everyone under 16 
years of age gets a free education. That was established as a 
national standard without any national education act or coercion 
on the part of the federal government.
<P>
	This talk of coercing the provinces into national standards as 
her financial position weakens is completely contrary to the 
spirit of federalism and what she said later on. I should like to 
give the minister an opportunity to withdraw that statement and 
indicate that she did not mean in any way, shape or form to say 
she favours coercion of the provinces, which is a polite word for 
blackmail, into national health care standards.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Marleau:</B> Madam Speaker, my response to that is to go 
on to say that again they do not listen to what I am saying. I have 
asked the Reform Party to explain how it would coerce the 
provinces into having a uniform list of core services, and it 
certainly has not answered that. Its type of top down solution is 
not exactly what I am talking about.
<P>
	We are getting a strange mixture of things from the Reform 
Party. On the one hand I heard the leader of the Reform Party go 
on at length about allowing the provinces to have more 
flexibility to allow those in the regions to be better able to 
deliver services. On the other hand his party is asking us to work 
with the provinces to develop a hard line definition of what is 
covered and what is not. There would be a list and we would 
need a whole series of bureaucrats to make sure it is really this 
and not that and therefore would not be covered. It always 
astounds me because the Reform Party cannot have it both ways.
<P>
	By the way, we enforce principles not standards. The Canada 
Health Act talks about five fundamental principles. Those 
principles have served us very well.
<P>
	The type of fear mongering and statements made by the leader 
of the Reform Party saying that our health care system is not 
doing well are wrong. While I will admit that changes are 
needed and we have to continue to work on it, the idea is for us to 
shape the future of medicare. That is what the provinces, 
working along with the federal government, are very much 
working on to  deal with the new technologies and to ensure the 
dollars spent on health go directly to those things that are most 
needed.
<P>
	Change is difficult. It is not easy. Throwing more money at it 
will not make it better. We will end up with a system like the one 
in the United States. That is exactly what the Reform Party is 
promoting.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, the 
minister has gone on at great length to talk about our proposal 
for a definition of core essential issues. She said that this was 
some kind of nefarious scheme that had never been thought of or 
heard of in Canada before.
<P>
<B>(1120 ) </B>
<P>
	Could the minister explain when the Prime Minister said 
shortly after the budget on the Peter Gzowski program that we 
must return more to basics in our health care system? That is not 
an exact quote but very close to an exact quote.
<P>
	Could the Minister of Health explain what the Prime Minister 
was referring to when he said that we were trying to do too much 
with our public funding? That is not a question the minister 
should be able to dance around and avoid. It is a fairly 
straightforward question.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Marleau:</B> Madam Speaker, the Prime Minister has been a 
member of Parliament for 32 years. He does not need lessons on 
medicare from the Reform Party. Let us make that perfectly 
clear. He was here when medicare was brought forward. He saw 
the growth and the best of medicare. That is why he is such a 
staunch defender of it. That is what we are talking about.
<P>
	The member for Macleod talks about core or medically 
necessary services and having lists. Certainly they are things 
that have been talked about. The premier of Alberta talks about 
them all the time and he has not been able to come up with a list.
<P>
	I would understand if the member for Macleod would agree. 
After all, he is and was at another time in his life a physician. 
Does he not believe it is far better for physicians, medical 
practitioners, to make that determination when they have 
someone before them? They look at the evidence before them 
and know what is medically necessary or not, or they should 
know.
<P>
	With the help of the Medical Research Council and many 
other agencies we are proposing to look at evidence based 
outcomes. Many procedures have been performed that perhaps 
do not have any real value. Those kinds of procedures should not 
be performed any more. We need to do a lot more research in that 
field. A lot of it is being done and we will continue to do it. We 
are proposing clinical guidelines so that there are fairly uniform 
ways of determining.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11855"> 11855 </A></B>
<P>
	When we hear about an excessively high rate of 
hysterectomies in one area versus another area when the 
composition of the communities is essentially the same, there 
is something wrong. We will work at addressing some very 
serious discrepancies, but that is not to say that we should have 
a strictly defined list. I still believe that patients, along with 
their physicians and their caregivers, should be the ones to 
determine what is medically necessary.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul E. Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I have a question for the Minister of Health. 
Canadians are faced with a fundamental dilemma: there is less 
government money to go around to support medicare as we 
know it yet everyone wants to preserve medicare.
<P>
	How do we reallocate tax dollars and in general bring more 
resources to bear on medicare in a climate of economic 
restraint? A lot of our problem is really not internal to medicare 
but rather the fiscal climate within which it is trying to operate.
<P>
	Could the minister clarify the larger fiscal climate that affects 
medicare and the solution to that dilemma? How do we address 
the overall funding shortfalls for medicare that are getting worse 
every day? It is a national problem. What will the federal 
government do about it?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Marleau:</B> I have said and I will repeat that there is 
enough money in the system. However I will say there are some 
areas where we have to set our priorities. Medicare is a priority. 
It is a priority for the federal government and it is a priority for 
most provincial governments. They have to base their financial 
decisions on their priorities.
<P>
	We are doing it here. We are working at setting our fiscal 
house in order because we understand we have to do certain 
things to preserve and protect the very sacred programs which 
are constitutive to our identity.
<P>
<B>(1125 ) </B>
<P>
	That is what medicare is. It defines what Canadians really are 
and it shows the values of caring and sharing which have helped 
to build this great country. We will continue supporting these 
solid values.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
welcome this opportunity to rise in the House and speak to the 
motion presented by our Reform Party colleagues, a motion that 
concerns Canada's health care system. Although we are aware of 
and condemn the federal government's unilateral withdrawal 
from the funding of health care services in Canada, the Bloc 
Quebecois cannot support this motion.
<P>
	It is true that, as far as funding for health care is concerned, 
the federal government has betrayed the provinces by reneging 
on its commitments. It is true that, by continuing to impose its 
standards in an area over which the provinces have jurisdiction, 
while refusing to pay the real cost, the federal government acts 
like the charming host who invites you out to dinner but leaves 
you with the bill. We agree with our Reform Party colleagues 
that we should condemn, loud and clear, the present 
government's shameful withdrawal of funding from health care 
programs.
<P>
	By continuing the work started by the previous Conservative 
government, which it deplored at the time, the present 
government has made the advent of a two-tier and two-speed 
health care system unavoidable throughout Canada. That is the 
tangible result of these harsh but insidious unilateral cutbacks in 
transfer payments to the provinces for established programs 
financing. However, the Bloc Quebecois could never support a 
proposal that the federal government become involved in 
determining core and non-core services, a prerogative exclusive 
to Quebec and the other provinces.
<P>
	To establish a national list of core services would be a denial 
of the authority of the provinces to determine the kind of care 
they feel is necessary to maintain the health of the public that 
depends directly on the provinces for those services. Another 
reason why we cannot support this motion is that the Reform 
Party proposes to open the door wide to private insurers. 
Although federal cuts in funding for the public health care 
system in Canada has led to a proliferation of private clinics 
across the country, the Bloc Quebecois cannot support the 
advent of a two-tier system, one for the rich and one for the 
poor.
<P>
	The present government's position on the management and 
funding of Canada's health care system is at best ambivalent. To 
me, it is clear the federal government can no longer afford its 
ambitious plans for managing the health care system. The 
trouble is, it does not come out and say so to the taxpayer, since 
by cutting spending unilaterally in a jurisdiction it appropriated 
at the time, the federal government has shifted the responsibility 
for breaking the bad news to the provinces. It takes credit for 
giving us the best health care services in the world, but it will no 
longer provide funding to maintain the standards it has set and 
compensate for the tax room it appropriated to pay the real cost 
of the system.
<P>
	We should not be surprised that the health care system is 
coming apart at the seams, and mainly because of the federal 
government's withdrawal of funding. However, the government 
should be frank and make this clear to the taxpayers, instead of 
trying to camouflage the whole situation with its new Canada 
Social Transfer. It should stop trying to fool the public and give 
the impression that the whole might be better than the sum of its 
parts.
<P>
	When the total amount of transfer payments is reduced in the 
Canada Social Transfer, it means there is less money for 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11856"> 11856 </A></B>
<P>
education, less money for social assistance and less money for 
health care. One would have to be very naive to believe, as the 
Minister of Health seems to think, that this new approach will 
make it possible to safeguard Canada's health care system 
without involving a major departure from its main principles.
<P>
<B>(1130) </B>
<P>
	In its last budget, the government introduced several 
measures which are a threat to our social programs. It cut 
transfer payments by $7 billion, which amounts to offloading $7 
billion of its deficit onto the provinces.
<P>
	The most recent cut in transfer payments is just one more in a 
series of unilaterally announced cuts over the past few years, a 
practice the members of this government used to protest loudly 
against back when they were in opposition. Between 1977 and 
1994, the federal government's share in social program 
funding-health, education and social assistance-dropped 
from 47.6 per cent to 37.8 per cent. The latest budget follows 
suit with a draconian cut to the federal government's funding 
share, which will have sunk to 28.5 per cent by the end of the 
next two years.
<P>
	After so many years of offloading to the provinces, the federal 
government still has not learned that cutting transfer payments 
is not helping to fix the financial problems of all of the 
governments in Canada. By insisting on governing areas over 
which its own Constitution gives the provinces exclusive power, 
the federal government is preventing the country from finding 
any real solution to its financial crisis, both at the federal and 
provincial levels.
<P>
	We are clearly witnessing the dismantling, the crumbling of 
the health care system as we have known it up to now. The very 
essence of the motion before us today bears witness to this. It 
also confirms the dismal conclusions drawn at the provincial 
health ministers' conference, which was held in Vancouver 
earlier this month.
<P>
	We all know that Quebec and the other provinces are facing a 
dizzying increase in health care costs. This increase is due 
mainly to the following factors: an ageing population; new, 
more expensive, medical technology, and a significant increase 
in spending on pharmaceutical products.
<P>
	In the last budget, like other budgets before in which transfers 
were frozen, the government substantially cut transfers to 
Quebec and to other provinces for health care. Regardless of 
whether these transfers are lumped with others in one envelope 
called the Canada social transfer, the effect is the same: less 
money will be available for health care and, in this way, the 
government is eating away at the foundations of our health care 
system.
<P>
	Nobody in this House can ignore the radical changes being 
made across the country to the health care system as we know it. 
A two-tier and two-speed health care system is no longer a 
prediction, but a reality.
<P>
	I cite as proof the Prime Minister's latest statements, in which 
he quietly and furtively introduced the new concept of 
guaranteeing Canadians basic health care services only. By 
alluding himself to essential minimum standards, which are 
neither identified nor formulated, the Prime Minister is 
acknowledging the evidence emerging everywhere in Canada of 
a two-tier and two-speed health care system.
<P>
	The two-tier health care system is evidenced by a trend, 
which is well established in the system and which, without 
drastic change, will become the norm. There will be a basic 
service covered by health insurance and there will be the full 
specialty service paid for by user fees, private insurance or some 
other financial arrangement.
<P>
	The two-speed system is already well established throughout 
Canada: slow public service for those without the means to pay 
and quick private service for those who cannot afford to wait, 
but who have the means to pay the cost of a private clinic.
<P>
	During his budget speech, the Minister of Finance solemnly 
stated, and I quote: ``The conditions of the Canada Health Act 
will be maintained. For this government, those [principles] are 
fundamental''. The government is maintaining the obligation to 
meet national standards, but, in the same breath, it is cutting the 
means to maintain them.
<P>
<B>(1135) </B>
<P>
	It is shameful double talk: we want to go to heaven, but 
nobody wants to die. The government says it is up to the 
provinces to organize themselves and all that. It would have us 
believe that this is flexible federalism.
<P>
	How can the government still think and argue that the 
provinces will keep the same health services for the public? 
How will Quebec and the other provinces successfully apply the 
five main principles of the Canada Health Act, which Ottawa is 
requiring them to do as it dumps billions of dollars of deficit on 
them through cuts to social programs?
<P>
	The government should be strong and come clean with 
Canadians by telling them that, unfortunately, because of its 
errors in the past, primarily in the ChrÃ©tien and Lalonde 
budgets, it no longer has the means to maintain our health care 
system as we know it. But no, the government is deceiving the 
people by hiding the spectre of the demise of social programs 
due to so many years of bad management, of diluting provincial 
jurisdictions and of wastage, because it used its spending power 
to centralize and unify.
<P>
	Quebec and Canadian taxpayers hand significant sums of 
money over to the federal government, and a portion of it was 
always set aside for health care under the 1977 agreement. The 
problem is that, for the past 12 years, the  federal government 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11857"> 11857 </A></B>
<P>
has not been returning the amount due the provinces to them, 
thus diverting money intended for health care. Instead, it 
transfers to the provinces the deficit it has accumulated because 
of its inability to bring its own expenditures under control. The 
federal government must be sensitive to and, more importantly, 
aware of the fact that, by increasing the tax burden of the 
provinces in this way, it is creating a two-tier health system.
<P>
	We believe in the general principles of universality, 
comprehensiveness, accessibility, portability and public 
administration of health care. What we denounce is the fact that 
these five general principles are now seriously threatened in 
Quebec and all the provinces by the federal government's failure 
to honour its commitments.
<P>
	Reducing or freezing federal transfer payments jeopardizes 
our health system. When it was first passed, the legislation 
governing established programs financing provided that 45 per 
cent of health costs were to be paid via Ottawa. However, 
because of the economic crisis in the early 1980s and the 
catastrophic condition of public finances at the federal level, the 
federal government began unilateral withdrawal action that will 
result, in 1997, in federal contributions being half of what they 
used to be. This withdrawal from financial commitments, 
repeatedly described as unacceptable, unfair and inconsistent by 
the Quebec government, did not lead to less interference from 
Ottawa. Not only does Ottawa continue to impose national 
standards, it interferes through parallel programs, thereby 
causing costly overlap.
<P>
	This results in constant pressure toward the introduction of 
user fees and other billing methods, the curtailment of coverage 
for certain services, a service tax on drugs, bed closures and 
major budget cuts in hospital centres as well as disgustingly 
long waiting lists in several areas.
<P>
	This is to say that the very foundations of our health system, 
namely free care, universality and accessibility, are in jeopardy. 
What does the minister think of her government's withdrawal 
from its commitments and the hardship caused to provincial 
health ministries? I think that, if she pays any attention to what 
goes on in her own department, the minister must be fully aware 
of the serious implications of such action on our health system. 
She must certainly see that all the leaks in the system will 
inevitably lead to a two-tier system, a two-speed system.
<P>
	Since she took office, the hon. minister has repeated over and 
over that the Canadian health system is the best in the world and 
that she cares so much for the health of Canadians that she would 
never give up the five general principles laid down in the Canada 
Health Act.
<P>
	Reality, however, is something else altogether. If she does 
not, as she claims, sacrifice these five general principles laid 
down in the Canada Health Act, her colleague, the Minister of 
Finance, on the other hand, certainly does not mind doing so.
<P>
<B>(1140) </B>
<P>
	By taking the axe to established programs financing, the 
Minister of Finance is eviscerating the health care system, 
principles or no principles. They may swear that they are 
committed to the principles set out in the legislation, but if they 
do not provide the money needed to enforce them, what will 
happen? The principles will fade away one after the other, 
slowly but surely.
<P>
	I freely admit that the Minister of Health may be committed to 
the principles that guided the implementation of what she 
always likes to refer to as the best health care system in the 
world. However, I think that this commitment, however 
profound, did not weigh very heavily in budget decisions. It 
must be recognized that the minister failed miserably in her 
attempt to secure the funds needed for the smooth operation of 
the health care system.
<P>
	In fact, the Minister of Health renounced her responsibility. 
When the 1994 budget was tabled, she announced with great 
pomp that the National Forum on Health promised in the red 
book would be held under the chairmanship of none other than 
the Prime Minister himself. The health care system was 
supposed to be spared until the results of these widespread 
consultations were known. Although the Minister of Health 
succeeded in holding her forum, which was supposed to solve all 
the problems, the Minister of Finance for his part did not beat 
around the bush. Saying to hell with the forum, with 
consultations and reforms, he decided that the remedy lay in 
blind, uniform, unilateral cuts across the board.
<P>
	The Minister of Health, who, like us, must see a two-tier 
system developing across Canada, should have the courage to 
rise in this House and denounce her government's unilateral 
cuts.
<P>
	It is not true that user services will remain the same. It is not 
true that the provinces, to which the federal deficit hot potato 
has been passed on, will perform miracles with shrinking 
resources. The minister should agree with this analysis since it 
reflects her own interpretation delivered in this House on March 
9, 1992, when she was a member of the opposition.
<P>
	What we must realize is that, by perpetuating the mistakes of 
the past, the government is moving toward the position held by 
the Reform Party, that is, a two-tier health care system that is 
partly public and partly private. The difference is that the 
Reform Party does it directly and openly by tabling a motion, 
whereas the government does it in an underhand and 
hypocritical manner by refusing to face reality and admit that it 
can no longer afford to pursue its ambitions.
<P>
	The government finds itself in that position because it does 
not have the will to cut elsewhere in its spending and to review 
its fiscal policy. The government is prepared to sacrifice health, 
but it does not hesitate to maintain useless and costly duplica-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11858"> 11858 </A></B>
<P>
tion, as well as family trusts, or to pay for costly ministerial 
suites, among other things.
<P>
	Whether it is through the government's approach or the one 
proposed by the Reform Party, the Bloc Quebecois cannot 
support the destruction of our health care program. If the federal 
government no longer has the means to meddle in this field of 
provincial jurisdiction, it should completely withdraw from it 
and leave it to the provinces, with the tax room that goes with it. 
In doing so, the government would at least save the 
administrative costs of the federal programs which duplicate 
similar provincial initiatives. Both the federal and provincial 
governments would benefit, not to mention Canadians, who 
would definitely get more for the same amount of money.
<P>
	The failure of the health care program reflects the failure of a 
centralizing federalism. That program can no longer be a great 
tool to promote Canadian unity, as this government would so 
dearly love. Let us do without symbols which we cannot afford. 
Let us be realistic. The federal government must stop trying to 
impose its utopian vision of an egalitarian Canada and withdraw 
from those sectors, including taxation, which fall under 
provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	This is the Bloc's position and this is why we reject the 
motion.
<P>
<B>(1145) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, first, I would like to thank the hon. member for taking 
part in this debate and for having made a speech here, but I think 
that she may have missed one or two things in mine. First, 
Canada is second in the world regarding the overall sums spent 
on health care. No expert, no economist anywhere would tell us 
we should be spending more. Not a one. We know that we could 
even do more with less.
<P>
	I am sure that Quebec's Minister of Health agrees with me on 
this point, because, this year, he is proposing a half billion dollar 
cut, $545 million to be exact, I believe, to the health care budget 
of the province of Quebec. So he too probably realizes that we 
do not need to pump more money into the health care system, but 
to better manage the amounts we do put into it. These things 
need to be said because this year's transfer payment has not been 
reduced but increased.
<P>
	The Canada Health Act gives the provinces a lot of leeway. In 
fact, they already have all of the freedom they could want, 
except to levy user fees or charges for hospital care or medical 
help.
<P>
	The fact that the Canada Health Act prohibits user fees is 
important, and Canadians should appreciate that this legislation 
can help them, especially when they are sick.
<P>
	The hon. member talked about overlap. The federal 
government only employs 25 people to administer the Canada 
Health Act. Is that overlap? In my opinion, we are doing quite a 
good job, because we are working very closely with the 
provinces to avoid overlap, especially in the area of health care.
<P>
	The hon. member made a fine speech, but what I really want to 
know is the following: Does the Bloc Quebecois support the 
principles of the Canada Health Act or does it envision a 
two-tier system? Does it want to bring in user fees? Exactly how 
does the Bloc Quebecois intend to do things better or to change 
things? Does the Bloc Quebecois acknowledge that the Canada 
Health Act has served Canadians very well and that we 
absolutely must build the system of tomorrow on the values it 
contains?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Picard:</B> First of all, Madam Speaker, I want to thank the 
minister for her questions.
<P>
	I would like to remind her of the position of the Bloc 
Quebecois. In 1977, when the five main criteria in the Canada 
Health Act were adopted, agreements were concluded with the 
provinces. The gist of these agreements was that the federal 
government would transfer to the provinces the money they 
would need to administer the health care system.
<P>
	With respect to the cuts I mentioned earlier and to what I said 
in my speech, I would like to point out to the minister that she 
misunderstood entirely what I was trying to say, because I 
always said the Bloc Quebecois supported the five main 
principles of the Canada Health Act. However, we object when 
the government cuts transfer payments and then asks the 
provinces to do more with less money, when we know that the-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Picard:</B> Exactly, if you had not cut transfer payments, 
Mr. Rochon would not have been able to-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Picard:</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to quote from the 
speech the minister made in 1992: ``Cutting back on the 
transfers in these areas has not contributed to better 
management of our health care system. We have literally forced 
our deficit onto the provinces and said to the provinces they 
have a choice: they can either increase their taxes or cut back on 
their services. What we have seen in many cases is a mix of the 
two''.
<P>
<B>(1150) </B>
<P>
	In the same speech, the minister also said: ``Cutting back on 
the transfers in these areas has not contributed to better 
management of our health care system. They have only 
contributed to the cutbacks and to the fear that we feel now 
across the nation, as the middle income group, which is the 
largest group of Canadians, are frightened and afraid of what is 
going to happen to them in the future. Will there be a health care 
system for them, will they be able to get the drugs that they need 
at the prices they 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11859"> 11859 </A></B>
<P>
can afford to pay when they need them, when they get to be a 
certain age. There is this feeling that  perhaps the federal 
government is letting go of its responsibilities in this matter''.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
in the comments of the hon. member for Drummond, the 
statement is made that the federal government is attempting to 
keep Canada together by using medicare. The member should 
realize that medicare is not a vehicle to try to keep Canada 
together. It is one vehicle that has kept Canada together and 
makes it the best country in the world.
<P>
	The five principles of the Canada Health Act are universality, 
accessibility, portability, public administration and 
comprehensiveness.
<P>
	I ask the member which of those principles she does not 
support and why does she feel medicare is not working?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Picard:</B> Madam Speaker, the Bloc Quebecois agrees 
with the five main principles of the Canada Health Act. 
However, and I repeat, we do not agree with dumping the deficit 
onto the provinces by reducing transfer payments to them, while 
they are facing increased health costs. The government reduces 
the payments and then tells the provinces they have to manage 
the health care system as usual, as the act provided in 1977.
<P>
	I myself do not want a two-tier or a two-speed system. 
However, if things continue the way they are going, the 
provinces will be forced to find a way to manage to serve the 
public and administer the health care system, because they 
cannot manage it with the cuts in the transfer payments. This is 
what is happening, and the government keeps on cutting. The 
effect of this, at the moment, is that it is better to be rich and 
healthy than poor and sick.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Eleni Bakopanos (Saint-Denis, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it is unfortunate the Bloc Quebecois can only repeat 
that it is the government's fault. How is it that the Minister of 
Health in Quebec cut $454 million from his budget, when the 
federal government's transfer payment actually went up? The 
blame need not always be placed on the federal government, 
because provincial governments make their own choices. The 
choice the PQ minister and government made was to cut in the 
area of health care on the backs of the poor, just like you said.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Picard:</B> Madam Speaker, why did Mr. Rochon, the 
Quebec Minister of Health, have to cut his administration in 
order to continue to manage certain forms of health care? 
Because there was a shortfall of $8 billion.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> There you have it.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> That is the truth.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Picard:</B> In terms of health care transfers since 1982-83, 
Quebec will yet again be shortchanged by Ottawa, by $2.4 billion 
between now and 1997-98. Then, with the increase in health 
care costs and the cost of new technology, it is supposed to do 
more with less? How can health ministers ensure that the five 
main principles are applied if transfer payments and social 
programs are cut. I do not understand how your constituents are 
not fighting this. You have just cut social programs.
<P>
<B>(1155) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, health 
care is too important to be left to politicians.
<P>
	I would like to quote the Prime Minister, as I did in the 
question and comment portion of the debate. The Prime Minister 
has said to all Canadians, in a public forum, that we must go 
back to basics. I would also like to quote the health minister 
when she said, in reference to the Canada Health Act, that we 
will enforce the provisions of the Canada Health Act but we will 
be very, very flexible.
<P>
	On those two comments and those two reflections on health 
care I am in wholehearted agreement. That statement will come 
back to haunt me. I know I will be quoted as saying that I 
wholeheartedly agree with the Prime Minister and the health 
minister on all issues of health care. I agree with those 
statements in particular.
<P>
	When I say that health care is too important to be left to 
politicians, how would I determine where health care should go? 
I would line up in these halls 100 high school students and I 
would make a speech in this Chamber, much as I am doing today. 
I would ask the health minister to do the same, and I would ask 
for the old-fashioned thumbs up or thumbs down on the 
proposals of the health minister and my proposals. I would 
determine whether or not I was on base with health care reform 
or whether the health minister had it right. It is the old Roman up 
or down. Maybe the pages could do it for me today.
<P>
	If the Prime Minister and the health minister and I are so close 
on the issue of health care reform-those were basic statements, 
brand new statements, statements that have not been made in our 
country for some years-where do we differ? Frankly, we differ 
on the cause of the need for health care reform.
<P>
	I will now go to a brand new survey from Statistics Canada on 
government spending. The figures I am quoting do not come 
from the Reform Party, they do not come from a strange source, 
they come directly from StatsCan.
<P>
	In 1994-95 the federal government will spend $1,522 per 
person on servicing the debt. What will the federal government 
spend on health care per person that same year? Two hundred 
and sixty-eight dollars. That is the reason we stand in the House 
today debating the future of the health care system. Anyone who 
stands up and says  that is not the reason is an ostrich, hiding his 
or her head in the sand, ready to be plucked.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11860"> 11860 </A></B>
<P>
	Teenagers in Canada will not listen to that kind of nonsense 
any longer. Fifteen hundred and twenty-two dollars per person 
on debt servicing is squeezing the heart out of the $268 left for 
health care.
<P>
	Reformers are looking for specific, positive solutions. To do 
what? To rip the heart out of health care? Not a chance. To 
preserve and save this most valuable of our social programs. 
Therein lies the problem. Therein lies the anchor. Therein lies 
the noose for health care.
<P>
	My focus with these words will be the Canada Health Act 
itself. The health minister said: ``I want Canadians to know that 
the Canada Health Act is alive and well and able to take on the 
challenges of the future''.
<P>
<B>(1200 ) </B>
<P>
	I have another quote from Dr. Steven Stern of Ajax, Ontario: 
``We must recognize the financial crisis in most provinces that 
has rendered the Canada Health Act hopelessly obsolete and the 
fantasy of supplying all medical services to all of the people all 
of the time from ever escalating middle class taxation is a futile 
hallucination''.
<P>
	I believe the Canada Health Act is in trouble. I believe the 
Canada Health Act needs help. I believe Canadians will no 
longer allow rhetoric to judge whether the Canada Health Act 
will survive.
<P>
	What has broken down in the act? I will talk specifically about 
provisions in the act that are failing. First, on portability, the act 
guarantees services provided to Canadians outside the country 
will be paid for at the same rate as if a person got sick in Canada. 
That is broken. Snowbirds who travel to Florida and come back 
to Ontario are paid $100 per day per hospital visit. There is not a 
hospital in Canada that can provide $100 per day service. 
Portability is broken.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In ``la belle province'', Quebec, there is a provision to the 
effect that each doctor is entitled to a certain portion. Here in 
Ontario, the portion is not the same.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Portability is broken and the minister knows it. The minister 
knows the Canada Health Act is falling down in portability.
<P>
	On accessibility and reasonable access, where are we with 
reasonable access guaranteed in the Canada Health Act? One 
specific breakdown is that Manitobans are waiting 60 weeks for 
hip replacements when the norm is 12 weeks. Reasonable access 
is toast under the Canada Health Act.
<P>
	Comprehensiveness is another plank of the Canada Health 
Act. How about the issue of what is medically necessary? Here 
we have provinces unilaterally deciding to take test tube babies 
off the medically necessary list and put on sex change. Those 
two things might be discussible under the provision of 
medically necessary. This is arbitrary and fragments health care 
across Canada.
<P>
	What about the bill's provision-this is not one of the planks 
of health care but one of the very basic provisions of the Canada 
Health Act-that there will be a prevention of user fees?
<P>
	In the House I have mentioned to the Minister of Health-this 
is not a unique thing to the province I will mention-that there is 
a hospital in Wolfville, Nova Scotia whose facilities were being 
shut down. It stated its facility was too important to be shut 
down. The province stated it could not afford the facility any 
longer but the staff was to keep it running. How were they to 
keep it running? By volunteer nurses, by a fee for the syringe, 
the local anaesthetic and the suture so that each patient who 
comes in with a laceration now pays for those basic facilities. Is 
it a user fee? Yes. Is it medically necessary? Yes. Is it the choice 
of the people in Wolfville, Nova Scotia? Yes. Should they be 
allowed to have that choice? Yes. It is their health; we should not 
be leaving this issue to the politicians.
<P>
<B>(1205 ) </B>
<P>
	The act guarantees, and this is not commonly known, 
reasonable compensation to practitioners who provide the 
services. I know of three provinces which have broken 
agreements with their medical practitioners unilaterally, 
agreements signed, sealed and delivered. Is reasonable 
compensation being given? The act is broken and there are no 
repercussions for that.
<P>
	If the act is broken and I ask the minister to stand up and tell 
Canadians that what I have said is inaccurate or untrue, should 
the minister be protecting this most valuable act? I think she 
should. Her reaction is to reinterpret sections of the act. She has 
gone on to define the hospital to include private clinics. She has 
decided semi-private clinics do not deserve the funds they have 
been getting. That issue is one that we may argue a lot but this 
does not sound like going after the basic principles of the act to 
me at all.
<P>
	We have been over funding provisions. I hear members of the 
Bloc say the federal government should not be withdrawing 
funding. There is no question in my mind the federal 
government has no choice. I do not think there is any point in 
going back and deciding the reasons for these choices. The 
federal government has no choice.
<P>
	I listened to more rhetoric not so long ago in my province of 
Alberta. The Prime Minister says the Canada Health Act does 
not allow private health care. I shook my head when I heard that, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11861"> 11861 </A></B>
<P>
recognizing that almost 30 per  cent of what is provided in 
Canadian health care is private.
<P>
	I asked the Prime Minister about the Shouldice Hospital in 
Ontario for hernias, about totally private laser eye surgery, 
about physiosports medicine clinics, about chiropractic, about 
cosmetic surgery that has been taken out of the fee schedule, 
about laser treatment for snoring, sleep apnea and bad breath. 
All these things are available so close to the House of Commons 
privately and there is no room under the Canada Health Act for 
private health?
<P>
	We have two tier health in Canada now. We will end up if we 
ignore the Canada Health Act, if we do not improve the Canada 
Health Act, with universal access to nothing. The $1,522 of debt 
servicing will choke that $268 and we will kiss it goodbye, and 
that will be wrong.
<P>
	This is not an answer that comes from me but I am now 
elucidating the answer from my colleagues. My answer is to 
give sensible Canadians choice over their most important 
resource, their own health. That is why I would line up the 100 
high school students.
<P>
	A journalist phoned me the other day. He said: ``I will ask you 
what you mean by your core essential services because I have 
asked a whole host of other individuals in Canada and none of 
them will tell me what they would take out of the core essentials. 
I know you will do it because you Reformers are not filled with 
political rhetoric yet''. I had the opportunity to tell him some of 
the things I would take out.
<P>
	For members opposite I will give a specific example of one 
thing I would take out of our broad health care coverage and put 
beyond the core essentials. This is actually being done in 
Quebec. The members of the Bloc will not be interested in this. 
Quebec has decided that psychoanalysis is no longer coverable 
under health care. Psychoanalysis is the treatment where one 
lies on the bed, the psychiatrist sits there and one comes in week 
after week for years on end to figure out what was the matter 
with one's psyche.
<P>
<B>(1210) </B>
<P>
	Quebecers in their wisdom, I give them credit, have said 
psychoanalysis is not something that should be covered under 
our core essential health care budget. They pay for 
psychotherapy which is much tighter, better controlled, involves 
looking after something like anxiety or suicide, possibly giving 
medication and a fairly rapid return to the workplace.
<P>
	Outpatient psychotherapy is covered and with outpatient 
psychoanalysis you are on your own. You can either get 
insurance coverage or pay for it out of your own pocket. In their 
wisdom they are doing what Reformers are suggesting.
<P>
	Will this be a big bureaucratic process? Not on your life. This 
is a process that will also be flexible. This is surely a process 
that our national forum on health should have and could have 
addressed.
<P>
	I listened last night to the minister make a very good speech. 
It was tight and controlled. I really credit her for this. She said, 
using different words and phrases, virtually the same thing I am 
saying. There are things we are doing today in health care that 
are ineffective.
<P>
	She said we must look at those things. That is what we are 
talking about. Define the essential core. Look at the things that 
are ineffective and set them aside. They are discretionary. They 
may well be covered by private sources, insurance or other 
sources.
<P>
	We are not so far off. The rhetoric may put us a long way apart 
but we are not so far off. Evidence based issues, let us call them 
what I call them or call them what the minister calls them, core 
essential, evidence based; not so far off.
<P>
	The national forum on health, which has people with vast 
experience from all over the country, should and could be doing 
this very thing today.
<P>
	My time is rapidly drawing to a close. I hear delight from 
across the way. It is a shame because this debate in the House is 
so important and has not been done for so long. I will be 
disappointed if there is not a frank and open interchange on this.
<P>
	There are other problems with health care beyond the federal 
portion. There are problems with accountability. There are 
problems with abuse. There are problems with our medical legal 
system and there are big problems with our drug costs.
<P>
	Each one of those deserves a good, frank expose as well. I 
have colleagues who will talk about other innovations we think 
might have some benefit for health care, funding changes that 
might well be present. I ask each member to consider what will 
happen if we ignore the $1,522 for debt servicing versus the 
$268 being spent on our health.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I thank the hon. member for Macleod. As I listened to 
his speech I realized that we are a lot closer than perhaps is 
apparent in many cases.
<P>
	I listened to some of the interventions the hon. member made 
and I will make a few statements to perhaps rectify some of the 
misconceptions out there.
<P>
	I have not ever said there have not been problems and that 
there do not continue to be serious problems with other sections 
of the Canada Health Act. Portability and out of country 
portability is one of the areas we are working on. We are trying 
to reach a solution with provincial governments. We believe in 
working co-operatively with them.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11862"> 11862 </A></B>
<P>
	When it comes to Quebec and the portability issue there has 
been considerable movement on the part of Quebec to address 
some of the problems of people from Quebec travelling to 
Ontario and not getting the coverage they should have.
<P>
<B>(1215 ) </B>
<P>
	There is an agreement of sorts in place to cover any treatment 
here in the Ottawa Valley or in the Abitibi section up north. I am 
hopeful, because I know that the Government of Quebec is 
extremely interested in serving the people of Quebec, wherever 
they travel. I would hope we can get some kind of an agreement 
on that in the near future.
<P>
	When it comes to accessibility and reasonable access, there 
will continue to be waiting lists. Some provinces have done a lot 
of work to address that. Not to be discounted, some provinces 
have a central registry of where there are rooms available so that 
hip replacements can be done. As you well know, there are 
waiting lists, but often when the need is very great those people 
jump to the front. When they get access to hip replacement it is 
generally because their need is much greater. Although access is 
not always perfect, everyone works to address the problem.
<P>
	The member has talked about a place in Nova Scotia, 
Wolfville. I do not have the particulars of Wolfville, but user 
fees and facility fees have been and will be outlawed. Just go 
back to my letter of interpretation in January. I would expect 
that Wolfville would be addressed by that letter of 
interpretation. If the member has any other information, please 
let us know.
<P>
	There are a number of other points the member made, 
including Quebec's psychotherapists and what is happening in 
the province of Quebec. They are working with medical 
professionals to determine the medical necessity and what they 
will cover. That is the beauty of what is happening with the 
Canada Health Act. We encourage that.
<P>
	These are the kinds of things that are happening across the 
country. When one province gets one thing right, others often 
follow suit.
<P>
	The member spoke about the Shouldice clinic. Yes, it is a 
private clinic, but it is covered by the Private Hospitals Act in 
Ontario. There is an act in Ontario that governs that. Therefore, 
people do not have to pay additionally. They get access.
<P>
	We have to understand that while we have a good system, it is 
not perfect. Any other suggestions the member may have would 
help us. One of the things he seems to be proposing, at least as I 
understand, is a system of user fees for certain procedures or 
items, which would be based not on need but more on the ability 
to pay. This is where we fundamentally disagree.
<P>
	When a facility charges a facility fee and general taxpayers 
are paying the physician fee, they are in essence subsidizing 
queue jumping for those who have the money. That goes against 
our principles. I would hope it goes against yours, although it 
does not appear to do so. That is a tax on illness. That is not a fair 
tax, at least in my book. Perhaps the hon. member can tell us 
how he thinks a facility fee is fair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, what has 
been missed in all of this discussion is unless we define the core 
essential we cannot decide whether or not a user fee has any 
place in our system. For discretionary, elective things, surely 
the minister would not deny those things to be done. That is why 
we need the definition. That is why there cannot be this 
airy-fairy situation where one thing is medically necessary in 
one part of the country and one thing is medically necessary in 
another.
<P>
	On the issue of facility fees, the semi-private clinic, there is a 
philosophical argument on that specific issue. If the procedure is 
medically necessary, it must be paid for by public funds in 
Canada today. If the procedure is medically necessary and it is 
done outside a hospital and the costs generated to do that outside 
the hospital are not borne publicly, where should they be borne? 
I believe they should make no impediment whatever to the 
public system.
<P>
<B>(1220) </B>
<P>
	I ask the minister, although this is not interchange time, to 
find me a country-without using the U.S. example, which is 
commonly used and where that is not done-where that 
produces a problem.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harold Culbert (Carleton-Charlotte, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I listened with great interest to my colleague for 
Macleod. We had the opportunity of serving together on the 
Standing Committee on Health.
<P>
	I would ask the hon. member what his definition of core is. He 
would know that there are criteria established presently from 
one province to another about what is included and what is 
considered outside those parameters.
<P>
	Generally speaking, Canadians look on our medicare program 
as one that is accessible to all Canadians for good health care, 
regardless of their status in life. Surely my colleague is not 
suggesting that we should revert to a system that is dependent on 
how wealthy one happens to be, or a system such as the United 
States currently has, where we know there are literally 
thousands of people who are left outside the system.
<P>
	I want to refer to one particular incident that I am well aware 
of regarding efficiencies. Of course we must change from time 
to time in order to be much more efficient. There is no question. 
That is why health care has to be upgraded continually from that 
perspective. That is exactly why the Prime Minister appointed 
the National Forum on Health to study that whole scenario.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11863"> 11863 </A></B>
<P>
	Surely my colleague for Macleod is not suggesting that we 
open up to some other system, for example the system that is 
in the United States, which does not work. The medicare 
program is so important for all Canadians, and treats everyone 
from coast to coast on an equal basis.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Macleod):</B> Madam Speaker, I appreciate the 
opportunity to respond.
<P>
	Let me give the member another example of something I 
would take out of the core. It seems to be lost on the member that 
the core must be defined. The core has the essential things.
<P>
	Although I have some expertise in this area, I do not pretend 
to be able to define the core perfectly. When health care started, 
there was no such thing as joint replacement. The first joint 
replacement literally came with health care.
<P>
	The hip joint prosthesis ranges from $1,000 to $7,000. I would 
decide which of the prostheses is cost effective for Canadians 
and say that if you want a $7,000 prosthesis, pay for it yourself: 
we in the public system will give the Chevrolet prosthesis; if you 
want a Rolls Royce, you pay for it.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Hedy Fry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I rise to speak with a mixture of 
emotions. There is some confusion, some humour, and some 
sadness.
<P>
	I am confused that members of the third party would bring 
forth this kind of motion when it so clearly contraindicates 
everything they have ever said in the past during their campaign 
and even during their proposed budget earlier this year.
<P>
<B>(1225 ) </B>
<P>
	There is some pleasure because I am proud to be able to speak 
for the system of health care we are espousing in this country 
and in which we so firmly believe. And there is a little sadness 
because one of the movers of this motion is a physician and has 
shown such a lack of understanding of the system, the words, the 
terminology and the principles that medicare is all about. It 
saddens me that he should rise to speak to this motion when he 
so obviously does not understand the system. I would like to 
know why he does not understand it.
<P>
	What we have heard is simplistic rhetoric. It is the kind of 
thing we have come to expect from the third party: there is 
always a simple answer; let us not confuse the complexity of the 
question, let us just throw a simple answer at it.
<P>
	What is so simplistic about it and what is so rhetorical about it 
is in terms of the statement of the problem, which is not factual. 
The statement of the problem is not based on fact at all. As the 
Minister of Health said when she spoke earlier, the figures 
quoted, which indicate a decrease in the percentage of payments 
to the provinces from the federal government, are absolutely 
untrue. The statement talks about total health care cost. It does 
not show any understanding of what the cost the federal  
government contributes to, as written in the established 
programs financing, is all about. That cost is purely for hospital 
and physician services. It is not for the whole bailiwick of health 
care services, which each province has expanded or constricted 
as it feels it wants. That is not what the federal government 
sends the transfer payments for; it is purely for physician and 
hospital service. That is the first bit of disinformation that came 
about in this.
<P>
	The second thing that is simplistic and rhetorical about the 
whole thing is the solution, the constructive alternatives we 
were given. They have absolutely nothing to do with ensuring 
efficient, universal, affordable, quality health care in this 
country. Universal quality health care is far more complicated 
than giving a cute, uninformed speech. It is a complex issue.
<P>
	Let us look at the preamble of the speech made by the hon. 
member for Calgary Southwest. He talked about the fact that we 
already have a multi-tier system. That alone shows a lack of 
understanding of what is meant by the term comprehensive, 
which is one of the five principles of medicare. It shows a lack of 
understanding of what medically required services means. It 
shows a lack of understanding of what the terms universality and 
accessibility actually mean under the Canada Health Act. The 
hon. member did not even read the Canada Health Act. He does 
not even understand the definition of the terms.
<P>
	The whole idea of having a multi-tier system is one of the 
usual red herrings that are thrown at us. Of course we have 
systems where there are always and have always been 
non-medically required services that patients pay for. They 
have always paid for them. If anyone wishes to have a face lift, 
they can always pay for one. There are many instances where 
people think they want something that is not medically required 
and they go out and buy it. That does not constitute a multi-tier 
system; that constitutes a system that operates outside of what 
the Canada Health Act defines as the five principles of 
medicare. The hon. member should go back and read the Canada 
Health Act.
<P>
	The other thing the hon. member said in his preamble was that 
users should define full services. Users define full services? I do 
not know that many patients would want to define what an 
essential service is and what a medically required service is, 
because they are not physicians. They may want to participate in 
the decision making of what is appropriate in the treatment, but 
they would not want to define what is clinically necessary and 
clinically required for them. That is why they go to a physician 
or a health care provider. That alone seems to me to be a rather 
simplistic and very impractical solution.
<P>
	What else do we have if we have started off with the first part 
of the motion being based on a false premise? The whole 
scaffold on which the argument is based is nothing more than 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11864"> 11864 </A></B>
<P>
smoke and mirrors. It is a weak scaffold because it is based on 
lack of fact, lack of information, and lack of knowledge.
<P>
	The hon. member said that we talked earlier on about the 50 
per cent the federal government is supposed to transfer to the 
provinces.
<P>
<B>(1230 ) </B>
<P>
	As the minister and I said earlier, we were never supposed to 
transfer 50 per cent. In 1975-76 we transferred 39 per cent of 
total health care. That 39 per cent constituted a greater 
percentage toward hospital and physician services only which is 
where it was supposed to go. Therefore, the rest of it is 
nonsense.
<P>
	That has not gone down a great deal when we look at the fact 
that in 1992-93 the total percentage of transfer has gone down to 
32 per cent and the provinces have expanded their total pot. That 
again is a false presumption of what the percentages should 
mean.
<P>
	There again I think the mathematics and the understandings 
were not done. If the figures were wrong and the assumptions 
were wrong, is the whole concept we are debating today wrong? 
It must be because it is based on a false assumption and a false 
concept.
<P>
	Everyone is saying that we need more money for health care. 
The concept of more money does not seem to sit well with the 
third party. The leader of the third party said in his budget 
speech and in fact said in Saskatchewan that he would transfer 
more tax points to the provinces. He would give them more 
money.
<P>
	Simple mathematics, and I am not a mathematician, tells me 
that in taking away from one side of an equation there is surely a 
corresponding addition to the other side. Therefore, if we take 
money away from our big pot to give more tax points to the 
provinces, what the hon. member did not factor in in his budget 
speech is that he is going to be $10 billion deeper in the hole in 
the deficit. How does that make sense with fiscal responsibility 
and cutting the deficit to zero in one year that we were talking 
about? It does not make sense. None of it makes sense.
<P>
	It is widely recognized as a fact that anyone who understands 
health care economics knows that throwing more money at 
health care is not the answer. In fact the quality, the outcome, the 
efficiency and the effectiveness of a health care system does not 
depend on money. If it did, the United States which spends the 
most amount of money not only per capita but as a percentage of 
GDP on health care would have the best health care system in the 
world. However, it does not.
<P>
	At the moment the country that ranks the highest for having 
the best health care system in the world is Japan. It spends a lot 
less money than Canada spends as a percentage of GDP. Money 
and a good system do not equate. Money in a health care system 
does not equal outcome.
<P>
	We know that many other things determine whether people 
are healthy or not. They have to do with socioeconomic factors, 
environmental factors, lifestyle factors and quality of life 
factors. None of those things are part of giving people more 
medical care. We can give people more medical care and we will 
not decrease those outcomes one whit. Throwing money at the 
health care system is not the answer.
<P>
	The challenge is how wisely we spend the money we put into 
the health care system so we can use the money for the 
socioeconomic and other issues that determine health. It is one 
of the big challenges we have to look at when we talk about 
health care.
<P>
	Let us look again at the third party using money as a criteria 
for effective and efficient health care services. If we talk about 
that then we are talking clearly about the fact that if one cannot 
afford the health care system and more money has to be thrown 
at it then people must pay for the health care system. Therefore, 
we are back to this hidden or not so hidden agenda the third party 
is talking about which is in fact finding a way to get the user, the 
person who is sick, to pay for their health care.
<P>
	It is a not so clever plot to say the system needs more money, 
the system needs more money, the system needs more money. 
Then we are going to have to say that if we are going to balance 
our budgets, and we cannot find the money from government, let 
us charge the people, the ill. Let us tax them. That is what is so 
underhanded and so disturbing about this motion, the whole 
concept that is underlying what we are talking about here today.
<P>
	It is a typical mentality that comes from people who espouse a 
south of the border policy on health care. We look at the United 
States and the kind of health care it gives. Yes, there is a two tier 
system there and yes of course people are allowed to buy health 
care but it is based on one criteria, the pocketbook. Those who 
can afford it can have unlimited access to health care. Those who 
cannot afford it, we see what the outcome is.
<P>
<B>(1235 ) </B>
<P>
	At the moment the United States is sixth among the 
developing countries in its health care outcomes. It does not 
have the health care outcomes of a developed country because 
those who cannot afford it, with poverty being the major 
determinant of health, those people are sicker.
<P>
	That is the way the Reform Party would have us go and it 
concerns me. In fact, if we give the rich unlimited access to 
health care what we see is that the number of interventions and 
the amount of laboratory tests are greater as a percentage of 
users in the United States than it is in Canada. The people who 
are using them more are based purely on the people who are in a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11865"> 11865 </A></B>
<P>
high socioeconomic bracket. In other words there are people 
who are having care and interventions.
<P>
	Open heart surgery is one example. The rich are getting more 
open heart surgery. It does not fulfil the criteria of whether they 
need it or not. The fact is they want it, they want to buy it and 
they are getting it. I do not consider that to be good medicine and 
I do not consider it to be good health care. I do not think we want 
that situation in this country.
<P>
	Let us look then at the solutions the third party recommended. 
The solutions it talks about are core services. We all know on 
reading the Canada Health Act and if we understand the 
principles of medicare, that the definition of medically required 
services is a provincial jurisdiction. The provinces have to 
define medically required services. This is a good thing. The 
provinces are where the regional disparities lie. Different 
provinces have different health care problems. Different 
provinces have different needs.
<P>
	We talk about bottom up care. It is appropriate to have the 
provinces deciding. That is what we have tried to do when we 
have discussed how we give the provinces more decision 
making in health care. It is to allow them to provide appropriate 
services for people where they need it, when they need it and 
how they need it. They know that better than the central 
government.
<P>
	We believe our role to play as the central government is to 
bring about and co-ordinate what it is we see within the 
principle that those medically required services are based on 
clear clinical guidelines. This is why the health forum was set 
up. The health forum is dealing right now with how we define, 
how we look at outcomes. It is dealing with how we look at what 
is the care and the criteria necessary to provide those outcomes 
so that we are not guessing as the hon. member for Macleod 
would have us do and set all sorts of criteria for who should get it 
and what a core service is.
<P>
	The hon. member for Macleod has decided that a core service 
should be something that is on a list of items. A core service is 
not an item. If we take for example the item of ultrasound for 
pregnant women and say that only one ultrasound will be done 
on a pregnant woman, that does not make any sense. Some 
pregnant women clinically require more than one while others 
only require one.
<P>
	We need to look at clinical guidelines when we talk about core 
services, not whether the item is a good idea or not, not to 
generically define items. That will not give us good care.
<P>
	Nor should it be like the hon. member for Macleod said to the 
Calgary <I>Herald</I> when he defined who should get health care and 
who should not and that if a woman in her past history had been 
promiscuous and had her tubes blocked she should not have a 
tubal ligation paid for by the government. What sort of 
subjective, moral, paternalistic health care system are we 
talking about here when we want to define core services that 
way? That concerns me a great deal.
<P>
	We also hear terms like private insurance. We all know from 
the United States and Robert Evans of UBC has shown us very 
clearly that multiple insurance systems and multiple payer 
systems are more expensive. They are more inefficient and in 
fact do not create the right kind of outcomes.
<P>
	The United States has multiple payer systems. The 
administrative costs are 25 per cent of the health care costs. 
Recent studies have shown in the United States that if that 25 per 
cent on administration could be rolled into a single payer 
system, there would be enough money to give health care 
services to the 37 million Americans who do not have it right 
now. If the money spent on Massachusetts Blue Cross alone 
could be decreased in administration there would be universal 
health care in the United States.
<P>
	When we talk about health care and about multiple systems, 
we are talking about greater costs. We are talking about defining 
who can no longer be insured because they are now chronically 
ill.
<P>
	In the United States someone who is chronically ill becomes 
uninsurable. Even if that person has millions of dollars to buy 
insurance, he cannot buy it. That person has to pay out of his 
pocket. That is okay if he has millions of dollars but someone 
who is a middle income worker cannot.
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	The other term ``benefactors to pay'' as I see it is a nice term 
for user fees. We are hearing all these little words that have been 
put in so that it sounds wonderful. We are talking about a 
two-tier system that in this country does not define what we see 
as health care.
<P>
	When we talk about health care we are talking about looking 
at how we can save money on health care costs. Recent studies at 
the University of Ottawa and Judith Maxwell have told us that 
we can save $7 billion a year in health care costs if we do some 
real things. For example we could shift from hospital based care 
to community based care. We could look at how we set clinical 
guidelines for care. We could look at how we help the 
determinants of health so that the socioeconomic factors that 
create illness in people are decreased.
<P>
	There are many things we can do to decrease health care costs 
without changing the five principles of medicare, without 
having to make people who are sick pay. The only way the third 
party can see for solving the problems is to define core services 
with the kind of hidden agenda it is defining. Reformers are 
talking about user fees and multiple insurance systems.
<P>
	What is wrong with that solution is that every system of health 
care in the world is based on some sort of rationale. The 
rationale in this country has to do with clinical need and that is 
the way we want to keep it. I do not ever want us to see where the 
rationale for our health care system is the pocketbook. There-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11866"> 11866 </A></B>
<P>
fore I strongly speak against first and foremost the problem 
which is not  factual and also the solutions put forward this 
morning by members of the third party.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
listened with great interest to the comments made by my hon. 
colleague. I know that she is very knowledgeable about health 
issues and that she really wants to ensure that the Canadian 
health care system is in the best of shape.
<P>
	I would, however, like to remind her and this House that 
medicare was invented by Quebec a few decades ago through the 
good services of Mr. Castonguay. That is why we as Quebecers 
care about maintaining the essential characteristics of a good 
health care system.
<P>
	Of course, such a system needs predictable financing. The 
Canadian provinces and Quebec have had to deal with the cuts in 
established programs financing that have been carried out for 
over a decade, in violation of the 1977 agreement promising 
reliable funding to the provinces; they had to make do and, in 
some cases, even improvise in health care matters. That is where 
the shoe pinches.
<P>
	By redefining the transfer of taxpayers' money to the 
provinces, the federal government has gradually destabilized 
the Canadian health care system. In fact, the federal government 
has, unintentionally, I admit, contributed to this decline of the 
Canadian health care system, which is already leading to a 
two-tier system.
<P>
	Basically, we have a right to ask the following question: Why 
does the federal government not transfer to the provinces and 
Quebec all the tax points linked to health care financing so that 
the provinces and Quebec can determine themselves the best 
way to provide services in compliance with the five fundamental 
principles of health care?
<P>
	I would like my colleague to give me her opinion on this.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Fry:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
rewriting the history of medicare a bit. Some people would 
argue that it was Saskatchewan and others would say it was 
Quebec, but that is a moot point.
<P>
	The hon. member mentioned money. We keep hearing about 
money being a factor in providing effective health care. There is 
an English saying that necessity is the mother of invention. 
Because of necessity and because there has been very little 
money, provinces have begun to be inventive. It is not an 
invention that has decreased the quality of health care.
<P>
	Something that has been necessary for many years which 
neither the provinces nor the federal government faced up to was 
that we needed to change our health care system to make it more 
appropriate to the needs of people and to make it more 
effectively and efficiently managed. As a result of the necessity, 
people are beginning to manage the system.
<P>
	The amount of money put into a health care system by any 
study of any country does not equate to quality of care. 
Otherwise, as I said, the United States would have the most 
wonderful health care system in the world because it spends the 
most money. Yet Japan, which spends the least, has the best. 
There are more things that determine the health status of a 
country and the health of individuals than money spent on 
intervention and on medical care.
<P>
	I spoke as well about the ways in which we could decrease the 
cost of the system, improve accessibility and improve the ability 
of patients to make decisions within their own health care 
system. That is by shifting from acute care to community care, 
by shifting and creating guidelines for care, by looking at 
outcome analysis and by setting up technology assessment, by 
doing all the things we are learning to do that some provinces 
have already begun to do.
<P>
	Judith Maxwell of the University of Ottawa is predicting in 
her report that if we continue to do such things we will need to 
put less money, almost $7 billion less, into health care. It is very 
important to understand that and not fall prey to the rhetoric that 
continues to say that we should keep throwing money at health 
care in the hope that it will stick somewhere. It never has and it 
never will.
<P>
	All the studies on mortality, morbidity and quality of life are 
telling us that is not what will create the outcome we are looking 
for.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, what does hon. member think about the recent 
comments of the British Columbia Health Association about 
being significantly concerned about access to essential health 
care services in British Columbia? This is not something 
occurring solely in British Columbia. As the member well 
knows, it is occurring across the country.
<P>
	My party has proposed an alternative form of the Canada 
Health Act. We would allow the provinces to have such 
structures as private medical clinics. Not a dollar from Canadian 
taxpayers would go toward paying for it. Members of the public 
would have the choice to pay for the services, whatever they 
happen to be, in private clinics. We must bear in mind that the 
services would be offered to anybody in a public hospital or a 
clinic.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11867"> 11867 </A></B>
<P>
	What is so wrong? How will private structures involving the 
exchange of private moneys impede the ability of the public 
sector to provide services? Also, why does the government have 
such an aversion to choice when we have choice in almost 
everything else in our lives?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Fry:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
question.
<P>
	What is wrong with setting up private clinics so that people 
who want to pay can pay? We only have to look at the United 
States where people who want to pay can pay and buy as much as 
they want whether or not they need it and people who cannot 
afford it have inadequate and inappropriate access to health 
care.
<P>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
	A major determinant of health is socioeconomic status. 
Poverty is the greatest determinant of health. Poor people need 
more services. We are basically saying that we have some false 
savings here. We will not save any money. The people who need 
the services more will be the people who cannot afford them. 
They will still be going to the public sector. That is the first 
point.
<P>
	Second, if we look at the United States model, private clinics 
have tended to create massive costs and inefficiencies in the 
system. They have taken away clinical autonomy from 
physicians who no longer have the ability to choose what they do 
for their patients but have to ask a non-medical person, some 
insurance adjuster, what they should and should not or can and 
cannot do. That is not what I consider to be choice.
<P>
	We have choice in this country. In the United States they are 
not free to choose a physician. They are only free to go to a 
physician who is under a particular insurance plan and works for 
a particular insurance company. In Canada we are free to choose 
a physician anywhere and everywhere we like.
<P>
	We have what is known as access to anyone we want to see. 
That is choice. In this country we are free to go to any hospital 
we choose. We are free to have a bed in the hospital next to 
anyone we choose to be with. We do not have to go to one for the 
poor if we are poor. We can sleep under a bridge or lie next to 
some multimillionaire in a Canadian hospital.
<P>
	What the member is considering is wrong. If he does not 
believe me, let him think about what happened in the United 
Kingdom. I did my medical training in the United Kingdom. Its 
wonderful easy answer was that it would take care of the poor 
and those who could pay would pay. We have seen a two-tier 
system in which the poor have been relegated to second rate 
medicine. Physicians do not want to work in the areas where 
there are large poor populations. The United Kingdom is 
sending for physicians from developing countries to go there to 
provide care. That does not create equality of care. That is what 
is wrong.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, my colleagues will be dividing their time from 
now on.
<P>
	It is with great sadness that I am here today to speak on the 
motion. It is with great sadness and anger that I listened to the 
response of the government to the most important thing in 
people's lives, their health.
<P>
	The government continues to put forth the fantasy that 
medicare can continue in its current form. This is criminal, 
reprehensible and an outright lie. The reality is that medicare is 
like a ship with holes in it that is sinking with its captain, the 
government, saying all is well. Unfortunately when we look 
inside where the people are, the patients, we find that they are 
dying, suffering and in pain. That is exactly what is happening in 
health care in Canada today. It is a profound tragedy and should 
not occur in a country such as ours.
<P>
	The provinces have found that demand is increasing. Costs 
are escalating with an aging population and more expensive 
technology. Also revenues are going down as was demonstrated 
in the last budget with an $8 billion decrease in transfer funding 
from the federal government.
<P>
	Who is caught between a rock and a hard place? In reality it is 
the patients who are sick, who are unwell. When they go to 
hospital they discover that essential health care services cannot 
be provided in a reasonable amount of time.
<P>
	The provinces are hamstrung by the current Canada Health 
Act. They are forced to engage in rationing. I will give some real 
life examples from across the country. In Victoria, B.C., where I 
live, 40 per cent of hip replacements for elderly people who are 
in severe pain take 13 months. The British Columbia Health 
Association is very concerned about the critical lack of access to 
essential services.
<P>
	In Prince George a very interesting and sad thing happened. 
People going for surgery were given the option of receiving 
autologous blood transfusions, which allow people to have their 
own blood taken and purified for use in their next surgery. The 
cost charged to each patient was $150. The reason for that was 
the Red Cross and medicare system could not pay for it. They 
gave the patient the option of using their own blood in a safe 
fashion that would not subject them to HIV, hepatitis and a 
number of other diseases.
<P>
<B>(1255) </B>
<P>
	Two months after this came out the Ministry of Health said 
that it could not be done, that patients could not be charged for it. 
It prevented the Prince George Regional Hospital from doing so. 
Now patients have to get packed cells for blood transfusions at 
$500 a unit.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11868"> 11868 </A></B>
<P>
	In Alberta it takes three weeks for emergent and urgent open 
heart surgery. The surgeons there say it is a miracle so far that 
nobody has died, but it is going to happen.
<P>
	The Prince George hospital, because of the funding cutbacks 
that have been foisted upon the provincial government, is forced 
to cut back its operating room days by 12 days a year, knowing 
full well that it has hundreds of people waiting for urgent 
surgery.
<P>
	The minister said that doctors were returning to Canada. I had 
a conversation with one of her close advisers the other day who 
said that it was the bad doctors who were leaving the country. He 
asked: ``Isn't that so?'' Half our neurosurgeons leave the 
country. Eighty per cent of orthopedic surgeons in some cities 
have left as well as 50 per cent of obstetricians and 
gynecologists.
<P>
	Dr. Joel Cooper of the University of Toronto, a world famous 
cardio-thoracic surgeon, left. Dr. Munro from the Hospital for 
Sick Children left. These world famous individuals left the 
country not because they wanted more money but because, in 
their words, they could not practise the way they were supposed 
to and were sick and tired of having their patients suffer. That is 
not adequate health care.
<P>
	The reality is that the population is increasing and costs are 
rising. The minister said that we do not have a two-tier system. 
What nonsense. A billion dollars every year goes to the United 
States. Why? It is because Canadians cannot obtain essential 
health care services in a timely fashion so they go to the states. 
Why do we not keep that money in Canada?
<P>
	The minister said that private expenditures were increasing. 
Of course they are increasing. Why? It is because people will not 
wait for the current public system to provide their health care 
services. They do not want to be in pain and they do not want to 
die. The government is forbidding them from doing that and is 
not accepting the fact that it cannot provide essential services in 
a timely fashion. That is a travesty. It is also extremely arrogant 
for the government to tell the public that it is forbidden to do 
that. In effect the government is sacrificing people's health on 
the altar of a dead socialist ideology.
<P>
	We must recognize the financial crisis of today and the 
decrease in funding. We must recognize that people cannot be 
taxed more and that demand is going up. We must recognize that 
the Canada Health Act is hopelessly obsolete and unable to 
provide the same health care services to all people all the time, 
especially essential health care services. Sick people are in 
effect dying.
<P>
	We must move to a new era. We will present constructive 
alternatives. Let us make a new made in Canada health act. It 
should not be one from the United States or one from England 
but one from Canada. We do not want an American style system. 
There is no  resemblance whatsoever in what we propose to the 
system south of the border.
<P>
	First, we must get the federal government, the provinces and 
the people together to define essential health care services for 
which all people across the country will be covered regardless of 
income. We may want to look at the Oregon model to begin with.
<P>
	Second, let us allow the provinces to experiment with 
alternative funding models, such as private clinics, private 
insurance and the like. Why? It is because the system needs 
more money to provide health care. It is true that it needs to be 
revamped, but it also needs more money to reflect our current 
fiscal crisis and fiscal crunch in health care.
<P>
<B>(1300 ) </B>
<P>
	This is not a threat to medicare, rather it will make it better. 
What is so wrong with enabling private clinics to provide 
private services in the private sector where only private dollars 
will be exchanged? It will not in any way affect the public 
system.
<P>
	In fact the demand on the public system will go down so that 
those people who are in this system will be able to get essential 
health care services in a more timely fashion. Is it a two-tier 
system? Yes, but we have one now. Is it unequal? Yes, but it 
provides for better access for all people regardless of their 
income. It ensures quicker access to those essential services that 
Canadians are not receiving now.
<P>
	It is time to move forward. It is time to move with courage. It 
is not the time to delve into a morass of ideology but open our 
eyes and work together. My colleagues and I are more than 
happy to work with the Minister of Health in the interests of the 
Canadian public and the health of Canadians, to develop a fair 
and equitable solution and to provide better health care for all 
now and in the future.
<P>
	We are not the enemy. We are merely trying to ensure that we 
have an improved system from coast to coast. Let us set up those 
national standards. As individuals we are not going to do that 
here, nor should we. We cannot nor should we play God. This 
must come from members of the public. It must come from the 
provinces. It must come from health care professionals. It must 
come from the federal government.
<P>
	Let us ensure that we have portability for these national 
standards, that we have comprehensive coverage for essential 
health care services for all people, that we have good public 
administration of essential health care services, that we have 
universal coverage for essential health care services for all 
Canadians.
<P>
	Last, let us ensure that we have essential health care services 
provided in a timely fashion. The Canadian people are not 
receiving their essential services in a timely fashion. One only 
needs to go into the field, go into the hospitals, to see the people 
who are not receiving them. Morale is the lowest it has ever 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11869"> 11869 </A></B>
<P>
been, as is the pain  and suffering on people's faces when told 
they have to wait 13 months potentially for their hip 
replacement or three months for their urgent heart surgery. That 
is not good medicine. That is bad medicine.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Hedy Fry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, typical of the third party is the 
sentimentality, the rhetoric, the lack of any real fact but let us 
spew it anyway. Let us do the emotional dance on people.
<P>
	I would like to ask the hon. member if he could give me clear 
statistical data which shows that the outcome in acute care is not 
one of the highest and best in the world, that people who 
clinically need care are not getting it.
<P>
	We have to be very careful to clear the wood between need and 
want. Health care is not a marketplace commodity. The 
difference between what a patient needs for appropriate care and 
what a patient thinks he or she wants is very different.
<P>
	We provide the best health care in the world that patients 
need. When we talk about people needing urgent care and not 
getting it I would like to ask the hon. member if he can give me 
clear examples of people who have increased mortality because 
they need acute care and do not get it. That, Mr. Speaker, is not 
true.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
cannot believe the hon. member is saying what she is saying. I 
will repeat again, this is not rhetoric.
<P>
<B>(1305 ) </B>
<P>
	I just spent half of my speech giving the government 
constructive solutions on what to do. My colleagues, Dr. Hill 
and Mr. Manning have spent the last hour giving constructive 
solutions to the government.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. O'Reilly):</B> I have to interrupt the 
member. Although he is complimenting them on doing a good 
job, it is not the custom of the House to name members but to use 
their ridings.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
have been giving constructive solutions. At the end of my 
speech I stated that members of the Reform Party would be more 
than willing to help get the Canadian health care system back on 
its feet and to ensure that medicare is provided in a fiscally 
sustainable fashion in the future. Obviously somebody is not 
listening.
<P>
	We talk about essential health care services and who is not 
getting them. I can give the House cases. I have just mentioned 
the three-week waiting list for urgent heart surgery in Alberta. 
If that is not an essential health care service and irresponsibility 
I do not know what it is. The physicians who are dealing with 
these patients-the member knows because she is a 
physician-would be more than happy to inform her that this is 
completely inadequate. This is not something happening only in 
Alberta but it is going on across the country. In Ottawa it is a 
five-month wait for open heart surgery and in B.C. it is a 
thirteen-month wait for people who are in severe pain.
<P>
	What the member and the government have been saying is that 
the government will decide what the patient needs. The 
government will decide what the public can and cannot do with 
their health care system and for their health. How arrogant to do 
this when health care is that which is most important to all of our 
hearts. That is irresponsible.
<P>
	I would be more than happy to provide a long list to the hon. 
member of situations that demonstrate the fact that our current 
medicare system is not working.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sharon Hayes (Port Moody-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise to speak today to the Reform 
Party's motion on the future of health care and medicare in 
Canada and the nature and extent of the federal involvement in 
that. The motion states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House recognize that since the inception of our national health care 
system the federal share of funding for health care in Canada has fallen from 50 
per cent to 23 per cent and therefore the House urges the government to consult 
with the provinces and other stakeholders to determine core services to be 
completely funded by the federal and provincial governments and non-core 
services where private insurance and the benefactors of the services might play a 
supplementary role.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The Reform Party believes that a fundamental responsibility 
of government is to safeguard the well-being of Canadians. 
Principle 10 of our statement of principles says: ``We believe 
that Canadians have a personal and collective responsibility to 
care and provide for the basic needs of people who are unable to 
care and provide for themselves''.
<P>
	The Reform Party also believes that the current health care 
system is inefficient and insufficient in providing this essential 
service to Canadians. The current system must be reformed to 
guarantee the continuation of care and the ability to address the 
future real demands of our health care needs for everyone's 
benefit.
<P>
	As for the benefits now of parents, my parents, the people in 
the House, people across Canada, our children and our 
grandchildren, we need that ongoing credibility of a system that 
right now is itself sick.
<P>
	Throughout my speech I will compare and contrast the 
Reform and the government approach toward securing the future 
of our health care system. One area that reveals this contrast 
between the Reform approach and the government approach is 
the issue of consultation. The motion urges the government to 
consult with Canadians and health care stakeholders about the 
future of medicare.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11870"> 11870 </A></B>
<P>
	In its much touted red book, the Liberal Party committed 
itself to ``establish a national forum on health in partnership 
with the provinces and health care experts to find innovative 
ways to control health costs while keeping medicare publicly 
funded and accessible for all Canadians''. It sounds good but 
to this day the government has broken its promise. It has not 
fulfilled the commitment it has made, a commitment to consult 
with Canadians about the future of medicare and the roles that 
will be played by the federal and provincial governments and 
other health care stakeholders. Because of the heavy handed 
approach of the federal government in this area, the provinces 
have refused to participate.
<P>
<B>(1310) </B>
<P>
	Consultations are not always what they appear to be or what 
they are announced to be by the government. For instance I 
would like to remind the members here of the travelling 
committee that was to consult Canadians on social policy 
reform. What happened? A flawed attempt and a report that was 
delayed and delayed and ultimately shelved.
<P>
	Reform on the other hand has long advocated that the federal 
government actively consult Canadians on vital and important 
national issues such as the health care system. We believe 
consultation must take place at all levels, with patients and 
users, with physicians and health care professionals, with 
administrators of those systems and with provincial 
governments. We do not believe in the top down, Ottawa says, 
approach. We believe that Canadians need to be part of the 
decision making process, especially in an important system like 
health care.
<P>
	This Reform commitment to consultation is reflected in the 
motion being debated today recommending that a consultative 
process about the future of health care be actively and honestly 
pursued.
<P>
	Another area that reveals the contrast between the Reform and 
the government approach is the area of federal funding. As noted 
in the motion, federal funding for health care has fallen from 50 
per cent to 23 per cent over the last years.
<P>
	Health care was originally implemented in 1957 with the 
Hospital Insurance and Diagnostic Services Act. The federal 
government adopted this act under pressure from the provinces, 
some of which had provincial insurance schemes. The act 
established a shared cost system providing universal coverage 
and access to hospitals to all residents of participating 
provinces. By 1961 all provinces had joined this plan.
<P>
	In 1977 this act was replaced with the Established Programs 
Financing Act. This transferred money from the federal 
government to provinces for both health and post-secondary 
education funding. In 1984 the Canada Health Act came in 
prohibiting extra billing and user fees and thus imposed 
financial penalties on provincial governments which would 
violate these things.
<P>
	The history of health care politics is essentially the history of 
the federal government demanding and expecting more and 
more from provinces and providing those provinces with the 
diminishing ability and the flexibility to meet those 
expectations.
<P>
	The present government has been in office for less than two 
years and it is definitely continuing this trend. In 1995 the 
government announced it was replacing the established 
programs financing plan and the Canada assistance plan with the 
new Canada social transfer. Under the previous system this 
money was transferred separately. The Canada social transfer 
will be a block fund provided through cash payments and 
transfer points.
<P>
	Under the new system federal funding for health care will be 
reduced. In 1995-96 the federal government will transfer to the 
provinces some $29.7 billion, approximately at the same level 
that was the case for 1994-95 funding. Under this new system 
funding under the Canada social transfer for 1996-97 will be 
reduced to $26.9 billion and further reduced in 1997-98 to $25.1 
billion. The government's approach to reforming health care is 
to cut funding without consulting or receiving input from 
Canadians.
<P>
	In February Reform announced a taxpayers budget prior to the 
government's budget. In it we would give provinces additional 
tax room through the transfer of tax points, providing that the 
provinces participate in an annual federal-provincial health 
consultation. These regular consultations would ensure a two 
way communication between the two levels of government 
which would benefit and make better our health care system.
<P>
	A first priority between the federal government and provinces 
would be to agree on core versus non-core services. Core 
services would be required to be maintained at a certain and a 
common standard across the country. Such things that would be 
necessary for core would be deemed desired by most Canadians 
and required by the key players in the health care field, rather 
than bureaucrats in Ottawa.
<P>
	These services must be financially sustainable and available 
over a long period of time. All such services would be covered 
regardless of Canadians' ability to pay. Non-core services, on 
the other hand, would be decided also by Canadians and would 
be those the federal government does not have the responsibility 
to fund, but would be the responsibility of private funding or 
through insurance. Reform's approach is bottom up, not top 
down consultation.
<P>
<B>(1315) </B>
<P>
	As we would reduce federal cash transfers by some $800 
million we would at the same time increase revenue levers and 
flexibility for the provinces with a transfer of tax points to those 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11871"> 11871 </A></B>
<P>
provinces so that over time they would raise more revenue to be 
allocated to their health care system.
<P>
	Funding for health care systems would increase over the 
medium and long term, steadily into the next century. This 
would give greater peace of mind to Canadians. It would give 
better flexibility to demoralized provinces and the result would 
be a better medical system for everyone. Our approach 
safeguards health care for the future while the government's 
approach leaves the future of health care uncertain in reality and 
in the minds of Canadians.
<P>
	The shortfall in funding and uncertainty is of particular 
concern to residents of B.C. The government's planned federal 
funding for health care in B.C. does drop significantly. Federal 
transfers in 1995-96 to B.C. are approximately $3.6 billion. 
This is funding for health care, education and welfare under the 
Canada assistance plan and established programs financing. In 
1996-97 under the new Canada social transfer scheme funding 
to B.C. will drop to $3.2 billion. Clearly something has to give. 
Clearly such an approach will put the resources of the provincial 
government under great strain.
<P>
	I have heard some comment today about simplistic rhetoric. I 
recall the government during the last election using what I 
would say is worse than simplistic rhetoric, scare tactics. I 
remember signs within my riding: ``Save Canada-Save 
Medicare''. That kind of rhetoric when the government now puts 
our medical system at risk is a testimony to what I say is unfair 
representation by the government.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Unfortunately the time 
has expired. Questions and comments.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Hedy Fry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, the hon. member made the 
comment that provinces obviously do not like the system and the 
way the Canada Health Act was imposed by the government on 
British Columbia when it was breaking the act.
<P>
	I would like the hon. member to name one province that has 
not supported all the principles of the Canada Health Act 
roundly within the last four months. I would like to know which 
ones have not supported the federal government in ensuring the 
Canada Health Act is effective and taking whatever steps are 
needed. All of the provinces, as far as I am concerned, have 
supported the concept. They believe in the system and in the 
Canada Health Act. They support the five principles.
<P>
	The last meeting of provincial health ministers with the 
federal health minister reiterated that. Alberta said it will 
support those principles.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Hayes:</B> Madam Speaker, I do not want to look to the past 
but to the future concerning the workability of the Canada 
Health Act and whether it is the provinces or Canadians who 
look to the care of their health system.
<P>
	I have talked to health professionals in my riding and they are 
wondering how certain services will be addressed. I suppose we 
could get into debate. Do Canadians want unlimited access and 
attention for any or all complaints or health concerns, a system 
that gives service to all the people all of the time? Do they want 
long waiting periods? These kinds of things from the citizens of 
Canada are coming to provincial and federal tables to be 
addressed. What we see is a system which will not be able to 
answer these things in future years.
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
	I know of men and women facing uncertainty. They are 
waiting for tests to determine the extent of an undiagnosed 
situation, perhaps cancer. They have sleepless nights. Seniors 
are waiting for months with a decreased ability to walk or 
breathe while they wait for operations.
<P>
	I do not see how the government can say the present system 
will continue to work with decreased funding to the provinces 
with inflexible guidelines which will not allow caregivers to 
give the care needed by Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Beth Phinney (Hamilton Mountain, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, the hon. member says she does not believe in top down 
Ottawa directives to health care authorities in the provinces. 
How exactly does she see the Canada Health Act and its five 
principles of accessibility, comprehensiveness, universality, 
portability and public administration as constituting top down 
direction? The provinces and the territories administer the 
health care system, not Ottawa.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Hayes:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
her question. Rather than a constant delivery of services, what 
we see in the health care system are differences between 
provinces. There are different expectations among users at the 
present time.
<P>
	This would probably be more focused on the real needs of 
Canadians if Canadians had a part in the process of deciding 
which services they want to fund. For instance, we have heard 
today that Quebec is no longer funding psychiatric services. I 
know Canadians who expect that service to be funded. There are 
other parts of Canada in which funding for abortions is 
available. I know Canadians who disagree with that. Is it a top 
down decision or is it a grassroots decision that these kinds of 
procedures are being funded?
<P>
	It is in those kinds of areas where-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am sorry, the time has 
expired.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Maria Minna (Beaches-Woodbine, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am grateful for this opportunity to talk about 
medicare and the Canada Health Act. I want to explain how and 
why the government supports medicare and why we on this side 
of the House will continue to support it.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11872"> 11872 </A></B>
<P>
	The Reform Party asks whether we have the will to uphold 
the principles of the Canada Health Act. There are no grounds 
for dire predictions that the federal government will not be able 
to uphold the Canada Health Act or that Canada's health care 
system will disintegrate as a result of the budget.
<P>
	Let me remind the House how clear the budget speech was on 
this matter. The Minister of Finance said no change would be 
made to the Canada Health Act. The Minister of Health was 
equally clear when she spoke to the Canadian Hospital 
Association last March: ``There is no change in the 
government's commitment or in my commitment to uphold and 
enforce the principles of the Canada Health Act''. As the Prime 
Minister said in Saskatoon, for Canadians these principles are 
not negotiable.
<P>
	The new transfers will be a block funding arrangement. That 
may worry some members but let us not forget that block 
funding for health and post-secondary education is 18 years old. 
The established programs financing funding mechanisms put in 
place in 1977 were a block funding arrangement. There is no 
requirement for the provinces to spend the money on health. 
What there is and what was nailed down in 1984 when the 
Liberal government passed the Canada Health Act is the 
requirement that provinces deliver health care services in 
compliance with the five conditions of the act or face a 
deduction from the money transferred to them.
<P>
	Nothing in the budget will change the government's technical 
ability to enforce the Canada Health Act principles. The 
enforcement mechanism remains the same. If deductions from 
transfer payments are necessary they will be made.
<P>
<B>(1325) </B>
<P>
	Canadians can rest assured that Canada's social and health 
transfer will not reduce federal ability to enforce the principles. 
We will enforce them because these principles of universality, 
accessibility, comprehensiveness, portability and public 
administration are ultimately rooted in our common values. 
They are Canadian values such as equity, fairness, compassion 
and respect for the fundamental dignity of all. We will also 
enforce the principles of the Canada Health Act because they 
support an economically efficient health care system.
<P>
	It is worth reminding opposition members the principles of 
the Canada Health Act are not just words. They have meaning. I 
want to touch briefly on each of these principles.
<P>
	The first principle is universality, although residents in a 
province must be insured by the provincial health plan to receive 
federal support. What this really means is that we all must have 
access to services. People cannot be deinsured because they 
might be costly for the system to cover. We cannot be turned 
away at the hospital door because we have not paid our quarterly 
tax bill or  provincial premium. If we need health care we will be 
treated the same as anyone else.
<P>
	Accessibility on uniform terms and conditions is the second 
principle. It means we should not face any financial barriers in 
receiving health care: no extra billing, no user charges, no 
facility fees, no up front cash payment. If the service is 
medically necessary we will get it at a time defined by medical 
considerations, not by the size of our wallet.
<P>
	Next is comprehensiveness. This principle recognizes 
Canadians have a range of health care needs and that those needs 
should be met. Scratch the surface a little more and we see that 
comprehensiveness again means we practise fairness. It would 
not be fair to ensure only some medically necessary services and 
not others. I do not believe we can, nor should we try to, choose 
at the federal level which service is medically necessary. We 
should continue to interpret the Canada Health Act as required 
coverage of all medically necessary services.
<P>
	The government will continue to take the position that if a 
province ensures any part of the cost of a service, it is an 
indication it believes it to be medically necessary and all of the 
costs must be covered.
<P>
	Justice Emmett Hall in his original royal commission on 
medicare recommended a very comprehensive package. Liberal 
governments of the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s accepted the 
concept of comprehensiveness, although not quite as broad a 
concept as Justice Hall's. Liberal governments in the 1990s will 
not turn their backs on this principle.
<P>
	The fourth principle is portability. It means Canadians 
maintain their health plan coverage when they travel or move. 
The portability principle is rooted in one of the fundamental 
elements underpinning our federation. It recognizes our right of 
mobility. Canadians are free to work and travel anywhere in the 
country without fear of losing their health insurance coverage.
<P>
	Portability is what makes our national health insurance truly 
national. Each separate health insurance plan may be provincial 
in origin but is recognized nationally in every province across 
the country.
<P>
	The fifth principle is public administration. Our health 
insurance plan must be operated by provincial governments on a 
not for profit basis. In my view this principle never seems to get 
the same attention as the others but it should. It is at the core of 
our ability to contain costs in the system and thus to deliver 
quality care at an affordable price.
<P>
	One would think that of all five principles, the Reform Party 
would be able to relate to this one. Public administration is the 
means by which we ensure all the other principles. When health 
insurance is operated and funded through government, we can 
guarantee that health care is universal, accessible, 
comprehensive and portable because we have direct control over 
it.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11873"> 11873 </A></B>
<P>
	It is through public administration that we also demonstrate 
our collective responsibility for our health care system. 
Canadians are responsible for paying for their health care 
system. We do it collectively through our taxes. We pay so that 
everyone can benefit according to need. We have agreed to 
provide this most essential of human services together. We must 
not lose that.
<P>
	Public administration also demonstrates something else about 
Canadians, our pragmatism. We want value for money and 
administering health insurance publicly is the best way to get it 
in health care. We need only look to the experience of our 
American neighbours to compare the efficiency of public 
administration with private administration.
<P>
	Not only does public administration make sure more of our 
health care dollars go toward patient care, government can be 
more successful than the private sector in keeping health care 
costs under control.
<P>
<B>(1330 ) </B>
<P>
	In 1993 we spent about $72 billion on health care. This 
represents 10 per cent of our gross domestic product. The public 
component of that 10 per cent has been growing at less than 2 per 
cent. Compare that to private health spending, which has been 
growing at 6.4 per cent.
<P>
	Over the last three years per capita spending on the publicly 
administered part of our system has been declining. Since our 
GDP has been growing, it is safe to predict that in 1994 and 1995 
we will come in with less than 10 per cent of GDP devoted to 
health care.
<P>
	Saying the federal government wants to maintain the 
principles of the Canada Health Act is not enough. We have to 
know the public is behind us. We all know that as politicians we 
cannot escape the will of our constituents. They put us in office 
and they can take us out. The same is true for the government. 
Canadians are all saying one thing to us very clearly: they want 
us to enforce the principles of the Canada Health Act.
<P>
	In Canada's health care system there are no first or second 
class citizens. We enjoy rights and privileges as Canadians that 
are the envy of the world. We can live wherever we want in 
Canada and have access to health care when we need it.
<P>
	The many values that make up Canada's social fabric are 
reflected in the five principles of the Canada Health Act. They 
reflect the Canadian concern for justice and equity in our health 
care system and they are not going to disappear. Canadians, 
including I am sure everyone in this House, will not allow that to 
happen.
<P>
	As I said a moment ago, we only need to compare ourselves 
with the United States. They have been trying for years to get a 
health care system. They have a private health care system that 
people purchase from private companies. They spend between 
13 per cent and 14 per cent of their GDP on health care. What 
does this extra money get them? There are 38 million people 
who are  not covered at all, and millions more are minimally 
covered. That does not sound like a great exchange: more for 
less. Therefore, I do not see what good privatizing our health 
care system will do.
<P>
	I also want to point out there are countries that have allowed 
extra billing. I know of one, Italy, that has allowed and allows to 
this date extra billing and private clinics. However, it may 
happen that a person is in a public hospital. The doctor will say: 
``I need to do a surgery, which is very expensive; I can only do it 
if you come to such and such a clinic, but it will cost you so 
much money''. That is setting up two classes of services: if you 
pay more, you get served faster, and maybe that specialist will 
treat you there.
<P>
	In this country it does not matter if one is poor or rich or even 
homeless. If you require assistance or surgery you choose the 
specialist or the doctor who will treat you. That is what a 
comprehensive and accessible medicare should be about. We 
need that kind of security, that kind of stability. Our health is the 
most precious thing we have, allowing us to do all of the other 
things we want to do. We talk about unemployment. If people 
are insecure about their health they cannot study, they cannot 
train, they cannot work.
<P>
	This gives Canadians a sense of stability. They do not have to 
worry or lose their homes and become paupers because they are 
ill or their children or parents are ill.
<P>
	Yes, we have a new world. We have a much larger population 
of seniors. We need to look at different treatments. That is true. 
That does not mean in any way retrenching one bit on the 
principles of health care, not one bit. I would never support any 
such direction. We must look at new treatments and new ways of 
assisting people.
<P>
	Preventative medicine in this country must become the norm, 
and not, as it is now, a reaction. We are still treating symptoms in 
many cases, and not dealing with preventative medicine. If we 
were to deal aggressively with that over and above the costs we 
now have, we would lower health costs in this country 
considerably. We should be looking at how we can improve our 
medicare system and our health system and its delivery through 
preventative and other measures, and not diminish the 
principles of health care. That is totally unacceptable. This 
government would never support that.
<P>
	We need to redouble our efforts to make sure even programs 
like psychiatric services are considered to be fundamental 
services. We have far too many children who are on waiting 
lists. Yes, a province has decided that is not a necessary service. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11874"> 11874 </A></B>
<P>
Maybe we need to look at that. It is a preventative service. This 
is what I mean by looking at innovative ways of dealing with the 
cost of medicare, not denying Canadians the right to access 
medicare.
<P>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Daviault (Ahuntsic, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise today to speak to the Reform Party motion 
concerning our health system. This motion provides for the 
compilation of a list of health care services considered as 
essential, to be fully funded by the federal and provincial 
governments, and a list of so-called non-core services, funded 
by private insurance and some form of user fee.
<P>
	Naturally, we are against this motion for reasons that I will 
explain in my remarks. For one thing, the first part of the motion 
reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House recognize that since the inception of our National Health Care 
System the federal share of funding for health care in Canada has fallen from 50 
per cent to 23 per cent-</BLOCKQUOTE>
While recognizing readily the federal government has reneged 
on its commitment, we feel that what should be denounced is the 
fact that the provinces were never compensated for this, and 
therefore saw their tax burden increase.
<P>
	In fact, the federal government's unilateral approach to 
maintaining its status as a partner in the Canadian medicare 
scheme is far from making all the provinces happy. The 
provincial health ministers do not agree either on how to prevent 
the Canadian medicare scheme from being affected by 
reductions in services and in federal transfer payments.
<P>
	As reported by Jean-Robert SansfaÃ§on in <I>Le Devoir </I>on April 
13, the Minister of Health candidly explained, by paying a 
simple lump sum, the Canada social transfer, instead of making 
several different and progressively smaller payments for health, 
education and social assistance, Ottawa will be able to maintain 
a level of control that could otherwise elude it because of its 
reduced contribution. As clever as it may be, the reporter added, 
the Prime Minister's strategy is nonetheless grossly unfair.
<P>
	Ottawa plans to reduce transfer payments to the provinces by 
$7 billion over three years starting in 1996-97. In Quebec, these 
cuts will jeopardize the health care system. During the health 
ministers' conference held in Vancouver, the Minister of Health, 
Mr. Rochon, released a study from his department indicating 
that Quebec, which is already experiencing an $8 billion 
shortfall, the equivalent of the annual budget for the Quebec 
health services network, following the changes made to health 
transfers since 1982-83, will be deprived of a further $2.4 
billion in federal moneys, between now and 1997-98.
<P>
	As pointed out by the hon. member for Drummond, who is 
celebrating her birthday today and to whom we wish all the best, 
the federal contribution is decreasing, having dropped from 
roughly 45.9 per cent of Quebec's health expenditures in 
1977-78 to 33.7 per cent in 1994-95. It can therefore be 
estimated that, for Quebec, the most recent cuts in established 
programs financing will result in a reduction of some 10.6 per 
cent of the federal contribution to health expenditures.
<P>
	This is typical of the federal government. It unilaterally 
decides to withdraw from a sector which, in any case, does not 
fall under its jurisdiction, without giving the provinces the 
appropriate financial compensation for this withdrawal. The 
Prime Minister said that this was an excellent system and that 
the government wants to maintain it. Why then withdraw from it 
if the system is so good?
<P>
	The fact is that, once again, the provinces will have to 
maintain this excellent health care program, but without federal 
support. So, after imposing, back in 1984, the five great 
principles of the Canada Health Act, the federal government is 
now unilaterally and implacably withdrawing its financial 
support, while keeping the power to impose national standards.
<P>
	Let me remind you of those principles. There is first of all the 
matter of comprehensiveness; this means that all health services 
provided by hospitals, medical practitioners and dentists must 
be insured. Two, universality means that all the people covered 
by the provincial plan should have access to all insured health 
services. Three, portability means that coverage of provincial 
plans is transferable from one province to another, and that 
health care services are also provided to insured persons who are 
temporarily out of their home province. Four, accessibility 
means that provincial plans must provide services on uniform 
terms and conditions, which means that billing is prohibited. As 
for public administration, it means that the health insurance plan 
must be administered on a non-profit basis by a public authority 
designated by the provincial government.
<P>
<B>(1340) </B>
<P>
	In Quebec we have no trouble with the five criteria. As far as 
we are concerned, they represent a minimum consensus. But 
what does the federal government have in mind, especially when 
we hear the Minister of Health spouting her earnest rhetoric as 
the great defender of the integrity of the Canadian medicare 
system? The cuts introduced unilaterally in the federal budget 
are draconian.
<P>
	Perhaps I may quote from a presentation by the Minister of 
Health before the Senate Committee on euthanasia and assisted 
suicide, in which she referred to palliative care.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11875"> 11875 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The minister said: ``I want to touch on 10 areas requiring 
attention if the individual who is the focus of my concern is to be 
provided with high quality care at the end of life. First, we need 
better diagnosis and prognosis. We need provider training. It is 
essential. We need fully developed teams of providers, ranking 
from physicians and volunteer support networks to dealing with 
problems of the end of life. We may even need to develop new 
specialties in this area''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	She went on to say: ``Research into pain control and 
management should be a priority. We need to know more about 
comfort and the supports that focus on time of administration of 
drugs and dosages. We must introduce support networks for 
patients and their caregivers''. Finally, and this is perhaps the 
best part of the speech:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``We need institutional development. There are not enough 
palliative care centres, especially outside of major urban areas. 
We need centres to coordinate community and home care, 
staffed with professionals with a sense of outreach and mobile 
forms of delivery''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Not only does the federal government take it upon itself to 
establish criteria, it also assumes the right to set priorities in 
areas that come under provincial jurisdiction, and now the 
Minister of Health, in response to the serious concerns she 
formulated, is going to cut transfer payments to the provinces. Is 
she doing the actual cutting? No. She is just taking orders from 
the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	In other words, Canada's health care system is adrift, and 
although in Quebec there is still a very broad consensus in 
favour of the main criteria of the Canada Health Act, we 
understand why the Reform Party is suggesting ways to make 
the system more efficient because, in the end, the debate is about 
these main criteria. Will we keep doing what we are doing now, 
which means making cuts in all services, something the Quebec 
Minister of Health is forced to do because of federal cutbacks, or 
should we de-insure certain services? I think our Reform Party 
friends did well to raise this matter in the House.
<P>
	The government has initiated major changes in health care 
funding, and we have to look beyond the rhetoric of the Minister 
of Health. In a speech to the Hospital Association on March 17, 
1995, the Minister of Health once again recalled certain aspects 
of the system: ``There is nothing in the budget that changes our 
technical capability to enforce the criteria of the Canada Health 
Act. The mechanism itself remains unchanged. If deductions 
must be made from transfer payments, deductions will be made 
either from the monetary portion of the new Canada Social 
Transfer or, if necessary, from other monetary transfers''.
<P>
	This is the so-called big stick. However, later on in her 
speech, the minister herself opened the door to a two-tier 
system. She said: ``On the other hand, we must be reasonable. 
The government and I are not going to ask the provinces to cover 
services like plastic surgery. In practice, we must allow the 
provinces some flexibility in identifying the range of insured 
services. However'', she admitted, ``we must realize that, by 
excluding certain medical services from medicare, we open the 
door to the privatization of coverage of health care services and 
to a lessening of our ability to control costs''.
<P>
<B>(1345) </B>
<P>
	Later, she alluded to her guilt, saying that as a politician-and 
I agree with her, that is essentially what she is in this case-she 
has to respect the wishes of Canadians, and Canadians are 
sending the government a clear message that they want the 
principles in the Canada Health Act to be upheld.
<P>
	They are strangling the provinces, but are doing it under the 
pretence of self-professed good intentions. However, as 
Saskatchewan's Minister of Health, Lorne Calvert, said:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``We are asking, if the federal government unilaterally 
withdraws more and more from funding to regions, how do they 
plan to maintain the integrity of the system?''
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Despite the many opportunities she has had this morning, the 
minister still has not answered this question. The federal 
government's share of health care funding is currently sitting at 
around 23 per cent and we are willing to bet that it will shrink 
even more. The net figure for health care, social assistance and 
education transfers from the federal government is $29.7 billion 
for 1995-96. This will drop to $26.9 billion in 1996-97, then to 
$25.1 million in 1997-98. And the minister admitted in her 
recent speech to the Canadian Hospital Association that a 
portion of this is for health, but she did not break it down.
<P>
	In perhaps an attempt to justify the scope of the cuts, the 
Prime Minister pointed out that the United States spends 15 per 
cent of its GDP on health; Europe, 8 per cent, and Canada, 10 per 
cent. So, he asked in an interview on CBC's ``Morningside'' 
why Canada would not be able to do it, for example, with only 
nine per cent of GDP?
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister not know that the Americans have 
private health care and that close to 40 million of them have no 
health care coverage whatsoever? Does he also not know that the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11876"> 11876 </A></B>
<P>
American government's attempt to implement a public health 
care system is meeting with strong opposition from the private 
sector?
<P>
	I do not know if the government even realizes that, by 
implementing such cuts, it is imperilling its own system. The 
Prime Minister himself, by his statements on essential services, 
is actually helping along the demise of the current system and is 
paving the way for a two-tiered system.
<P>
	Basically, this seeming desire to rationalize health care costs 
is expressed in freezes and reductions in transfer 
payments-and I would remind the minister that reference was 
made in the same speech to an annual increase in health care 
costs of approximately two per cent. These freezes and 
reductions in transfer payments conceal the governments real 
intention, which is to reduce the deficit on the backs of the 
provinces.
<P>
	So, how can the government still claim it is legitimately 
justified in imposing standards and dictating policy on the 
management and operation of the provincial health care 
schemes? The government is passing itself off to the provinces 
as upholding the law and wants to consult them to find out how 
they should tighten their belts to cut costs and health services 
while meeting federal standards.
<P>
	I would point out that, in this context, the consultation was 
between the federal Minister of Finance and the provincial 
finance ministers. Then, once everything was all wrapped up, 
the federal Minister of Health and her provincial counterparts 
were casually told that they would have streamline their 
systems.
<P>
	The forum on health is surely another example of lack of 
respect for the provinces. Minister Rochon has already 
reiterated Quebec's opposition to the forum, another indication 
of the government's intransigence with the provinces.
<P>
	I would also recall a statement made by the former Quebec 
Minister of Health, who is now the Minister of Labour in the 
federal government and who is curiously absent from the debate 
today. When she was Quebec's Minister of Health, she described 
the government's behaviour in connection with the forum on 
health as absurd. She went on to ask how the government could 
imagine reviewing the health care system without the 
participation of the provinces, which are responsible for 
delivery of services. She felt it was simply out of the question.
<P>
	In the case of the Minister of Labour, we could say that 
customs change with time and speeches change with the level of 
government.
<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
	Under the 1867 Constitution Act, the provinces have full and 
exclusive jurisdiction over health care. The federal 
government's costly interference in this area, notably through 
program duplication, was based on its constitutional power to 
spend.
<P>
	The federal government maintains that its involvement in 
health care is justified by the fact that the implementation and 
maintenance of medicare is a paramount issue of national 
interest and part of the rights and benefits associated with 
Canadian citizenship. Because of its debt, the federal 
government is withdrawing financially while still upholding the 
national interest and keeping the powers it gave itself.
<P>
	According to Minister Rochon, the real solution would be for 
the federal government to withdraw completely from health care 
and transfer the tax points belonging to Quebec and, I would 
add, to each of the provinces.
<P>
	The second part of the motion reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-therefore the House urges the government to consult with the provinces and 
other stakeholders to determine core services to be completely funded by the 
federal and provincial governments. . .</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Several members of this House, both on the government side 
and on the side of our friends from the Reform Party, have 
mentioned exceptions, examples of programs or treatments 
covered by special agreements.
<P>
	I would also like to remind the House of the importance given 
in Quebec to the five fundamental principles of health care, 
which were the subject of major debate during the election 
campaign. As you will recall, the former Liberal provincial 
government, of which the new federal Minister of Labour was a 
member, wanted to eliminate the newsletter <I>Malade sur pied</I>, 
which lists the drugs that are covered or available. It also wanted 
to charge $20 in user fees for chemotherapy treatments for 
cancer patients. This directive provoked an outcry in Quebec. 
As a result, the Liberals quickly suspended it and the new 
government wasted no time in cancelling it.
<P>
	We cannot eliminate all user fees. I know that Quebec charges 
user fees for some services, but the cuts imposed by the federal 
government force us to make unconscionable decisions, and I 
think that the federal government must take the blame for the 
health care cuts in each of the provinces.
<P>
	The Quebec government is also considering the feasibility of 
introducing a basic universal drug plan that would benefit not 
only welfare recipients and seniors but the entire population and 
cover all new drugs and treatments for diseases such as AIDS 
and cancer.
<P>
	In this regard, Quebec is still striving to ensure universal 
access. By supporting these measures, we in the Bloc Quebecois 
are telling the federal government that, if it cannot enforce these 
principles we care about, it should give us our tax points and we 
will deal with the matter. However, the federal government 
should not tell the provinces what they should do-and not in 
health care matters, in my opinion. As far as the other provinces 
are concerned, if a western province wants to take a different 
approach, it should be allowed to do so, provided it continues to 
<P>

<B><A NAME="11877"> 11877 </A></B>
<P>
negotiate with all the other provinces. The issue of portability 
can be settled with or  without the federal government, so that 
Albertans can be treated in Quebec and vice versa.
<P>
	I think that the federal government must bear the greatest 
blame in this area.
<P>
	In closing, I would like to remind you that we will oppose this 
motion, although we wish to commend the Reform Party for 
raising this issue in the House.

	<B>Ms. Hedy Fry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I was a little disturbed by the 
last part of the hon. member's speech.
<P>
	He can correct me if I am wrong, but I understood the member 
to say that he would like to see national medicare disbanded and 
provinces deal with provinces in terms of issues such as 
portability.
<P>
	This government is committed to Canadian medicare, which 
is based on treating all Canadians equally as they cross from 
province to province. I would really like to see whether the 
member would like to elaborate on the dismantling of medicare 
that I just heard or to correct me if I was wrong.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Daviault:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member probably forgot 
the first part of my remarks. The point I am making is that we, in 
Quebec, agree with the five principles, which we regard as a 
minimum consensus. However, it is rather cynical for the 
federal government to hide behind these five principles and cut 
transfers to the provinces.
<P>
	The hon. member said earlier that necessity is mother of 
invention. I do not think that the federal government's goal in 
cutting transfer payments to the provinces is to spur lazy 
provinces to action. It is only trying to get out of a difficult 
financial situation. This is not a health strategy but a financial 
strategy and, in that regard, the health minister must submit to 
the finance minister's wishes.
<P>
	We feel we are at the crossroads. Quebec remains committed 
to the principles of universality, accessibility, portability, and so 
on. However, if the federal government cannot do its job, we, at 
the provincial level, are prepared to go over its head and 
negotiate directly with the other provinces to ensure the 
portability of the system. The federal government should get 
serious, uphold the five principles and provide the required 
funding. It is true, up to a certain point, that money does not 
guarantee the quality of health care, but when you cut-

<BLOCKQUOTE>I don't purport to know more about law than the Attorney General. However,

<BLOCKQUOTE>This incident is typical of the level of honesty and fairness we can expect from

<P>
	The young people of this school have taken up a very 
admirable cause. They wish to see the establishment of 
Igalirtuuq, a sanctuary on Isabella Bay, Baffin Island, for the

extinct and so a sanctuary would help protect the species.

	The 10 and 12-year olds at Norway public school have written 
letters to the Minister of the Environment and circulated a 
petition at a recent school open house. I will be presenting these 
letters along with the petition to the Minister of the Environment 
next week.

others about the bowhead and other types of whales. They want 
to save the bowhead whale from extinction and they are asking 
the House to help them.

overcome the challenges of the harsh Canadian climate and 
geography and have built on the base of our abundant natural

	Seasonal work currently provides jobs and livelihoods for 
over a million Canadians. Seasonal industries and the people

	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on the 
surface the Canadian economy appears to be sailing smoothly. 
Yet, as the Moody's downgrade revealed, the buoyancy is 
deceptive. Three indicators are pointing to rough seas ahead.
<P>
	The first is our sinking dollar. Since the release of the 
government's first budget our currency has lost more than 20 per 
cent of its value versus the yen and the mark. The Bank of 
Canada has only kept it afloat through high interest rates.
<P>
	However, it is these high interest rates which have knocked 
the wind out of our sails, housing sales, that is, which hit a 
13-year low in March.
<P>
	While the combination of high interest rates and a 
depreciating currency roil the waters, the third storm cloud has 
appeared on the horizon. Inflation is re-emerging which will 
prevent the Bank of Canada from offering the interest rate relief 
we all need as Canadians.
<P>

fiscal course for deficit elimination, not deficit reduction, our 
economy will end up on the rocks.

	<B>Mr. Michel Daviault (Ahuntsic, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
morning we learned that the number of welfare recipients in 
Quebec had increased drastically, from 550,000 in 1990 to 
808,000 this year. To make things even worse, 188,000 of these 
recipients, or close to 25 per cent of them, live in Montreal. That 
city is in fact the main victim of the federal government's 
negligence and incompetence.
<P>
	This deterioration of the situation also confirms that federal 
reforms designed to improve the plight of the poor have failed 
miserably. This government only managed to make things 
worse.
<P>
	When will the federal government realize that it cannot 
deliver and that it must provide Quebec with the necessary tools 
to develop a real job strategy? This government's stubbornness

	First, a cabinet minister can sue the government that employs 
them provided it does not infringe on the rights of their children

	Second, $100,000 trips using Challenger jets are justifiable 
only on the condition that the minister speaks at a northern U.S.

son-in-law works for Power Corp., back off.

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="TELECOMMUNICATIONS">TELECOMMUNICATIONS</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the government took the unprecedented 
step of tabling two orders concerning DTH satellite distribution 
which are a direct reversal of the CRTC's decision. One of the 
orders comes in response to the dearest wishes of the Power 
DirecTv Group, by allowing the group to use an American 
satellite. We know that one of the main shareholders and leaders 
of the group is the Prime Minister's son-in-law.
<P>
	My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Would he 
confirm that the chairman of the panel appointed to advise the 
government in this matter, Mr. Gordon Ritchie, is a former 
associate of his principal adviser, Mr. Eddie Goldenberg, who 
intervened directly in this case?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we have been through this a number of times.
<P>
	We have demonstrated repeatedly that the action the 
government took both in initiating a review of the exemption 
order issued by the CRTC and in adopting the report of the panel 
of experts chaired by Mr. Ritchie has been in conformity with 
the views of many disinterested groups, at least in terms of the 
commercial interests involved. These include Friends of 
Canadian Broadcasting, the Consumers' Association of Canada, 
ACTRA, groups which really are not involved other than as 
important users of the system. Newspaper editorials have also 
asked for this response.
<P>
	If the Leader of the Opposition wishes to debate this matter on 
the basis of process, then we will have something of substance to 
talk about. So far, his only attack on this has been unbased 
innuendo, which I think reveals more about him than it does 
about our process.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, a long answer that could have been shorter if it had 
been the answer to the question.
<P>
	The question is a question of fact: Is Mr. Goldenberg a former 
associate of the chairman of the panel that drafted the orders? 
The question is very straightforward. It is a question of fact that 
will clarify the matter for the public, since the Prime Minister 
took the unprecedented step-I do not think this has happened 
very often in Ottawa, and I think it is probably the first time ever 
in the history of the federal Parliament and the federal 
government-of trying, and I think he did so in good faith, to 
isolate himself as though behind a wall from a fundamental 
decision by his government.
<P>
	I therefore want to ask the Prime Minister whether he would 
agree that his wall shows some serious gaps and whether he 
realizes that the actions of his principal adviser, Mr. 
Goldenberg, allowed him to do indirectly what his conflict of 
interest guidelines prohibited him from doing directly?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, a lot of smoke but no fire.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The problem here for the Leader of the Opposition is very 
simple. He has a report of a panel of experts, yes, chaired by 
Gordon Ritchie, participated in by Roger TassÃ© and Robert 
Rabinovitch, three former deputy ministers in the Public 
Service of Canada. They produced a report which has been 
generally praised in editorial comments and by other groups.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11882"> 11882 </A></B>
<P>
	The Leader of the Opposition has nothing to criticize in the 
report. In fact, as I recall from the publication of the report on 
April 6, the most telling criticisms came from the very party 
he claims it was intended to benefit. Why? Because the result 
of the report and the direction which was tabled yesterday really 
give nothing to anybody except the right to apply to the CRTC 
for a licence. That right is open to Power DirecTv. It is open 
to Expressvu. It is open to everybody else.
<P>
<B>(1420 ) </B>
<P>
	Our intention has been to be very, very careful on process. We 
invoked a process which was transparent and open. We have 
initiated it with tabling a direction, a process which is statutory, 
open to debate in a public forum, namely the House of Commons 
and the Senate of Canada.
<P>
	The Leader of the Opposition cannot find anything to criticize 
in that process so he is left to asking about irrelevant details.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Colleagues, it is early in the question period. 
May I please appeal to you to keep the questions and answers as 
brief as possible.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is very strange to hear the minister hiding 
himself behind the process while they have put aside the 
process, squashing a decision made by the CRTC. It is the first 
time that has been done in the history of Canada. That is 
something.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I have the following question for the Prime Minister. 
Considering the fact that the order is tailor-made to meet the 
demands of Power DirecTv, that this order is a carbon copy of 
the draft prepared by a panel chaired by the former associate of 
the Prime Minister's principal adviser and that this associate 
personally intervened by speaking to the responsible minister, is 
the Prime Minister not bothered by this impression that Power 
DirecTv and his son-in-law were given preferential treatment?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Leader of the Opposition keeps trying to find 
something that would discredit the process but he does not 
succeed.
<P>
	The fact is the process was initiated yesterday in the House of 
Commons. It is true it is the first time it has been used. I am sure 
the Leader of the Opposition would admit it is a power that has 
only recently been included in the statute, although it was 
proposed that it was included in the statute by the previous 
government. It is a relatively new power and was used in a 
circumstance which itself was unprecedented, namely the 
granting of the exemption order by the CRTC.
<P>
	In the face of the exemption order being granted on August 
30, many groups asked the government to act, saying there were 
problems with this. If we had not acted in response to those 
criticisms, I suspect that at least the Leader of the Opposition, or 
perhaps his critic who often claims to speak on behalf of groups 
like the Friends of Canadian Broadcasting, would be standing in 
this House criticizing us for having not acted in the way we have 
acted.

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
<I>Toronto Star</I> reported this morning that, through some strange 
coincidence, the Minister of Canadian Heritage happened to be 
in Edgar Bronfman's suite in Los Angeles when Seagram took 
control of MCA studios. Following this transaction, Seagram 
will have to secure Investment Canada's approval before it can 
also get the Canadian subsidiary, the movie theatre chain 
Cineplex Odeon, out of the deal.
<P>
	My question, which is quite simple, is the following: Can the 
Prime Minister explain to us what business a minister of his 
government had in Edgar Bronfman's suite, when Investment 
Canada will have a very important decision to make regarding 
this transaction?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean ChrÃ©tien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Investment Canada will review this investment 
proposal like it would any other. The Minister of Canadian 
Heritage is not responsible for this issue, the Minister of 
Industry is, I believe.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Minister of Canadian Heritage is a minister of the government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> Supposedly.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier:</B> Yes, supposedly. So, the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage, a government minister, just happens to be in a 
businessman's suite at the moment that a transaction is taking 
place which will require the approval of Investment Canada, an 
agency over which the government has some influence.
<P>
<B>(1425) </B>
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister not feel that the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage exercised poor judgment by putting himself 
in a situation of conflict?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean ChrÃ©tien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Bronfman Group's investment proposal will come 
before the government and will be evaluated in accordance with 
the laws of the country and we will see what will happen. The 
appropriate minister and commission will examine the case and 
make a decision. The government will then decide whether or 
not to approve the deal.
<P>

<HR>
<B><A NAME="11883"> 11883 </A></B>
<P>
	Many businessmen, citizens and opposition members speak 
to the minister every day, under all sorts of circumstances. That 
is normal. Because, before making a decision-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order, please.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. ChrÃ©tien (Saint-Maurice):</B> Mr. Speaker, a decision will 
be made when there is an application. I do not know if we are 
faced with an application but with any investment made in 
Canada from foreign interests trying to buy Canadian concerns 
there is a review process. The review will be there. There will be 
a decision and that is it. That is the law of the land and the law 
will be respected.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as has already been referred to, the Seagram company 
acquired an 80 per cent interest in the movie giant MCA. 
Investment Canada may be required to make a ruling as to 
whether Seagram should be regarded as a Canadian company. 
While all of this is going on, the Minister of Canadian Heritage 
was apparently in Los Angeles being wined and dined by the 
principals to the deal.
<P>
	Did the Prime Minister personally know about these 
meetings? Has he had the ethics commissioner determine that 
the minister has not once again put himself in a conflict of 
interest situation?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member may know there is an issue here as to 
whether or not Seagram is a Canadian company. If so, then the 
transaction is not reviewable by Investment Canada.
<P>
	I want to assure the hon. member that that determination, 
which will be made according to legal principles by Investment 
Canada, is done entirely without reference to the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage as if that were relevant.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the question was about ethics and not the regulatory 
decision.
<P>
	Power Corporation's DirecTv involving the Prime Minister's 
son-in-law just got the government to reverse a ruling of the 
CRTC for which the Minister of Canadian Heritage is 
responsible. Now the Bronfmans and Seagram board member 
Paul Desmarais who are closely related to the Liberal Party 
appear to be seeking the minister's help to get Investment 
Canada to leave them alone. We fear that the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage may be ending up as some sort of errand boy 
for an emerging Liberal family compact in the communications 
field.
<P>
	What assurances can the Prime Minister give that the 
government's decisions in this rapidly developing 
communications field will not only be free from political 
influence but will also be free even from the appearance of 
political influence?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the marriage of convenience between the Bloc and 
Reform is one formed in the gutter I must say.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
<B>(1430 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I know today is Thursday, not Wednesday. I 
would ask hon. members to please be very judicious in their 
choice of words. I would go back to the floor to the hon. Minister 
of Industry.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manley:</B> Mr. Speaker, the process is really the assurance 
that the leader is looking for. I offer him a reminder of last 
Christmas when Canadians across the country told us loud and 
clear that they wanted competition. We have taken moves in the 
context of the DTH file to ensure that there is competition.
<P>
	The member raises the issue of ethics. Surely he understands 
that the best assurance that ethical principles have been lived up 
to is a clear and transparent process. That is the process we 
invoked. We invoked one that was open to public debate and 
discussion. We have listened in a public manner to the 
submissions of Canadians from coast to coast.
<P>
	If he disagrees with the submissions that we heard from 
hundreds of Canadians, from editorialists, from artists and from 
broadcasters then let him say so, but let him not criticize it on 
the basis of innuendo. It is below him.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister will know from history books that 
the Liberal Party evolved from a group of reformers in 
pre-Confederation days who fought against the family compact, 
a closely knit group of elites, many of them related to each other, 
who subverted responsible government to protect and advance 
their personal and collective interests.
<P>
	If the Prime Minister is really committed to integrity, surely 
he does not want to allow such a clique to develop around his 
government.
<P>
	My question is very simple. How does the Prime Minister 
propose to prevent the formation and activities of this Liberal 
family compact, la clique du chÃ¢teau libÃ©ral, from undermining 
the integrity of his administration?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean ChrÃ©tien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, when I spoke in the House yesterday on this matter I 
said I did not participate in any discussion in committee or in 
cabinet. When the decision was made I was not there. I have 
absolutely no conflict of interest.
<P>
	It is true that somebody who is earning his living working for 
the corporation in question is my son-in-law. This is why I 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11884"> 11884 </A></B>
<P>
abstained in the discussion even though it had no conflict of 
interest at all. I know some people want to attack me but I have 
been standing proudly in the House for 32 years. Everyone can 
look at my record.
<P>
	It just so happens there is a lot of controversy in Canada 
because there is not enough competition. We had complaints in 
December because there was an exemption to make sure there 
would be no competition. My colleagues in the cabinet, without 
my presence, using the laws of Canada, have made a ruling 
which is clear. Everybody who wants to can apply for a licence 
and it will be reviewed under Canadian law. I will not intervene.
<P>
	However, I will not go down to the level of people who do not 
have the decency to realize that a Prime Minister of Canada has 
the right to have his daughter well married.

	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-TÃ©miscouata, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Industry.
<P>
	By issuing unprecedented decrees, the government has 
reversed the CRTC's decision to license Expressvu and has 
allowed Power DirecTv to use an American satellite, rather than 
use a Canadian one exclusively, to broadcast its programs. The 
Minister of Industry has confirmed publicly that the Prime 
Minister's principal adviser, Eddie Goldenberg, intervened 
directly in the matter.
<P>
	How can the Minister of Industry claim to have disregarded 
the financial interests at stake for the Prime Minister's 
son-in-law in discussing the Power DirecTv file with Eddie 
Goldenberg?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, again the opposition is grasping at straws.
<P>
	The hon. member is correct. I did confirm that I informed Mr. 
Goldenberg on the status of the file. That is normal. I received 
no submissions. Certainly I have never discussed the matter at 
all with the Prime Minister. I can assure the House of that. Nor 
did I receive, as the member describes, any pressure from Mr. 
Goldenberg in any respect with regard to this file.
<P>
	What I did receive were hundreds of submissions through the 
review panel from Canadians from coast to coast who said: 
``Please review the order that was issued in August by the 
CRTC''. When the report of the panel was issued it was again 
supported not only by editorialists but by many of the groups on 
behalf of which the hon. member claims to speak in the House of 
Commons and committee, groups like ACTRA, the Friends of 
Canadian Broadcasting, the Canadian Council of the Arts.
<P>
	I do not understand what her problem is. If we did not listen to 
those groups she would be on her feet criticizing us for not 
having done so.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-TÃ©miscouata, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, how does the Minister of Industry explain Power 
DirecTv's failure to apply to the CRTC for a license, which it 
could have done since last July, other than by the fact that Power 
DirecTv had been assured that the government would issue a 
customized order enabling it to take over Canadian airwaves 
with an American satellite?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this is a case of the more noise, the less substance. As 
the hon. member knows, the condition of the exemption order 
which required that all content be carried through Canadian 
satellites excluded essentially everybody but Expressvu from-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manley:</B> They are getting louder and louder, Mr. Speaker. 
It excluded potentially everybody but Expressvu from-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order. The hon. Minister of Industry may 
finish.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manley:</B> The effect of the exemption order was that 
essentially nobody but Expressvu could possibly have carried on 
the service.
<P>
	If Power DirecTv had got what I assume it wanted, the 
government would have tabled a direction that would have 
changed the conditions of the exemption order to authorize 
Power DirecTv to operate under an exemption order. Then it 
would have been able to do it right away. It did not get that from 
the panel. In fact it got an obligation to apply to the CRTC for a 
licence which had already set conditions that put it essentially 
out of business in Canada.
<P>
	The whole hypothesis of the member's question is entirely 
unfounded, but is obviously inherently contradictory. She does 
not understand the case.

	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	The government abused Investment Canada over the Ginn 
Publishing affair and it is poised to do it again over the Seagram 
acquisition. The government blamed the Tories for the Ginn 
Publishing deal but it cannot blame them this time.
<P>

<P>
	The Minister of Canadian Heritage attended meetings in Los 
Angeles with MCA and Seagram prior to this transaction being 
filed officially with the securities commission or cleared by 
Investment Canada.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister not understand that as a result of 
these meetings the Minister of Canadian Heritage appears to be 
influencing Investment Canada's decision?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I guess this is just my day.
<P>
	Again we have a false hypothesis. With respect to the issue 
that is before Investment Canada at the present time, it is one 
simply of fact, whether or not Seagram is a Canadian controlled 
corporation. If so, then the transaction is not reviewable by 
Investment Canada.
<P>
	The hon. member implies by her question that somehow or 
another the Minister of Canadian Heritage ought to be able to 
know in advance of a visit to a facility such as MCA that a 
takeover is about to be launched. If he has the ability to see in 
advance, then my suggestion would be that perhaps he would 
have succeeded very well as an investment counsellor.
<P>
	How could he possibly have known in advance that this 
transaction was to occur? It is a ridiculous question.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the insidious backroom family connections continue.
<P>
	Investment Canada has confirmed that the ADM for cultural 
affairs in the department of heritage is directly responsible for 
the Seagram file. He also has family ties with the Bronfmans. He 
is-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I appeal to the hon. member to put her question 
now.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, why is the 
Prime Minister allowing this sensitive issue to be handled by an 
individual who is in a direct conflict of interest and whose 
family stands to benefit from the decisions made?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean ChrÃ©tien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Minister of Industry, who is responsible for 
Investment Canada, has explained very clearly that there is a 
process.
<P>
	There will be an application from the buyers of this complex. 
They will have to establish very clearly something that is very 
easy to understand: Is this company Canadian controlled or not? 
It is a matter of fact. Investment Canada will review this. If it is a 
Canadian company it means the huge corporation will be 
controlled by Canadian interests. I do not see anything wrong if 
that is the case.
<P>
	If it is not the case and it is an American concern, it will have 
to follow the same route as any other foreign investment. 
Therefore, it will be decided by Investment Canada. Investment 
Canada will look at the books of the Seagram corporation and 
decide if it is Canadian or not.  It is not my decision. It is for 
Investment Canada to decide.

	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, Power 
DirecTv needed an exemption order from cabinet, since the use 
of its partner's American satellite violates current CRTC rules. 
Moreover, because of such exemption orders, the federal 
government could be liable to court action, this according to the 
CRTC's secretary general.
<P>
	Will the Minister of Industry recognize that, with this 
made-to-measure order for Power DirecTv, the government is 
allowing that company to use DirecTv's American satellite, thus 
avoiding having to pay tens of millions of dollars in fees for 
using the Canadian satellite?
<P>
<B>(1445) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, I want to say two things. First, the legal opinion which 
the government received does not support CRTC's contention. 
Second, the process which we undertook yesterday is of a 
parliamentary nature. If the hon. member has suggestions to 
make regarding the handling of this issue, we are prepared to 
listen.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, we know 
that legal opinions are usually debated before the courts, which 
raises the following question: How can the Prime Minister, as 
head of the government, accept a decision which not only 
favours his son-in-law's interests but, more importantly, which 
makes his government liable to court action?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am sure the hon. member knows there are often 
differences of opinion among lawyers. I can assure the hon. 
member our view is that the government acted entirely legally 
and is not subject to any civil suit for the actions it has taken in 
issuing a direction in pursuance of its powers under the 
Broadcasting Act.
<P>
	However, I want to make clear that our objective in this, as I 
have stated several times in the House on previous days, is to 
create a competitive environment for direct to home satellite 
services, a level playing field. We think the direction we have 
tabled is the best means of achieving it.
<P>
	Again, since there is a parliamentary process invoked here, if 
members in either of the opposition parties think there is a better 
way to do it, they may want to suggest changes to the direction.

	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the backroom family connections continue. Investment Canada 
has confirmed the assistant deputy minister for cultural affairs 
in the department of heritage is directly responsible for the 
Seagram file. Surprise, surprise.
<P>
	He has family ties to the Bronfmans. He is Victor 
Rabinovitch, the brother of Robert Rabinovitch, who wrote the 
DTH satellite directive that benefits Power Corp and who works 
for the Bronfmans.
<P>
	Why is the minister allowing this sensitive issue to be handled 
by an individual who is in direct conflict of interest and whose 
family stands to benefit from the decisions?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, let me help the hon. member to understand the process 
that is being invoked here.
<P>
	The public servant in question does not work either for 
Investment Canada or for Industry Canada. Until it is 
determined that Seagram is not a Canadian company, there is in 
fact no role to be played by the Department of Canadian 
Heritage in the matter.
<P>
	If Seagram is a Canadian company, the transaction is not 
reviewable by Investment Canada. As far as I can tell, the 
consequence of that would simply be that the sequel to ``Jurassic 
Park'', which I know is one of the hon. member's favourite 
movies, could perhaps qualify for the Oscar for best foreign 
film.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
do not have to go very far in the House to find ``Jurassic Park''.
<P>
	This morning when asked about the heritage minister's trip to 
Los Angeles to meet with MCA and the Bronfmans, the ethics 
counsellor admitted that he had no knowledge of the trip. 
Considering the strong ties of the Bronfman family to the 
Liberal Party and the decisions that lie before Investment 
Canada, we have yet another problem of conflict of interest.
<P>
	Why did the minister fail to consult again the ethics 
counsellor on an issue that affects the integrity of the decisions 
made by the government from ``Jurassic Park''?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean ChrÃ©tien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, now I will have to inform my cabinet ministers that 
when they go on trips they should ask the permission of the 
ethics counsellor.
<P>
	Come on, look at the facts. This Canadian company of the 
Bronfman family, a great business success in Canada, has 
expanded into the United States. We should not be ashamed of 
that.
<P>
	If it is still a Canadian company, it does not have to apply to 
Investment Canada. If it has too many interests outside Canada 
and has no more Canadian interests, it will have to apply.
<P>
<B>(1450 ) </B>
<P>
	There is no mystery. Why do they use innuendoes to try to 
destroy the reputations of people when the process is completely 
open and when we want to introduce some competition in the 
communications system of Canada?
<P>
	I know le dÃ©sespoir of these guys on the other side of the 
House. They do not have anything to say. They are trying to find 
fault when there is no problem. That is why the Canadian public 
is not responding to them and why they are so low in the polls.

	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is directed to the Prime Minister.
<P>
	In January 1995, nearly 5,500 Quebec households applied for 
welfare for the first time. More than 40 per cent of these new 
applicants were young people under the age of 25. Altogether, 
sadly enough, we have a record 808,000 people in Quebec, 25 
per cent of whom live in Montreal, who must turn to welfare as a 
last resort.
<P>
	Considering that 40 per cent of new welfare recipients-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Lalonde:</B> Mr. Speaker, the people I am talking about do 
not have the same lobbying power as those who were referred to 
repeatedly just now, but I would like to be heard just the same.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Lalonde: </B>Considering that 40 per cent of new welfare 
recipients were either on unemployment insurance or were 
denied access to UI, would the Prime Minister agree that these 
cuts in unemployment insurance totalling $5.5 billion over three 
years are simply--
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Hon. members, we should be listening to 
questions and answers today.
<P>
	The Prime Minister.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean ChrÃ©tien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, like the hon. member I too deplore this state of affairs 
in Quebec. And that is why, since we came to power, we have 
discussed the need for job creation, and we have had some 
results. Nearly 100,000 new jobs were created in Quebec since 
we formed the government, and unemployment in Quebec 
dropped by 1.3 per cent over the past 18 months.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11887"> 11887 </A></B>
<P>
	Unfortunately, at a time when Quebec has the most serious 
social problems in Canada and unemployment is increasing, the 
Government of Quebec only thinks about independence, 
separation and the Constitution. And while it does its political 
fancy footwork, the poor in Quebec are paying the price. That 
is what is so unfortunate. We want to talk about job creation, 
while it dreams of separatism at the expense of the poor in that 
province.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
because these people are not as well connected, and because we 
are convinced that only sovereignty will give Quebec a chance 
to deal with the terrible scourge of unemployment.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Lalonde:</B> Does the Prime Minister not realize that the 
federal system has failed us in this respect and that the situation 
will go on deteriorating under the Canada Social Transfer, which 
will further reduce federal funding for welfare assistance?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean ChrÃ©tien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as a result of changes in unemployment insurance 
benefits, 250,000 families in Quebec now receive an additional 
$1,000 since the changes in the program came into force.
<P>
	I am glad that we are starting to talk about these problems, 
because Quebecers like me, and other Canadians as well, are 
sick and tired of hearing about the Constitution and separation. 
At last we are going to talk about the real problems of 
Quebecers: unemployment and employment. If they would only 
stop bothering us with all this talk about separation.

contributions to this important cultural and tourism facility in 
the city of Toronto.

financial pressures the group at Harbourfront is facing, I invited 
both parties to get together to see whether or not discussions

no reason to consult. The Prime Minister has just now repeated 
again that there was no need to consult.

campaign the Liberals said that they wanted to rebuild trust. We 
would like them to do it.

an investigation and rule on the matter. Why does the Prime 
Minister resist having the ethics counsellor apply his skills to 
resolving the problem?

Parliament has the right to discuss the direction and to propose

	The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11889"> 11889 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernard Patry (Pierrefonds-Dollard, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in 1984 the members of this House unanimously 
adopted the Canada Health Act. It was a particularly 
noteworthy event for two specific reasons. This legislation 
guaranteed quality health services to all Canadians, regardless 
of their income or their place of residence.
<P>
	Furthermore, this piece of legislation was adopted 
unanimously by the members of all the parties. Everyone felt a 
national health insurance scheme was invaluable.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This government's commitment to universal health care 
remains unshaken. The Canada Health Act and the system we 
have built under its framework is a defining feature for our 
society. The essence of medicare is not to be found in the 
mysteries of a funding formula. It is certainly not to be found 
simply in the amount of money we spend. Rather, it is to be 
found in providing quality health care equally to all Canadians.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The five main principles underlying the Canada Health Act 
are: universality, accessibility, comprehensiveness, portability 
and public administration. They are rooted in values of fairness, 
social justice, compassion and respect for human dignity. These 
values are shared by all Canadians. They are part of our social 
fabric.
<P>
	Some claim that our health insurance system is too costly and 
that we can no longer afford the luxury of a government funded 
system. On the contrary, I believe that our health insurance 
system is no luxury but a necessity and that public financing of 
this system helps keep health care costs under control.
<P>
	In investing in health in general and in health care services, 
our government is helping to keep Canadians healthy and fit. 
They will be able to meet the economic challenges of the 21st 
century. Studies indicate that many days of work are lost to 
illness or accident. They all reach the same conclusion: these 
days lost have a negative effect on workers, society and the 
economy.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A health care system that Canadians can access without fear 
of financial hardship encourages people to seek medically 
necessary treatment before an illness or injury becomes life 
threatening or debilitating. Early diagnosis and treatment are far 
less expensive than chronic care, both to the individual and to 
the system. Such a system does not encourage patients to seek 
inappropriate care.
<P>
	For those who think in terms of the bottom line, the principles 
of the Canada Health Act support an economically efficient 
health care system. These are economies of scale obtained from 
governments being the only buyers of medically necessary 
hospital and physician health care services and of the entire 
population being the customer base. A system that is publicly 
administered saves this country billions of dollars annually in  
administrative overhead. In hospitals and in clinics this frees up 
the resources in time to practise medicine, not administration.
<P>
<B>(1510) </B>
<P>
	Finally, medicare produces a healthy population, which in 
turn means a healthy and productive labour force. This is a 
reciprocal relationship between business and the health sector. 
A healthy business sector means economic growth. Economic 
growth means jobs. Jobs reduce unemployment, and less 
unemployment means a healthier population and reduced health 
costs. In other words, a healthy Canada is a wealthy Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The fact that the Canada Health Act is both to flexible and too 
rigid was also deplored. Yet, according to the Canadian 
constitution, it is up to the provinces and territories to provide 
and administer health care services. Consequently, the 
provinces and territories must identify their own priorities and 
manage their resources.
<P>
	Under the act, the provinces and territories must provide the 
required medical and hospital services. However, nothing 
prevents them from providing other types of services. This 
means that a province may pay for the costs of prescription 
drugs or dental care for children, while another may finance air 
ambulance services.
<P>
	As long as it abides by the five basic principles underlying the 
Canada Health Act, each provincial or territorial government is 
free to provide additional services at its own cost, or experiment 
with different structures. The basic criteria governing federal 
financing under the Canada Health Act are the five principles 
previously mentioned. The government is not prepared to 
compromise on these principles.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The basic criteria for federal funding under the Canada Health 
Act are the five principles mentioned earlier. It is these that the 
government is not willing to negotiate.
<P>
	The first principle is universality, meaning that all residents 
of a province must be insured under the provincial health plan if 
it is to receive federal support. We as Canadians believe we must 
all have access to medically necessary services. People cannot 
be deinsured because they might be costly for the system to 
cover. They cannot be turned away at the hospital door because, 
for example, they have not paid their quarterly tax bill or even 
their provincial premium. Any one of us needing health care will 
be treated the same as everyone else. This is what is meant by 
equity.
<P>
	Accessibility on uniform terms and conditions is the second 
principle. We should not face any financial barriers in receiving 
health care, no extra billing, no user charges, no facility fees, no 
upfront cash payments. If the service is medically necessary, we 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11890"> 11890 </A></B>
<P>
will get it at the time defined by medical consideration and not 
by money.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The principle of comprehensiveness is a recognition that 
Canadians have a number of needs which must be met. It would 
be unfair to insure only certain medical services. We will 
continue to contend that the provinces and territories must 
insure all medically necessary services.
<P>
	However, comprehensiveness does not mean uniformity. It 
does not mean that the provinces and territories must all meet 
health care needs in exactly the same fashion. These needs must 
be met, but there is some flexibility as to how this can be 
achieved.
<P>
	Portability means that Canadians are always covered by 
medicare when they travel or move within Canada. This is what 
gives our health care system its national dimension.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Canadians enjoy the freedom to work and travel anywhere in 
the country, without fear of losing their health insurance 
coverage. Each separate health insurance plan may be provincial 
in origin but is recognized nationally in every province across 
the country.
<P>
	The fifth and final principle is public administration. Our 
health insurance plans must be operated by provincial 
governments on a non-profit basis. It is at the core of our ability 
to contain costs in a system and thus to deliver quality care at an 
affordable price.
<P>
	Public administration is the key to ensuring all the other 
principles. When health insurance is operated and funded by the 
government, we can guarantee that health care is universal, 
accessible, comprehensive and portable because we have direct 
control over it. Public administration not only ensures that more 
of our health care dollars go toward patient care but it also 
makes governments more successful than the private sector in 
keeping health care costs under control.
<P>
<B>(1515) </B>
<P>
	In 1993 we spent about $72 billion on health care. This 
represents 10 per cent of our gross domestic product. The public 
component of that 10 per cent has been growing at less than 2 per 
cent. Compare that to private health spending which has been 
growing at 6.4 per cent.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	However, complying with the provisions of the Canada Health 
Act does not prevent the provinces and territories from adopting 
innovative strategies to meet the challenges in providing health 
care services.
<P>
	For example, British Columbia has set up emergency 
response teams, New Brunswick has established an extramural 
hospital and Quebec has achieved excellent results with its local 
community health centres. All these initiatives have solved 
different problems and demonstrate how flexible the legislation 
is.
<P>
	The Minister of Health even recognized that private clinics 
offering medically necessary services can be an effective way to 
give such services, provided that the medically necessary 
services are fully covered by provincial or territorial health 
plans. What is totally unacceptable is, first, physicians 
extra-billing for services already covered by provincial or 
territorial health plans and, second, charging user fees for 
medically necessary services covered by provincial or territorial 
health plans.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In this era of fiscal restraint, Canadians want value for money. 
We pay for our health system collectively through our taxes. We 
all pay so that everyone can benefit according to need. There are 
altruistic human reasons and hard economic arguments for 
doing so. Whichever we support, the system works to our 
benefit. This government is committed to preserving the Canada 
Health Act because in spite of what its critics may say, it works.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	For many of us, health care insurance is an essential part of 
the Canadian identity. We belong to a nation where all citizens 
are equal. Anyone in Canada can rely on reasonable access to 
health care services, not on the basis of wealth but according to 
need. Every Canadian can rest assured, now and in the future, 
that he or she will not be ruined financially by a serious illness. 
The Canadian health care system has no equal in the world. 
Treatment priorities are set in light of medically necessary 
services and not according to the patient's wealth.
<P>
	The Canadian government takes very seriously its role as a 
defender of universal health care. The Minister of Health has 
expressed her strong opposition to facility fees, extra-billing 
and any other sign of a two-tier health care system. Canadians 
have entrusted their government with protecting their health 
care system. As the Prime Minister has repeatedly said, this 
government intends to show that it is worthy of this trust.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philippe ParÃ© (Louis-HÃ©bert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I think 
there is not one Canadian or Quebecer who questions the 
importance and value of the five principles set out in the Canada 
Health Act. However, the greatest threat to these principles, in 
my view, is the underfunding the Government of Canada has 
caused these past few years by phasing out financing in these 
areas.
<P>
	Does the hon. member for Pierrefonds-Dollard recognize 
that this seriously threatens the principles he referred to and 
with which I totally agree? Reduced funding from the federal 
government may well place the  provinces in a situation where, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11891"> 11891 </A></B>
<P>
while recognizing these principles as normal and necessary, 
they can no longer uphold them.
<P>
<B>(1520) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patry:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member of the Bloc 
Quebecois for his question. I am very pleased to hear him say 
that he came to the same conclusion as I did, in that he agrees 
with the five principles I listed earlier.
<P>
	There is a real problem with underfunding but it lies in the 
fact that social and health programs are provincially 
administered in Canada. Every province made its own choices. 
It is now up to these provinces to make new choices to cut their 
costs within the health system as we know it.
<P>
	In certain parts of the country, provinces have allowed non- 
essential services to be provided to their citizens. I think that the 
ball is in the court of the provinces now.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member may congratulate the Bloc for endorsing the five 
universal principles. However, I hope he will not congratulate 
the Reform Party because we do not endorse these five 
principles.
<P>
	I would like to know what the hon. member is trying to do 
when he acknowledges there is a serious reduction in the amount 
of money being put into health care by this government. The 
provinces are cutting back as they try to balance their budgets. 
There is a significant reduction in the amount of cash going into 
the health care system, yet the Liberals with their heads in the 
sand seem to think it is business as usual. They seem to think 
that health care is going to continue on as it has been, 
uninterrupted without any problems while they cut back on the 
cash without having any opportunities or initiatives allowing the 
health care system to resolve its own problems through the 
market forces or whatever.
<P>
	When will the Liberals get their heads out of the sand and 
recognize there is a real problem in health care that is caused by 
the lack of funding? When are they going to allow this additional 
funding either through taxpayers' dollars or by letting the 
marketplace put some money into it?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patry:</B> I thank the hon. member of the Reform Party for 
his question.
<P>
	I will answer the second part of his question first. There is no 
way that government will ever grant the Reform Party its wish 
for a two-tier health system, with one system for the rich and 
another for the poor. That is out of the question.
<P>
	Extra billing and private clinics lead to a two tier system: one 
for the rich and another for the poor. The government in office in 
Ottawa will do no such thing because it is against its principles.
<P>
	As for the first part of his question, I think that it is up to the 
provinces; they can and must cut their costs, which have become 
astronomical. There are certain things that must be looked at, 
costs, hospitals, provinces and even physicians, and I am one 
myself. Therefore, it is within the medical and social service 
community that the solution should be sought, and not in terms 
of the accessibility per se of the services.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hugh Hanrahan (Edmonton-Strathcona, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is my pleasure to address the issue of established 
programs funding in regard to health care.
<P>
	The issue of established programs funding is of great concern 
to the constituents of my riding of Edmonton-Strathcona. 
While Alberta is battling its debt and deficit problem without 
increasing taxes, it is also doing it with less and less resources 
from the federal government. Since health care is Alberta's 
largest single area of government expenditure, I feel it is of the 
utmost importance to debate this issue.
<P>
	In 1993-94 the federal government provided transfers of 
$40.5 billion to the provinces. The majority, approximately 71 
per cent of these transfers, was for the established programs 
financing and equalization program. Out of this $40.5 billion, 
tax transfers were approximately $13 billion. It is the 
established programs funding, the tax transfers which I wish to 
spend most of my time discussing today. However, before we 
can discuss these transfers, it is important to look briefly at the 
equalization program.
<P>
<B>(1525) </B>
<P>
	Alberta has been deemed a have province. According to a 
recent study by a University of Calgary professor, it has paid in 
$139 billion more than it has received since Confederation.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> We want it back.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hanrahan:</B> Albertans are gracious individuals and they 
have felt that being part of Canada has had its costs, but they also 
feel the benefits have outweighed these costs. I agree with that 
attitude, yet I also find that many Albertans are rethinking this 
attitude of generosity.
<P>
	Another area that has become extremely contentious, 
particularly in Alberta and B.C. is the established programs 
funding. This funding is an arrangement between the federal 
government and the provinces relating to the funding of 
post-secondary education and health care. I will try to limit my 
comments solely to health care due to time limitations.
<P>
	First, the Reform Party has no intention of dismantling 
medicare, nor do we want to create some form of a U.S. style 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11892"> 11892 </A></B>
<P>
two-tier health care system. Instead, the Reform Party argues 
that our health care system is  already gravely ill as its costs are 
going out of control in relation to the funding available.
<P>
	Our intention is to ensure the long term viability of health care 
in this country. Health care is an issue which lies at the heart of 
most Canadians. It is Reform policy to ensure that no Canadian 
is denied adequate health care services for financial reasons, 
regardless of where they live in Canada.
<P>
	Currently, provincial governments possess the legal and 
constitutional responsibility to provide health insurance and 
services. They do not however, possess the authority to take the 
administrative steps to control medical costs and/or raise 
additional revenue for health care services. Reformers believe 
that this arrangement puts both the federal and provincial 
governments at odds with each other, rather than allowing them 
to get on with the job of providing improved quality health care 
to all Canadians.
<P>
	In fact, the Canadian Medical Association has argued that the 
country's health insurance system will be colliding with the 
economic reality in which it, the health care system, cannot be 
maintained in its present form. I believe this collision has 
already begun. This is apparent if we look at the federal budgets 
throughout the 1990s.
<P>
	We have seen virtually a non-stop series of cuts and freezes in 
the federal government's transfers to the provinces. This has 
pushed the federal government into a corner. It realizes that it is 
risking losing control over national standards in health care 
should the cash transfers to any province cease entirely.
<P>
	This problem is further troubled by the fact that federal 
provincial relations regarding transfers has been marked by 
decisions which have nothing to do with the search for balance 
or fairness in the use of our resources. I refer here to the national 
energy program and the recent gas tax that hit Alberta harder 
than any other province.
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> And public utilities.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hanrahan:</B> Yes. It is for this reason that the Reform 
members of Parliament believe the only viable solution to 
safeguard our health care system from a fiscal crisis is to 
redefine the Canada Health Act. It should allow the provinces to 
find solutions that make the most sense for their region, through 
exercise of their constitutional jurisdiction over health care. The 
role of the federal government should be to provide financial 
support and equalization through the taxation and transfer 
system and to ensure that no Canadian is denied health care for 
financial reasons.
<P>
	The Reform Party advocates amending the health care act to 
restore to the province the administrative jurisdiction the 
federal government has expropriated through the use of its 
spending powers. In other words, we will leave it in the hands of 
the provinces where it belongs.
<P>
	What worked yesterday does not necessarily work today. 
What was taboo in the past is possibly accepted today. This 
applies to the federal transfer payment system which, after 
having its successes, is now coming up against its failures. Few 
people would dispute that to rectify the inefficient allocation of 
resources it is urgent that we put our public finances on a more 
solid footing to create an economic environment that will 
contribute more to efficiency and growth. However, the way to 
achieve this may not be compatible with certain political, social 
or provincial expectations.
<P>
<B>(1530) </B>
<P>
	As just stated, the federal government would seem to be 
feeling more and more trapped by its policy of imposing 
national standards and its desire to reconsider the refinancing of 
transfer payments.
<P>
	We must continually remind ourselves it is the provinces and 
not the federal government that have the constitutional 
jurisdiction to operate the health care system. It is the provinces 
and not the federal government that provide the bulk of health 
care funding. It is the provinces and not the federal government 
that have the greatest expertise in health care delivery.
<P>
	We on the Reform side of the House have to move ourselves 
away from the corner and into the forefront of health care policy 
issues. The way to do this is to focus the federal government's 
role on making no strings attached transfer payments to bring 
adequate health care within the financial reach of all provinces 
and citizens.
<P>
	The provinces in consultation with patients, health care 
workers and taxpayers should be left to explore new options for 
greater health care efficiency without fear of being penalized by 
Ottawa.
<P>
	We ultimately should be transferring additional tax points 
based on the notion that each province will clearly define what 
its core level of basic services will be. This list can ultimately 
and should differ from province to province. This would be our 
version of national standards to which the federal government 
could rate the provinces on their record against their core level 
of services.
<P>
	Not only would we like to have a clearly defined level of basic 
core services but would also expect the provinces to shift more 
toward a community based development philosophy of 
delivering health care. This process and approach is to work 
with a community to address unmet needs and issues of concern 
to that specific community. It is based on the principle that the 
community affected by an issue is in the best position to 
articulate its needs and desires and to devise appropriate 
strategies to address these needs.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11893"> 11893 </A></B>
<P>
	The core services and community based development 
approach, linked with the no strings attached tax point transfer, 
would ensure accessibility for everyone in a cost effective and 
efficient manner. This accessibility will ultimately be redefined 
to recognize that long waiting lists for essential services are 
a denial of access.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Maria Minna (Beaches-Woodbine, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am having some difficulty understanding the logic of 
the hon. member for Edmonton-Strathcona. He is talking about 
transferring tax points with no strings attached. This is 
transferring more money to the provinces, giving them carte 
blanche and letting them decide what their core programs would 
be. Each province would decide what its core program would be 
and we would have different core programs from province to 
province.
<P>
	He says he does not want to create a two tier program. I do not 
understand how the member can say that he would have an 
accessible health care system across the country where one 
province's accessibility would be defined in one way and 
another province differently. It is quite conceivable that in some 
provinces health care would not be accessible to people who are 
poor because they would have to pay certain types of 
remuneration or what have you.
<P>
	I do not understand what the member is actually asking. 
Basically the current health care system structure has allowed 
the provinces to administer their health care systems as they 
wish as long as they are able to respect the five conditions. That 
is not so difficult. Those are not very difficult conditions to 
respect. His colleague earlier said they do not endorse the five 
principles. They are pretty broad.
<P>
<B>(1535) </B>
<P>
	I would like to know from the member exactly what kind of 
medicare system the Reform Party envisions. If it sees one 
different for every province with accessibility varying without 
any national principles, however broad, I have some difficulty 
with that. I would really like to understand where the provinces 
are now hampered in the administration of the health care 
system.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> While the hon. member 
for Edmonton-Strathcona is on his feet replying to the question 
from the hon. member for Beaches-Woodbine I wonder if he 
could refresh the memory of the Chair on whether he is splitting 
his time with a colleague.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hanrahan:</B> Mr. Speaker, we will be splitting our time.
<P>
	I thank my colleague for her question. With respect to the 
distinction between provinces, she is aware that already 
happens. From the investigations I have made with various 
medical people they suggest there are health problems relatively 
unique to certain areas, to certain provinces, to certain 
communities. In those areas they should be able to direct as 
much of their resources as  possible. We are trying to localize it 
to the people most affected.
<P>
	With respect to the core area, that is something which we have 
to debate as a national government, a national society, and we 
have to come to some agreement as to what is universal from one 
end of the country to the other. However, there are certain 
aspects which do not require that.
<P>
	In terms of accessibility, the essential core agreements must 
be available to all regardless of income. I believe I made that 
relatively clear in my speech.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, one of 
the five principles Liberals keeping talking about is the publicly 
funded one to the exclusion of all other input of cash into the 
health care system. I want to ask the hon. member for 
Edmonton-Strathcona if he feels their proposition of refusing 
any other means of funding health care will preserve our health 
care or should we allow other moneys into the program?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hanrahan:</B> Mr. Speaker, if we do not allow other moneys 
into the program, if we continue the decline in financing for 
medicare which has been occurring over the last number of 
years, combined with increase in the interest on the debt, we will 
find there will be a no tier system, not a two-tier system. There 
will be no medicare for anyone.
<P>
	This is an attempt to save medicare.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speller:</B> Do you want a three tier system?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hanrahan:</B> I said very clearly in my speech that is 
exactly what we do not want. We want to save the basic elements 
of medicare for all Canadians regardless of income.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
this business of a two-tier system, do we want it or do we not 
want it, we have had it for years. Let me draw to the member's 
attention that we have a two-tier health care system right now.
<P>
	If my friends would like to get out their wallets or their purses 
or whatever, I would refer them to their benefits card from the 
public service health care plan. Mine says: ``D.C. Grey, hospital 
level three''. As soon as we see other levels we ask whether this 
is a two-tier health care system or a one tier system. Members 
opposite shun that and talk about the fact that we could never 
have a two-tier health care system. My card says level three, so 
how many tiers are we looking at here?
<P>
	Let me also draw to their attention that MPs pay exactly zero; 
zero comes off their paycheques every month.
<P>
<B>(1540 ) </B>
<P>
	Anyone in the gallery who works for the public service or 
anyone who works in our offices, anyone who is a public 
servant, has the option to have a level three health care card. My 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11894"> 11894 </A></B>
<P>
staff members have those. They pay if they are single $5.32 a 
month; if they are a family they pay  $10.35 a month. I got that 
today from our pay and benefits clerk in the comptroller's 
office.
<P>
	If we are to talk about two tier health and be so sanctimonious 
about it, that we in the Reform Party will only have an American 
system in two tier health, this is nonsense. We cannot beat 
around the bush because that is fact. We pay zero for this level of 
hospitalization. Public servants, people who work for us in our 
offices, pay $5.32 or $10.35 a month. That is two tier or 
spending differently. MPs are off the hook again; zero comes off 
our paycheques for that. We have some serious problems in the 
country and that is one tiny example.
<P>
	We are in favour and believe every Canadian should have 
access to health care regardless of their ability to pay. That is a 
fact. That is important across the country. It comes down to how 
we will pay for that. The country is $550 billion in the hole and 
yet the health minister this morning said it is just going along 
fine and we have lots of money.
<P>
	Deficit spending in the late sixties and early seventies has dug 
us into a hole so deep that if we do not get this thing under 
control even the size of the Chamber would not hold the cash we 
owe. It is rising at a rate of $1,500 per second.
<P>
	For people on the government benches to say we are dreaming 
on this side of the House and everything is as safe as could be 
forever, that is not true.
<P>
	My friends across the way know it. We cannot be eating up 
interest rate payments at the rate we are paying and expect 
everything and the status quo to go along as it has.
<P>
	There are discrepancies in the system right now. The system 
needs to be fixed. There are many tiers, many levels of health 
care. Let us admit it rather than having a shade pulled over our 
eyes and trying to go out to Alberta and scare the daylights out of 
us and my health care minister. Do not try to frighten anybody. 
Do not accuse Reformers or the Bloc of fearmongering.
<P>
	We are dealing with the facts. We have serious economic 
problems. We do have a two tier health system. My friend from 
Winnipeg this morning, a doctor, said he was all in favour of the 
Liberal plan of health care. He was specifically asked whether 
he had ever in his medical practice referred one of his patients to 
the Mayo Clinic. I suspect he did. I suspect there were many 
times in his medical profession because I think he was an 
excellent doctor who would tell someone they needed to get to 
the Mayo Clinic fast. Winnipeg is plenty close to the Mayo. I bet 
he referred lots of patients there.
<P>
	I bet the doctor from Vancouver Centre who lives close to the 
American border, in someone's best interest if they could afford 
to pay, would send them down to the Mayo Clinic, California, 
Seattle or wherever for health care if they could afford it. This is 
happening all the time.
<P>
	To say we are just fearmongering in the Reform Party, forget 
that. Let us get on with solving the problem.
<P>
	They also talked about our position in the campaign. That was 
$150 billion ago. The national debt is now at $550 billion, $150 
billion more than when a lot of greenhorns walked into this place 
not even a year and a half ago. The debt and the interest on it are 
chewing so quickly that if we do not get this problem under 
control it will destroy the national medicare program more than 
anything else.
<P>
	Is there a mix of health care plans? I was really surprised as a 
westerner when I first came down here to discover that even 
though I in my teaching career had been paying for my Alberta 
health care forever people in Ontario do not even pay for their 
premiums. That sounded pretty strange to me. They do not in 
Manitoba either.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harvard:</B> Why should we?
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> Why should we, he says. I guess if everything is 
self-financing and self-funding and the country is in great 
shape, sure, let us offer freebies.
<P>
	We continue to pay for health care premiums and I do not 
think people mind that because they know the service they get is 
absolutely terrific. Some provinces charge health care 
premiums, others do not. That is the way it is.
<P>
<B>(1545 ) </B>
<P>
	Some people have private insurance to supplement their basic 
coverage. That is the way it is. People who can afford to pay are 
perfectly entitled to do so. In my province, some can afford to 
get eye laser surgery at the Gimble clinic either in Calgary or the 
new one in Edmonton. Those people say: ``I want to pay for it. I 
will step out of the queue of those waiting for laser surgery, 
perhaps at the University of Alberta Hospital, and I will get it 
done at the Gimble clinic. I will pay my $1,200 and I will free up 
a spot in a public institution for somebody who is waiting in the 
line''. That is not reprehensible. That is the way it has been for a 
long time.
<P>
	Somebody says: ``Yes, it is reprehensible''. What about 
people who live on welfare? Do we who have jobs say: ``Isn't it 
dreadful about all of those on welfare''. No, we are grateful to 
have a job and we will pay our taxes. We will make sure those 
who are needy in our society are able to collect welfare. Surely 
that is not reprehensible.
<P>
	Would my friend over here quit her job right now as an MP 
and not pay taxes any more because she does not think her tax 
money should support welfare for the people who really need it? 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11895"> 11895 </A></B>
<P>
Of course not. Well, she is thinking on that. Those of us who pay 
are blessed. We are able to pay our taxes and we want them to go 
to the more needy in our society. Why should we not do it with 
health care? It makes perfect sense to me.
<P>
	The hon. member should not hog the line-up. She has her 
place in the queue. If she is in there and says that she gets health 
care because, or maybe she is demanding child care, who 
knows? She is making $60,000 a year. I would say let her pay her 
own babysitters. This is nothing different. If you are able to pay, 
pay and step aside for someone who may be a little more needy. 
Perhaps not so sanctimonious but maybe a little more needy.
<P>
	We are under no illusion here. We have some serious 
problems with health care. Federal cash transfers in support of 
health care are projected to go down to zero in the next 10 to 15 
years. This is from a government, a Liberal government. 
Medicare is having its 30th birthday. It is wheezing and gasping 
its last breath on its 30th birthday.
<P>
	There are real problems. Funding? Sorry, the well has dried 
up. Under successive Liberal governments year after year we are 
deficit spent and we are really sorry but the well has run dry. The 
Liberals cannot go to the Canadian public and say: ``Sorry that is 
just the way it is'' yet pretend, give speeches, go on CBC and 
CTV News saying: ``We have all the money we need for it''. The 
minister said that today. I hope they show a clip of that on the 
national news tonight. There are a lot of people, a lot of 
taxpayers who know that is absolute fantasy.
<P>
	It would make sense to prepare for that day. We know we have 
problems. Let us prepare for that day. Let us be ready for it 
rather than just saying: ``Do not touch it, do not do anything to 
it''. We are in bad shape financially and we need to make sure we 
move ahead and solve the problems instead of just complaining 
about them.
<P>
	In my province of Alberta there have been huge cuts. I want to 
let the hon. members know that in 1970, 25 years ago, the whole 
budget for Alberta was $1 billion for everything, not just health 
care. In 1982, 12 years later, the entire budget was $12 billion. 
We had some boom years in our province. With the oil boom we 
went from a $1 billion budget to $12 billion in 12 years. That is a 
lot of money. Imagine what happened. Hospitals sprang up all 
over. We were spending two to three times per capita on each 
Albertan as many other provinces were doing. Many of these 
cutbacks may just be bringing us back to some of those levels.
<P>
	Recently I underwent major surgery at the University of 
Alberta Hospital in Edmonton. My experience there-I can only 
talk for myself-is that for major surgery, for a hysterectomy, I 
waited my time in line. I did not want to go to the National 
Defence Centre and jump the queue. I said: ``I will go. I pay my 
health care. I pay premiums in Alberta. So I will take my turn 
and just go in with the regular run of the mill people''. I was 
asked: ``Do you want a room of your own?. It is $40 a night''. I 
thought: ``That is cheaper than the Relax Inn so sure I will book 
in for it''. Little did I know because I have never been sick and 
am grateful for that, my health care card, level three for which I 
pay the goose egg, absolutely nothing every month, covered my 
room. I was grateful for that.
<P>
	The people in that hospital were professional. They were 
kind, looked after me and treated me really well. I am standing 
here, two months later, fully recovered and recuperated. Perhaps 
I am an example that the health system works. However, let us 
make sure that we do not let it get any sicker or in any worse 
shape than it is already.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	Health care is worth it in this country. Regardless of the fact 
that members say there are no tiers in it, let us shed some tears 
for the system and make sure we make it right.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Maria Minna (Beaches-Woodbine, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would first like to correct the first statement the hon. 
member made with respect to the two-tier system for MPs 
versus our staff.
<P>
	The two tiers do not exist. Medically necessary physician or 
hospital services are the same. There is no difference. One gets 
the same hospital and the same doctor. The only difference is 
there is a TV in the room which one can decline. The hon. 
member chose the TV but she could have said no. The medical 
care is not different. There is no difference between the hospital 
one goes to, the doctor one gets, the services one receives or the 
nurses who serve us.
<P>
	I heard today from the hon. member and other colleagues 
about core medical services and that core services should be 
identified. I am trying to understand what the difference is 
between core services and medically necessary services as 
defined in the Canada Health Act. What is the real difference 
between core and medically necessary? I think they are one and 
the same and that we are playing with words here.
<P>
	I would like the Reform members to define for me what core 
services are and how it differs from what we now have in the act.
<P>
	I am very proud to pay my taxes. I do not consider welfare to 
be charity. I consider welfare to be the right of needy people who 
have fallen on hard times.
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> Needy people.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Minna:</B> Absolutely. I am quite proud to pay my taxes to 
help those people. I do not consider it charity which is why I am 
not for workfare or any such thing. These people have a right to 
be assisted by the system and the government. They have paid 
taxes before and they have earned the assistance.
<P>
	With respect to the Gimble clinic, laser surgery and stepping 
out of line, I do not want that system. Before we know it we will 
have a system where the people who can afford it will always be 
stepping out of line. The best specialists can charge more money 
because profit as a motive will always be working in the best 
clinics. Before we know it we will end up with a two-tier system 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11896"> 11896 </A></B>
<P>
no matter how we look at it. I have seen it happen in other 
jurisdictions and it will happen here. It is not necessary.
<P>
	The publicly administered health care system is the most cost 
effective system in the world. It saves money because the 
motive is not profit, it is to deliver the best possible system to 
the citizens of the province.
<P>
	Those are my comments and some of my questions. I would 
really like to understand what core services are to the Reform 
Party as I have not quite understood that yet.
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the member's remarks. 
What part of this two-tier system does the member not 
understand? It just baffles me. I am usually not at a loss for 
words and my friend knows that. Anybody who has ever known 
me, and my family certainly knows, I am usually not stumped 
for something to say, but I can hardly believe it. I can hardly 
believe that someone would say we get the same hospital care 
and there is no difference in it.
<P>
	Somebody who says that the Gimble Eye Clinic is only for 
people who can afford it should know they have been doing this 
for years. People go to abortion clinics. The minister talks 
regularly and incessantly about facility fees and that she will not 
allow them in Alberta. What about the people going to 
freestanding abortion clinics right across the country? Is that a 
facility fee? Sure it is. Somebody talked earlier today about 
Quebec psychoanalysts being de-insured now. This goes on and 
on.
<P>
	Core services and medically necessary services are things that 
are absolutely essential. These could be life saving devices or a 
hysterectomy, if there is cancer, all those types of things. If 
someone wants to get a nose job, if it is necessary, is affecting 
one's breathing, let us let the medical profession determine this. 
However, if one just wants to go in and get plastic surgery, a nose 
job, a face lift or whatever other lift one might want, those are 
the kinds of things that the medical community is quite capable 
of deciding which is core and which is not core.
<P>
<B>(1555 ) </B>
<P>
	Those procedures which are life saving are core. But it is not a 
government's responsibility to sit in the House of Commons and 
make those decisions. Let the medical profession do it.
<P>
	There are very capable doctors on the government side as well 
as over here. Let them decide and then we will support that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Reg Alcock (Winnipeg South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was 
interested in the last few remarks made by the member opposite 
when she said: ``Let the doctors decide. Let the physicians 
decide. Let the people who are responsible for delivering the 
care decide''.
<P>
	That is exactly what we do. That is exactly what the Canada 
Health Act does. Her proposal would put a bureaucrat in their 
place. There would be a schedule or a list decided by someone 
other than the physician, someone other than the person who is 
providing the care. That is one reason why we do not support the 
proposal that party brought forward today.
<P>
	I want to step back a little bit and look at exactly what the 
Reform Party is saying today. The members sat down, thought 
this out and put it into their political planning that they would 
have this debate today. They stood up and put forward a motion 
which states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House recognize that since the inception of our national health care 
system the federal share of funding for health care in Canada has fallen from 50 
per cent to 23 per cent and therefore the House urges the government to consult 
with the provinces and other stakeholders to determine core services to be 
completely funded by the federal and provincial governments and non-core 
services where private insurance and the benefactors of the services might play a 
supplementary role.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alcock:</B> I am pleased that the members recognize that I 
can read.
<P>
	I would like to balance what members opposite talked so 
strongly about, of putting greater control in the hands of the 
province, against a statement made not too long ago by another 
Reform member in the human resources committee. The 
statement made was: ``Well, I come from a have province. We 
contribute money to Confederation. Should we not be able to 
dictate the kinds of services those people in the poor provinces 
get?'' At the root of my feelings about this debate is what it says 
about us as a country.
<P>
	We made a decision a long time ago that we were going to 
provide health care. We were going to see that every person no 
matter where they lived in the country, no matter what their 
income level, would be entitled to basic health care. We made 
that decision as a country. We have followed through on that 
promise.
<P>
	Reform members talk so loudly about supporting the wishes 
of their constituents. There is no other service government 
delivers that the people value as much as their health care 
system.
<P>
	The Reform Party reminds me of the old story about the 
doctor whose only answer to a query was: ``Take two aspirins 
and call me in the morning''. On every policy issue that is 
debated its members say one thing: ``We have a deficit. We do 
not have the money for it so we have to cut somewhere. We have 
to get out of it''. It strikes me that a party that has been around 
here for a while which has some intelligent, thoughtful people in 
it, could think a little harder about what they are really saying.
<P>
	We spend between 4 and 4.5 per cent of the federal budget on 
health care. In doing so, we buy ourselves one of the finest 
health care systems in the world. This is the point of attack 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11897"> 11897 </A></B>
<P>
Reformers have chosen to solve the deficit  problem. It is not 
funny. It is tragic that they would attack a service that is so 
valuable to so many people who have so few options.
<P>
	It is fine to talk about the wealthy individual who can walk 
into any place in the world and buy what he or she needs. 
However we also have to think about the person who cannot do 
that. It is something that has been a part of our values for all my 
working life, and hopefully will be for all my life.
<P>
<B>(1600 ) </B>
<P>
	There is another aspect to this. I think we have to ask the 
Reform Party to be a little more intellectually honest. In the 
proposal put forward it talks about the fall from 50 per cent to 23 
per cent. I suppose it is done to heighten the fears it might 
engender in people or to heighten the arguments that can be 
made about the role of the federal government and what the 
federal government has or has not done. However, that is simply 
not true. It is false information, which the party has put on the 
record in order to strengthen its debate.
<P>
	The fact is that the first number refers to the federal 
government's share of spending on hospital and physician 
services, our contribution to medicare. The second number 
refers to the federal share of total health spending, things like 
non-prescription drugs, cough drops, et cetera. The Reform 
Party knows this, and its researchers should know this, and to 
bring it forward simply discredits the debate it wishes to have.
<P>
	Reform members talk about creating a list of services, which 
presumably some bureaucrats in Ottawa would manage, having 
consulted with doctors, and they would tell us what medical 
services we could have and what medical services we could not 
have.
<P>
	The Reform Party has been accused on occasion of looking 
south for its policy initiatives. I do not want to spend all of my 
time walking through that particular model, but I would like to 
note a couple of things.
<P>
	I had a recent experience in the United States. I lived there for 
a few years. I met a man in Los Angeles, quite a wealthy man, 
who had a very serious cancer of the jaw. He received very good 
medical service. Following a technique that is available here in 
Canada, they replaced his jawbone with a piece of bone taken 
from his thigh. It was marvellous. It was truly a wonderful piece 
of work.
<P>
	He walked out of that hospital and was told that was it, his 
insurance was now cancelled. Despite the fact that he is wealthy 
and despite the fact that he has the resources, he cannot at any 
price buy service. In the system the Reform Party promotes, he 
cannot buy service for the rest of his life.
<P>
	I would like to give another example. This happened to my 
nephew, who lives in Los Angeles. He drove to another state on a 
vacation and he fell and cut the palm of his hand on a piece of 
glass. He cut a tendon, so it was a little more serious than just a 
cut in his hand. He was rushed to the local hospital and they 
looked at it and put a compress on it and said: ``Your insurance 
only covers this immediate service. To get the tendon repaired 
you have to go back to a health jurisdiction that your insurance 
respects''. He had to drive some 500 miles to get a fairly serious 
repair. He could have lost the function of his finger.
<P>
	When we talk about letting the provinces decide and when we 
talk about letting individual hospitals decide, are we not talking 
about a system that says that a person may not be able to get 
service because the level of coverage in their province does not 
cover them for all of those things? Is that not exactly the kind of 
divisive force that the Reform Party promotes when it talks 
about the have provinces being able to dictate the level of 
services in the have not provinces? I reject that.
<P>
	Frankly, in this country we have a very serious problem. We 
are seeing an increasing polarization between those who are 
well to do, who can take care of themselves and live a 
comfortable life, and those who are not so fortunate. We are fast 
building a community not unlike those we see around large 
cities in the U.S., walled cities, walled communities, which have 
a wall built around them to keep the bad folks out. We are 
building a society that is less inclusive, less caring, less 
Canadian than the one I believe in. The Reform Party needs to 
consider very carefully what it is promoting when it talks about 
the destruction of our health care system.
<P>
	One of the discussions the Reform Party brought forward in 
its motion is the idea that we would have a matrix of services or a 
list of services. It is interesting that the provinces and the federal 
government do not want to impose a list of services. They do not 
want it because they want to do what the member for Beaver 
River said in her closing remarks: they want the decisions about 
care to be decided between the doctor and the person who needs 
the care. The federal government believes that. It is enshrined in 
the principles. The provinces also want that.
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
	The member who spoke just before the member for Beaver 
River made a comment about universality. It is odd to me that 
the Reform Party finds universality such a difficult concept to 
understand. All universality means is that everyone has access. 
If they do not want to have universality, as they have been 
stating, despite the agreement, who are they going to exclude? If 
they are not going to have universality, who then is outside of 
that universal range?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Nobody.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alcock:</B> They cannot have it both ways. They cannot say 
they are opposed to universality and they are  not going to put 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11898"> 11898 </A></B>
<P>
anybody outside. That is all universality means: that we are 
going to cover everybody, we are going to give everybody 
access to the services.
<P>
	The leader of the Reform Party made a speech on medicare not 
too long ago. I would like to talk a bit about it. Perhaps the 
members can get ready to jump up and down, as they do.
<P>
	There was a suggestion that we might want to ask the member 
for Beaver River to try to define where facelifts are free.
<P>
	The leader of the Reform Party, in his speech not so long ago, 
said that the real long run threat to medicare is the financial 
threat caused by deficits, debts, and skyrocketing interest 
payments. Skyrocketing interest payments on the national debt 
eat up the federal government's ability to finance any and all 
social programs, including medicare.
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alcock:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for Beaver 
River, once again, for giving me a standing ovation.
<P>
	Take two aspirins and call me in the morning.
<P>
	We have a problem so cut the deficit. That is their only 
solution. Do not look at what is happening within the services 
that are being provided, do not call upon the medical community 
to find more efficient and more effective ways to deliver 
services. Cut the deficit. Cut the funding.
<P>
	The member for Beaver River called upon me to talk a bit 
about the Liberal approach to this. The leader of the Reform 
Party talks about cutting the deficit. In fact, total savings from 
our Liberal budget will be $29 billion over the next three years. 
This budget represents, by everyone's criteria, the strongest 
fiscal action taken by a government, certainly since the war 
years.
<P>
	I was on a local radio show with a fellow by the name Peter 
Warren back home, who has been on the air for 25 years. I asked 
him if he had ever seen a tougher budget, and he said no.
<P>
	This government is living up to its promises to be fiscally 
responsible, but it is being fiscally responsible in a morally 
responsible way. It is not throwing the weakest people out of the 
boat. It is not saying let those folks who can afford it go off on 
their own and do what they want and forget about the others. It is 
saying we are all in this together, we are all part of the same 
family, we are all part of the same country, and we will solve 
these problems.
<P>
	One of the issues the Minister of Finance talked about over 
and over again was fairness, that we would do this, we would 
swallow the tough medicine, we would make the tough 
decisions, but we would do it fairly.
<P>
	In the speech of the leader of the Reform Party he talked about 
how the Prime Minister's speech contained no workable 
framework or plan whatsoever for the reform of medicare.
<P>
<B>(1610 ) </B>
<P>
	I do not know where the leader has been. He has not been in 
the House that much, but certainly has people who can read, who 
can talk about the council, who can look at the work the minister 
has been undertaking to work with the provinces, to work with 
people to find solutions for what are some very difficult, very 
complex issues that confront all of us.
<P>
	The federal government is already engaged in discussions 
with all the key players. A number of provinces, the conference 
of the Ministers of Health, the federal-provincial advisory 
committees, bilateral meetings with health organizations, and 
consultations with Canadians through the National Forum on 
Health, ensure that all parties are informed and working 
together to ensure that Canadians have access to a responsive, 
effective, and affordable health system.
<P>
	There is another aspect to this. If the member for Beaver River 
wants to talk about the cost, there is a very significant cost to 
poor health. There is a very significant cost to poor children. 
There is a very significant cost to unhealthy children.
<P>
	The fact is that universal access means, yes, that my children 
get coverage, which I can afford to pay for, but it also means that 
those who cannot afford it get coverage. It means that we also 
care about their public health needs. It means that kids go to 
school stronger, more fit, more physically active and more ready 
to learn. It also means that people are able to pursue careers. It 
means that people are more able to be productive, working and 
contributing to society. Good health care is a foundation of a 
healthy community. To risk destroying that in the cavalier way 
the Reform Party does is irresponsible.
<P>
	The Reform Party has been accused at times of speaking in 
code. I want to add a bit more code to the discussion. The leader 
of the Reform Party said: ``Reform therefore favours the 
decentralization, localization, and personalization of health 
care delivery'', and to amend the Canada Health Act to provide 
this kind of flexibility.
<P>
	Is it not interesting that mere minutes ago, when I talked about 
the problem that my nephew had in a different state trying to 
access health care, the members opposite said: ``Oh no, we do 
not mean that''. Then what does decentralization mean? What 
does localization mean, except specific services in a specific 
area? What does that do if I do not come from that area, if they 
are not insured in my area?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11899"> 11899 </A></B>
<P>
	Do we really build a system where certain Canadians have 
certain kinds of services and other Canadians have different 
kinds of services when it comes to our health? Is that really 
what we are promoting?
<P>
	What does personalization mean? Does it mean user pay? 
Does it mean the ability of those who can pay will pay? Does that 
not just promote a greater fracturing of the community?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I have been somewhat 
generous with the time. I have taken into consideration the 
applauses and so on and so forth. I would ask the member for 
Winnipeg South to summarize in the next minute and a half.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alcock:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate your alerting me to the 
time.
<P>
	I would simply like to say that I want to thank the members 
opposite for bringing forward this resolution. I reject its 
intention absolutely and completely. I am saddened by the 
position that they have taken on so vital a service to this country. 
I do appreciate the opportunity they have provided me to stand 
up and say how strongly I and my party support health care and 
medicare in this country and reject the position taken by the 
party opposite.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
with great interest to the member's speech. His views are 
diametrically opposed to those of the Reform Party.
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	However, some of the issues raised by the Reform Party are 
not totally erroneous. I do not agree with the hon. member when 
he says that the Reform Party's views are irresponsible. I do 
think that, unfortunately, our debt ratio will force us to make 
some hard choices, as is already the case with the UI program, 
for example.
<P>
	We learned today that the number of welfare recipients in 
Quebec climbed to 808,000, with a more or less corresponding 
decrease in the number of UI beneficiaries. It is pretty easy to 
figure out that those are UI exhaustees who have now joined the 
welfare rolls. If the Liberals continue to close their eyes, as they 
have a tendency to do, instead of tackling the issue of the 
national debt, we will have to make even harder choices in the 
future. We will have to cut our social programs, including 
medicare.
<P>
	This Liberal government set aside a tidy sum for things such 
as the purchase, by the Department of National Defence, of four 
secondhand submarines, which will of course have to be 
upgraded with state-of-the-art detection systems, the very best 
enemy detection systems. Given what is happening with the 
frigates that have to be refitted, we can expect this government 
to once again spend billions of dollars. If the government 
stopped spending uselessly, it might be able to delay cutting into 
social programs.
<P>
	But this is not what the government does. Consequently, I do 
not agree with the hon. member's comments on the Reform 
Party vision. I am not a Reform member either, but I do think 
that our debt ratio is dangerously high. This is the real threat for 
our society and, without going as far as the Reform Party, I do 
believe that the provinces, which are closer to the taxpayers, are 
in the best position to assess their needs, and should therefore be 
the only ones to decide which medical services to provide.
<P>
	The other day, in Quebec, we had-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order, please. I hesitate to 
interrupt at any time, but particularly during the period of 
questions and comments. When I called the question and 
comment period, I noted that a number of members wanted to 
ask questions of or make comments to the member for Winnipeg 
South.
<P>
	This is the period that permits an exchange of viewpoints 
between members from both sides of the House. In noting the 
number of members wishing to debate the hon. member for 
Winnipeg South, I would ask the hon. member to ask his 
question and conclude his remarks so that I may give the same 
opportunity to others who have indicated their desire to speak. I 
hope you will trust in my being as reasonable and fair all the 
time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lebel:</B> Mr. Speaker, I understand very clearly and I will 
be quick. I would ask the member for Winnipeg South if the 
solution, which would not be entirely that of the Reform Party 
or, at the other extreme, the Liberal Party, if it could not be a 
joint one with respect to expenditure cuts, particularly in the 
area of defence, that might satisfy everyone?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I thank the hon. member 
for Chambly for his co-operation.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alcock:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his 
question.
<P>
	I absolutely agree with the member. All sorts of areas have to 
be looked at, evaluated and tough decisions have to be made. 
That is what we are doing. That is what the budget which was 
tabled here not so long ago was all about. That is why people in 
every constituency across the country are feeling the pinch. It is 
because we have made some of the toughest fiscal decisions 
made by a government, at least in the last quarter century.
<P>
	The difference comes in this way. I was in a provincial 
legislature that supported health reform. We said that we have to 
get costs down in health care. We advocated very strongly and 
the health care professionals worked very hard to do exactly 
that.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11900"> 11900 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	Procedures which used to cause a week or 10-day stay in the 
local hospital near me are now done in one night. Many are done 
on an out patient basis. All sorts of reorganizations have been 
undertaken in order to reduce costs, be more efficient, deliver 
better service, faster and cheaper. However, we have not made 
the reform of saying one person can have health care but another 
cannot. That is the difference in the Reform approach and what 
we are doing.
<P>
	Change is a fact of life. There can always be change. There 
can always be improvement. We can always do things 
differently. But as Canadians we made a commitment that we 
would be in this together. That is the difference.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish the hon. 
member for Winnipeg South were the minister of fisheries 
because I have never seen so many red herrings dragged through 
this Chamber in the brief year and one-half I have been here.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Call them turbot.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> Yes, perhaps turbot. We were supposed to be 
debating the Reform Party's motion on the reform of the 
Canadian health care system. We heard a dissection of the 
American health care system which is totally irrelevant to the 
discussion being held here today.
<P>
	We heard the hon. member saying that we must have good 
health, that good health is so valuable. Who is arguing? Let us 
get down to basics and talk about the motion instead of dragging 
in these straw men, setting them up and kicking them down.
<P>
	I wish I had the hon. member's gift of eloquence but I thank 
heaven I do not have his gift of logic. He will not stick to the 
issue. He wants to know what local administration of health 
means. I can give him a good example.
<P>
	I was born and raised near Swift Current, Saskatchewan in 
what was known when it was first formed 50 years ago as health 
region number one. It was the first medicare system in Canada. 
It was an experiment. My family helped to create it. They 
worked hard for it. It was a great success and do you know why? 
Because it was run by a bunch of country doctors and municipal 
reeves. It did not have a giant bureaucracy leaning over its 
shoulder telling people what should or should not be done. It was 
a wonderful system.
<P>
	When the Canadian medicare system was finally set up some 
20 years later the results of that experiment were ignored. It was 
thrown out the window. A massive federal bureaucracy was set 
up to oversee the medicare system we had worked so hard for. 
Our system was efficient, it was effective and by God it was 
cheap. Nobody went without medical care. If we did not have the 
specialists available in our rural area to do certain procedures, 
we  sent them somewhere and we paid the bills. That is what 
local control means.
<P>
	In this day of marvellous communications we do not have to 
go that small. However surely to heaven we can put it at the 
provincial level where politicians have to respond directly to the 
people who elected them, where the system is run by the people 
who are most directly concerned. That is what local control 
means. That is anathema to the Liberals because they are the 
great centralizers, the great controllers.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alcock:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will only take a minute to 
respond.
<P>
	I would urge the member to get a copy of the Canada Health 
Act. There is nothing in the Canada Health Act that prevents 
local involvement, local control. We have medical regions in my 
province. The hospitals have boards. There are some 
restrictions. The Canada Health Act states that the provinces 
will pay for any service that is medically necessary. We cannot 
decide in a local region to de-insure somebody for a medically 
necessary service. We cannot make that decision because we as 
Canadians made a decision that everybody in all parts of the 
country would have access to medically necessary services.
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	The member raises the spectre of a huge bureaucracy 
centralized in Ottawa that makes all these decisions. Does the 
member know how many people it takes to administer the 
Canada Health Act? Has the member ever bothered to check the 
size of this huge bureaucracy? There are 25 people who make the 
decisions about the Canada Health Act.
<P>
	I have nothing against local control and local involvement. 
That is something we promote. We went around designing a 
series of health regions with elected boards and everything else. 
It was done in British Columbia and Manitoba. However, that is 
very different from saying that we will have a two-tier system 
where the rich get one kind of help and others do not, or that rich 
provinces will have a particular kind of health care system and 
poor provinces will not. We are all Canadians who want to see a 
country that includes and brings everybody into the Canadian 
family, not one that kicks a few out.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am glad 
to participate in the debate on the Reform's motion on health 
care today. I would like to try to put to rest some of the 
misconceptions and untruths by our friends on the other side of 
the House.
<P>
	We have heard so much about the two-tier system. The 
two-tier system has already been created.
<P>
	Someone who has money can get something fixed today. He 
can go south to the United States and get any medical treatment 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11901"> 11901 </A></B>
<P>
he wants. It alleviates the necessity of the Canadian taxpayer to 
pay for it. It costs, but the person can have it right away.
<P>
	The other is our Canadian health care system which will 
deliver non-emergency services sometime down the road in 
maybe a year or more. That is the health care system we have 
today. It is the one which is eroding and deteriorating 
significantly. It is being starved for cash by this government.
<P>
	The government clings to its five universal principles that it 
cannot ensure and guarantee any more. That is the two-tier 
system which exists under this Liberal government and the 
two-tier system we are opposed to.
<P>
	Now we are in a financial crunch. The system is broke and is 
falling apart. People are in desperate need of surgery and are 
having to wait a long time. One per cent of Canadians are 
waiting for elective surgery. This is not 1 per cent of those who 
are sick. According to the Fraser Institute, today 1 per cent of 
Canadians are waiting for the health care system to deliver and it 
cannot.
<P>
	Those who have money can go across the line and spend 
money in another country. This is equivalent to importing which 
is detrimental to our economy. They can buy any service they 
want. Therefore, we have a two-tier system. It is not the one we 
would propose or that we even like. In fact it is the one we are 
totally opposed to.
<P>
	However we are saying that there is a guaranteed need. The 
Reform Party is absolutely committed to ensuring that all 
Canadians have access to medical services and they should be 
able to have it now.
<P>
	Someone may want more than the basic minimum and may 
want to pay for a longer hospital stay or a private nurse at their 
bedside. I say be my guest, at your cost.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	There are many ways that we can resolve the problem. 
However, before we talk about resolutions let us continue to 
look at the problem.
<P>
	I have a letter from the Sturgeon Health Unit in my riding. It is 
dated September 9, 1994. It is a generic letter to its patients:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Dear Home Care Client:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>As you may be aware, the increased demand for home care services has far 
exceeded the available resources. There is decreasing access to acute hospital 
care. Increasing numbers of people in the community need high levels of 
support to compensate for disabilities.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In order to continue to provide essential, basic service to those in greatest 
need, we have asked home care co-ordinators to review their caseloads and 
reduce services where possible.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We recognize that assistance with homemaking enables many clients to 
remain at home longer. Currently, however, homemaking will be limited to 
those people who would face an immediate move without the service. This 
means that families may have to provide more assistance or purchase the 
service. The Home Care Program recognizes the significant contribution family 
caregivers make to home care clients and regrets the increasing expectations 
placed on families. It is hoped that increased funding will soon follow the 
demand for community based care.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Sincerely,</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Carol Sims, R.N.,BScN.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Director, Home Care</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The letter says there is decreasing access to acute hospital 
care. That is not Reform policy. That is not because of Reform 
Party actions. That was happening in 1994 and it is happening in 
1995. It is happening in the country now under the government 
and it accuses us of proposing a two tier system. The letter says: 
``In order to continue to provide essential, basic service to those 
in greatest need, we have asked home care co-ordinators to 
review their caseloads and reduce services where possible''. 
Only those in serious need will be looked after. The rest will be 
passed over to the families to look after because the government 
does not have any money.
<P>
	This is not a letter from someone who is peripheral to health 
care. It is not a letter from someone being denied health care. It 
is a letter from the very heart of our health care operation where 
decisions are being made to deny health care services except to 
those most in need.
<P>
	We have a two tier health care system today. We have it in the 
worst possible way. That is exactly why the Reform Party put 
forward this motion which says things must change. It is not 
because we simply want to change things; we recognize the 
health care industry is sick and needs to be revitalized. We are 
asking questions about how that should be done.
<P>
	I said earlier the Liberal Party seems to be stuck with its head 
in the sand on the five principles: universal, affordable, 
comprehensive, publicly funded and publicly administered. The 
Liberal Party says that is it, the debate is finished and there will 
be no more discussion. In the meantime the government is 
cutting back the money it is prepared to put into the health care 
system by the billions. In the last budget the Minister of Finance 
cut it back again and said: ``Provinces, it is all yours. Remember 
that you must abide by our five principles that we refuse to let 
you off the hook on''.
<P>
	In Alberta the Minister of Finance gave a severe warning. He 
said unless it stops these practices that do not meet the definition 
of the five basic principles, Alberta will be cut back on its 
funding.
<P>
<B>(1635 ) </B>
<P>
	We all know that every province is providing these same types 
of services where doctors, hospitals and clinics are charging 
additional fees. For some reason Alberta was singled out as the 
big bad ogre and was told to toe the line or it would be cut back. 
The Minister of Health said nothing, not a word, about the other 
provinces.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11902"> 11902 </A></B>
<P>
	Alberta is wrestling with reduced budgets and less money to 
resolve the problems. It is being innovative. It has reorganized 
its system. I will not say I think it has resolved every problem 
the best way it should but it is trying and it is doing its best 
to grapple with a system with less money to ensure the services 
are there for those who need it.
<P>
	With respect to the two tier system in order to reduce the cost 
of health care, we must introduce that dreaded word 
competition. That is deemed the code word for the American 
style of health care but I say there is no competition in the 
United States. That is a closed shop. It may be privatized but it is 
a closed shop and there is no competition.
<P>
	If we are to control the cost of health care we must introduce 
competition. Competition can show up in many different ways. 
Competition means that we have a choice. If we have a choice 
between A or B and we decide to always choose B, then A 
disappears through lack of funding.
<P>
	We find our health care costs are 50 per cent higher than those 
in Europe. In the last few days they have made some references 
in the Liberal camp to the fact that we are trying to bring health 
care costs down because Europe has a wonderful system and it 
only consumes 5 per cent or 6 per cent of GDP, but we are up 
closer to 10 per cent of GDP. Why is that?
<P>
	I was in the UK last summer. To give an anecdote, my sister 
who lives over there had surgery a year ago and had to attend the 
outpatient department in a large hospital. When I say a large 
hospital, I mean a large hospital. It serves .5 million people.
<P>
	We had to be at the outpatient department at 11.10 a.m. and 
after we had been there my wife and my sister and I were to go 
shopping and so on. I thought: The day will be gone before we 
get out of the hospital; an appointment at 11.10, they will see us 
at 1 p.m and by the time we get out of the doctor's office it is 2 
p.m and it is time to go home.
<P>
	I could not believe it. My sister had seen the doctor and we 
were back out on the street at 11.30 a.m., 20 minutes after her 
appointment time. I was amazed. How did this happen? I 
investigated to find out.
<P>
	Medicare is free there. What has changed since I had last seen 
medicare there is the UK has introduced a couple of things. One 
is internal markets and the other is called social charter.
<P>
	The social charter basically says any government 
organization that deals with the public in a monopolistic 
environment has to publish minimum standards. These 
minimum standards are not enforced on them but they have to 
decide their own minimum standards and publish them.
<P>
	In the outpatient department of this hospital the minimum 
standard that the hospital had published was to see its patients 
within 30 minutes of their appointment time. It sounds good to 
me. It went a little further. It said that if the hospital cannot see 
the patient within 30 minutes, fill out this card, pop it in the mail 
and the hospital will not get paid for providing the service.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	All of a sudden we have accountability. Right there we have 
accountability. If it cannot meet its minimum service standards 
it does not get paid. Now it has a challenge to provide service. 
Two out of five principles, publicly funded and publicly 
administered, which the Liberal government has, totally and 
absolutely fall down.
<P>
	Until one provides competition there will never be service. 
That is why we have to wait a year or more for surgery. 
Competition ensures it looks after its patients. That is the type of 
thing we are trying to start a debate about in this country, that 
provided accessibility.
<P>
	I talked about the concept of internal markets. Every hospital 
is required to get on to a true and proper cost accounting basis, 
just like business. That is all; we are not asking them to do 
something impossible. We are asking them to do their 
accounting by the same rules as business. Then when the 
regional health units have a budget to look after their clients, 
they have to spend money. Let us take something quite 
expensive such as bypass surgery.
<P>
	They will choose the hospital that meets and exceeds 
standards, that can provide the service and also does it for a 
lower fee. Now we have hospitals competing on price. That 
ensures that each hospital keeps its costs down. That is how we 
introduce cost savings and bring health back into the medicare 
system.
<P>
	Health care in the UK to the consumer is still free but the UK 
has introduced internal markets, social charters and it has 
competition. The health care system in the UK is costing a half 
to two-thirds of what it does in this country.
<P>
	The Liberals cling to the idea that only publicly administered 
and publicly funded hospitalization and medicare is the way to 
go as we watch it crumble before our eyes. The UK was the 
pioneer of socialized medicine. Fifteen or twenty years ago it 
was in the turmoil we are in today as far as trying to afford health 
care services. It introduced these new ideas and has been able to 
improve the service, improve the quality and ensure 
competition. By allowing competition it has also allowed 
private funding to come into health care.
<P>
	When I say private money, is that such a dirty word? We all 
say we cannot have profit in medicare. I defy anyone to find 
anybody in the health care industry to say they will continue to 
do what they are doing for nothing.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11903"> 11903 </A></B>
<P>
	Everybody is in for the paycheque, the profit they make on 
the sale of the equipment, on the hospital they build, and so 
on. That is why the other thing we have to introduce is a real 
and true market. Market makes the right decisions.
<P>
	We have seen it time and again. My riding is a perfect 
example. Health care built a brand new hospital four or five 
years ago at a capital cost of $50 million. It sat empty for a 
couple of years before the operating money could be found to 
open the doors. Now it has been downgraded from a hospital to a 
health care unit. This is in the city of St. Albert. All these were 
political decisions. They were not market decisions. We have 
wasted millions and millions of dollars on these kinds of 
decisions.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	Access to health care is not available today, even though 
universality is talked about. The definition of universality does 
not mean access because people are waiting up to a year and 
sometimes longer for elective surgery.
<P>
	Affordable? Yes, we want to ensure that all Canadians in any 
part of the country have access to health care. That can be basic 
health care. There can be a deductible charge of 5 per cent or $5 
or $10 to make people think because as soon as it is free, there is 
abuse.
<P>
	Yes, we want to ensure that health care is available for all. 
However, we totally disagree that publicly funded, publicly 
administered, non-competitive, political decisions by 
bureaucrats, politicians and committees are the only way to run 
a health care system.
<P>
	There are all kinds of situations in the private sector. From the 
food we grow to the vehicles we drive and the buildings we live 
in are all provided at standard or above standard by the private 
sector. It is done on a competitive basis. It ensures the highest 
quality and a variety of choices for the consumer.
<P>
	In conclusion, I strongly endorse the Reform Party proposal. I 
would like to see a national debate on health care. I would 
strongly ask my Liberal colleagues to re-examine, and I have to 
say it again, their heads in the sand approach to publicly funded, 
publicly administered health care that has proven it does not 
work.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> We will go to questions 
and comments. I would ask you to keep your questions and 
comments brief so that I might recognize as many members as 
possible.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dan McTeague (Ontario, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to have the opportunity to question my learned 
colleague from St. Albert.
<P>
	Where are these great waiting lists the member talked about? 
Who are the thousands of people who have gone to the United 
States in search of services? I have one of the largest ridings in 
the country. I do not have these large numbers telling me about 
this. On the contrary, I  hear a lot of people complaining about 
the provincial government and the way it administers services.
<P>
	It is interesting that the hon. member used the Fraser Institute 
to support some of his information. Really, that is the <I>Pravda</I> of 
the political right in this country.
<P>
	While I agree with some of the comments the hon. member 
made with respect to the home care issue, I would hope he would 
take the time to read the Canada Health Act. Under the Canada 
Health Act our requirement is only to deal with hospital services 
and MD services. If we want to talk about the home care issue, 
we have to go beyond the act. Therefore, he is really speaking 
out of context.
<P>
	All the provinces, including Alberta where the member comes 
from, support the five principles. It is interesting that the 
comment has been made that the province is not in agreement 
and in particular that the member is not in agreement with the 
five principles. Could he tell us which part of the five principles 
he or the Reform Party is prepared to abandon? I presume he is 
speaking on behalf of the Reform Party since he is a member of 
that party.
<P>
	I also want to point out to the hon. member that when we 
compare ourselves to the United States where competition and 
market forces exist, 39 million people in the U.S. have 
absolutely no protection and are in no position to get sick. 
Another 39 million in that same jurisdiction where this great 
aura of competition exists are also underinsured.
<P>
	Does the position the member has taken here today really deal 
with whether or not members of his party are prepared to 
understand the full implication of what they are lamenting here 
today? Before the hon. member answers that question, there are 
some other examples which I think have to be taken into 
account.
<P>
<B>(1650 ) </B>
<P>
	Dental services are not covered in Canada. Most people will 
not go to a dentist to get necessary treatment because they are 
concerned about the possible costs being assigned to them.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grubel:</B> How do you know that?
<P>
	<B>Mr. McTeague:</B> I know that for a fact because my wife is a 
dentist. That is the evidence I am prepared to support because I 
am speaking from truth, unlike my hon. colleague's friends over 
there.
<P>
	My concern is with the hon. member. I would like-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. I hope I am not 
overreacting. I know members feel very strongly about each and 
every issue we debate. I think there would be unanimous 
agreement in the House that the issue being debated today is of 
critical interest to all Canadians and all parliamentarians here in 
the House, particularly those taking part in this debate.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11904"> 11904 </A></B>
<P>
	As to the matter of truth and who has the best ownership of 
truth, there is certainly no sole ownership and I will leave it 
to all of us to debate. I would ask members to be very judicious 
in their selection of words. Would the hon. member for Ontario 
please conclude and ask his question to the hon. member.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McTeague:</B> Mr. Speaker, I take that under advisement. 
Can the hon. member tell me what he really means when he talks 
about competition and its full implications on Canadians given 
that we have a universal, acceptable system that is working for 
the benefit of all Canadians?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will answer the question of 
what I mean by competition.
<P>
	I gave the United Kingdom example, not the United States 
example, where the cost to the consumer is absolutely free. Yet 
even the United Kingdom has developed internal markets where 
hospitals can compete against each other in delivering price, 
service and quality. These are the three fundamental elements of 
service one finds when there is competition. If we eliminate 
competition, we find waste, mismanagement, poor service and 
declining quality. These are the things we have in our health care 
system today because of lack of competition.
<P>
	I said nothing about the American situation except that I did 
not even consider it to be a competitive market. I used the 
United Kingdom as an example. It is the cradle of social health 
care systems in our western world.
<P>
	The hon. member's first question was on which of the five 
principles we would abandon. We would abandon the 100 per 
cent publicly funded principle. We would still ensure that health 
care was largely funded by the taxpayer, but we are not saying 
there should be an ironclad guarantee that it has to be 100 per 
cent. I believe publicly administered elimination of competition 
is totally detrimental to our system.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Harvard (Winnipeg St. James, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I think the member for St. Albert really does not get it 
especially when he advocates competition among insurers. The 
evidence is absolutely overwhelming that when there is a single 
public insurer as we have in this country, that is by far the most 
efficient and cost effective system. The one way we can control 
costs is when we have one public single insurer.
<P>
	I was watching an American doctor on CBC television last 
night. Perhaps the member also saw him. His name was Dr. 
Katz. He spoke about the American system with competition 
among insurers which the hon. member champions. He said that 
the doctors and insurers cherry pick. They are not interested in 
you if you do not have money and are not wealthy. Can you 
imagine a system in this country where there was competition 
among insurers? Does the gentleman from St. Albert really 
think if he had a long history of heart trouble, the competitive 
system would be interested in him? Of course not.
<P>
	The system with competition among insurers is only 
interested in the healthy and the young. You talk about 
privatizing the system. That is what you are talking about.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. I would like to 
remind members to direct their interventions through the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harvard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to make one more point. 
When we privatize the system there is no trouble in taking costs 
off the public books. We could transfer $1 billion or $2 billion, 
perhaps even more from the public books, that is medicare, over 
to the private sector. When those costs show up in the private 
sector, because of wasteful competition the cost will not then be 
$1 billion or $2 billion, it will be $3 billion or $4 billion.
<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
	The hon. member is dealing in illusion, is that not true? That 
is my question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Mr. Speaker, if the hon. member for Winnipeg 
St. James does not understand how competition works, then I 
would propose that he is the one who is under complete and 
absolute illusion.
<P>
	I will refer to the point made earlier by the member for Beaver 
River in talking about health care and will use the point of the 
member for Winnipeg St. James who is a government member. 
Why are members of Parliament entitled to a benefit under the 
public service health care plan that costs us absolutely nothing 
yet all other members of the plan, be they civil servants, have to 
pay $10.35 a month as family members? That is the first of this 
two-tier system which is creeping in.
<P>
	Not only that, the member for Ontario has told us that dental 
services are not covered under health care. Why not? Why 
would people not want to have dental plans if they want to have 
their health plans? Because the country cannot afford it. We 
must realize that there will be abuse of the system unless there is 
a fee for use, however small.
<P>
	I will finish on the last point the hon. member made. The 
member for Winnipeg St. James may think that one single 
insurer, be it the government, is the most efficient way to run a 
program. I am sorry but I think he does not understand the first 
simple fact about economics which realizes that competition 
gives the best quality and the best service at the lowest price. 
That is the point.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
President of the Treasury Board, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it seems 
to me there is a certain amount of confusion in the member's 
mind and I do not say that unkindly.
<P>
	Would the member take the time to rapidly identify the 
expectations from the federal and provincial governments in the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11905"> 11905 </A></B>
<P>
ideal health care system he described? Many of his expectations 
in his comments do not belong to the federal government, 
constitutionally speaking.
<P>
	Just to give a very quick example about the confusion, in the 
Canada Health Act there is no prohibition on profit. There is a 
section where it is not possible to have a health care system that 
makes a profit. It must be operated on a non-profit basis.
<P>
	My colleague seems to confuse the two in the Canada Health 
Act on that particular feature. I get the impression that my 
colleague is looking for a Pizza Pizza health care system. That is 
what it sounds like to me. Would he care to comment?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Mr. Speaker, my comments were made in all 
seriousness and had nothing to do with pizza whatsoever. I was 
merely trying to make a point that competition provides the best 
service and the best product at the least price.
<P>
	As I said, in the United Kingdom, not the United States, the 
cradle of social health care has introduced internal markets 
where one health care institution competes against another. In 
that way they are seeing the price come down, the service go up 
and the quality remain high. At the same time the taxpayer is 
getting a better deal and a better return on his investment. That is 
in the United Kingdom. It has nothing to do with the United 
States. It is still absolutely free to the consumer.
<P>
	My point is there are many options. The hon. member asked 
me how I would see the ideal system. The federal government is 
retreating from funding of health care from 50 per cent down to 
23 per cent and falling rapidly. Surely it should recognize that its 
insignificant contribution it is now making will force the hands 
of the provinces to go their own way. Therefore because it is a 
provincial responsibility under the Constitution I feel they 
should be making up their minds on how it should be done.
<P>
<B>(1700) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> It is my duty, pursuant to 
Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the question to be 
raised tonight at the time of adjournment is as follows: the hon. 
member for Notre-Dame-de-GrÃ¢ce-Access to Information 
Act.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dianne Brushett (Cumberland-Colchester, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I will share my time with the hon. member for 
Winnipeg North.
<P>
	It is a great pleasure for me to participate in the debate on 
health care today. There are few issues which we speak of here 
which touch as many Canadians as health care. It is a central 
issue to the people of my riding, as it is to all Canadians. They 
appreciate the security which our health care system gives them 
and they firmly believe that commitment must be continued.
<P>
	As we are in a time when there are questions about the 
commitment, some in the House favour steps which I believe 
would move us down the road to a two tier system, one for those 
with money, another for those without. Some in the House 
favour the balkanization of health care with a withdrawal of 
federal government from any real role in the health care field. 
How much support is there really for either of these 
perspectives? From what I hear from my constituents, not very 
much. They support the leadership which the federal 
government has taken on health care issues.
<P>
	Leadership does not mean rigid centralization. In my remarks 
today I want to emphasize the flexible nature of federal 
co-operation in health care. More specifically, I want to talk 
about the Canada Health Act. This law is not a straight-jacket on 
the provinces; not now, nor has it been, nor will it be in the 
future.
<P>
	The Canada Health Act is a very short piece of legislation. At 
its heart are five principles grounded in common values which 
we hold as Canadians, values very close to the hearts of every 
Canadian. They represent the essential ground rules that most 
Canadians expect the provincial and territorial governments to 
respect when it comes to guiding principles of the Canada 
Health Act. Let me talk about each one of them and the reasons 
for which every one still matters to the federal government and 
to every single Canadian.
<P>
	The first principle is universality. Quite simply, the federal 
government provides financial support to provincial health 
insurance plans, plans that cover all citizens. People cannot lose 
their health insurance because they might be too costly for the 
system to cover or because they may be unemployed or because 
their health may be a high risk.
<P>
	The second principle is accessibility. This means we should 
not face any financial barriers in receiving necessary health 
care: no extra billing, no user fees, no facility fees. If the service 
is medically necessary it will be delivered on the basis of 
medical considerations, not financial considerations.
<P>
	The third principle is comprehensiveness. It recognizes 
Canadians have a range of health care needs and that those needs 
should be met. The Canada Health Act requires that all 
medically necessary services be covered.
<P>
	The fourth principle is portability. This means Canadians 
should maintain their health coverage when they travel.
<P>
	The fifth principle is public administration. Our health 
insurance plans must be operated by a public authority 
accountable to provincial governments and operated on a 
non-profit basis.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11906"> 11906 </A></B>
<P>
	At various times since the act was passed in 1984 there have 
been issues that have brought these principles into focus. 
Between 1984 and 1987 extra billing and user charge penalties 
were levied against several provinces.
<P>
<B>(1705) </B>
<P>
	More recently, extra billing has occurred in British Columbia 
and we have acted by making deductions to the transfer 
payments. We now see other questions emerging, for example, 
as the Government of Alberta pushes its agenda of private, for 
profit health care.
<P>
	These principles do not extend to dictating how provinces 
should run their system or what they should cover. Since the 
beginning of federal support for health care in 1957, decisions 
regarding what is a medically necessary service have been up to 
each of the provinces to determine. After all, they manage the 
system. They have the constitutional authority. They work with 
the appropriate medical experts and also pay a substantial 
portion of the cost. It is not for Ottawa to say this procedure or 
that procedure must or should be covered.
<P>
	It is better to leave the responsibility of determining medical 
necessity to the provinces and to physicians who deliver 
services and are aware of the circumstances under which they 
are delivered.
<P>
	The Canada Health Act also leaves much to the discretion of 
provinces; ensuring the services of health care professionals 
other than physicians, charging for semi-private or private room 
accommodations requiring prior consent for elective health 
services provided out of province, and financing for a variety of 
methods not including those that require point of service 
charges.
<P>
	Remember, the Canada Health Act does not force a province 
to comply to its requirements. The provinces can accept the cash 
penalties and allow the non-compliant situation to persist.
<P>
	These facts alone show that any claims of rigid centralization 
are simply not founded. That will continue to be the case as we 
renew the health system.
<P>
	The federal government and the provinces recognize the 
health system has to change. Provincial authorities are trying 
many different ideas in their efforts at renewal. They will 
continue to experiment but as long as they adhere to the five 
principles of the Canada Health Act it is unlikely there will be 
any disputes.
<P>
	Not one of the principles in the Canada Health Act prevents us 
from looking at innovative solutions to health care issues. They 
simply define the limits of the system in a way that Canadians 
who rely on the system want it to continue. It is not a free for all. 
Canadians believe some limits are necessary and useful to 
preserve our accessible and comprehensive health care system 
which is available to all Canadians.
<P>
	The federal government is equally committed to finding 
better ways to achieve our health goals. The most high profile 
element in that approach is the National Forum on Health. This 
was a red book commitment and it is a commitment that we have 
met.
<P>
	The forum was created to help us adapt our health care system 
to the new social and economic realities of today. It will create a 
vision for health in the 21st century. It is made up of 24 
Canadians, health care professionals, volunteers and health care 
consumers from across the country. It is chaired by our Prime 
Minister, with the Minister of Health acting as vice-chair.
<P>
	Canadians understand these issues, as does the forum. They 
want to spark a frank and open dialogue with each citizen about 
the challenges that will influence the kind of health care we will 
receive in the future.
<P>
	There is the impact of technology, the impact of new drugs, of 
aging and emerging possibilities thanks to research and great 
technological innovations. Our challenge is to deal with them in 
a thorough, comprehensive and sensitive way.
<P>
	We anticipate an open process of consultation that reflects the 
attachment Canadians feel toward health issues and the 
commitment to finding real solutions. The government believes 
the National Forum on Health represents an excellent 
opportunity to address the future of health of all Canadians in a 
comprehensive and open way.
<P>
	The forum is not going back to square one. It is working 
within the principles of the Canada Health Act quite simply 
because those are fundamental values that every Canadian has 
asked the government to respect, to maintain and to deliver on.
<P>
<B>(1710 ) </B>
<P>
	I want to end my remarks by saying that despite the ill 
informed critics, the Canada Health Act is still a valuable piece 
of legislation, one that enjoys the greatest support of the public. 
It is probably the greatest factor that binds Canadians together 
today. It is the underpinning of a system based on universal 
access to high quality, efficiently run health care. It is not a 
monument and our task is to find new and efficient ways to 
achieve better health goals for all Canadians.
<P>
	As we undertake this process the federal government will 
continue to be an important source of the funding that keeps the 
system going. It will continue to be a staunch defender of the 
Canada Health Act. It will still work with medical practitioners 
and professionals, but we will protect the system.
<P>
	The federal government intends to play the national role in 
health care that Canadians have asked us to do and that 
Canadians expect we will do. The Canada Health Act will be an 
important and flexible part in the role of health care in the 
future.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to address this motion put before us by 
the hon. leader of the Reform Party:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House recognize that since the inception of our national health care 
system the federal share of funding for health care in Canada has fallen from 50 
per cent to 23 per cent and therefore the House urges the government to consult 
with the provinces and other stakeholders to determine core services to be 
completely funded by the federal and provincial governments and non-core 
services where private insurance and the benefactors of the services might play a 
supplementary role.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I hasten to say that by laying out his party's true agenda for 
health care in Canada, the leader of the Reform Party has 
dispelled any doubt that his party stands against medicare as we 
know it today with its five principles of universality, 
accessibility, comprehensiveness, portability and public 
non-profit administration.
<P>
	So many times in the House we have heard members opposite 
insist they support medicare. What we have in this motion is the 
Reform Party's advocacy for a multi-tier health system, one 
standard for the rich and one standard for the poor.
<P>
	His motion proposes governments get together with 
stakeholders to determine core services and non-core services. 
The member further proposes that only core services be 
completely funded by governments, while non-core services be 
left to patients who, in the Reform Party vision, should pay out 
of pocket for supplementary health insurance.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I wonder if I could draw 
the attention of the colleagues nearest the member for Winnipeg 
North. A microphone very close by is also open and we 
sometimes have some difficulty hearing interventions. I ask for 
your co-operation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pagtakhan:</B> This kind of approach by the Reform Party 
of cost cutting simply will not work.
<P>
	I call the attention of the member opposite to a recently 
published book entitled <I>Public Finance in Canada</I>. It states that 
increased cost sharing in government medicare plans, where the 
policyholders can afford them, have great potential for reducing 
health care spending. However, it adds for such plans to be 
effective governments will have to ban the development of 
supplementary health insurance that will turn the patient's share 
of cost into a third party payment.
<P>
	Simply put, increased cost sharing will have to be made 
mandatory and applied to all insurance plans, public and private, 
which would require increased government regulation of the 
health insurance industry.
<P>
	I am perplexed that the Reform Party with its penchant for 
less government involvement is now calling for the very 
opposite. Is this a deliberate change of policy or a lack of 
understanding of the dynamics of health care financing in 
Canada?
<P>
<B>(1715 ) </B>
<P>
	The Reform Party is proposing a return to user fees. One very 
noted Canadian health care economist said that this is like a 
zombie, not to be resurrected again. User fees deter necessary 
care just as much as frivolous care. Reformers are showing signs 
that they have not even read the literature.
<P>
	I am proud to be a member of the Liberal Party of Canada, 
which in 1919 conceived the idea for a national medicare plan. It 
is a party that in government gave birth to its reality. It is a party 
that when in government again nurtured and restrengthened the 
national health policy with the passage of the Canada Health Act 
of 1984. It is the legal centrepiece of our medical system as we 
know it today and a system that bans user fees and insists on 
equal access for all citizens regardless of their financial means.
<P>
	The proposal by the Reform Party might not pose a problem 
for those with six or seven figure incomes but for me, for my 
Winnipeg North constituents and for the vast majority of 
Canadians it is utterly unacceptable. Inevitably we would be left 
with a system in which only the financially fit would survive. 
That sort of social Darwinism is anathema to the government.
<P>
	The government is not looking to make Reform Party style 
compromises where the health of Canadians is at stake. Yes, this 
government has acknowledged the need to contain health care 
costs, which in 1991 were roughly equal to 10 per cent of the 
gross domestic product.
<P>
	The difference between the government approach and the 
policies embraced by the party opposite is that the government 
is not prepared to surrender the principles of medicare to fiscal 
constraints but instead is working to balance fiscal 
responsibility and the preservation of medicare.
<P>
	The solution is not easy. The government believes in a more 
imaginative approach than simply wielding a broad scalpel and 
cutting away indiscriminately at medicare as the Reform Party 
proposal would do.
<P>
	Utilizing alternative modalities to achieve desired health 
outcomes and substituting equally effective lower cost 
treatment approaches for the traditional are parts of a strategic 
approach to meaningful reform of the health care system.
<P>
	For example, more patients could be managed at home on an 
outpatient basis rather than in hospital. Patients could be 
encouraged to see their family physicians before consulting 
specialists. Medications could be used instead of surgery where 
possible. Other health care professionals could substitute for 
medical doctors in defined areas of treatment. Some of these 
approaches may require legislation to ensure that health care 
professional substitution does not compromise standards.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11908"> 11908 </A></B>
<P>
	Another means of controlling expenditures without 
compromising quality of care involves eliminating costly waste 
in our system. Just as certain established medical routines, such 
as annual physicals and routine chest radiographs of 
tuberculosis patients on follow up have been discredited as 
effective and efficient health policies, other diagnostic and 
therapeutic routines should be scrutinized. There could be a 
greater reliance on physiotherapy and less on orthopaedic 
surgery.
<P>
	Physicians should not hesitate to debate the issue of human 
resources supply in relation to the per capita needs of the 
community nor the issue of arranging funding so that moneys 
will be allocated according to patient needs and not the 
provider's level of activity.
<P>
	All of these elements and many more constitute an effective 
health care reform strategy which would ultimately yield greater 
dividends for all Canadians in contrast to the quick fix, 
multi-tiered system the Reform Party proposes.
<P>
	The government has positioned itself as a staunch defender of 
medicare as we know it but that does not mean it is committed to 
the status quo. It means that the government will continue to 
explore creative and cost effective options for maintaining 
health care for all Canadians in accordance with the five 
principles of medicare.
<P>
	That is why the government has launched the National Forum 
on Health chaired by the Prime Minister. That is why the Canada 
health and social transfer program is now being negotiated 
between the provinces and the federal government, giving 
provinces the flexibility to deliver the health care system but, at 
the same time, maintaining the five principles of medicare. 
Then and only then can we ensure the crown jewel of our social 
programs survives and is strengthened. We can also ensure the 
quality of health care for all Canadians, rich or poor.
<P>
	In conclusion, I appeal to the Reform Party to withdraw its 
motion rather than face the certain defeat it merits from the 
majority of the House, who have been sent here by the vast 
majority of Canadians to be their voice and their guardians and 
to defend, preserve and strengthen medicare.
<P>
<B>(1720 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was 
quite eager to note the emphasis the member for Winnipeg South 
put on one of the principles of their pillars of health care, 
accessibility. If I may read again from the letter from the 
director of home care at the Sturgeon Health Unit, Carol Simms: 
``There is decreasing access to acute hospital care''.
<P>
	I would like to ask the member for Winnipeg South if this is 
the type of access he wishes to guarantee where people who have 
need of access to an acute care hospital cannot get it under this 
system? Is that the type of access he wishes to guarantee for 
Canadians?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pagtakhan:</B> Mr. Speaker, of course that is not the access I 
would like to see happen. We recognize the problem and it must 
be solved. But their treatment for the problem is wrong. That is 
the difference between the Reform Party and the Liberal Party.
<P>
	We must explore the means to solve the problem, not propose 
a solution that will create another problem where the ultimate 
result is even an greater lack of accessibility to the health care 
system.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was 
interested in the comments from the last exchange. The hon. 
member for St. Albert mentioned his concern about home care in 
his riding.
<P>
	I read an interesting article the other day. It said that the 
evolution of the medical practice involves more home care. 
Patients are better taken care of in their home environments and 
to some extent actually display better recovery rates. I wonder if 
what he is looking at is not a problem but a possible positive 
solution to some of the problems in health care.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pagtakhan:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
comment and question. Before I entered Parliament in 1988, I 
presented a paper in Australia at the International Congress on 
Cystic Fibrosis. My paper was about home care treatment of 
patients with cystic fibrosis, giving them intravenous 
antibiotics at home. It can be done. We were able to decrease the 
health care cost sixfold. At the same time, even more important, 
we were able to enhance the quality of care for these patients.
<P>
	I congratulate the hon. member on his insight as to the 
importance of home care. We must provide the resources for 
home care and not misplace our focus on a wrong approach as 
the Reform Party is trying to propose.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as a professional economist before coming to Ottawa I 
had taken some interest in the economics of health care. In 1992, 
I published two editorials on the subject in the <I>Medical Post</I>.
<P>
	Today I would like to share the most important insights about 
the problem of health care I have gained from these studies and 
suggest some policy initiatives based on them. These ideas are 
my own and not necessarily those of the Reform Party.
<P>
	I believe the public provision of health care through the 
present Canadian system is bedevilled by a fundamental 
problem which is due to the absence of a deductible and of 
co-insurance. This problem is amenable to relatively easy 
solutions once political and ideological rhetoric is put aside.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11909"> 11909 </A></B>
<P>
	Of course, the system has other problems. There are no patent 
solutions. Some of these problems involve fundamental issues 
of technology, incentives, values, ethics and morality. I will not 
discuss these today.
<P>
<B>(1725) </B>
<P>
	I would like to remind everyone that the Canada Health Act 
has created a gigantic system of insurance. Every Canadian 
contributes premiums through general taxes. Benefits are 
provided to anyone without the need to pay financial deductibles 
and co-insurance. As everyone knows, our system has produced 
a wonderful world in which every taxpaying Canadian is eligible 
to receive free of any charge general medical care, specialized 
services and hospitalization. Congratulations Canada.
<P>
	In my view, one of the most important reasons for the 
financial problems which undoubtedly now are haunting our 
system stem from the absence of deductibles and co-insurance. 
I have reached this conclusion because the absence of restraint 
on demand stemming from this completely costless service has 
resulted in very large increases in demand. This is not a 
universally accepted proposition. Therefore, I would like to 
illustrate its validity by making reference to two historic 
experiments of public insurance systems that failed because of 
the absence of deductibles and co-insurance.
<P>
	The first involves the government automobile insurance 
monopoly introduced by the NDP government in British 
Columbia in 1972. It started with great fanfare, having no 
deductibles at all on any repairs on cars, on the grounds that 
even small scratches and dents on cars ultimately lead to more 
serious problems. Therefore, it was argued it was wise to 
encourage repairs of such damage at no cost since some 
shortsighted owners might be discouraged from having the work 
done by a deductible of $50 or $100 or whatever it might be. The 
rest is history. The policy was cancelled by that same caring, 
foresighted NDP government because it was simply too costly.
<P>
	The second experiment involved the British government, 
which in the early days of the public health scheme argued that 
no one in Britain should suffer because he or she did not have the 
money to pay for medication. I have heard the same arguments 
here about access to health care. I wonder why the rhetoric from 
members of the Liberal Party has not also extended to 
medication. After all, some people are suffering because they do 
not get all the medication they want just like that. They may 
have to spend some money.
<P>
	The universally free dispensing of medication was ended after 
only a short time. Costs had become much higher than had been 
anticipated by a study of demand, a study which had been 
conducted under conditions when people paid for their 
medication. Studies have shown that if the cost is free it is easier 
to go back to the pharmacy to get medication rather than look for 
it in the medicine cabinet. People ended up with huge stocks of 
medication  which were finally flushed down the toilet at an 
extremely high cost to society.
<P>
	These two examples are instructive for Canadian medicare. 
The policy of having no deductibles or co-insurance in 
Canadian health care was motivated by the noblest of intentions, 
just like they were in the case of automobile insurance and free 
medication in England.
<P>
	We need to take care of the needs of the most poor in society 
and we must prevent serious problems which might develop if 
small ones are neglected. The two experiments were terminated 
because of the universal law of demand. The price was too low 
and demand became too high. I believe that what we are seeing 
after 20 years of operation in Canada is exactly the same 
situation. That is one of the main reasons why the Canadian 
health care system is in such financial trouble.
<P>
	There is a fairly straightforward solution: introduce user fees. 
However, there is a strong resistance in Canada to the use of this 
instrument.
<P>
<B>(1730 ) </B>
<P>
	We heard them just a few minutes ago. The arguments are the 
traditional ones: care about access for those who cannot afford 
it, and those who, even if they can afford it, are stupid enough to 
let illnesses go and the consequences will be more costly than if 
they had taken care quickly of the illness symptoms at the 
beginning.
<P>
	Some even argue, somewhat more sophisticatedly, that the 
inconvenience of visits to physicians and the risk associated 
with all medical procedures represent a strong deductible and 
co-insurance. Others argue that the deterrent effect of such 
measures is small and not very cost effective. This is the 
position taken by my colleague at the university of British 
Columbia, Bob Evans, a professor of health economics, one of 
the most highly respected and best known economists in 
Canada. I disagree with him.
<P>
	The arguments against deductibles and co-insurance involve 
empirical judgment on the way in which these incentives are 
introduced. I would now like to propose and outline briefly a 
scheme for the introduction of co-insurance and deductibles, 
which I have published in the <I>Medical Post</I>. It can be 
summarized quickly as follows.
<P>
	Every doctor visit or treatment by a Canadian elicits a 
government notification of the cost involved. One gets a little 
postcard saying that your visit on such and such a day cost 
society and you $30. At the end of every tax year, the value of the 
medical services consumed is added as income when we file our 
income tax.
<P>
	Think about what this would do. The poor would have access. 
Universality of access would be preserved. In the end, the poor 
would not pay anything. One of the most cherished, basic, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11910"> 11910 </A></B>
<P>
fundamental characteristics of our system would be preserved, 
one I think is worth preserving. Of course, the better off who 
have income tax  to pay would as a result pay a share of the cost 
they have incurred on society.
<P>
	Now I must state something that immediately comes up 
whenever I discuss this in a public forum. Of course there would 
have to be a ceiling to the amount of money that individuals 
would have to add to their income tax as income and on which 
they pay taxes. I do not even want to venture what it is, but 
maybe nobody would have to pay more than 5 per cent or 10 per 
cent of their income.
<P>
	One of the most important things that every health care 
system must present is protection against the catastrophic 
consequences of serious illnesses. That could be preserved and 
will be preserved by the proposal I have just outlined.
<P>
	One of the biggest problems I have is with the idea that these 
incentives of people paying their own money, in a way, having a 
deductible and co-insurance, would not work. Just recently I 
received some information about experimentations that are 
going on in the rest of the world. I would like to share these ideas 
with members.
<P>
	I found the following. Most health economists agree that the 
primary reason why health care costs are rising is that the money 
we are spending in the medical marketplace is usually someone 
else's. More than a decade ago, the Rand corporation discovered 
that when people are spending their own money on health care, 
they spend 30 per cent less, with no adverse effect on their 
health.
<P>
	Now it turns out that in the United States some employers are 
experimenting in putting this principle to work. Please do not be 
turned off by the idea that I have just mentioned that this is 
taking place in the United States.
<P>
	Let me set the stage. Here are companies whose names I will 
read off that have for their employees systems of health care that 
are superior to that available to every Canadian. They have 
health insurance from the first dollar. They have catastrophe 
insurance. They are employed. They are very well taken care of.
<P>
<B>(1735) </B>
<P>
	Here is the experiment: <I>Forbes</I> magazine pays each employee 
$2 for every $1 medical claim they do not incur up to a 
maximum of $1,000 a year. For every time they look at what it 
costs to go to the doctor and they decide not to go during the 
year, they can earn as much as $1,000 extra income. <I>Forbes'</I> 
health costs fell 17 per cent in 1992 and 12 per cent in 1993.
<P>
	Another example: Dominion Resources, a utility holding 
company, deposits $1,620 a year into a bank account for the 80 
per cent of employees who choose a $3,000 deductible rather 
than a lower one. The result is the company has experienced no 
premium increase since 1989, while employers face annual 
increases of 13 per cent.
<P>
	Another example: Golden Rule Insurance Company deposits 
$2,000 a year into a medical savings account for employees who 
choose a $3,000 family deductible fee. The result is in 1993, the 
first year of the plan, health costs were 40 per cent lower than 
they would otherwise have been.
<P>
	Take the United Mine Workers, a union that is very concerned 
about the welfare of its members. Last year they had a health 
plan with first dollar coverage for most medical services. This 
year they accepted a plan with a $1,000 deductible. In return, 
each employee receives a $1,000 bonus at the beginning of the 
year and employees get to keep whatever they do not spend. As a 
result, the mine workers still have first dollar coverage plus all 
the catastrophe insurance coverage and all that, but now the first 
$1,000 they spend will be their own money rather than their 
employer's money.
<P>
	These plans are popular with employees. They can save 
money in an amount directly related to their own effort. They are 
not deterred from seeking medical care by the traditional out of 
pocket deductible. They can usually use their medical savings to 
buy services not covered by traditional services, and they are 
usually not restricted to certain doctors, as they would be under 
a managed care plan.
<P>
	We have here very strong evidence that deductible 
co-insurance works. It works in ways that satisfy the people 
who are involved.
<P>
	Let me try in my own words to explain what are the 
fundamental benefits. These experiments have permitted 
individual employees to feel clearly and voluntarily that under a 
wide range of conditions they would have gone to the doctor if it 
cost them nothing, but when faced with the true cost of the 
doctor visit they preferred having the money instead.
<P>
	It is important to note that under these medisave schemes that 
I have just described individuals retain the benefit of full 
protection against the consequences of serious illness. They are 
making these choices with their own money. We have just 
deleted the distortion the zero deductible and co-insurance 
system has introduced into the incentives of the individual. 
They are being misled by the system into believing that for them 
and society the cost of going to the doctor is zero. It is not.
<P>
	As we can see, individuals like it if they are given the choice, 
the freedom to do so. They prefer it. And the system itself saves 
money. It is an opportunity that I believe we in Canada can also 
take advantage of. Of course there have to be modifications, 
because we want to preserve the current system of universality 
of access and all the other aspects we have just discussed.

	Let me conclude by suggesting that these well documented 
experiences provide strong support for the effectiveness of 
introducing deductibles and co-insurance into the Canadian 
health care system through the tax system I just sketched. It 
could be modified and create more positive incentives by giving 
every Canadian a $1,000 tax offset against which the cost of 
medical services would be deducted. I think that very quickly 
after such a system is introduced people would know about it 
and they would pay attention to these things.
<P>
	However, I believe these are details. I want to add to the 
current debate over the possible reform of the health care system 
the idea of using deductibles and co-insurance for routine 
medical services, administered through the tax system, while 
the system continues to provide universality of access and 
protection against catastrophic health costs.
<P>
	Let me repeat: It is possible that this scheme-which not only 
I have proposed in the <I>Medical Post</I> editorial, but which has 
been proposed by the Fraser Institute competition for the 
reduction of the cost of government and has been proposed by 
other doctors who wrote to me after my publication-may very 
well be a way in which Canada can have all the wonderful 
qualities of our system we now have and create incentives for 
greater efficiency and prevent the demise of the system, which 
otherwise might collapse under the threat of excessive financial 
costs.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Questions or comments. I 
just want to remind the House that at 5.46 p.m. I will suspend the 
debate to move on to private members' hour.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dan McTeague (Ontario, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will ask 
two very direct questions to the hon. member, given that time is 
limited.
<P>
	The system he is proposing is a claims bonus system. In my 
view, it contradicts the public health preventative care policy we 
are concerned with in this country. Someone who might, for 
instance, suffer a headache and does not go to a doctor or a 
health care facility might otherwise wind up with an aneurism, 
which of course will be more expensive to the health care 
system. That is only an observation, but it connects with my 
previous question.
<P>
	A more important point is the one the hon. member made 
concerning deductibles. I am wondering if the hon. member has 
discussed this with his colleagues, including his leader, who 
during the 1993 campaign cited: ``I want to make it absolutely 
clear that the Reform Party is not promoting private health care, 
deductibles or user fees''. I think the hon. member has to check 
his facts and perhaps check with his leader. Could he please 
respond to that?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grubel:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for this 
silly remark.
<P>
	We are talking about something that has potential, regardless 
of what my leader said a year ago. I do not care. I present this as 
my personal opinion. Every time I go on a radio program or any 
time I present it to a general audience, they ask why we are not 
doing this. It is because of silly remarks of the sort I just heard.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McTeague:</B> Your leader said it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grubel:</B> My leader had not had the opportunity to hear 
what I had to say when he made this remark. It takes time for 
these ideas to spread.
<P>
	I think it would be very much in the interest of Canada if 
members from the other side opened their minds just a little bit. 
There might be ideas out there that they have not thought of that 
would do exactly the same thing they want to do, except it would 
save the system at the same time.
<P>
	Let me read something. Some critics claim that these medical 
service accounts that have been experimented with in the United 
States will encourage people to avoid preventive care. Yet 
experience shows that the reverse is true.
<P>
	I wonder if the member would please listen.
<P>
	Medical service accounts make money available immediately 
when the medical need exists. This allows people to make 
purchases they might not make if they had a traditional 
deductible requiring an immediate out of pocket payment. 
Therefore his objection to this scheme is simply incorrect. We 
would preserve exactly what we have now. It is not a traditional 
deductible system.
<P>
	On the other hand, it is quite clear that I am prepared to 
continue to support a system which has no co-insurance and no 
deductibles if ways can be found to finance it.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> It being 5.46 p.m., it is my 
duty to inform the House that pursuant to Standing Order 81, 
proceedings on the motion have expired.
<P>
	I have a statement concerning private members' hour for 
tomorrow, Friday, April 28, 1995. I have received written notice 
from the hon. member for Winnipeg Transcona that he will be 
unable to move his motion during private members' hour 
tomorrow.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	As it has not been possible to arrange an exchange of positions 
on the order of precedence, pursuant to Standing Order 94(2)(<I>a</I>), 
I ask the clerk to drop this item to the bottom of the order of 
precedence.
<P>
	Pursuant to Standing Order 94, private members' hour will be 
suspended for tomorrow, and the House will continue with 
consideration of business before it at that time.

	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.)</B> moved that Bill 
C-295, an act to provide for the control of Canadian 
peacekeeping activities by Parliament and to amend the 
National Defence Act in consequence thereof, be read the 
second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased today to have the 
opportunity to speak to Bill C-295, which I will refer to as the 
peacekeeping bill. It offers a golden opportunity for all 
members to rationalize and focus Canada's peacekeeping 
efforts. I am especially pleased that the House leader for the 
government affirmed his intention on April 6 to treat all private 
members' bills as free votes. This means that all members will 
be able to make up their minds purely on the merits of this 
legislative suggestion.
<P>
	This is a breath of fresh air in the House. I sincerely hope 
members speaking to the bill today and those voting on it later 
will have taken the time to study it thoroughly. Free votes may 
mean a little extra work for individual members of Parliament 
but as an exercise in democracy free votes help to establish the 
credibility of the House.
<P>
	Bill C-295 is a good idea, worthy of all party support because 
it would not cut off or even reduce Canada's peacekeeping role 
in the world. Rather, it would affirm and institutionalize the role 
of peacekeeping in Canada's foreign policy and strengthen 
Canada's place as a leader among the United Nations.
<P>
	Neither would it reduce the power of the government to make 
decisions about the deployment of Canadian troops. The bill 
deals strictly with peacekeeping and allows cabinet full 
authority to act on a temporary basis. However, it also places the 
responsibility for our long term commitments squarely where it 
belongs, in the capable hands of the Canadian people through 
their members in the House of Commons.
<P>
	At the moment there is no legislation governing Canada's 
peacekeeping effort. Legally peacekeeping is still regarded as 
sort of a side show, an informal duty that Canada undertakes 
almost as an afterthought. However, in reality peacekeeping has 
become one of the most visible aspects of the Canadian forces. 
Certainly Canada's international reputation hinges to a large and 
increasing degree on its peacekeepers.
<P>
	However, the only legislation that acknowledges this reality 
is the National Defence Act which allows cabinet to place 
Canadian soldiers on active service and pay our soldiers as if 
they were at war. This is purely an administrative necessity and 
it does not even address the modern questions about 
peacekeeping that demand attention.
<P>
<B>(1750 ) </B>
<P>
	I quote from the defence policy review tabled last fall:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Defence policy cannot be made in private and the results simply 
announced-Canadians will not accept that, nor should they. Nor should the 
government commit our forces to service abroad without a full parliamentary 
debate and accounting for that decision. It is our expectation that, except in 
extraordinary circumstances, such a debate would always take place prior to any 
such deployment.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I agree wholeheartedly with this recommendation which was 
made by an all party committee of the House. I assume it should 
become parliamentary policy and I note the government allotted 
three hours on March 29 to debate the renewal of Canada's 
commitment in the former Yugoslavia. The government has 
thereby acknowledged that Parliament does have a role to play 
in making these important decisions.
<P>
	Unfortunately the effectiveness of that role is questionable 
because the matter was not put to a vote on March 29. Although 
20 members of the is House spoke to the issue that day, the input 
from those MPs was not as effective as it could have been 
because it was just a take note debate. The motion put before the 
House was non-votable. We have no idea of the consensus of the 
Canadian people. The debate was not brought to its logical 
conclusion. Some people have speculated the decision was 
finalized before the debate had begun.
<P>
	Would it not have been better if at the end of that debate, 
where the pros and cons of the peacekeeping proposal had been 
discussed in this most public of forums, we had considered this 
issue important enough to stand up and be counted? Canadians 
deserve to know our position on this important subject. We are 
ready to move past the old ways of doing things where this 
House rubber stamps decisions which have been made in the 
bureaucracy. Canadians want and need assurance that it is their 
members of Parliament who actually make the decisions in 
Ottawa.
<P>
	Failure to bring a debate to its proper conclusion on such an 
important topic as this results in a patchwork policy which does 
not seem to make sense. Bosnia is an example. The UN has 
44,300 people on the ground from 38 nations. It is the largest UN 
mission ever. The operation began over three years ago and has 
continued at great expense and high risk to Canadians in a 
situation where neither side seems to appreciate the value of 
Canadian peacekeepers.
<P>
	Last July I attended the funeral of Corporal Mark Isfeld, one 
of the Canadian soldiers killed by a land mine while performing 
his peacekeeping duties in the former  Yugoslavia. His family 
and friends and all Canadians knew peacekeeping frequently 
means lives are put at risk. Mark was one of nine people who 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11913"> 11913 </A></B>
<P>
have made the ultimate sacrifice in service to their country in 
that war torn zone.
<P>
	Our peacekeepers are honoured to represent Canada on 
missions overseas and I am honoured to be represented by them. 
However, it needs to be said that the mission in Bosnia has no 
foreseeable end and it seems to have a diminishing hope of 
success.
<P>
	I refer now to a different situation. A few weeks ago a 
Canadian, former Major General Lewis MacKenzie, 
investigated Canada's oldest peacekeeping effort. Canada has 
been in Cyprus for 30 years, since 1965. The original UN 
mandate was just three months. Three full decades later the UN 
is finally thinking of withdrawing, only because other nations 
are starting to mutiny. Canada, of course, soldiers on.
<P>
	Both of these situations tax the very idea of reasonability. 
They also tax our resources and denigrate the reputation of the 
United Nations. At the same time we look at a nation like 
Rwanda where genocide was attempted last year, or Burundi 
where unrest is threatening to boil over again into mass 
slaughter, perhaps another attempt at genocide. However, the 
UN sits on its hands and Canada's hands are also bound in part 
because so many of its resources are committed in so many other 
places in the world.
<P>
	The obvious disparities between these operations show that 
Canada's approach to our peacekeeping function is not rational. 
We lack an orderly process by which we can sit down together 
and weigh the increasing numbers of peacekeeping requests we 
are receiving. We need a way of ordering our priorities to make 
sound decisions about where to become involved, what to do 
when we get there, how much to spend and, most important, 
when to call it quits.
<P>
	Major General MacKenzie made a good suggestion:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Perhaps what is required is a deadline. What if the UN were to say we will 
give you a set period of time, say three years. You sort your problem out during 
that period or we are out of here.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1755 ) </B>
<P>
	This is a celebrated peacekeeper saying we need a new 
mechanism for dealing with Canada's peacekeeping decisions. 
It certainly would have helped in the case of Cyprus. We need 
guidelines and mechanisms so that all Canadians whether they 
are taxpayers, men and women of the armed forces or members 
of Parliament will know what we are committing ourselves to 
when we go overseas.
<P>
	The peacekeeping bill provides the mechanism we need. Let 
me describe the basic elements. It is a very simple bill, worthy 
of the support of all members of the House.
<P>
	In summary it says that when Canada is approached by the 
United Nations to participate in a multinational effort the 
government should develop a peacekeeping plan and present it 
to the House by way of a motion.
<P>
	The elements of that plan are very simple: estimate the cost of 
the mission, its location, its duration and its role. That is it. The 
House would debate it for less than five hours. It would pass the 
resolution and the mission would be in full force.
<P>
	If the government had to act immediately it could do so by 
joining the mission without any debate and sending as large a 
contingent of troops and materiel as it needed to. A 
peacekeeping mission is carefully defined in this bill as more 
than 100 soldiers sent under a UN mandate for more than one 
month.
<P>
	This means soldiers deployed with a UN mandate would not 
require legislation approval. The cabinet needs that authority 
and ability. It means that fewer than 100 Canadian forces 
personnel acting for more than a year would not constitute a 
mission. They as well could be sent by the cabinet.
<P>
	A thousand soldiers on a mission lasting less than a month, 
something that we had to do quickly, would not require 
parliamentary approval.
<P>
	When we get into major commitments for long periods of time 
Bill C-295 would come into play. Once Parliament has approved 
a peacekeeping plan that plan would become the mission's 
mandate. If the mandate expired the mission would 
automatically be over and the troops withdrawn. If a situation 
called for the mission to be extended that process is also 
contained in the bill. The government would simply come back 
to the House with amendments to the plan and pass a new 
resolution.
<P>
	This simple process in many ways mirrors a letter I received 
last May from the Minister of National Defence which detailed 
the criteria for Canada's peacekeeping commitments. He said 
there must be an achievable mandate. The principal antagonists 
must agree to UN involvement. Are the lines of authority clear? 
Is the mission adequately funded? What is the risk for 
peacekeepers and the rules of engagement?
<P>
	Laws are simply a codification of what is necessary and 
reasonable. The things the minister mentioned are both 
reasonable and necessary considerations. Now it is time we 
codified these requirements into a law that allows Parliament to 
have significant and effective input.
<P>
	I can think of important benefits to this idea. The first is 
participation. Through the political process Canadians would 
decide Canada's priorities, where Canada should be involved 
around the world. There would be a special benefit for the 
government of the day in that it could lay before Parliament a 
peacekeeping plan from which it could gauge support for a 
mission before we actually made the commitment in the 
international arena.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11914"> 11914 </A></B>
<P>
	Also, the debate would allow all political parties to endorse 
a proposal in an official way through a vote. Having endorsed 
a mission a party would be reluctant later to criticize a plan it 
had helped finalize.
<P>
	The second benefit is preparedness and co-ordination. The 
government as well as our international partners would know 
beforehand exactly what Canada is prepared to do in each 
situation and other nations could prepare accordingly. Our 
national defence people could better prepare for a mission if 
they knew its parameters in advance.
<P>
	The third benefit is budgetary. By putting a cost ceiling on all 
our missions we would know how much the country will allot for 
peacekeeping and in these days of tightening budgets the ability 
to fix our costs as much as possible ahead of time is vital.
<P>
	If governments had to return to the House for more money the 
political hurdle this would pose in some cases would cause the 
government to be more careful about the money it spent and 
committed to in the first place.
<P>
	Governments need to be held accountable for the money they 
spend and certainly the current government needs to recognize 
that the budget for peacekeeping is like other departmental 
spending plans for which they present estimates to the House. 
We simply must be able to keep to the budget allocated by 
Parliament.
<P>
<B>(1800 ) </B>
<P>
	Some people will argue political situations change so rapidly 
that Canada cannot make firm commitments ahead of time. I 
would answer that firm commitments ahead of time could in 
themselves positively affect the political and military decisions 
others will make.
<P>
	Firm decisions will allow us to direct our circumstances and 
set our own course rather than have external events lead us 
around by the nose. As General MacKenzie implied, by giving 
generous but firm guidelines ahead of time, we may even 
influence warring factions to resolve their differences in a 
timely fashion.
<P>
	In any case, the bill is flexible. It allows for the government to 
make corrections in midstream, to extend, for example, a 
peacekeeping mandate. Having said that, all of us elected to this 
House know our first duty is not to satisfy the wishes of other 
nations. The government's first duty is to satisfy the Canadian 
people that our foreign involvements are necessary and fiscally 
prudent before running around the world putting out other 
people's fires. For Canada's peacekeeping function to continue 
to be legitimate in the eyes of Canadians, it must pass the test of 
continuing public approval.
<P>
	We also need a bill that touches on other areas of Canada's 
peacekeeping function. This bill does that. It refers to the 
command structure of Canadian forces and requires that our 
troops be placed under the command of other Canadians. As we 
know, a major complaint about the UN is the notoriously low 
quality of its commanders.  We feel that Canadians, especially 
Canadian soldiers, will feel more secure with Canadian 
commanders.
<P>
	Even here we have constructed this bill to allow some 
flexibility. Clause 6 states that cabinet may delegate that 
command structure if it wishes to another body for periods of six 
months at a time. At least cabinet would have to make a 
conscious decision to place our troops under someone else's 
care.
<P>
	We also talk about the neutrality of our armed forces. 
Neutrality is a precious commodity in this world. Once we give 
our reputation away for neutrality it is very difficult to restore. 
Canada is known and welcomed around the world for its 
fairness, impartiality and even-handedness. We should not be 
seen to be installing and deposing governments, even 
non-democratic governments, at the behest of the UN. It is not 
our role to take political sides in political disputes.
<P>
	Our peacekeeping task, our role, our function is to enforce 
ceasefire agreements and to deliver humanitarian aid, thereby 
earning the respect over the long term of all sides in the dispute 
rather than breaking the bounds of neutrality in a short-sighted 
way and turn half of a population against us. This is a delicate 
task. It can only be accomplished if our armed forces continue 
our traditional neutrality in peacekeeping roles.
<P>
	There has been some question about the use of deadly force in 
peacekeeping situations, situations in which our peacekeepers 
have felt ashamed of themselves and deeply frustrated by their 
inability to protect themselves and others. My bill helps to 
resolve this problem by allowing our peacekeepers to use deadly 
force in self-defence, in defence of innocent civilians or to stop 
serious abuses of human rights where deadly force seems to be 
the only way to do it.
<P>
	What is an army for? An army exists to pit force against force. 
That is its only purpose. Even peacekeepers are an army that 
moves physically into a dangerous area to provide a physical 
check on another armed force. But we fight a different battle 
than either of the antagonists. We are warriors stepping between 
other warriors in a battle for peace, risking everything in our 
striving to end war and deliver hope where little exists.
<P>
	We cannot ask our soldiers to go into these types of situations 
completely unprotected. Although we must minimize our own 
use of deadly force, I feel it is justified in the situations I have 
just outlined where it will clearly forestall an immediate 
situation that is obviously worse. However, I acknowledge this 
is a difficult area.
<P>
	Let me sum up by talking about Canada's identity. Canada is a 
young country. As such, its personality, if we want to call it that, 
is still developing. Different nations seem to be known for 
different things. When we think of Switzerland we naturally 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11915"> 11915 </A></B>
<P>
think of neutrality. Germany is an industrial giant and Sweden is 
perhaps a classic welfare state.
<P>
	What do people think of when they think of Canada? I would 
say that other nations long ago recognized Canada's peaceable 
nature, her natural co-operativeness and her concern for 
stability in the world. We offered a novel idea, that there is a 
third option between defeat and victory.
<P>
<B>(1805 ) </B>
<P>
	The UN requested our assistance as peacekeepers. Canada did 
well and the public supported it. We have continued to respond 
proudly and generously for 40 years. In doing so, we have 
defined our own nature, shaped our identity and become 
comfortable with our role in the international community.
<P>
	We are peacekeepers. It is a role that receives applause around 
the world. A peacekeeping bill would formalize this positive 
definition of Canada. It would cement it in the minds and hearts 
of Canadians. I can think of no more noble role than being a 
peacekeeper, no higher legislative aim than to entrench this 
function as a formal element of Canada's identity.
<P>
	It is said that we reap what we sow. If that is true, and I think it 
is, what kind of harvest do we reap, what kind of fruit grows 
when peace is sown? Peaceable people co-operate more. The 
food of peace is better health, prosperity, long life, happy 
relations, improved working conditions. To strive for peace is to 
strive for all that is necessary for humanity to thrive on this 
planet.
<P>
	Finally, in addition to those tangible benefits of peace, the 
fruit of peace is also hope. That precious seed of hope is sown in 
peace by those who make peace. I trust that all members of the 
House would see fit to formalize Canada's peacekeeping 
identity by voting to submit the peacekeeping bill to committee 
for consideration.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fred Mifflin (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak on Bill C-295, an act to 
provide for the control of Canadian peacekeeping activities by 
Parliament and to amend the National Defence Act in 
consequence thereof.
<P>
	I have no doubt that the bill was motivated by the concern of 
all members for the well-being of the Canadian forces personnel 
and for a wise and sound decision making process on the part of 
the government.
<P>
	Unfortunately I have to say that after close study of the bill, in 
my opinion it might on serious consideration make the process a 
little worse than the situation that we now have in place. For that 
reason I oppose it.
<P>
	Before describing the details of my opposition, I have a 
general observation to make that applies to much of the thinking 
that emanates from our hon. colleagues on the Reform benches. 
It is a tendency that I see reflected in this bill to look for 
American models in matters of public policy in Canada.
<P>
	This tendency skews the vision and certainly on our part. I do 
not believe we can make policy on the basis of the trends and 
obsessions of our American neighbours, as much as we respect 
and admire them. We are not them and their examples are 
foreign to our needs and purposes.
<P>
	The government has gone to great lengths to ensure a made in 
Canada defence policy. In fact, members of all parties were 
members of the special joint committee that put together an 
outstanding report. I say this not in any sense of gloating but in 
modesty. Ninety-five per cent of it is reflected in the white 
paper. It is a Canadian defence policy and one that reflects 
Canada's needs and aspirations. I for one-I am sure I am joined 
by many others-would want to keep it that way.
<P>
	Bill C-295 would restrict the prerogative, the speed and the 
discretion of the crown to determine Canada's contribution to 
the United Nations for reasonable peace operations. Like other 
military operations, peacekeeping is carried out under the 
authority of the Minister of National Defence under the National 
Defence Act. It provides that the minister has the management 
and direction of the Canadian forces and of all matters 
pertaining to national defence. The bill would remove the 
responsibility and the discretion not only of the minister but also 
of the government respecting military operations.
<P>
	As a result, the bill would adversely affect the speed with 
which the government can respond to UN requests for assistance 
in peace operations as well as the timeliness with which it can 
respond to changes in the peacekeeping mandate.
<P>
	One of the major problems cited by many former Canadian 
UN commanders is that it takes too long for the international 
community to become involved in times of crisis. Most recently 
Major-General Romeo Dallaires has been an eloquent and 
passionate advocate of the need for speed in emergencies, 
claiming that he could have saved tens of thousands of lives had 
he received the troops he needed when he requested them.
<P>
	Bill C-295, which would add another layer in the decision 
making process, would ensure that it would take still longer for 
Canada to become involved and to provide help. In an 
emergency we should treat it like one and act urgently. The bill 
would also create an unworkable structure for the management 
of international Canadian forces operations. All potential 
operations are evaluated against a series of guidelines that 
include the broad political and foreign policy context, the 
overall mission requirements and, of course, our own military 
capability.

<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The 1994 defence white paper outlines certain key principles 
intended to help the government assess the various factors to be 
considered before deciding whether Canada should participate 
in a mission. These guidelines are based on the peacekeeping 
experience we have acquired over the last 40 years. They also 
illustrate in a careful but pragmatic way the new international 
world order that has followed the end of the cold war.
<P>
	The white paper highlights the key principles that must guide 
the design of all peacekeeping missions. These principles are as 
follows: first, there must be a clear and enforceable mandate; 
second, there must be an identifiable and commonly accepted 
reporting authority; third, the national composition of the force 
must be appropriate to the mission, and there must be an 
effective process of consultation among mission partners; 
fourth, in missions that involve both military and civilian 
resources, there must be a recognized focus of authority, a clear 
and efficient division of responsibilities, and agreed operating 
procedures; finally, with the exception of enforcement actions 
and operations to defend NATO member states, Canada's 
participation must be accepted by all parties to the conflict.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Canada's experience also suggests that successful missions 
are those that respect certain essential operation considerations. 
Some were touched on by the hon. member. The size, training 
and equipment of the force should be appropriate to the purpose 
at hand and remain so over the life of the mission. There should 
be a defined concept of operations, an effective command and 
control structure and clear rules of engagement.
<P>
	To look at another aspect, I believe Bill C-295 would give up 
Canadian sovereign command of Canadian forces elements and 
would create in its place an unworkable command and control 
relationship. In this area, in particular, I have problems with the 
intent of the bill.
<P>
	Canadian forces personnel now serving on peace operations 
are always commanded by a Canadian. Command of Canadian 
forces personnel is no longer given up to allied or UN command, 
as it was during the first and second world wars. Canadian units 
and personnel can only be placed under the operational control, 
not the operational command, of the UN or other multinational 
commanders for specific tasks.
<P>
	The practical difference between the two is that when 
Canadian forces are deployed under operational control, 
changes to the task assigned or significant changes to the area of 
operation cannot be implemented. For example, the UN would 
have to seek Canadian approval to deploy Canadian forces 
UNPROFOR personnel to the former Yugoslav republic of 
Macedonia from Croatia, should the need arise. Such approval 
would not be required under operational command.
<P>
	On the other hand, a non-Canadian commander who only has 
operational control cannot assign separate deployment of 
components of a unit. For example, the force commander of 
UNPROFOR who has operational control of Canadian forces 
personnel cannot unilaterally assign, for example, B company of 
2-PPCLI to the British battalion. Such a deployment would 
require Canadian national approval. If the commander had 
operational command, there would be no requirement for such 
Canadian approval.
<P>
	Currently, commanders of Canadian contingents are directly 
responsible to the chief of defence staff for the Canadian 
contribution to the overall mission and tasks of any given 
operation abroad. The subclause of Bill C-295 which calls for 
the Canadian commanding officer to be placed under UN or 
other international command would be contrary to current 
practice and would mean less, not more national control, 
something my instincts tell me is far from being the intent of the 
bill.
<P>
<B>(1815) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Bill C-295 would restrict Canada's capability to contribute to 
the strength of a fast reaction force on standby. As the hon. 
members probably know, the Minister of Foreign Affairs and 
myself have launched an initiative to assess the short, medium 
and long term implications of a United Nations fast reaction 
force and a possible Canadian contribution to this effort in the 
future.
<P>
	Let us come back to Major-General Dallaire's plea for rapid 
deployment to Rwanda and in response to other international 
crises. Whether or not Canada participates in a given mission, 
when the decision is made to participate, timeliness is often 
crucial. This bill, if passed, would slow the decision-making 
process down almost every time there is a crisis.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In summation, I regret I do not support Bill C-295. I know the 
hon. member has put a lot of work into it and I appreciate the 
comments he has made. However, under the guise of providing 
greater control by the Parliament of Canada of international 
peacekeeping operations, I believe it tends to confuse certain 
key concepts, some of which I have alluded to. It reduces 
national authority over our peacekeeping troops abroad. It 
significantly restricts one of the government's prime assets, the 
flexibility and ability to manoeuvre and shape our resources to 
suit rapidly changing requirements in dangerous times.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to speak to Bill C-295. This bill provides for the control of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11917"> 11917 </A></B>
<P>
Canadian peacekeeping activities by Parliament and amends the 
National Defence Act in consequence thereof.
<P>
	Bill C-295 has three main objectives: first, to enhance 
parliamentary control over the involvement of Canadian forces 
in international peacekeeping missions; second, to limit it to a 
neutral or non-combatant role; third, to control the placing of 
Canadian forces under UN or other non-Canadian command.
<P>
	I would like to stress at the outset that the members of the 
official opposition are glad to have the opportunity to discuss 
such changes to the way the Canadian forces participate in 
peacekeeping missions. And we would like to thank the hon. 
member for Fraser Valley East for giving us the opportunity to 
express our opinion on these matters.
<P>
	Much of the content of Bill C-295 is in step with the concerns 
already expressed by the Bloc Quebecois, as much in the debates 
in this House as in the dissenting report we submitted regarding 
the Canadian foreign policy review.
<P>
	I would briefly like to reiterate the Bloc Quebecois' position 
on the issue being discussed today. Firstly, I would like to stress 
that the official opposition believes that one of the most 
important roles of the Canadian forces on the international scene 
is to support peacekeeping operations and to take an active role 
in them. This is one of Canada's crowning achievements which 
has helped earn us our reputation.
<P>
	Nevertheless, we believe that, in the future, Canada should 
select more carefully the operations in which it will participate. 
Recent peacekeeping missions have, as you recall, had their 
difficulties, of which Canada should take note. Examples are the 
missions to Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia, or even the 
situation in Haiti, which reminded us of the need to ensure that 
our operations serve to further legitimate democratic causes and 
are meticulously planned.
<P>
<B>(1820) </B>
<P>
	The conflicts I just cited as examples clearly show how 
important it is to define, under the auspices of the United 
Nations, specific objectives and mandates for each mission 
beforehand. The Bloc Quebecois also recognizes that we need to 
give the Canadian forces special status, in order to maintain the 
credibility of our operations.
<P>
	At the same time, Canada should review its current military 
alliances and adapt them to strategic missions in accordance 
with the needs of the United Nations. This approach would 
inject new life into these organizations and would make them 
more effective in protecting safety and in resolving conflicts. It 
would also make it possible for Canada to meet its public 
security objectives, which are crucial to its own domestic 
security.
<P>
	Furthermore the official opposition feels that Canada should 
encourage the creation of a permanent contingent that would be 
at the disposal of the UN to carry out its peacekeeping missions 
abroad. The number of personnel assigned by Canada to these 
peacekeeping missions should be limited. Unfortunately, Bill 
C-295 is silent on this point.
<P>
	Finally, as we have said many times before, for instance in our 
dissenting opinion, we believe that Canada should put its 
decisions to participate in peacekeeping missions to a vote in the 
House of Commons, and do so as soon as possible, if there is 
enough time. We are of course delighted to see some of our 
suggestions reflected in the bill before the House today. 
However, some sections raise a number of problems, and we 
would like to suggest some improvements.
<P>
	For instance, in clause 4 of Bill C-295, there seems to be no 
provision for the eventuality that Canadian forces might be 
asked to take part in peacekeeping operations at a time when 
parliamentarians are not sitting in this House. On the other hand, 
with respect to the order that would place the officer in 
command of the Canadian forces under the command of the 
United Nations or an international organization represented by 
an officer of another state, in subclause 6(3), the bill provides 
that the order would be laid before the House of Commons on 
any of the first three days on which the House sits following the 
day the order is made. Perhaps the same provisions could be 
included in clause 4?
<P>
	Furthermore, clause 4 makes no provision for renewing the 
mandate given to Canadian forces. Perhaps it would be 
advisable to add a provision to that effect. Still in clause 4, and 
more specifically in subparagraph 4(1)(v), the Minister of 
Defence is asked to specify a maximum planned expenditure for 
the mission.
<P>
	We realize such provisions are necessary. Canada's financial 
situation demands that we act responsibly. However, instead of 
immediately patriating military personnel once the expenditure 
limit previously approved by the House has been exceeded, this 
clause should provide for increasing, always by a resolution of 
the House of Commons, the resources allocated for an operation 
in exceptional cases, such as emergency humanitarian aid.
<P>
	We also have some questions about the scope of subclause 
5(3). This subclause mentions three circumstances in which 
Canadian forces would be allowed to use deadly force. We must 
ensure that Canadian military personnel take part in 
peacekeeping rather than peacemaking missions. Would it not 
be more prudent to make the rules specifying the circumstances 
in which force may be used subject to criteria set by the UN? 
Otherwise, we might have a situation where the participation of 
Canadian military personnel in peacekeeping missions would be 
subject to criteria that are different from those for other national 
contin-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11918"> 11918 </A></B>
<P>
gents.  These questions show how important it is to specify the 
scope of subclause 5(3).
<P>
	As for clause 6, I have two comments. First, in clause 6(3), we 
want all references to the other place deleted. As you know, the 
Bloc Quebecois considers it a waste of public funds to maintain 
the other house, which should be abolished as quickly as 
possible.
<P>
<B>(1825) </B>
<P>
	As our final amendment, to clause 6(4), we believe that the 
renewal should be submitted to the House of Commons and not 
to the Governor in Council. This amendment is in keeping with 
the spirit of the bill, which attempts to involve Parliamentarians 
more in decisions pertaining to peacekeeping activities.
<P>
	In closing, I would once again like to thank my colleague for 
Fraser Valley East for allowing us to debate this important 
question. I assure him that the Bloc Quebecois supports the 
principles underlying Bill C-295. For this reason, we support 
the bill in second reading.
<P>
	We would like the questions raised by the opposition to be 
given serious consideration so improvements may be made to 
the bill before its passage at third reading.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Carolyn Parrish (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to participate in 
the debate on Bill C-295, an act to provide for the control of 
Canadian peacekeeping activities by Parliament and to amend 
the National Defence Act in consequence thereof.
<P>
	I will take a few minutes this afternoon to talk about the 
context of the bill, namely the nature of Canada's current 
involvement in peacekeeping activities and the way in which we 
currently manage our participation in the operations. I should 
also like to look at a number of specific details in the bill and 
explain why I cannot support the changes the bill proposes.
<P>
	Since World War II successive Canadian governments have 
argued that a safer, more secure international environment is 
key to Canada's own security and prosperity. As a responsible 
international participant and as a major trading nation, Canada 
is concerned with the dangers of a spillover of a localized strife 
and the threat it poses to the larger international community. At 
the same Canadians desire a reduction or end to the widespread 
human suffering in situations where there are strong indications 
that outside assistance can make a difference.
<P>
	To this end Canada has worked with other countries to create a 
stable international environment. One of the instruments we 
have used in this effort has been peacekeeping, a technique of 
multilateral conflict management and resolution that has proven 
exceedingly useful over the years, and at which Canada has 
excelled.
<P>
	Canada's contribution to peacekeeping is rooted in the belief 
that a stable international order sustained by substantial 
multinational consensus is the best foundation for Canada's 
long term peace and security. Hence, we willingly make 
available well trained and suitably equipped military personnel 
for peacekeeping and related operations.
<P>
	However, our commitment to peacekeeping cannot be taken 
for granted. Canada carefully examines all requests for 
peacekeeping assistance and turns down those it regards as 
inappropriate. Our record of support is unparalleled, but that 
does mean our decision to take part in such missions is 
automatic. Canada has declined opportunities to participate in 
the third UN Angola verification mission, the UN Aouzou Strip 
observer group and the UN observer missions in Georgia and in 
Liberia. In recent years Canada has also significantly reduced or 
withdrawn contingents from Cyprus, Western Sahara, Somalia 
and El Salvador.
<P>
	Traditionally the international community has turned to 
Canada for peacekeeping resources, not only because our 
foreign policy has been inclined to support involvement but also 
because our armed forces are flexible, multipurpose and combat 
capable. Our personnel are well trained, suitably equipped and 
have a very impressive track record. The world has come to 
depend on Canada for peacekeeping.
<P>
	Canadian participation must always be placed in a larger 
international context. Our decision to join in a mission is a 
unilateral one and any changes to the way we operate would also 
be unilateral. However, the actual mission is always multilateral 
and complex. With many partners affecting our understanding 
we become team players when we join. This is an important 
consideration because UN Security Council resolutions are not 
always absolutely precise in specifying all the aims, duties or 
roles of a mission. Decisions evolve as circumstances change.
<P>
	I should like to turn now to a discussion of some specific 
provisions of Bill C-295 which in my mind are not workable.
<P>
<B>(1830 ) </B>
<P>
	Clause 8 of Bill C-295 requires that once the aims of a 
particular mission have been achieved the Canadian 
contribution is to be terminated. The bill is not clear as to how 
the UN objectives or those expressed in the resolution might be 
reconciled. Yet the withdrawal of a Canadian contingent based 
upon an arbitrary expiry date would have two undesirable 
effects. First, the entire Canadian contribution might prove 
pointless if withdrawn too early. The second and more serious 
impact is that withdrawal could be counterproductive to the 
mission as a whole and thereby in itself threaten peace and 
security.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11919"> 11919 </A></B>
<P>
	I also question those provisions of the bill related to active 
service. This bill would deem members of the Canadian forces 
assigned to peacekeeping missions to be on active service for 
all purposes. The bill proposes that the National Defence Act 
be amended so that an officer or non-commissioned member 
assigned to a mission that is subject to the proposed 
peacekeeping act shall be deemed to be on active service for 
all purposes.
<P>
	Quite simply, this proposal is unnecessary. Pursuant to an 
order in council dated April 6, 1989, all regular force members 
anywhere in or beyond Canada and all reserve force members 
beyond Canada are currently on active service. Moreover, all 
members of the regular force have in fact been on active service 
continually since 1950.
<P>
	There is therefore no legal requirement for individual orders 
in council placing members on active service as a consequence 
of a particular peacekeeping operation. These orders in council 
are simply a parliamentary convention. But convention though 
they may be, the practice certainly reflects the government's 
desire to consult more frequently with Parliament concerning 
the general thrust of Canada's peacekeeping policy and practice.
<P>
	As members well know, there have been two substantial 
debates on international peacekeeping commitments since this 
government came into power, the first on September 21, 1994 
and the second just recently on March 29.
<P>
	Bill C-295 does not adequately address the scope of UN 
peacekeeping operations or chapter 7 action taken by the UN 
Security Council. This is the third element of the bill with which 
I have serious concerns.
<P>
	The definitions and structure imposed by the bill do not 
accord with international treaties and the UN charter 
obligations. In trying to encompass the broad range of 
operations that may be authorized or directed by a UN Security 
Council resolution, the definition of a peacekeeping service in 
clause 2 of the bill is very imprecise.
<P>
	The Secretary General of the United Nations, Dr. Boutros 
Boutros-Ghali, in his June 1992 report to the Security Council 
defined four terms: preventive diplomacy, peacemaking, 
peacekeeping, and peacebuilding, all of which contribute to the 
maintenance of international peace and security. Each of these 
UN concepts can, and most often do, entail the use of military 
force. However, civilian personnel such as elections officials 
and civilian police are also becoming common in UN 
peacekeeping operations. The problem with Bill C-295 is that it 
does not provide a clear delineation of which operations are 
covered, nor does it offer any specific rationale for applying 
such regulations only to Canadian forces.
<P>
	I would also like to question the section dealing with the rules 
of engagement. Bill C-295 creates overly simplistic legal 
obligations for rules of engagement and the use of force. Rules 
of engagement are always issued  to armed Canadian forces 
personnel participating in international operations. They often 
operate under UN rules of engagement, although these are 
always drafted in conjunction with the Canadian forces staff at 
National Defence Headquarters as well as the Canadian 
contingent commander.
<P>
	In this way, UN rules of engagement reflect a distinctly 
Canadian approach in structure, terminology, and interpretation 
of the mandate within which the rules operate. Occasionally, 
when the UN is slow to produce an acceptable set of rules of 
engagement, Canadian forces will operate under Canadian rules 
while permitting the UN to maintain overall control of an 
international operation.
<P>
	Clause 5(3) of the bill restricts the use of force to 
self-defence. However, this restriction cannot, unless 
specifically authorized by a UN Security Council resolution, 
extend to the protection of civilians, even if they are subject to 
the actual or immediate threat of deadly force or if they are 
threatened with a serious abuse of human rights. All rules of 
engagement must be carefully analysed, taking into account the 
specifics of the mandate. That mandate could require 
troop-contributing states to use force for reasons other than 
those specified in the bill.
<P>
	The issue of neutrality in Bill C-259 is also insupportable. 
The blanket requirement in subclause 5(1) that Canadian forces 
be neutral and not engage in combat is itself contradicted later in 
paragraphs 5(3)(a), (b), and (c) of the bill. The authorization this 
later subclause gives would violate the neutrality provisions 
because force could be used to protect one civilian group against 
the actions of another. There may be cases in which combat is 
the only means of restoring peace. Once again, this bill, if 
implemented, would restrict the flexibility of our Canadian 
forces in what are often very fluid and unpredictable 
circumstances.
<P>
<B>(1835) </B>
<P>
	In conclusion, I think that the same argument could be applied 
to the bill as a whole. The provisions of Bill C-259 foreclose 
options and restrict the flexibility of the Government of Canada 
to direct and manage the peacekeeping operations it undertakes.
<P>
	I urge all members of the House to give careful consideration 
to how this bill would affect the ability of our Canadian forces to 
perform the tasks they have been assigned. This bill, however 
well meaning in its intent, would, in my view, have a detrimental 
effect on Canada's ability to undertake peace operations.
<P>
	Out of respect for the admirable work that our Canadian 
forces are doing on a day to day basis and with their interests in 
mind, I cannot support this bill.
<P>

<B><A NAME="11920"> 11920 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to stand in the House 
today and support Bill C-295, put forward by my colleague for 
Fraser Valley East.
<P>
	The part of this bill I would like to address is clause 4, dealing 
with the authority of the House of Commons. As everyone in this 
House knows, much to the distress of the Liberal government, 
the Reform Party strongly endorses the notion that the House 
must be accountable to Canadians, and not just financially 
accountable. Everything we do in the House must reflect the 
desires and expectations of the people. Only under the most 
extreme circumstances should Parliament act without 
consulting the people who elected us. This is especially true 
when Canadian lives are at stake.
<P>
	Last year I had the privilege of being a member of the special 
joint committee reviewing Canada's defence policy. During this 
year of intense research and consultation with Canadians, we 
made a number of recommendations in our report, entitled 
``Security in a Changing World''. This is one of the 
recommendations, and I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Defence policy cannot be made in private and results simply announced. 
Canadians will not accept that, nor should they. Nor should the government 
commit our forces to service abroad without a full parliamentary debate and 
accounting for that decision. It is our expectation that, except in extraordinary 
circumstances, such a debate would always take place prior to any such 
deployment.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This recommendation was endorsed by all members of the 
committee, including those sitting opposite today. Though there 
have been eleventh hour debates on peacekeeping in the former 
Yugoslavia and the government's white paper on national 
defence did recognize many of the special joint committee's 
recommendations, this specific recommendation was 
overlooked by the minister and the government.
<P>
	Currently, cabinet has the full authority to designate soldiers 
to be on active service for war or for peacekeeping activities. If 
Parliament is not sitting, section 32 of the National Defence Act 
requires that the House reconvene 10 days after placing soldiers 
on active service. Strangely, the government is not required to 
hold a debate on this. The notion of accountability is 
conspicuously absent. Canadians have no say in committing our 
troops to life threatening circumstances.
<P>
	Clause 4 of Bill C-295 provides a method for full 
parliamentary review in the spirit of the special joint committee 
report and holds the government accountable for all 
peacekeeping commitments. Clause 4 states: ``No Canadian 
forces shall serve or be committed to service in peacekeeping 
service or continue in such service beyond the time or 
expenditure limit previously approved by the House of 
Commons, pursuant to this section, unless the Minister of 
National Defence has moved in the House of Commons a 
resolution'' outlining five criteria that must be debated and 
passed.
<P>
	This opportunity for debate is essential. Since the end of the 
cold war the government has designated more troops to active 
service than any time since the Korean war. While we are very 
proud of our international recognition as peacekeepers and in 
some cases peacemakers to the world, the missions we have 
engaged in are becoming increasingly dangerous and uncertain 
in purpose. Canadians should be proud of our peacekeepers, 
because our troops are indeed the best in the world.
<P>
<B>(1840) </B>
<P>
	The first criterion in the resolution authorizes the specific 
mission for peacekeeping service. This is extremely important. 
The House of Commons must be told exactly what the specific 
mission is.
<P>
	When I talk to my constituents about defence issues many ask 
me what our specific mission is in hot spots such as the former 
Yugoslavia. They also ask why we are still there when the troops 
are fired on and held hostage by the combatants. They seem to 
realize there is no will for peace in that troubled nation and 
wonder exactly what we are doing to resolve the conflict.
<P>
	This brings me to my second criterion. Bill C-295 would 
ensure the resolution specifies the objectives, duties and role of 
the mission. This is important in the new peacekeeping roles we 
find ourselves in.
<P>
	In the former Yugoslavia it is often unclear what objectives 
we are striving for. The classic peacekeeping role of keeping 
two warring factions apart from each other while they negotiate 
a final peace or maintaining a ceasefire to which all parties agree 
is absent in Bosnia. In a conflict such as this where all warring 
sides clearly do not want peace and look at our troops as 
occupiers, it is difficult to ascertain exactly what our objectives 
are.
<P>
	If we are to send peacekeepers into dangerous situations such 
as this it is imperative Parliament pass a resolution specifying 
the objectives of our troops, what objectives they will be 
attempting to meet.
<P>
	Canadian troops cannot be pawns in any conflict. We must 
have a clear role spelled out. This is particularly important when 
communications between Canada's peacekeeping forces and the 
Canadian public are weak.
<P>
	The third criterion of the resolution defines the state or area in 
which the mission is to operate. Only Parliament should have 
the authority to specify where our troops are to be committed.
<P>
	The fourth criterion in the resolution specifies the date on 
which the authority expires. It is essential for Parliament to 
decide the exact date on which the mission ends.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="11921"> 11921 </A></B>
<P>
	Some of our former commitments have seemed unending in 
scope. Our service in the former Yugoslavia is on a six-month 
term but other peacekeeping missions, such as our mission to 
Cyprus, lasted 30 years.
<P>
	Giving Parliament the authority to determine the date on 
which the authority is to expire for a mission also gives 
Parliament the opportunity to cancel or renew the mission. 
Parliament will be able to evaluate the mission and decide 
whether we have accomplished our objectives. It can also 
re-evaluate the conflict and assess whether it has changed in 
scope and whether we still have a role to play.
<P>
	In common with the fourth criterion is the fifth. It specifies a 
maximum planned expenditure for the mission. Peacekeeping 
missions, like anything else the government does, must have 
financial bounds. The nation does not have a bottomless purse. 
We must determine what we can afford.
<P>
	Clause 4 of the bill also provides for a five-hour debate on the 
resolution before the question is put to the House. As with any 
bill, the resolution can pass with or without amendments and it 
can also be defeated.
<P>
	The time for Parliament to become accountable to the 
Canadian people for designating our troops on active duty is 
now. We must be the ones to decide and those who represent 
them in Parliament are their voice.
<P>
	I strongly urge all members of the House to support Bill 
C-295.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The time provided for the 
consideration of Private Members' Business has now expired. 
Pursuant to Standing Order 93, the order is dropped to the 
bottom of the order of precedence on the Order Paper.

<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 
deemed to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="ACCESSTOINFORMATION">ACCESS TO INFORMATION</A></H4>
	<B>Hon. Warren Allmand (Notre-Dame-de-GrÃ¢ce, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on March 13, I asked the Minister of Justice if he would 
order a full review of the Access to Information Act as 
recommended by the information commissioner in his 10th 
anniversary report. In response, the Minister of Justice said that 
he was considering such a review and hoped to come forward 
with reforms in due course.
<P>
<B>(1845) </B>
<P>
	In 1986-87 I was a member of the justice committee which 
made an extensive review of this act. It issued a report entitled: 
``Open and Shut'' which made 87 recommendations for 
amendment. Unfortunately, none of those recommendations 
were implemented by the former Conservative government.
<P>
	Recently the information commissioner made similar 
recommendations in three documents entitled: ``The Access to 
Information Act: 10 Years On''; ``The Access to Information 
Act: A Critical Review''; and ``Information Technology and 
Open Government''.
<P>
	The basic principle of this act is that Canadians should have 
the right to information about their government and to 
information compiled and held by the government. Of course, 
this is information paid for with taxpayers' money.
<P>
	For years prior to the Access to Information Act the 
government's general policy was to say no whenever 
information was requested and only to say yes by exception. The 
purpose of the Access to Information Act was of course to 
reverse this process. There would be exceptions, of course, for 
national security, for privacy and for cabinet confidence, but the 
general rule was to make information available.
<P>
	The ``Open and Shut'' report concluded that the act had major 
shortcomings and weaknesses which should be corrected. As I 
said, the committee made 87 recommendations to do that.
<P>
	Among those recommendations were first, that all 
government institutions, including much of our parliamentary 
process, be included under the act.
<P>
	Second, it was recommended that all crown corporations 
except the CBC be included under the act. These institutions are 
not included under the act at the present time.
<P>
	Third, it was recommended that all persons in Canada, not just 
citizens and residents, have access to the act.
<P>
	Fourth, it was recommended to entrench the status of the 
information co-ordinators who are present in every department 
to facilitate the operation of the act and to give those 
co-ordinators senior rank in the departments.
<P>
	Fifth, there were several recommendations with respect to the 
exemptions. We said that the exemptions should be subject to a 
significant injury test. We also recommended narrowing certain 
exemptions.
<P>
	With respect to the cabinet confidence exemption we said that 
it should be covered under the act, but subject to a class tested 
discretionary exemption. In other words, cabinet confidences 
would not automatically be outside the scope of the act.
<P>
	We also said that the information commissioner should have 
the power to issue certain binding orders in some cases, 
although generally he would still act by recommendation only. 
We made recommendations that the social insurance number be 
restricted in its use by outside agencies.

<P>
	We recommended that the time for answering information 
requests be reduced from 30 to 20 days. We also recommended 
that there be legislation to protect whistle blowers within the 
Government of Canada.
<P>
	Those are some of the recommendations which were made in 
1986-87 in the ``Open and Shut'' report. I would like to ask the 
government again tonight if and when it intends to move on the 
recommendations made in ``Open and Shut'' in 1986-87 and 
also on the recommendations made recently by the information 
commissioner in his 10-year report.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Russell MacLellan (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Notre-Dame-de-GrÃ¢ce has 
asked about the government's intentions with respect to reforms 
of the Access to Information Act.
<P>
	The act is now 12 years old and much has changed since the 
act was first adopted. At that time access to information was 
seen as innovative and statutory rights to government 
information was thought to be a bold step.
<P>
	Now we are fully in the information age. Canadians are 
increasingly purchasing computers and equipping them with 
modems. They are on the eve of the convergence of the 
television with computers. Those who have a television will also 
have the mechanism by which to retrieve information from the 
world at large. The Internet has completely changed our earlier 
notions of what access to information means.
<P>
	The Access to Information Act was studied by a 
parliamentary committee in 1987. The information 
commissioner issued extensive recommendations to reform the 
act on the occasion of its 10th anniversary. The information 
commissioner also released background information studies he 
had commissioned, including one on information technology 
and open government.
<P>
	The federal government recently adopted a blueprint for 
improving government services using new technology. It has 
created the Information Highway Advisory Council which is 
scheduled to report to the Minister of Industry in the spring.
<P>
	Federal and provincial governments are engaged in a variety 
of pilot projects designed to provide more government 
information and services electronically. In the United States the 
department of justice has issued a draft consultation paper on 
electronic access to government information.
<P>
	These initiatives are making more government information 
available than has previously been the case. This information is 
being provided outside the Access to Information Act and 
therefore with less red tape, more quickly and at virtually no 
cost to citizens.
<P>
	All commentators on the Access to Information Act agree that 
what is needed most of all is a change in attitude that results in 
more government information becoming routinely available 
without requiring citizens to  request it under the expensive and 
sometimes slow process of the Access to Information Act.
<P>
	Progress is being made. There is no question that the Access 
to Information Act needs reforms. The minister has promised 
that the government will come forward with reforms.
<P>
	The Liberal Party has made open government a promise in the 
red book. The minister has indicated that the Department of 
Justice is at work identifying areas where reforms could be 
made. We need to take the minister at his word. Reforms are 
coming. While precise details and dates are not now available, 
these will unfold in due course.
<P>

<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Pursuant to Standing 
Order 38, the motion to adjourn the House is now deemed 
adopted. Accordingly, this House stands adjourned until 
tomorrow at 10 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24.
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 6:52 p.m.)
