<P><A NAME="LINK3"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP)</B> moved: 
<A NAME="LINK4">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should restore 
full multi-year funding to the CBC, sufficient to meet its stated 
public service goals. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>She said:  Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure to move that this 
House adopt Motion No. M-432.  I am proud to have the opportunity 
to address the House on a subject which is important to Canadians 
and to our culture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also timely in the minds of the media, due to the current 
and impending labour disputes.  The need for stable and adequate 
funding for the CBC is also very close to my heart. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members on the other side of the House will undoubtedly say that 
after years of cuts they have made a commitment to stable 
funding.  If they say that, I am afraid they are wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at what funding for the CBC has been since the 
Liberals last promised full stable funding in the 1993 election 
campaign.  Then the CBC received almost $1.1 billion to run the 
largest and best broadcast system in the world.  The main 
estimates from 1998-99, however, show a different story. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1998-99 the Liberal government allocated only $745 million to 
the CBC for operating expenses.  Granted the government did throw 
another $94 million into the pot in the supplementary estimates, 
but it should be noted that $88 million of that was for 
employment departure programs.  In other words, to get rid of 
people.  In short, the CBC operations have been slashed by this 
government by about $400 million and this has resulted in the 
loss of over 3,000 employees.  It has also resulted in a drastic 
loss in service for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen the closing of regional TV stations.  We have seen 
the closing of local suppertime news shows and we have seen the 
closing of foreign bureaus, three of them only last week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another result seems to have been the chaos at management level. 
When $3 million gets lost on the radio side of the corporation 
something is definitely wrong.  But when the manager in charge of 
that problem then gets a major promotion I would say that 
something is drastically wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Radio Canada International, Canada's voice in the world, was 
also almost lost and has been forced to significantly reduce its 
service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen cuts to the radio and stereo services as well, now 
called Radio one and two, meaning that almost one-third of the 
radio programming, before the current round of labour problems, 
was made up of repeat broadcasts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the cuts we have seen valiant efforts by CBC employees 
to finally Canadianize the prime time television schedule, but a 
large part of the success has been undercut because they have 
been forced to sell even more commercials during prime time to 
make up for the cuts.  Thanks to this government Canadians now 
have to endure endless commercials in the middle of national 
news. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All evidence shows that the corporation is a shell of its 
previous self when the Liberal government promised stable funding 
in 1993.  Some promise.  Some stability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just before the last election the Minister of Canadian Heritage 
announced that there would again be stable funding.  She pointed 
to a single line buried in an old press release. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's commitment to public broadcasting is similar to 
that kind of promise; something to be buried, to be ignored, to 
be lost once the votes are counted.  The arrogance of this will 
not be lost on Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following up on her stable funding promise the minister has, 
just in the last two months, presided over a significant 
reduction in the amount of funds available to the CBC through the 
Canadian broadcast television fund.  She has also expressed 
approval for a new funding proposal for Canadian feature films 
which calls for an additional $25 million cut to the CBC.

<A HREF="#LINKT1"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This kind of treatment, saying that there is stable funding and 
then taking away more money, is perverse.  The government has a 
choice to make and I call on it to make it.  Either support the 
CBC or have the courage to admit to what is actually happening. 
It is basically giving it death by a thousand cuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some believe that the CBC's future should be to get out of TV 
and to move into the new media, with specialty programming for 
children and news.  This would be a logical conclusion if the 
government policy is to discontinue support, through funding, to 
public broadcasting.  I do not believe that is what Canadians 
want.  It may be what the government wants, but once again it is 
silent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want quality radio programming, not repeats, not 
reruns and not mismanagement.  This government even seems to have 
acknowledged this by giving an additional $10 million to the CBC 
just before the last election.  Now the election is over and that 
$10 million is no longer part of the overall allocation.  The 
1997 promise for stable funding is in the same place as the 1993 
promise.  It has vanished. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A clear example of how hypocritical the government policy has 
been is reflected in the current labour dispute.  During the last 
question period in the House the Minister of Labour said that the 
current labour dispute at the CBC has nothing to do with 
government funding levels.  What an odd thing to say.  Is this 
not a dispute about wages, working conditions and job security? 
Is the core of all these issues not money? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CBC gets most of its funding from the government.  The 
government funding cuts have created the financial problems which 
have resulted in the labour dispute.  To suggest otherwise is to 
say that there is no warmth from the sun or that if you fall in 
the water you will not get wet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new Minister of Labour should know better.  I had hoped she 
would be keeping an eye on crown corporations to prevent the use 
of replacement workers.  I had hoped she would ensure that all 
crown corporations bargain fairly.  That is the job of the 
Minister of Labour, not standing in the House denying reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have recently seen Treasury Board interfering with the CBC to 
have it include the Canadian flag in the CBC logo.  We have seen 
a member of the board of directors become a leading fundraiser 
for the Liberal Party and we have seen the CBC launch an 
advertising campaign, costing hundreds of thousands of dollars, 
aimed at slandering its workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The workers and the programmers at the CBC are the ones who have 
borne the brunt of the cuts.  There are 3,000 fewer employees and 
those still there have been accepting behind inflation 
settlements since the early eighties.  The fact that there is 
still good programming on the air is mostly due to the sacrifices 
of these CBC employees, both in terms of the extra efforts they 
have made at work and in terms of the opportunities they have 
forgone to continue doing a job they love.  For them to be 
treated this way by management is outrageous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CBC board and management were acquiescent when the Mulroney 
government cut them.  They were totally silent when the Liberal 
government slashed their funding.  Now they are finally speaking 
up to attack those who have kept them going throughout these 
cuts.   Shame on the board, shame on the management of the CBC 
and shame on this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government took a situation already made critical by 
the Tories and made it one hundred times worse.  I guess one 
could say that the government made it $40 million dollars worse 
and 3,000 employees short. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we have a Minister of Canadian Heritage who believes that 
providing stable funding means cutting back and that the CBC is 
an arm's length organization as long as some board members help 
raise money for her political party.  We have a Minister of 
Labour who believes that $400 million in government cuts to a 
crown corporation has nothing to do with the monetary issues in 
collective bargaining.  These Liberal ministers should look for a 
career change.  They should be asking for funding from the Canada 
Council to write fiction, not to be in charge of the greatest 
gutting of cultural programming in the history of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government promised it was not going to cut the 
parliamentary allocation to the CBC and it did.  It promised it 
was not going to fill the CBC board with a bunch of political 
hacks and it did.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government promised it would defend the validity and the 
vitality of our world class broadcaster.  Instead, it has plunged 
it into rancour and turmoil.  Instead of being the saviour of 
public broadcasting, it in fact has been bent on destroying it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am calling on this government to change its disastrous course, 
to ditch its boisterous rhetoric about concern for public 
broadcasting and instead truly recommit in spirit and deed to 
stable multiyear funding for the CBC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am calling on this government to leave as its legacy not just 
more broken promises but a strong public broadcaster.  Canadians 
want and deserve a confident, courageous and clear voice in this 
multichannel universe.  Give us back our Canadian window on the 
world, on our communities and on our neighbourhood.  Give us back 
the CBC. 
<P><A NAME="LINK5"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin—Swan River, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I am pleased to speak today on private member's Motion No. 432 
for more CBC funding from the member for Dartmouth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CBC is doing a fine job reflecting Canadian culture at this 
time despite continued cutbacks.  The larger question should be 
what is the right balance, not just more money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At present, the CBC receives approximately $800 million to $900 
million in its annual appropriation from the federal government. 
The CBC also takes in approximately between $250 million to $300 
million every year in advertising revenue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CBC has exclusive access to half the Canadian television 
fund, formerly the television and cable production fund for 
production. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Canadian Heritage announced recently the CBC's 
exclusive access to half the Canadian television fund will end in 
July 1999.  However, that funding has amounted to about $100 
million per year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even when we estimate on the low side, when it is added all up, 
the CBC currently takes in approximately $1.2 billion or more 
each and every year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where does that $1.2 billion or more come from?  The Canadian 
television fund of $200 million comes from both the federal 
government and from the television cable service providers.  It 
comes from federal taxpayers and private cable companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Advertising revenues of $250 million or more come mainly from 
private companies, the federal government and federal crown 
corporations, from advertising, charities and from non-profits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an aside, I recently heard something very strange. A well 
respected Canadian charity, Athletes in Action, which provides 
chaplaincy support to professional athletes and which is active 
in youth work, launched a national advertising campaign. One 
broadcaster refused it, the CBC. 
Why would the CBC refuse a reputable charity that does laudable 
work with our athletes and our youth?  That is an aside. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More than $250 million comes from advertisers. Finally, the CBC 
receives more than $800 million each and every year from the 
federal government.  Really the CBC receives more than $800 
million each and every year from federal taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians across Canada are footing an annual appropriation 
given to the CBC to the tune of more than $800 million.  The 
member for Dartmouth is asking this House to restore multiyear 
funding to the CBC, sufficient to meet its stated public service 
goals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the more appropriate question to ask, first of all, is 
why can the CBC not meet its stated public service goals on a 
$1.2 billion budget, and why is $1.2 billion a year not 
sufficient. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second question we could raise is are the CBC stated public 
service goals still valid.  What will the CBC's role be in the 
new millennium?  What will be its role on the international 
stage? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the place of public broadcasters in an era of not just 
broadcasting but with cable, direct to home satellite service, an 
era of booming new media like the Internet, including web casting 
and a convergence of all these?

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have one more question I want to preface with some 
observations. Even before the recent problems between the CBC 
management and its technical staff, viewership for CBC TV and 
listenership for CBC radio has gone down and stagnated.  Private 
broadcasters sink or swim on their ability to attract viewers and 
listeners.  If they do not attract viewers and listeners they 
cannot attract the advertising dollars that keep them afloat.  In 
fact, a key basis on which a private broadcaster gets and keeps 
its licence granted by the CRTC is its profitability.  No 
advertisers, no money; no profits, no licence to broadcast.  If 
fewer and fewer Canadians watch and listen to the CBC, is the CBC 
serving Canadians? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the CBC worth the more than $800 million it gets in its 
annual appropriation?  Is it worth the $100 million it gets from 
the Canadian television fund?  Is the CBC worth its combined 
revenues of $1.2 billion or more?  More important than money for 
the CBC, this government needs to be at arm's length from the CBC 
so that the CBC can operate independently without government 
interference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should the CBC get one more cent from Canadian taxpayers?  At 
this time without further review of the CBC I certainly would say 
no.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski—Mitis, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, as 
Parliament resumes, I am delighted to take part in the debate on 
Motion M-432 presented by my colleague, the NDP member for 
Dartmouth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should 
restore full multi-year funding to the CBC, sufficient to meet 
its stated public service goals. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Until very recently, the Bloc Quebecois would have supported 
this motion unconditionally. 
Since its inception, the CBC has been a public institution dear 
to the heart of Quebeckers.  The CBC French-language radio and 
television network has made a great contribution to the 
development and enrichment of the Quebec culture and identity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois cannot therefore be opposed in principle to 
the Canadian government's restoring a budget that it has slashed 
considerably over recent years, despite numerous promises. 
These cuts have obliged the CBC to reduce its operating budget 
by more than $414 million between 1994 and 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois finds, however, that history is repeating 
itself and that, once again, the Liberals are trying to control 
the CBC. 
According to the <I>National Post</I> of Saturday, February 26, the 
1984 Trudeau cabinet wanted more control over Canada's cultural 
institutions.  The article states as follows: 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“Senior members of Mr. Trudeau's cabinet wanted all the arm's 
length cultural agencies to carry the Canada logo more 
prominently and through a strict system of reporting to be 
brought under more direct government control”. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes on to say that the Minister of Energy, Mines and 
Resources was the keenest about this and that Mr. Trudeau had 
given him a two-fold mandate: to help draft a bill limiting CBC 
and the cultural agencies, and to determine the share of the 
federal budget to be devoted to each of these agencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will never guess the name of that minister who was so 
keen to control culture.  Yes indeed, it was the hon. member for 
Shawinagan, the present Prime Minister.  Unfortunately, he has 
not changed over the years.  He is still pushing that same idea, 
and this time he is asking Treasury Board to do the dirty work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On March 26, 1998, the President of Treasury Board issued a 
clear directive requiring all federal agencies and departments 
to standardize the use of the Canadian government logo.  The 
CBC, generally exempt from such directives, was required to 
conform this time.  Most fortunately, to date the corporation's 
board of directors has resisted and refused to do so, refused to 
commit a kind of hara-kiri. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is public knowledge that the Prime Minister is no lover of 
the CBC, suspecting it of being pro-separatist.  And 
more recently, the Prime Minister's Office's contacts with the 
Canadian Broadcasting Corporation concerning a report on 
“peppergate” have done nothing to reassure the Bloc Quebecois.

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know the effect of the Prime Minister's displeasure:  the 
journalist was suspended on the pretext that his reports were 
not in keeping with the rules of the art.  Strange, though, that 
the corporation realized this only after a complaint was 
received from the office of the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In another vein, during the latest referendum in Quebec, 
Quebeckers saw that for the federal government bigwigs, 
including the federalist Liberal Prime Minister, promoting 
national unity was an integral part of the official goals of the 
CBC public service, the goals referred to in the motion 
currently before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer my colleagues to the statements made by the current 
Prime Minister and member for Saint-Maurice and to those made by 
the Minister of Canadian Heritage and member for Hamilton East 
in the latest referendum campaign that the corporation had 
failed to fulfil its mandate to promote national unity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the Bloc Quebecois notes along with other cultural 
sector stakeholders and with at least two other political 
parties in this House that, for several years now, including 
following the 1995 Quebec referendum, the federal government has 
been putting considerable pressure on the CBC to change the 
independent nature of its national news service.  And the 
article I was referring to earlier indicated, and I quote: 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“With a CBC board of directors well stocked with Liberals, 
there is now a proposal on the table to give control of news and 
information programming on both CBC and its French service, 
Radio-Canada, to Ottawa under a senior news czar”. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This must never happen.  And I take the position of Professor 
David Taras, director of the graduate studies in communications 
program at the University of Calgary, who said that distance 
from the government is particularly essential to the integrity 
of CBC journalists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, beyond the shadow of a doubt, the federal government is 
trying to give itself the power to intercede by ensuring it has 
control over cultural appointments.  At least, this is the clear 
message of Bill C-44, which aimed to provide an ejection seat for 
the position of president of the CBC.  Fortunately, the 
government dropped this idea following public outcry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All these examples show the federal government's thrust and its 
desire to challenge the independence of Canadian cultural 
corporations. By constantly confusing culture with propaganda, 
the government is trying to get involved in the content of the 
programs presented by the CBC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consequently, the Bloc Quebecois has some reservations about the 
second part of the motion, which reads: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—to meet its stated public service goals. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois is prepared to support a motion seeking to 
restore sufficient multi-year funding to the CBC to enable it to 
continue to present information and cultural programs while 
remaining fully independent of the federal government and 
political parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the Bloc Quebecois is opposed to the motion if 
restoring sufficient multi-year funding means that the 
corporation will have to serve the state and not the public, and 
that it will have to comply with government directives, submit 
its plans for government approval, or be accountable to the 
government and lose its independence with regard to the 
production of news casts or the content of its programming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before unconditionally supporting the motion, the Bloc Quebecois 
wants guarantees from the federal government that no federal 
cultural agency will be subjected to the directive released by 
the Treasury Board on March 26, 1998, demanding that such 
agencies display the Government of Canada logo. Everything must 
be done to ensure the independence of cultural institutions, and 
no measure that threatens that independence should be 
implemented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois is also demanding that all the provisions in 
Bill C-44 that have the effect of increasing the federal 
government's control over appointments in the cultural sector be 
eliminated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, since the Prime Minister himself, through his 
statements and actions, has questioned the CBC's independence, 
the Bloc Quebecois is asking him to formally recognize the 
corporation's editorial independence, for both its creative and 
information services. That statement should apply to all the 
members of his government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois is also asking the CBC's board of directors 
to make a public commitment to Canadian taxpayers that it will 
fight tooth and nail to protect the corporation's independence, 
and that it will inform the public of any attempt from any party 
to influence the corporation.

</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the minimal assurances the Bloc Quebecois feels the 
federal government owes Canadians and Quebeckers if the CBC is to 
keep its independence.  Without that independence, which has 
until now been a hallmark of the corporation's French and English 
networks, increased funding to the CBC would be seen by the 
public as nothing more than a boost to a federal government 
propaganda tool.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Price (Compton—Stanstead, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I am pleased to have this opportunity to rise before the House to 
address the motion put forward by the hon. member from Dartmouth, 
Nova Scotia.  Essentially it calls upon this government to 
restore adequate multi-year funding to the Canadian Broadcasting 
Corporation so it can fulfill the mandate that was entrusted to 
it by the Government of Canada so many years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the years the CBC has played an essential role in helping 
Canadians to develop a better understanding of themselves as a 
people, and of the different culture enclaves that together have 
helped make up this great country of ours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CBC was established on November 2, 1936 by an act of 
parliament.  This new agency succeeded the Canadian Radio 
Broadcasting Commission which was first created in 1932 to help 
regulate a still relatively new broadcasting industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian interest in broadcasting has existed since the 
beginning of this century.  In 1918 the first experimental 
broadcasting licence was issued to the Marconi Wireless Telegraph 
Company of Montreal by the department of naval service under the 
authority of the Radiotelegraph Act of 1913.  Two years later 
public broadcasting was well under way in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By 1928 the number of Canadians who had access to radio 
broadcasting had jumped to over 400,000 and already the alarm 
bells were ringing about the undue influence U.S. broadcasts were 
having on Canadian listeners.  Studies conducted back then 
indicated that Canadian listeners preferred U.S. broadcasting 
over Canadian broadcasting.  These findings were largely due to 
inadequate coverage provided by Canadian transmitters and a 
superior quality of programming being offered by the U.S. 
industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian government of the day under Progressive 
Conservative Prime Minister R.B. Bennett recognized the danger 
increased U.S. programming posed to our Canadian culture and 
immediately set out to find ways to help bolster our broadcasting 
industry.  The government was concerned that our culture would be 
engulfed by our powerful neighbours in the south and therefore it 
sought ways of maintaining and promoting our own distinct 
culture.  It had the fortitude and the insight to recognize that 
Canadian culture is something we should be proud of and that it 
is something worth preserving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1929 the Aird commission recommended that some form of public 
broadcaster be created, operated and controlled by Canadians so 
Canadians could be exposed to Canadian programs. Prime Minister 
R.B. Bennett appointed a parliamentary committee to further 
review the Aird commission's recommendations.  In 1932 the 
Canadian Radio Broadcasting Act became law creating the Canadian 
Radio Broadcasting Commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fortunately, the Reform Party was not in existence in the 1920s 
for I am certain it would have fought tooth and nail against the 
need for encouraging any Canadian broadcasting, particularly when 
our airwaves were already saturated with U.S. programming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the decision to create a Canadian Broadcasting 
Corporation has paid huge dividends over the years as Canadians 
from coast to coast have developed a better understanding and a 
greater appreciation for the different challenges facing 
Canadians across this great nation.  Over the years the CBC has 
been the vital link that has helped bond this country together in 
both good times and bad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no denying the fact that the CBC has helped shape the 
cultural fabric of this country.  Who can question the impact the 
great Foster Hewitt had on Canadian hockey and on Canadian 
nationalism?  Foster Hewitt's riveting broadcast of the 1972 
Canada-Russia series brought Canadians to their feet helping 
create a fervour for Canadian nationalism that had not been seen 
or felt in years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CBC has helped launch the careers of so many successful 
Canadian performers.  I think all maritimers in the late 1960s 
and early 1970s recognized the enormous talents of a wonderful 
singer from Springhill, Nova Scotia as she springboarded from 
CBC's Don Messer show to international stardom.  Obviously I am 
referring to the internationally renowned recording star Anne 
Murray, one of my personal favourites.

</I></B></P><P align=left>What would a Friday night have been without Canadians sitting 
around television sets watching Canada's longest running variety 
show with the host the great Mr. Tommy Hunter? I could go on with 
many others: <I>La Soirée canadienne</I>, <I>Hockey Night in 
Canada</I>, <I>Wayne and Shuster</I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think one can deny the importance the CBC has played in 
helping Canadian artists achieve their goals and success in both 
Canadian and international markets.  The CBC helped open the 
doors for today's performers who, if the Grammy awards are any 
indication, are making a lasting impression on audiences 
throughout the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no questioning the importance of the CBC to the 
promotion of Canadian culture.  Unfortunately over the past 
number of years the CBC has been victimized by substantial 
government cuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite Liberal promises in 1993 to provide stable multi-year 
financing for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, the CBC has 
instead witnessed this government cut its funding by $414 million 
between 1994-95 and 1997-98.  These drastic cuts have resulted in 
a reduction in services and permanent layoffs of thousands of 
employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These cuts were considered so drastic, even possibly threatening 
the future of the CBC, that its president, Anthony Manera, 
resigned in March 1995 in protest. This comes from a government 
that preaches the importance of protecting and promoting Canadian 
culture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In February 1997 the Canadian heritage minister attempted to 
deflect some of the criticism being levelled against her 
government over broken red book promises by announcing $10 
million for CBC Radio and stable funding for five years after 
1998. This stop-gap measure was widely criticized, as expressed 
in a February 12, 1997 article in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> which 
stated, “It's half baked and it's neither here nor there.  All 
it does is acknowledge that they made a mistake”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's broadcasting industry is in a state of flux.  Canadians 
can likely expect many changes in the upcoming years as the CRTC 
recently held public hearings to review such things as Canadian 
content criteria, new specialty TV services, a review of the 
policy on Canadian TV programming, and a review of Canada's radio 
policy, just to name a few. As well, for the first time in seven 
years the CRTC will completely review all of the CBC's licences. 
These reviews will undoubtedly result in changes in how Canada's 
broadcasters conduct their everyday business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CBC itself is in a state of transition.  CBC president Mr. 
Perrin Beatty has confirmed that he was not offered a second term 
by this Liberal government and that he will resign come October 
of this year. It has been widely rumoured that relations were 
strained between the corporation's chairperson and the president 
over their vision of the future role of the CBC in this 
ever-evolving technological world we live in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By offering the chairperson another five year appointment to the 
CBC board, it appears that her vision will likely prevail in 
years to come which would not appear to bode well for the 
existing structure of the CBC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CBC operates independently of government.  As such, the 
federal government has no legislative authority to intervene 
directly in the corporation's management of its resources and its 
operations.  However, if recent Liberal government actions are 
any indication, the CBC's independence will soon be brought into 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed changes contained within Bill C-44 that would have 
effectively changed how the CBC board members, including the 
president, are appointed from serving in good behaviour to 
serving at pleasure of the government were only withdrawn after 
public protest forced the government to withdraw these proposals. 
This subtle little change could have effectively compromised the 
integrity and independence of the CBC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is no secret that the Prime Minister maintains a personal 
dislike for the CBC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For these reasons it is important that all Canadians remain 
vigilant against further dismantling of a Canadian institution 
that has served the Canadian interests so well over these past 67 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Canada is to have an identity and a culture separate from 
that of our southern neighbours, it is crucial that the CBC 
network continue to exist and prosper so Canadians separated by 
distance can remain bonded through technology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to congratulate the member for Dartmouth for having put 
forth this motion that is obviously in defence of Canadian 
culture as well as the CBC.  I am not certain that it is the 
appropriate time to introduce such a motion.  It might be more 
prudent if we were to wait and see the direction the new CBC 
president will propose for our public broadcaster. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would also be beneficial if we had some indication from the 
CRTC as to changes in the rules and regulations broadcasters will 
be forced to abide by in the future.  Regardless of the decisions 
taken here today, it is vital that we maintain an effective 
Canadian public broadcaster so we can continue to promote 
Canadian culture and continue to deliver Canadian talent. 
Part of making this work would be for the government to sit down 
and put some serious offers on the table for the negotiations in 
the ongoing dispute.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mauril Bélanger (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am very happy to 
have an opportunity to address the motion and on the whole to 
congratulate the member for her continuing support of Canadian 
culture and Canadian industries.  To address the particular 
issue, I want to point out a few things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For several years now the Canadian government has recognized the 
importance of giving the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation the 
financial stability it needs to adequately fulfill its mandate as 
a public broadcaster.  It was with that objective in mind that 
two years ago the Minister of Canadian Heritage announced that 
the CBC would receive stable funding until 2003. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In recent years CBC endured budget cuts as part of Canada's 
joint efforts with everyone's shoulders to the wheel to 
rationalize public spending and essentially reverse the growth of 
continuing deficits and accumulated debt, which we have now 
achieved.  The efforts of all Canadians have borne fruit and the 
era of cuts to the CBC and other institutions of government, be 
they cultural or otherwise, are essentially over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On February 11, 1997 the Canadian government guaranteed the CBC 
stable funding for a period of five years beginning in 1998 as 
well as additional funds to ensure the survival and development 
Radio Canada International. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the dawn of the new millennium, which we all talk about 
regularly, Canadians can take pride in the achievement of their 
national public radio and television networks over the past 60 
years.  The CBC is the fruit of the combined efforts of many 
individuals from all backgrounds over the decades. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CBC is one of the pillars of our broadcasting system.  Like 
other members of the industry, CBC is trying to adapt to the 
evolution of the constantly changing universe and to diversify 
its services in order to allow its audience to benefit from the 
never ending technological improvements being made in this field, 
such as the Internet, and digital radio and digital television 
which are looming on the horizon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CBC occupies a central position in the Canadian audio-visual 
landscape.  The government gave it a major social, economic and 
cultural role and enshrined its mandate in the Broadcasting Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CBC must offer radio and television services that provide 
predominantly and distinctly Canadian programming that informs, 
enlightens, entertains and reflects Canada and its regions.  At 
the same time the CBC's programming must actively contribute to 
the flow and exchange of cultural expression in French and in 
English, contribute in shared national consciousness and identity 
and reflect the multicultural and multiracial nature of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an ambitious mandate.  That makes it all the more 
stimulating to fulfill it.  The CBC has been meeting that 
challenge with enthusiasm since its creation.  Over the years the 
CBC has become a household word and remains an integral part of 
Canadians' everyday lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With its funding assured, the CBC met the government's 
expectations by announcing in its business plan, the one it 
prepared in 1998, a new action strategy that is firmly focused on 
the future and on Canadian programming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CBC has identified a series of objectives designed to 
reaffirm its mandate as a national public network.  It intends to 
be the Canadian broadcaster.  More than ever, CBC's programming 
will be Canadian and will reflect the taste and interests of 
Canadians.  The CBC will continue to treat its audiences as 
citizens of Canada and not simply as consumers of the service. 
Decisions about what programs to present will be based first and 
foremost on a desire to serve the CBC's audience, not dictated by 
commercial considerations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CBC is committed to continuing to participate actively in 
broadcasting amateur sports which contribute to the richness of 
our cultural heritage and to the health of the Canadians who 
practise them.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This autumn the minister told the chair of the Canadian 
television fund that she wanted the distribution rules for the 
fund amended to put the CBC on the same footing as other 
broadcasters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Beginning next spring, the CBC will no longer have a reserve 
envelope for access to the fund.  As before the CBC will have 
access to the fund through the independent producers whose 
productions it broadcasts.  The minister's request does not limit 
that access or call it into question.  However, eliminating the 
envelope that gave it privileged access will create a new balance 
among Canadian producers and broadcasters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian production has made great strides since the fund was 
created three years ago.  There are more Canadian stories on 
television and movie screens than ever before.  It is no longer 
necessary to give the CBC special treatment in the distribution 
of the fund.  From now on each production's access to the fund 
will be determined strictly on the basis of its intrinsic 
qualities.  That means the productions broadcast by the CBC will 
continue to be subsidized by the fund in so far as they 
demonstrate they possess the necessary qualities to qualify.  We 
are confident the CBC will be able to perform in this very 
competitive environment. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister also wants to ensure that the CBC, and private 
broadcasters, contribute in a fair and equitable manner to the 
development and distribution of Canadian cinema.  If the past is 
anything to go by, we are convinced that the CBC will continue 
to stand out as a broadcaster of high-quality Canadian 
programming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This change will not affect the stability of the CBC's funding, 
which, let me reiterate, is stable until 2003. 
We are confident that this stability will allow the CBC to 
continue to fulfil its mandate and to move ahead in this 
universe of technology and new services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the issue raised in the motion has already been 
addressed.  The Canadian government reaffirms its commitment to 
the national public network which, since its creation, has gone 
from strength to strength and confirmed how relevant it still is 
to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The service offered by the CBC is one of the best in the world. 
The CBC's broadcasts let Canadians keep in touch and communicate 
with each other, from sea to sea; and the CBC remains an 
essential partner in the creation of harmonious social and 
cultural bonds among Canadians.  The CBC is part of the family, 
and the Canadian government is continuing to help it in its 
mission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I remind everyone that the CRTC is preparing to 
conduct a cross-Canada consultation on the CBC's mandate, in 
addition to holding hearings, in May, on the renewal of the 
corporation's licences.  These two events are public and open to 
all Canadians across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hope that all those who 
want to share their satisfaction with or concerns about the CBC 
will take the opportunity to express themselves to the 
Commission and share their vision of the CBC's future on the eve 
of the new millennium.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak briefly to Motion No. 432.  The bill, in its 
present form, would help to redress the problems we see every day 
in the delivery of broadcasting by the Canadian Broadcasting 
Corporation.  The corporation under the government opposite has 
no money.  It has basically no vision of where it is going and 
the board of directors is full of Liberal Party hacks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member opposite in his speech would have us believe that 
there is absolutely nothing wrong with the CBC, ignoring the fact 
that currently 2,000 employees are walking the picket lines, some 
of them within a stone's throw of the House of Commons today. The 
member opposite said about the reduction in funding that “the 
deficit made us do it”.  That is their standard refrain on just 
about everything these days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find interesting another refrain we hear all the time from 
government members.  They talk about globalization, how Canada 
has to be competitive, and how we have to be aware of what is 
happening around the world. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1150"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, in the last 10 days or so, the Canadian 
Broadcasting Corporation has announced that three foreign CBC 
bureaus around the world would be cut and the broadcasters 
reassigned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of those bureaus is in Mexico City.   As we go forward as a 
country on the free trade agreement of the Americas it would be 
extremely important in the future of North and South America. 
Joan Leishman, the CBC first-rate broadcaster working out of 
Mexico City, and her crew are one of the three groups that will 
be reassigned and the bureau closed.  It is particularly painful 
and very difficult for the government to square that circle on 
globalization but cut foreign CBC bureaus at the same time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another point I would raise is the whole business of the CBC 
having been told by the Canadian government that it has to 
display Canada's logo.  As a noted TV broadcast journalist has 
said, this is a role that is common in countries where TV and 
radio act as government mouthpieces.  It is absolutely outrageous 
that the Canada logo should be included on our television sets. 
It is a very worrisome trend that the government seems to want to 
perpetuate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In view of the absence of money and vision, the make-up of the 
board, the whole question of globalization on the one hand and on 
the other related to the broadcasters, as well as the logo, the 
motion would go a long way to correcting all the initiatives the 
government is taking. 
<P><A NAME="LINK10"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I was not 
intending to speak this morning but on listening to the debate I 
found it interesting and realized I have a few ideas members of 
the House and perhaps some of the people out there who pay the 
bills would be interested in hearing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I acknowledge publicly and proudly that I have received a few 
letters and a few phone calls, not many, which say “please 
support the CBC.  We like it and we do not want it to be 
diminished or abolished”.  I put that fact on the record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On balance I should also say that I have a greater number of 
communications from people in my riding who are asking me to 
seriously consider letting CBC stand on its own legs and stop 
propping it up with taxpayers dollars.  We have both sides in the 
riding where I am from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who of us does not appreciate the CBC?  I remember for many 
years listening to programs like the <I>Royal Canadian 
Airfarce</I> and enjoying the humour.  I suppose those of us in 
the House have all been the subject of their ribbing humour.  We 
enjoy it even when they poke fun at us because its usually very 
humorous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember way back I used to almost religiously listen to 
<I>Double Exposure</I> on CBC Radio because again it was very 
funny, entertaining, and yet made a social comment. If I were 
asked if this defines what it means to be a Canadian, I would 
humbly submit that being a Canadian is much more than that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also think of a program like <I>Cross Country Checkup</I> on 
Sunday afternoons, with Rex Murphy; I hardly ever miss it.  What 
a great venue it is to bring Canadians together.  People can 
phone in from coast to coast.  I do not know exactly how rigorous 
their screening process is, but it gives Canadians an opportunity 
to express their points of view and it gives all of us across the 
country an opportunity to hear those points of view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are very good points, but the question here is with 
respect to funding.  My constituents are telling me very strongly 
that we ought to be supporting those things that Canadians 
support.  We believe the marketplace is what can do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember a number of years ago when one local magazine, whose 
name I do not want to give, published a very demeaning article 
about the daughter of the prime minister of the day. 
I did not read the article but I heard about it.  I said I would 
never give that magazine a nickel because of what it did.  I have 
the right to do that.  I have kept that promise with one 
exception.  On one occasion there was a very funny article.  I do 
not believe in breaking copyright rules, so instead of making a 
photocopy of the article I in fact bought one issue of that 
magazine.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When the CBC or other broadcasters come up with things that we 
do not like, we have the right as citizens to boycott the product 
that is sponsoring the program or in other ways to exert pressure 
by saying we do not approve of what is happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the most obscene things I ever heard was on CBC Radio. It 
was totally demeaning to women.  It was an outrage. This was 
before I was a member of parliament.  I asked what I could do and 
there was nothing.  They tax me.  They give the money to CBC. 
They fund this stuff.  They have the right to crank it out. There 
is no way that we can control it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree the government ought not to be controlling broadcasting. 
They need to be kept at arm's length, but if they are at arm's 
length to whom will they be answerable and where is the final 
accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member proposing the motion has five minutes to speak and I 
would like to concede the floor at this stage.  Let us carefully 
consider the funding of the CBC and the accountability of what is 
broadcast. 
<P><A NAME="LINK11"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
appreciated the comments of my colleagues around the Chamber.  In 
terms of the member across the floor, I had hoped Liberal 
governments would drop the rhetoric about stable funding for the 
CBC and actually in the cold light of day look at what they have 
wrought in the public broadcasting situation.  However, that will 
not happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to make some comments which I think are real 
wake-up calls for me.  I was on the heritage committee tour 
across the country last week talking to people about what they 
want in a cultural policy.  Over and over again we heard about 
the importance of a public broadcaster.  More than that, we heard 
terrible concerns about the fact that we are living very much in 
an occupied country in that our culture is occupied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Jack Stoddart, a respected publisher in the country, says that 
we are at war with another culture, the American culture.  One of 
our main defences is institutions such as the public broadcaster, 
our magazine industry, our publishing industry and the Canada 
Council.  They are the bulwarks for our defence against an 
unending swamp of American products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The idea of having a strong public broadcaster is as critical at 
this point as ever before.  We are also facing enormous media 
concentration.  We are facing foreign ownerships in all these 
areas.  The issue is keeping a strong public broadcaster, funding 
it sufficiently so that it is not constantly making deals with 
the devil or is not constantly trying to cut here and alter there 
and drop services in order to balance its ever shrinking budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things my colleague from Yukon just told me was quite 
astounding but also played into the issue of globalization. We 
are saying we are out in the world.  We are dealing and marketing 
ourselves all over the place.  Yet for some reason we decide not 
to have journalists in some major centres of the world, one of 
them being Mexico with which we are inextricably connected by a 
trade agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Paris and South Africa are places where we need Canadian eyes 
and voices and Canadian values looking at what is going on. We do 
not need just CNN feeds.  We do not need to hear another 
country's particular take on issues.  We need to know what we 
think.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>REPORT STAGE 
</H4><P align=left>

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from February 1 consideration of Bill C-49, an 
act providing for the ratification and the bringing into effect 
of the framework agreement on first nation land management, as 
reported (with amendment) from the committee; and of Motions Nos. 
1, 6 and 7. 
<P><A NAME="LINK18"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to be speaking to the report stage of Bill C-49.  The 
vote just taken shows that the opposition is united in opposing 
this frequent abuse of democracy in invoking time allocation.  I 
think this is the 48th time this has been done since the Liberals 
came to power.  This bill is certainly far too important to 
succumb to that type of action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For many years big power has been wielded by Ottawa with respect 
to first nations, with a little power being wielded by the band 
leadership and no power at all devolving to the rank and file 
natives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the passage of this bill we see Ottawa's power being 
devolved somewhat, the bands have increased some power and it 
turns out that rank and file natives still do not have any power. 
This parliament also seems powerless to do anything about this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-49 purports to devolve municipal type powers to bands and 
it does allow some local decision making.  It removes judicial 
protection from bands.  People pursuing legal revenues will at 
least have to fight the band and not Ottawa.  These are some 
positive things that we have seen in this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, when we were in committee we heard concerns from 
lessees and women's groups who were concerned about their rights 
under this legislation.  We did hear that the minister had 
launched a fact finding process into property disposition on 
reserve when marriages break down, and we welcome that 
initiative.  We urge the minister to make this a priority, make 
the results public and to act on any recommendations that may 
arise from this initiative. 
We want to see involvement by national and provincial native 
women's groups in the consulting process.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois has independently introduced an amendment 
which will be the next amendment discussed under this fast track 
process that has just been initiated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had a major concern addressed during committee stage 
hearings.  The proposed legislation may fall under section 35 of 
the Constitution and we are grateful that the act now contains a 
proviso that it will not qualify as a land claim. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We noted this deficiency.  We proposed the amendment and it is 
now included in the bill.  Support for the amendment was sought 
and obtained and it is now included.  This required the support 
of the chiefs, their advisers and all party support in committee. 
We appreciate the fact that there was no opposition to it.  It 
was hard for those people to support the amendment and credit is 
due to those who worked to bring it about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had a discussion with the chief of the Muskoday reserve which 
is in my riding near the city of Prince Albert.  I would like to 
point out that 101 women on the reserve signed a letter which 
would not qualify as a petition in this House but I indicated 
I would speak about it while I am speaking to Bill C-49. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The letter's main features are that the women want this House to 
know that B.C. native women do not speak for them regardless of 
the merit of their case.  They are not in favour of the attempted 
injunction by that group.  They are in support of Bill C-49 and 
feel that matrimonial lands and property questions were addressed 
in their land code.  I would say this has more to do with the 
good relations that exist on that reserve than any benefits 
contained in the land code itself. The women of the reserve and 
the council seem to have a good accord with one another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately this is not always the case on every reserve and 
the Bloc amendment is set to address that concern.  The Reform 
Party will continue to be the voice of those who have no voice in 
Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since those goods times of committee, events have overtaken the 
bill.  The Muskoday reserve situation in B.C. has raised serious 
concern over the lack of consultation on reserves and communities 
and with those who reside in them.  The municipalities in the 
Vancouver area are concerned there is no formal consultation 
clause in the bill.  That means development can take place 
without adequate consultation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prior to becoming a member of parliament, I was a Saskatchewan 
land surveyor and as a land surveyor I know the importance of 
well defined property lines in never mind ameliorating a dispute 
but avoiding disputes.  This bill does not define the limits 
between municipalities surrounding a reserve and the reserves 
themselves.  What will happen, and we are quite positive of this, 
is this will lead to no end of difficulties between reserves and 
the surrounding municipalities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When one looks at the Musqueam situation it would never have 
arisen had it been a requirement to consult on a regular basis 
instead of everybody encamping and holding firm to the fortress 
of their position without ever hearing what the other side's 
concerns were.  I believe that had that been put in place at the 
time the agreements and leases were signed, we would not see the 
difficulties we see today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We look at what the government is up against in having forced 
this legislation through. Two hundred and thirty people signed a 
petition from the Squamish band alone.  They are opposed to the 
legislation.  Why did the government impose time allocation 
knowing about the 230 people from just one reserve that requires 
really only 12.5% of the members of the reserve to approve a land 
code? 
A federal court case has been filed by the B.C. native women's 
society demanding amendments.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I appreciate that the minister will be looking into it, 
what will happen when the court case proceeds and if the 
government is found wanting? There have been warnings from B.C. 
mayors that the bill could create planning chaos. Anyone who 
knows anything about the planning process knows that one tries to 
get wide consultation and agreement on plans prior to their 
implementation.  There are sewers, water, roads, telephones, 
power lines, gas lines and all kinds of infrastructure that will 
not be prepared or that will be ill placed as a result of 
development that does not proceed hand in hand with wide open 
consultation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To say that the goodwill of people is all that is required is 
somewhat naive.  Everywhere we go there is legislation to govern 
relations between people.  This bill has not provided that.  We 
can see that in the type of opposition that is coming from it, 
real estate agents from Vancouver and area, non-native residents 
on reserve.  The legislation makes homes owned by non-natives on 
Indian lands unmarketable.  They cannot get rid of them.  Why? 
There was no agreement which allowed prices to rise with the 
market and all of a sudden they have a huge adjustment and no one 
can move on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government says there is no interest on the part of Reform 
in any constructive change to the legislation at this point. I 
beg to disagree.  The amendment we are proposing calls on the 
government to consult and the bands to consult even prior to 
developing with an ongoing consultation which has to occur so 
that we can know what the limits of development are.  It is a 
very important amendment.  It is not one that was lightly put 
forward by the opposition.   We take it very seriously and we 
will continue to bring these points forth as the bill proceeds.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Harvard (Charleswood St. James—Assiniboia, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to speak in support of Bill 
C-49, the first nations land management act.  In particular, I 
would like to address Motion No. 6, the amendment proposed by the 
hon. member for Skeena. This amendment would require the 14 first 
nations signatories to consult with their neighbouring 
jurisdictions on their land codes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Neighbouring municipalities would not be consulted when the land 
codes are developed by the first nations. For one, neighbouring 
jurisdictions have not been defined.  We would have to define and 
limit who is included in neighbouring jurisdictions which would 
create an unworkable consultation requirement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More important, these land codes are beyond the jurisdiction of 
neighbouring jurisdictions.  Why should municipalities have the 
right to review what is the internal working document of a first 
nation?  Would we expect any municipality to accept such a 
paternalistic system?  Of course not. Therefore this proposed 
amendment from the opposition suggests it believes that first 
nations cannot be trusted, that they must be held to a higher 
standard than other communities in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not the first time the opposition has suggested during 
debate of this bill that first nations need to be subject to a 
different set rules from other Canadian jurisdictions.  This is 
not the first time the opposition has said that the 14 
signatories to this bill cannot be entrusted with powers of 
governance. In particular, the opposition has voiced exaggerated 
claims regarding the powers of the 14 signatories to expropriate 
reserve lands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the course of second reading and again in committee questions 
arose about the ability of first nations to expropriate any 
existing interest in their reserve lands with the recourse 
available to individuals whose interests are being expropriated.

<A HREF="#LINKT17"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently the Indian Act gives authority to the Minister of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development to expropriate reserve 
land for the first nation's benefit under section 18 for the 
general welfare of the band.  The bill before us delegates 
similar expropriation powers to the signatory first nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would emphasize that expropriation powers are an essential 
power of governance and are a necessary facet of land management. 
As such, these powers have been provided for in Bill C-49.  The 
power of expropriation being delegated to the signatory first 
nations is similar—and I emphasize similar—to the expropriation 
power that is delegated by the provinces to ministers, to 
municipalities or to boards of school trustees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to emphasize that the expropriation power 
provided for in this bill is not mandatory.  Each first nation 
community will decide whether or not this power will be an 
element of the first nation's land management powers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of the Chippewas of Georgina Island the Mississaugas 
of Scugog Island, these communities have both decided not to 
exercise their expropriation powers in their land codes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Muskoday First Nation has chosen to implement expropriation 
powers and has addressed the issue in accordance with the 
framework agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a first nation chooses to implement the power of 
expropriation it must do so through its community developed land 
code.  The land code sets out the specifics of the new land 
management regime for each first nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The land code includes basic laws that will govern land and 
interests in land and resources after the land provisions of the 
Indian Act are withdrawn from the community.  It will also 
include the rules and procedures that will apply to the use and 
occupancy of first nation land and to the transfer by 
testamentary disposition or succession of any interest in the 
land.  As well, it will include provisions related to first 
nation lawmaking, land exchange procedures, conflicts of 
interest, dispute resolution, procedures for amending the land 
code and expropriation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, the responsibility and procedure for 
expropriation is being removed from the minister and placed, 
along with other aspects of land management, in the hands of the 
communities where they belong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A first nation with a land code in effect has the right to 
expropriate interest in first nation lands without consent if 
deemed by the first nation council to be necessary for community 
works or other first nation purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In exercising any power of expropriation the first nation must 
meet the test of community purpose.  A first nation with a land 
code in effect has the right to expropriate interest in first 
nation lands without consent only if it is deemed by the first 
nation council to be necessary for community works such as roads, 
water, sewer treatment facilities and hydro transmissions or 
other first nation purposes such as hospitals, day care centres, 
fire halls, schools and health centres.  This does not allow for 
arbitrary expropriation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First nations must justify any expropriation, just as provincial 
and municipal governments must.  Further, any expropriation must 
be justifiable before the courts and Canadian jurisprudence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before us requires that in exercising these powers 
first nations provide fair compensation based on the rules set 
out in the Expropriation Act.  This act provides that 
compensation is based on fair market value and that this value 
will be determined based on the value of the interest prior to 
the knowledge or expectation of expropriation.  In other words, 
an expected expropriation will have neither positive nor negative 
effects on fair market value.  Alternative dispute resolution 
mechanisms are available to those persons who want to challenge 
the rationale for first nations expropriation.  The court is also 
available for the same kind of challenge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to repeat that the power of expropriation that is being 
delegated to the signatory first nations is no different from the 
expropriation power of federal and provincial governments and 
public and private organizations such as municipalities, school 
boards, universities and hospitals. 
Canadians know that this power is invoked in the interest of the 
community.  They know that those who have property expropriated 
will be compensated.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The expropriation regime for first nations is different in that 
the community is consulted extensively during the development of 
the rules and procedures that will be applied for the 
expropriation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under this bill and the framework agreement a first nation 
wishing to implement expropriation powers will have to develop 
the specifics of their powers in consultation with the community 
and then seek the community's approval of the proposed powers in 
a community-wide vote.  The powers are not automatically in 
place.  This approval process is by far the most stringent 
approval process in Canada respecting the development of 
governance, expropriation powers and land codes.  It allows every 
member of the participating first nations a voice in deciding if 
a proposed land code meets with the values of their individual 
communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind all members that the first nations communities 
themselves will decide in their land code whether they will 
exercise the power to expropriate and how it will be exercised. 
As stated earlier, we have already seen some cases, namely the 
Chippewas of Georgina Island and the Mississaugas of Scugog 
Island, where first nations have decided not to implement 
expropriation provisions in their land codes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I emphasize that both the first nations and Canada have ensured 
that the framework agreement and this legislation provide for the 
protection of third party interests.  Both stipulate that any 
existing third party interests will continue in force according 
to their terms and conditions.  As is the case now, upon 
expropriation of the existing terms and conditions, the 
disposition of those interests will be subject to negotiations 
between the first nations and the third party.  However, third 
party interests will not be exempted from expropriation. 
Everyone in Canada is subject to the power of expropriation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge the House to support Bill C-49. 
<P><A NAME="LINK20"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, it is a little difficult to address this issue with 
members opposite after listening to the speech that was just 
given.  One wonders in this country why we talk about western 
alienation. I do not think that many members opposite have much 
of an understanding of exactly what the problem is.  It is 
interesting that when they do not understand the problem they 
seem to say that Reformers are wrong or that Reformers did it for 
some terrible reason and that they are opposed to this.  That is 
not the case and in the next few minutes I will show the House 
why I believe that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A short time ago we all witnessed time allocation for the 48th 
time in the last two sessions of this House.  Time allocation is 
basically when the government says that it will limit debate on a 
bill because it does not see it as being important enough to 
debate.  Or the government may feel that the bill may be too hot 
to handle and will impose time allocation limits on the debate so 
the folks out there do not really catch on to what is happening. 
Today we had another time allocation vote, which of course the 
majority government won.  That happened after one day of debate 
on this issue in the House of Commons.  Just one day.  That is a 
shame.  It is really despicable, but again what do we do with a 
majority government?  One day we hope to change that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Members opposite do not like to hear 
that, but we are going to change it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the event that those long lost people on the other side do 
not think others agree with us, I will read from a letter given 
to me by the leader of the official opposition in British 
Columbia, Gordon Campbell, who will no doubt be the premier of 
that province after the next election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  He is endorsing the Liberal Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  They say that I am endorsing the Liberal 
Party.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This person is going to be the next premier of that province. 
If they do not want to listen to us on that side, maybe they 
should listen to somebody who has a deep concern about this bill. 
I want to read the letter into the record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The letter is to the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dear Minister, 
</UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am writing to express my concerns about Bill C-49, the First 
Nations Land Management Act, which federal Opposition members 
have rightly argued must be addressed through corrective 
amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, there appears to be no guarantee that women will have 
equal protection of property rights as men under the rules 
governing the breakdown of marriages.  Under section 17, First 
Nations will have the ability to establish “general rules and 
procedures, in cases of breakdown of marriage, respecting the 
use, occupation and possession of First Nation land and the 
division of interests in First Nation land”. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members opposite say that this is wrong, but we on this side, 
along with Gordon Campbell from British Columbia, speak from a 
bit of knowledge and not from the notes the minister gave these 
people to read when they walked in here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The letter goes on to state: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As you know, some aboriginal women have alleged that women living 
on reserve have not always been treated fairly by band councils 
when marriages fail.  They maintain that men have sometimes been 
granted preferential treatment with regard to housing issues, 
because property division laws that protect other Canadians do 
not apply on reserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Act should specifically stipulate that the land codes 
authorizing the new rules governing property rights will accord 
equal treatment to both sexes, in keeping with property division 
laws of general application.  There should be no possibility that 
the rules established by First Nations will allow for any 
potential discrimination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the Act must be amended to ensure that the expropriation 
powers granted to First Nations under section 28 cannot be 
abused.  In view of the recent controversy on the Musqueam 
reserve, it is understandable that some non-native leaseholders 
are very worried about how First Nations might be able to use 
their expropriation powers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand you have said that you will only approve land codes 
that ensure expropriation powers cannot be abused.  With respect, 
that assurance offers little comfort. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will re-read that: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect, that assurance offers little comfort.  I trust you 
are sincere, but the fact remains, leaseholders will not have any 
real protection from expropriation under the Act.  And past 
experience suggests that it is not good enough to rely on 
Ministerial discretion in protecting property rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was given similar assurances by former Minister Tom Siddon 
that Musqueam leaseholders' rights and interests would be fully 
protected before he would sign off on the transfer of authority 
over those leases to the band.  That commitment was not honoured. 
The Musqueam band is now using their unchecked authority to 
extract unconscionable lease and tax hikes from those residents, 
while your government has sat idly by and done nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I note that Bill C-49 includes a number of sections that will 
guarantee First Nations' land cannot be expropriated by the 
Government of Canada without a rigorous justification and appeal 
process.  That same level of protection should be extended to all 
leaseholders living on the reserves in question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the Act should be amended to ensure that neighbouring 
municipalities are adequately consulted by First Nations in the 
development of their land codes.  There appears to be no 
assurance in Bill C-49 that the communities adjacent to reserves 
will have a right to be consulted, despite the fact that they 
will be heavily impacted by the First Nations' land codes.  That 
is simply unacceptable and must be corrected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge you to give careful consideration to the amendments 
proposed by the federal Reform Party and others, to correct the 
flaws in Bill C-49. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That letter comes from Mr. Gordon Campbell, the leader of the 
opposition and the person whom we hope will soon be premier of 
British Columbia.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>All I hear in response from the group over there is that it is 
not true, that that is not the way it happens, that it cannot be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the NDP are panicking because we want them out of 
office in British Columbia.  Imagine. They were in twice too many 
times.  That is why they are always a minority in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we have it.  A few Liberals in the House are trying to make 
like they know what they are talking about.  British Columbians, 
not just the Reform Party but people from all walks of life are 
saying there are problems in the bill, but the Liberals do not 
listen. I guess that is what we have come to know in western 
Canada as western alienation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand the Liberals have a 10 or 12 member committee going 
to western Canada to find out what is alienating us.  It is this 
kind of attitude, this kind of atmosphere in the House of Commons 
by this government toward the west that creates western 
alienation.  The Liberals say that it is nonsense and rubbish, 
but they have just a few seats in British Columbia because we are 
sick and tired of the Liberal government telling us the way it is 
going to be in our province without listening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister comes into the House with this bill.  The Liberals 
slap it on the table saying that we are going to have to live 
with it because the government is going to use time allocation 
and it is going to short everybody on the issues in British 
Columbia.  Is it any wonder that British Columbians will never 
ever again elect Liberals the way they elect Reformers.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to respond to Motion No. 7, the amendment 
to Bill C-49 proposed by the hon. member for Skeena. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This amendment would delete the names of the 14 first nations 
from the schedule and in effect would make it an empty schedule. 
We will not be supporting this motion.  It is absolutely 
necessary that the schedule identify the 14 participating first 
nations.  If they are deleted from the schedule, no first nations 
can opt in, rendering the act inoperable. The proposed amendment 
suggests that the first nations can opt in through section 45 of 
the act but section 45 does not come into force until four or 
five years after the first nation has opted in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure hon. members will share my disbelief over the logic of 
this proposed amendment.  This is not useful or even workable as 
an amendment.  It does not improve the bill.  In fact it would 
only serve to change the commitments made in the framework 
agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to take a moment to remind hon. members why this bill is 
being enacted and why it is a positive piece of legislation for 
first nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new land management regime outlined in the framework 
agreement empowers participating first nations to opt out of the 
land management sections of the Indian Act and establish their 
own legal regime to manage their own lands and resources.  This 
bill will facilitate the exercise of first nations government as 
far as lands and resources are concerned.  It gives the 14 first 
nations the authority to pass laws for the development, 
conservation, protection, management, use and possession of their 
lands.  The crown continues to hold the title to the lands but 
the jurisdiction and authority to manage that land will now lie 
with the communities themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first nations will no longer need to get approval from the 
Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development to promote 
economic development on their own lands.  This bill is an 
innovative way to establish an alternative land management regime 
to give 14 first nations control over their lands and natural 
resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As stated at the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs and 
Northern Development, this bill is about first nations 
accountability, capacity building and economic development. 
Most important, this bill is part of a first nations community 
driven process that culminates here in the House of Commons.

<A HREF="#LINKT21"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill does not create a third order of government.  The 
framework agreement that it puts into effect gives first nations 
the powers, rights and privileges of a landowner.  I am sure no 
members in the House would tolerate in their own lives and 
businesses the kind of red tape the Indian Act imposes upon 
aboriginal land management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The framework agreement will get these 14 first nations out from 
under these provisions.  It will give them a new degree of 
flexibility.  They will be able to get on with the task of 
building the economy in their communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The framework agreement provides first nations with greater 
control over their future.  They will have greater autonomy and 
control over land and revenues in their area.  The new land 
regime does not fundamentally alter the crown's fiduciary 
relationship with the first nations.  However, when first nations 
exercise their new authority, the crown's fiduciary obligations 
respecting those new authorities will diminish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill establishes a framework for accountability.  The 14 
first nations will establish a framework that defines 
accountability both toward the government and toward their 
communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to thank the hon. member for South Shore in particular 
for his remarks at second reading about the accountability 
provisions of this legislation.  I fully agree with him when he 
said that this is a very positive piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following the extensive debate this bill received at second 
reading, it was brought before the Standing Committee on 
Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development where it received 
support from many witnesses from the first nations communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee also received correspondence from Phil Fontaine, 
the national chief of the Assembly of First Nations.  Mr. 
Fontaine described this bill as unique and an important first 
step, but he also pointed out that this legislation will not 
initiate or impose change. I am quoting when I say “the act 
merely provides the opportunity for these 14 first nations 
communities to initiate change at the pace and in the direction 
established by their community”.  That is important to note. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the issues raised in committee was the question of 
matrimonial property.  I remind the House that the government has 
taken this issue very seriously.  That is why the department has 
called a second meeting with aboriginal organizations to work in 
partnership to identify an individual who will conduct an 
independent fact finding process to investigate the issue of 
matrimonial property as it relates to reserve lands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is a broader context in which this bill should be 
placed, it should be seen as part of the government's agenda to 
respond to longstanding issues that have held back aboriginal 
communities for generations, issues raised in the Royal 
Commission on Aboriginal Peoples.  These are the issues that the 
government addressed nearly a year ago when it tabled its 
aboriginal action plan, Gathering Strength. The action plan has 
four objectives.  Each of them has a bearing on the bill before 
us. The four objectives are:  renewing partnerships; 
strengthening aboriginal governance; developing a new fiscal 
relationship; and supporting strong communities, peoples and 
economies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The framework agreement and this bill to implement it provide 
renewed partnerships and through new co-operative relationships 
with other levels of government and the private sector, the first 
objective. They help create new governance mechanisms through 
increased lawmaking powers and accountability, the second 
objective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact the framework agreement provides opportunities to help 
build the capacity of first nations communities for 
self-government.  It gives an opportunity for first nations 
peoples to demonstrate that they have the skills and knowledge 
required for accountable, democratic and efficient government 
structures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These first nations will develop their own source of revenue and 
those who manage the process will remain accountable to the 
community for their actions.  This relates to the third objective 
of Gathering Strength which is to develop a new fiscal 
relationship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Control over lands and resources provides a foundation for 
stronger communities based on healthy economies.  That is the 
fourth objective of Gathering Strength. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Land and resources provide opportunities for first nations. All 
too often these opportunities have not been tapped because first 
nations are hamstrung by the provisions of the Indian Act 
concerning land and resources.  Local control over reserve lands 
will mean that first nations will be able to take advantage of 
economic development opportunities, and well that should be.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The benefits will also spread to neighbouring communities that 
will prosper from economic development spinoffs.  We will see an 
end to the situation where transactions that off reserve might 
take a matter of weeks can go on for months when they involve 
first nations land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>New partnerships will be forged between the first nations and 
surrounding communities.  That too is important to note and is 
worthy of our support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should add that the consultations on the development of this 
legislation have been ongoing since 1996.  Canada has met with 
all affected provinces as well as other stakeholder groups such 
as the Union of British Columbia Municipalities and the Ontario 
Association of Cottage Owners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The framework agreement that this bill provides is a win-win-win 
situation.  The first nations communities win; they obtain the 
flexibility they need to build their economies.  The government 
wins because the bill reduces the minister's day to day 
involvement in the routine decisions of land management and it 
meets the government's objectives of helping to build the 
capacity for self-government in first nations.  The local 
non-aboriginal communities also win as the first nations begin to 
generate jobs and economic growth on Indian land, thereby 
contributing to the broader economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank all hon. members for providing lively discussion and 
understanding and I ask them to join me in supporting this very 
worthwhile bill. 
<P><A NAME="LINK22"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I stand here to speak on behalf of the aboriginal people in my 
community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very interesting that in the Vancouver <I>Sun</I> this 
weekend a person by the name of Kelly Acton quoted as being a 
spokeswoman for the Indian affairs minister said, “The minister 
believes concerns about the legislation were met when it was 
being studied by the Commons Indian affairs committee at which 
time the government accepted one amendment from Reform”.  She 
suggested that recent attacks on the legislation by Reform Party 
members were insincere. I say to Kelly Acton, if that is the kind 
of advice she is offering to the Indian affairs minister, no 
wonder the Indian affairs minister is so mixed up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have in hand just three of many letters my office has received 
from grassroots aboriginal people.  I want to read them into the 
record.  I know they are watching this on CPAC as we speak.  They 
want their voices heard in this House.  We know this government 
does not want their voices heard in this House because it keeps 
coming in with closure and stifling debate. For the 48th time it 
has stopped debate in this House.  It does not want their voices 
in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am taking the next couple of minutes to give these people a 
voice in this Chamber, not that I expect the Liberals to listen 
but at least they will have had their say.  The people of Canada 
will also know that there is a bankruptcy on the part of the 
Indian affairs minister in the way this legislation is being 
brought forth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first letter, dated February 11, to myself is from Jeannette 
George from the Lower Kootenay Indian Band.  She says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very concerned about Bill C-49 and what I've just read on 
its powers over ownership, management and expropriation of band 
lands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know, who is going to protect us when we speak 
out against our chief or council?  Are we going to be kicked off 
the reserve for speaking our minds?  This is already happening 
right now on this reserve because a person brought up issues on 
housing and land and how they were being handled here. They gave 
her two weeks for her and her young children to get off the 
reserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I myself had my three children taken away because I tried to find 
out what was going on with the housing here and why we had to pay 
such high rent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that this band is already doing what is being 
talked about in Bill C-49.  This really concerns me when I think 
about the land and the money that will be coming to the band 
after the land claims are settled.  I am worried that most of the 
families here will be no better off and everything will end up 
going to certain families only.  I ask you to think about the 
rest of us when you are deciding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>P.S.—I just watched the Prime Minister on TV talking about the 
homeless in this country.  If this bill passes we too might be 
the next homeless. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know this woman.  She speaks from experience.  She speaks from 
a position of having challenged the chief and council and having 
had her family taken away from her for doing so.  It was only 
through the intervention of B.C. social services that she got her 
children back.  That is what this government is putting this 
person through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This letter is from Sharon Willicome, also from the Lower 
Kootenay Indian Band: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thank you for this opportunity to comment on the proposed Bill 
C-49 and thank you for bringing this issue to my attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These comments will be brief but are sincere and based upon 
personal experiences therefore should justify some consideration 
during the debate on this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, it is mind boggling to think a piece of legislation is 
being proposed and in its third reading where such a tremendous 
lack of public information and public input exist.  This matter 
seems to exist within a vacuum of informed public input while 
surrounded by the cloud of treaty negotiations and settlements. 
Are they not of equal importance and value for to have such 
significant impact on native communities impacts on non-native 
equally as well? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, based upon recent personal experiences with abuses of a 
local band council's power and the inability of the Department of 
Indian Affairs to ensure the Indian Act is being administered 
according to law, the only remedy for fair mediation is now in 
the courts.  How will both residential/commercial interests of 
native and non-native people be protected under the proposed 
legislation?  What fair remedy will exist to protect those 
rights? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this time in history and the restoration of native 
communities is this legislation premature, opening the door to 
corruption and greater abuses on reserves?  What mechanism of 
accountability will exist? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I strongly urge the Members of Parliament to table this proposed 
piece of legislation, call for further public consultation from 
all sides of the issue with well informed input from the ones who 
will be affected.  There is too much at stake and too much to 
lose.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the issue that aboriginal constituent is raising in that 
letter has been brought personally by me to the attention of the 
minister.  The third letter is dated February 13 and reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As you know, the Tobacco Plains Indian Band has experienced many 
problems over the last couple of years, and among those is the 
issue of land ownership on the Reserve.  In reference to the 
recent information I have received regarding the little 
publicized and controversial Bill C-49, I would like to share 
with you some of the situations we have encountered within our 
Band and one of the others in the Ktunaxa Nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the Tobacco Plains Reserve, at least nine homes and the Band 
Office have been on bottled water for the past five years.  The 
water source supplying the homes and office is contaminated with 
the cryptosporydium virus, similar to E coli, and is unsuitable 
for drinking.  The Band has been supplying water coolers and 
bottled water to everyone at a cost of approximately $45 per 
month per household, with the Office being slightly higher, 
thereby paying more than $5,000 a year for drinking water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In an effort to solve the water problem, the past Band Manager 
had several wells drilled in various places around the Reserve. 
Water was found here and there, but there was never enough of it 
or it was unsuitable for drinking.  The drillers were on Band 
owned land, and had found good, clean water with a sufficient 
flow when someone who lived there started screaming at them to 
leave and get off off “their land”.  They left and went to 
Elizabeth Gravelle's land, which is also currently supplying the 
contaminated water.  They found clean water and lots of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, Indian Affairs (BC Region) have told Liz that her land will 
be expropriated “for the good of the Band” and have offered her 
$18,000 for the land easement and water rights, even though she 
has made it clear that she is not interested in selling her land. 
She has offered to lease or rent, but she is told `no', that they 
will take her land.  Elizabeth and her heirs are strongly opposed 
to this land transaction, and want to know why their land is 
being taken when the Band has land of its own that is just as 
suitable for the intended purpose.  She has no chance to voice 
her concerns, and has no choice but to begin discussions with a 
lawyer to try to keep her land.  Elizabeth is 76 years old, lives 
on a pension, and has very little money to put toward legal fees 
to fight the expropriation process.  It will be a long and 
arduous battle that she may very well lose in the end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Bill C-49 were passed, she would lose her land.  It would be 
taken from her and her heirs, without them being able to protest. 
The Band would have its land, and an old lady would not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In another example, a woman who was born a St. Mary's Band 
Member cannot inherit her family's land because she is a woman. 
Her brother is the family's last living male; he is older than 
she is, and in poor health.  She was told that when her brother 
dies, the land will become the property of the St. Mary's Band. 
In order to inherit the land, her son had to transfer his 
membership from his own Band, Tobacco Plains, to St. Mary's so 
that there would be a living male to accept the inheritance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-49 would, again, take this woman's land from her and give 
it to a Band and Council that already has enough of their own 
land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are no good reasons for the land transaction, but it would 
be done.  It is already ridiculous enough in itself that a woman 
stands to lose what belonged to her family simply because she is 
a woman.  Bill C-49 wipes out 100 years of progress for women, 
and brings forth yet another prejudice to divide the Indian 
people. It is but another opportunity for the elite to govern the 
lives of the oppressed.  It gives even more power and control to 
those who have already failed to demonstrate a sense of 
responsibility to bring unity, fairness, and equality for all. It 
will result in a greater wedge of mistrust between the people and 
the leaders who, already, do not meet these expectations.

</I></B></P><P align=left>She wants me to send her any updated information. The updated 
information is that the Liberals do not really care about any of 
my constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals have decided that they will steamroller this entire 
effort through the House of Commons, with closure at report stage 
where we are trying to bring in some responsible, rational and 
reasonable amendments so the bill would not be the dog's dinner 
it presently is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House will note that all three of these letters were from 
aboriginal women who are saying to me face to face:  “We don't 
understand.  The Indian affairs minister is a woman.  Why doesn't 
she understand the plight we find ourselves in?   We take a look 
at this entire issue and we ask where in the world is the 
government going and why”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see the reaction of backbenchers when the minister tells the 
whip that they must all stand and vote accordingly.  What about 
these women?  The Liberals do not care.  That is really 
frustrating to me as I listen to the people in my constituency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Iftody:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  The hon. member is engaging in discussion which should be 
on the next motion dealing with the matrimonial question and 
women's rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are still on the first motion and I would suggest 
respectfully that the member's comments are somewhat out of 
order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I ask the member to 
stay on the motion as far as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott:</B>  Madam Speaker, the point is that I cannot 
get up on the next motion because Liberal members have brought in 
closure and I will not have an opportunity to do that.  They know 
that.  They are the people who have shut down the debate in the 
House.  That is really light weight. 
<P><A NAME="LINK23"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Oak Ridges, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
would like to speak in support of Bill C-49, the first nations 
land management act.  As a member of the standing committee I 
will point out a number of things with regard to the amendments 
presented today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is a very important step for the 14 signatories who 
have worked hard to negotiate the framework agreement.  Hon. 
members will appreciate the impact of the bill and that the 
framework agreement extends beyond individuals communities and 
their relationships with the federal government. Third parties 
are affected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the course of past months we have seen considerable 
discussion and the impact land codes made possible under the bill 
may have on provinces, municipal governments and individual 
tenants on first nation lands.  There has been some 
misunderstanding and I would like to set the record straight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will address the issues of each of these third parties.  The 
theme is common to all.  Even though the third parties have no 
direct say in the creation or ratification of the land codes, 
they have been and will be kept well informed of the process for 
creating a first nations land management regime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will outline the issues raised by the provincial governments 
affected.  British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, 
Ontario and New Brunswick are not signatories to the framework 
agreement because the issues addressed are within federal 
jurisdiction.  However the new regimes provide for the 
participation of provinces in matters that normally fall within 
or could affect their jurisdiction such as the administration of 
justice, environmental protection and assessment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Both federal and first nation representatives consulted with 
these provinces throughout the development of the framework 
agreement in the bill before us.  Moreover, the provinces which 
do not have participating first nations have also been informed 
of the new regime.  We consulted on the issue by removing 
provincial expropriation powers.  We consulted on the extent of 
the expropriation powers for first nations.  We consulted on 
environmental protection regimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The framework agreement and the bill reflect a balance that has 
been struck as a result of taking provincial interests and needs 
into account.

<A HREF="#LINKT25"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bottom line is that we have been consulting with the 
provinces on an ongoing basis to resolve these issues to the 
greatest extent possible.  We consulted the province of British 
Columbia regarding the impact of the framework agreement and 
order in council 1036 and privy council order 208 which provide 
for British Columbia's power to resume its authority over a 
portion of the reserve lands; in fact one-twentieth of the lands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Discussions have been ongoing throughout the development and 
introduction of the bill.  British Columbia has given strong 
assurances that the legislation will not affect these orders. The 
Government of Canada has given B.C. the assurance that the 
legislation affects only the Indian Act and not other existing 
orders in council or legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will turn to the impact of the bill and the framework 
agreement on municipalities.  Being the former president of the 
federation of municipalities I can speak with some authority as 
to the impact and the issues with regard to my colleagues from 
the municipal sector in British Columbia.  The Union of British 
Columbia Municipalities had similar concerns to those of the 
province.  It sought to have a provision for mandatory 
consultation included in the legislation respecting any 
development of first nation land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see in this example the reason it is important for the 
framework agreement and the bill to go through.  For the first 
time municipal governments are concerned about land management in 
neighbouring reserves.  The first nations communities are 
rightfully concerned about land management, and that takes place 
in neighbouring communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The five British Columbia signatory first nations have been 
working with the Union of British Columbia Municipalities.  The 
first nations have received a letter from the Union of British 
Columbia Municipalities supporting the first nation consultation 
process and mechanisms for discussion.  Under the existing regime 
the federal government gets involved in the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us imagine if the situation took place with two communities, 
neither of which was a first nation.   The citizens of those 
communities would not welcome federal government interference. 
They would not tolerate it.  It should be up to the communities 
to resolve the issues using existing law where necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill and the framework agreement allow first nations and 
neighbouring municipal governments to work out issues between 
themselves without federal interference.  The municipal 
governments and the signatory first nations have met to address 
mutual concerns.  Both parties agreed to provide letters of 
assurance that each will consult with the other on an issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Neighbouring municipal governments will not be consulted when 
the land codes are developed by first nations.  There are several 
reasons for this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  As it is almost 2 p.m. I will stop the member 
here.  He still has five minutes remaining in which to wrap up.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, in June 
1987 sceptics laughed at reports of a shiny new star on the 
horizon.  “Too small to notice” and “doesn't fit the mould”, 
they said but they were wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was small but he was also living proof that big things come 
in small packages.  Today the city of Calgary mourns the loss of 
our super hero Theoren Fleury, traded by the Calgary Flames to 
the Colorado Avalanche.  Not unlike a political party that was 
born about the same time, Theoren Fleury cast a long shadow 
across the western landscape and won the affection and respect of 
Canadians from sea to sea to sea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was the smallest player ever to don the jersey of a national 
hockey league team.  When the experts questioned whether a small 
man could ever make it into the big leagues, Fleury had the 
answer.  He said “When you are small you have to play with 
heart”.  He played with heart, departing as the team's all-time 
leading scorer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I suggest to my hometown that if anybody deserves the 
title of honorary Calgarian for life it is Theoren Fleury.  He 
truly is one of the biggest little men we have ever known.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The creation of the Canadian institutes of health research will

making today will provide benefits well into the future,

the Reform Party is the first political party in Canadian history 
to vote no confidence in itself while in official opposition. 
This raises two very interesting questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would Canadians put their trust in a group so hungry for 
power that after only two elections it is ready to give up what 
makes it unique and go crawling back on penitent knee ready to 
barter its position on Quebec, on the Senate, on moral issues, 
all for a taste of the fruit of the tree of power in the garden 
of Canadian politics? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also raises the question of whether Reform should continue to 
be the official opposition.  In the last parliament the Reform 
Party argued that the Bloc should not be the official opposition 
because it was not and could not be a government in waiting as 
defined by Erskine May. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party has now put itself in the same category.  It is 
not even a party in waiting.  By admitting it cannot form a 
government without becoming something other than it is in name 
and substance, perhaps Stornoway should become empty again.  Its 
current occupant appears to have forfeited the category that 
qualifies him for occupancy.

between $30,000 and $60,000 a year.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I know the Leader of the Opposition was quite busy with 
his united alternative conference last week, but if he had paid 
more attention to the budget when it was presented, he would 
realize that the general tax reforms, both in the last budget and 
in this budget, are focused particularly on middle and lower 
income families, among them millions of young families. Those are 
the people we are helping through this budget.  Those are the 
people we will continue to help in years to come. 
<P><A NAME="LINK63"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, let us look at the tax position of two families after 
this budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Suppose there are two families, both earning $50,000 each and 
each with two children.  We would think that they would both pay 
the same amount of tax.  But if one family chooses to have one 
parent stay at home, that family under this government's tax 
policy ends up paying about $4,000 more per year in taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the government think that it is fair that one family 
should pay $4,000 more a year in taxes simply because one parent 
chose to stay home?

earning $50,000, two earners and two children, the combination of 
our last two budgets has reduced the total tax bite by fully 15%. 
On top of that we have introduced the child tax benefit, $850 
million in one budget followed by another $300 million on the 
last budget for a total of $2 billion to low income working 
families.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the parliamentary secretary did not answer the question. 
Besides, the child tax credit gets clawed back after families 
make $26,000 a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question is simply this:  We have two families, identical 
income, two children, but one has a parent stay home and the 
other does not.  The family with a parent who stays home to look 
after the children ends up paying $4,000 a year more in taxes 
than the other family.

one has to recognize that under our tax act we have brought in a 
lot of liberalizing measures which allow credits to be 
transferred from a spouse who is working and earning income to 
one who is not. I will go through some of these.  For example, we

homelessness.  Last week I saw it firsthand, people living in

this fiscal year for housing renewal and rehabilitation aimed at 
low income Canadians and the homeless.

the suggestion that such events might be occurring with blood

were various studies and they all indicated that there was no 
health risk.  Since then additional studies have confirmed the

currently a problem with Quebec.  Tens of millions of dollars 
are not available for the student population in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Human Resources Development seems not to want to 
talk to the Quebec minister of education.  There is a consensus 
in Quebec.  The National Assembly is in agreement.  The students 
are in agreement.  The Liberal Party of Quebec called for it 
this morning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the minister pick up the telephone and talk to François 
Legault, the Quebec minister of education, so that the students 
will at least have a hope of getting quality loans and bursaries

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Bachand (Richmond—Arthabaska, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, that 
will surely have been enough time for the Minister of Human 
Resources Development to come up with a satisfactory answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The chairman of the millennium scholarship foundation said that, 
if there was no agreement with Quebec, the money earmarked for 
students in Quebec would go into a bank account, thus depriving 
them of tens and tens of millions of dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I again ask the minister:  Will he, in good parliamentary 
fashion, telephone Quebec's Minister of Education to say that an 
agreement can surely be reached, that, if negotiators must be 
appointed, then so be it, and that students in Quebec are indeed 
very important to the government? 
<P><A NAME="LINK141"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources

are extremely important to our government.  If a spokesperson 
from my department would help discussions between the foundation 
and those administering Quebec's loans and grants system, I 
would be only too pleased to provide one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the Gautrin motion unanimously passed in the National 
Assembly and endorsed by the government contains three 
principles, and I can assure the House that we are perfectly 
capable of meeting all three, thus putting students in Quebec on 
an equal footing with Canadian students when it comes to these 
millennium scholarships. 
<P><A NAME="LINK142"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Minister of

the millennium scholarships with him, that is quite obvious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unlike the pointlessness of the opposition here, however, Jean 
Charest is trying to be of some use in opposition.  Mr. Charest 
and the Quebec Liberal Party are trying to find a way by which 
we can finally do something for the students of Quebec, based on 
the three principles of the Gautrin motion.  That is what a 
constructive opposition does.  In speaking to him, I realize he 
is moved by a constructive spirit, but there is no negotiation.

rise to present a petition on behalf of Liliane George of 
Grandparents Requesting Access and Dignity, along with 186 
others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They draw the attention of the House to the fact that 
grandparents as a consequence of the death, separation or 
divorce of their children are often denied access to the 
grandchildren by their guardians. 
The relationship that exists between grandparents and 
grandchildren is a natural fundamental one and the denial of 
access can constitute elder abuse and can have a serious 
detrimental emotional impact on both the grandparents and the 
grandchildren. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is legislation in several provincial jurisdictions, 
including Quebec and Alberta, containing provisions to ensure the 
right of access of grandparents to their grandchildren.  They are 
asking this House to amend the Divorce Act to make this possible.

Aggregate Uniform Crime Reporting Servey (UCR 1) 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The RCMP does not have an automated system to indentify all 
crimes where a firearm was used during the commission of an 
offence. The police information retrieval system PIRS, is the 
automated indexing system for the majority of the RCMP 
investigative files. However, it is not mandatory to record all 
information on the system. PIRS serves as a pointer to the 
hard-copy files where the details of investigations are recorded, 
including information on firearms used in a crime. The hard-copy 
files are the only source of information that can accurately 
reveal all information on firearms the RCMP encounters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The RCMP opens approximately 2.5M investigational files each 
year; therefore, it is estimated that the number of files the 
RCMP created during the past 20 years would be up to 50M. The 
RCMP does not have the resources for this type of extensive file 
review. We would encounter problems conducting this research, even 
if resources were available, since files have various 
retention periods ranging from 24 months after the date of 
conclusion to 240 months. Some files are retained indefinitely if 
they meet the general criteria of the National Archives of 
Canada. With all of these details in mind, clearly tabulating the 
requested information is an impossible task due to the records 
that no longer exist and the quantity of resources required to 
review the millions of files. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The RCMP uses operational statistics reporting OSR, to fulfil 
the requirement of reporting crime information to Statistics 
Canada. OSR is a far more accurate data source than PIRS, but 
there are data quality concerns with it. OSR is comprised of 1,206 
codes which identify various offences, survey or service provided 
information. There are no OSR codes to clearly identify all 
instances when firearms are used to commit crimes. For example, 
AA01 indicates a 1st degree murder, but it does not reveal how 
the murder occurred. There are some OSR codes which do indicate a 
firearm was used or some other weapon. These codes include the 
following: AA34—Robbery with Firearms—Effective date: 
1981-05-01; AA48—Discharge of Firearms with Intent—Effective 
date: 1983-01-04. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The OSR codes AC13, AC14 and AC15 identify weapons offences that 
include many firearm crimes, but without a detailed review of 
every file there is no way of identifying only the crimes 
involving firearms. For this reason, these statistics have not 
been included in this report. The following information explains 
the offences covered by each OSR code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>AC13—Prohibited Weapons—Effective date: 1981-05-01—Note that 
not all prohibited weapons are firearms. The existence of an 
offence does not mean the weapon was used directly against 
someone. The presence of a prohibited weapon is an offence. 
Offences under this category refer ot breaches of Sections 90 
(Possession of Prohibited Weapon), 95 (Importing or Delivering 
Prohibited Weapon), 103(10) (Possession of Prohibited Weapon 
while Prohibited), 104 (Found Prohibited Weapon) and 105 (Record 
of Transaction in Prohibited Weapons) of the Criminal Code. It is 
not possible to determine how many offences in this category 
involve violence against a person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>AC14—Restricted Weapons—Effective date: 1981-05-01—Note that 
not all restricted weapons are firearms. The presence of a 
restricted weapon can be an offence; therefore, the existence of 
an offence does not mean the weapon was used directly against 
someone. AC14 covers restricted weapons offences under Sections 
91 (Possession of Unregistered Restricted Weapon), 96 (Delivery of 
Restricted Weapon to Person without Permit), 103(10) 
(Possession of Restricted Weapon while Prohibited), 104 (Found 
Restricted Weapon) and 105 (Record of Transaction in Restricted 
Weapons) of the Criminal Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>AC15—Other Offensive Weapons—Effective date: 1981-05-01—Note 
that this code includes much more than firearm offences and 
includes: breaches of Section 85 (Use of Firearm in Commission of 
Offence); 86 (Pointing a Firearm); 87 (Possession of Weapon or 
imitation); 88 (While Attending Public Meeting); 89 (Carrying 
Concealed Weapon); 93 (Transfer of Firearm to Person Under 18); 
94 (Wrongful Delivery of Firearms, etc.); 97 (Delivery of Firearm 
to Person Without Firearms Acquisition Certificate); 100 
(Prohibition Orders, Seizure and Forfeiture); 103(6)(b) & (10) 
(Possession of Firearm, etc. while Prohibited); 104 (Found Weapon 
not Prohibited or Restricted); 105 (Ammunition and Firearm[not 
Prohibited or Restricted]); and, 113 (Offences Relating to 
Certificate and Permits) of the Criminal Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(c) The RCMP does not collect statistics in this format. To even 
provide a partial answer to this qestion would require a labour 
intensive review of millions of RCMP files at detachments across

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>FIRST NATIONS LAND MANAGEMENT ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK200">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of Bill C-49, an act providing 
for the ratification and the bringing into effect of the 
Framework Agreement on First Nation Land Management, as reported 
(with amendment) from the committee; and of Motions Nos. 1, 6 and 
7. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  When the debate was interrupted for 
question period, the hon. member for Oak Ridges had the floor. 
He has five minutes remaining in his allotted time. 
<P><A NAME="LINK201"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Oak Ridges, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will 
continue my remarks with regard to the impact of the framework on 
municipal governments.  As the former president of the federation 
of municipalities and as a member of the Standing Committee on 
Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development, I offer the 
following perspectives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We prefer that first nations and their neighbours work out 
issues among themselves without our interference.  We strongly 
believe this bill and the framework agreement will pave the way 
for better understanding and closer relationships between first 
nations and neighbouring municipal governments.  They remove some 
of the constraints that impede the building of partnerships 
between first nations and neighbouring communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First nations recognize the necessity of consulting with 
neighbouring municipal governments to establish long term 
co-ordinated approaches to development and servicing.  These 
consultative processes are already in place.  First nations are 
already working with the Union of British Columbia Municipalities 
to develop the appropriate consultation mechanism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its January 20 response to this issue, the UBCM indicated 
that on the recommendation of the aboriginal affairs committee, 
the UBCM executive endorsed in principle the idea of mutual 
consultation.  The letter also stated:  “Further, the aboriginal 
affairs committee believes that the ideas contained in the draft 
discussion paper attached hereto are a very good starting point 
for the negotiation”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words the UBCM supports that in the following areas: 
the land use plans in existence at the time of agreement and in 
the future; environmental impacts for development on their lands; 
the provision of local infrastructure and services to their 
residents; cross-boundary land use issues; other matters of 
general concern relating to land development and its effect on 
the respective adjoining lands.  Consultation and discussions 
will occur in a round table format to which all parties will be 
invited.  Individual agreements between neighbouring B.C. first 
nations and B.C. local governments will be encouraged.  The local 
governments affected in support would be Vancouver, North 
Vancouver and Kelowna along with the five first nations already 
mentioned. I mention that particularly for my colleagues across 
the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Various land and resource management initiatives will again 
proceed.  First nations will be able to sign servicing agreements 
with their neighbours on such matters as water, sewer services, 
schools, roads, and so on.  In one case one first nation has 
already loaned money to a neighbouring municipal government to 
help complete a water project.

<A HREF="#LINKT41"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also point out that there are over 100 active service 
agreements between first nations and neighbouring municipal 
governments in the province of British Columbia in the areas of 
water, sewer, transportation and schools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I further point out that the Centre for Municipal Aboriginal 
Affairs which is based in Ottawa would indicate again how, from a 
best practices standpoint, first nations and municipal 
governments work together not only in British Columbia but right 
across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to address the concerns of third parties who are 
neither provincial nor municipal.  They are, for the most part, 
individuals or associations representing individuals who have 
leased property on first nations land.  Let me emphasize that any 
interest currently held by third parties will transfer to the 
jurisdiction of the first nation with the original terms and 
conditions intact.  At the expiration of these interests, the 
lessee, like lessees anywhere in Canada, will have the 
opportunity to negotiate directly with the first nations to 
remain on first nations land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will appreciate that while provinces and municipal 
governments were consulted extensively in the development of this 
act, the department had neither the resources nor the time to 
consult with individual lessees affected.  Some meetings did take 
place, however.  For example, department officials met with the 
Ontario Association of Cottage Owners last September and most 
recently with the Musqueam Home Park lessees.  Wherever the 
concerns of third party leases were brought to the government's 
attention, federal officials did meet to try to address these 
concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third party tenants will not have an opportunity to vote or have 
input into the land code because they have no proprietary rights 
to the effect that lands are on the existing lease, licence or 
permit.  Therefore voting rights under this regime have been 
restricted to those directly affected by the delegation process 
under the Indian Act who do hold proprietary rights to the 
affected lands, in other words the band members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This House can be assured that individual third party leases are 
and will continue to be notified by Canada and the first nation 
where the first nation opts to come under the new regime.  The 
framework agreement and this bill require that they be informed 
of the proposed land code, the first nations land management act 
and the date of the vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the attentions of the new land management regime is to 
foster partnerships between interested parties such as provincial 
governments, municipal governments and private industries that 
deal with first nations on a daily basis.  We hope that all will 
participate in making sure that the relationships foster mutual 
respect and co-operation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK202"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, today I 
am speaking on Bill C-49. For the folks back home, I want to make 
sure they understand that this is indeed not the 47th, not the 
46th, not even the 45th, but the 48th time this Liberal 
government has brought in closure to go ahead and stifle debate. 
That is 48 jackboots I hear a thumpin' on the pavement where this 
government will not allow freedom of speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who is being silenced by this, by those 48 votes of closure? 
Who is not being heard?  Who do the Liberals want to shut down? 
Who do the Liberals want to muffle?  Who do the Liberals want to 
stifle on this?  I will tell members about some of those voices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of those voices says that at least 250 members of the 
Squamish nation have joined the rising chorus of criticism 
against proposed changes to the federal Indian Act, this very 
Bill C-49.  They are saying that powers greater than those 
granted to municipal governments are being given out here.  There 
is authority over zoning and search and seizure.  The legislation 
would also give bands the power to implement laws that call for 
punishments ranging from fines to jail terms. There are those 
within those bands who have been after the council members to 
explain the bill and its ramifications to the band membership, 
but the band members have heard nothing with regard to 
explanation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have people on bands across this country who want to hear 
explanations.  They are not getting explanations.  And yet we are 
having a third level of government created here.  One person here 
says it may be 10 years in the process, but when in the 10 years 
were we consulted? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1520"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT43"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT43"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1520

<A HREF="#LINKT42"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>So I have something that is long, agonizing and painful but with 
not a lot of consultation.  It sounds like this Liberal 
government when it got elected in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The powers that band councils would acquire to expropriate their 
own members' land and the absence of any requirement that bands 
consult with the neighbouring municipalities before developing 
these lands are real problems.  There need to be consultations, 
not unilateral actions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have just touched on a few issues here but we also have issues 
of property rights, of expropriation, of a lack of consultation 
and of a lack of openness in the process.  We also have people 
who have been silenced on these bands and have to put up with all 
these types of unilateral actions and lack of explanations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It calls into question here that there should be one law 
enforced uniformly over the land in a common jurisdiction.  Yet 
what we have here is a set-up of some sort of third form of 
government.  We also have people who are not even listening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That Bill C-49 will not protect non-aboriginal tenants is also 
another criticism.  Here is where we talk about these 
expropriations.  To kind of turn a phrase, it is almost a joke in 
and of itself but not so funny for those who have their property 
taken where it is called expropriation rights.  A right to 
expropriation, can anyone believe it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are aboriginal women's rights as well to equal access to 
the marital home in the event of a marriage breakdown.  There are 
real problems.  Under the law everybody else who marries and then 
gets divorced has the ability to get half the assets.  There are 
those who would quibble about whether some deserve half or more 
or less but nonetheless it is part of the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have with this situation is that native women entering 
into a marriage contract if it does not work out have a very 
vague system that they will be going into where they are not 
assured of having equal access to the matrimonial assets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have warnings from B.C. mayors that the bill would create 
planning chaos because it does not require bands to consult with 
the municipalities that must provide the services, roads, sewers 
and the water for any developments the bands plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have warnings from Vancouver area real estate agents and 
non-native residents on reserves that the legislation makes homes 
owned by non-natives on Indian lands across the country 
unmarketable because there is not enough protection for 
homeowners from expropriation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One might ask how this government can pass this.  It can 
implement its land use codes after they are approved by 25% of 
all eligible band voters.  Usually in a democracy it requires 50% 
to pass something.  I guess what we have here is half democracy 
because real democracy would demand that we need 50% plus one.  I 
guess that is what we would call half a democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have west Vancouver mayor Pat Boname saying that the bill 
should be amended to require bands to consult with neighbouring 
communities before undertaking major developments as B.C. 
municipalities are now required to do.  What they are calling for 
is a level playing field, not a veto.  This is pretty 
straightforward stuff, no unilateral actions, consultations. This 
is not a painful process.  They only want a little openness and a 
little explanation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are not confident that the council will consult with them 
thoroughly before drawing up a land use code which is one of the 
reasons we are proposing changes to this and one of the reasons 
why we do not want to see time allocation and the 48 jackboots of 
the Liberals once again shutting down debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Coincidentally, where it is only requiring 25% of eligible 
voters, not the majority needed in just about every other common 
sense democratic election one can possibly think of, that can 
approve a land use code chain that equals the number of people 
employed by the band. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I stress this once more for the folks at home.  In just about 
every other democratic set-up one could possibly imagine they 
require 50% plus one to make a change. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1525"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT44"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT44"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1525
<A HREF="#LINKT45"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT43"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They only require 25%.  More insidious than that being half a 
democracy, there is the coincidence that 25% equals the number of 
people employed by the band.  I do not think that just sounds 
incestuous, I say it is incestuous.  We have serious problems 
with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On top of that, one of the other voices that the government is 
trying to silence is Gail Sparrow, the former chief of the 
Musqueam Band.  She says: “How can you go to parliament with 
this when the first nations people haven't voted on it?”  That 
is a very good question.  How can that happen?  It is because the 
Liberals bring in closure for the 48th time.  That is how that 
happens.  She said: “Land use codes could be used to deny women 
access to homes on the reserve”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have some more people who are being silenced.  Barbara 
Findlay, the lawyer for the B.C. Native Women's Society, says: 
“You can't hand off inequality.  You can't contract out your 
constitutional responsibility for women to native bands”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are pretty good quotes.  Those are quotes that should be 
heard by the government across the way when it goes ahead and 
restricts freedom of speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned that we have non-natives on band lands who are 
worried.  I will quote a few of them because the Liberal 
jackboots are silencing them.  “`We will be excluded', McKay said 
of non-native residents who have lived on the reserve for 30 
years but who will have no say in the land use code”.  Imagine 
that, living some place for 30 years and not being able to have 
any say with regard to the land use codes. “People's property 
rights are being trampled”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“`They have to pay fair market value but what will fair market 
value be?', asks Fred Warkentin, a real estate agent with 
MacDonald Realty”. That is a very fair question.  If they have 
no say over their land use codes what type of market value is 
that?  Once somebody has stated they will expropriate your land 
and take it from you what value does it have?  It is like a 
government that says it will confiscate your gun.  Good luck 
selling it.  Who would want it after that?   That is property 
rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have an instance where market prices have plummeted 
since the band more than doubled taxes and imposed a 7,366% rent 
increase on leasehold homes in the Musqueam Park subdivision. 
Cheryl Dewson, a real estate agent with Dexter Associates, said: 
“In my professional opinion there will not be any buyer prepared 
to purchase a property with this type of encumbrance”. Who does 
this affect?  There are 20,000 leaseholders on Indian lands in 
B.C. and 60,000 in Ontario whose homes may now have no value. 
Unless amendments are made to this bill, Bill C-49 renders all 
properties on Indian leasehold lands worthless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been able to go through only a few of the voices that 
have been silenced.  This screams, if anything possibly could, 
that the Liberals should open up their ears and make changes so 
that those people do not fall victim to bad legislation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK203"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is a privilege to intervene at this stage of the debate on 
Bill C-49.  We are at report stage.  I remind hon. members that 
third reading is still to come and after that to the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We sometimes tend to think in terms of dichotomous divisions, 
watertight departments and divisions between the different organs 
of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to pay tribute to the very helpful discussions on 
this bill I have had with members of the Senate, both government 
and opposition members, and members of other parties in this 
House, more particularly on the larger public issues with which 
it is bound up.  It is legally and constitutionally separate and 
distinct from the Nisga'a treaty to which a lot of us have given 
a lot of attention. It is separate and distinct from the Musqueam 
leaseholders issue.  In the public mind it is part of the general 
discussion and our thoughts could never be completely divorced 
one from the other. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1530"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT44"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take notice of the fact that although it is an area in which I 
have had some pre-parliamentary experience, there are some 
massive briefs by lawyers presenting arguments on this issue 
which I am studying in some detail; some communications by 
leaseholders, by both native and non-native leaseholders; some by 
native women.  We recognize of course that no one of our 
legislative acts in Indian matters is a template for other 
matters.  That was the original confusion, if I can call it that, 
of the provincial government of B.C.  Each act is historically 
separate and should be seen on its merits.  Nevertheless, certain 
points are common in respect to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have advanced the view that I have problems with section 35(3) 
of the charter of rights, which was an amendment adopted after 
the charter was enacted in 1982.  I have some problems with it, 
but nevertheless it does remain my view that the better 
interpretation is that all matters in this area are subject to 
the Constitution and to the charter of rights.  This means that 
the larger charter principles of due process in its procedural 
sense and its substantive sense are applicable to all subsequent 
measures that may be made in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In some areas, and the Nisga'a treaty is an example, it is 
stated explicitly, and if one wishes a subordination to the 
charter of rights and to the Constitution, there is the case for 
making assurance doubly sure and stating that in terms.  But I 
would say again that it is not constitutionally necessary to do 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also think that it is implicit in the subjection to the 
charter that judicial review and recourse to the Supreme Court of 
Canada remain an ultimate resource in every situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There would be merits at some stage in the proceeding—and it is 
a long march I think to the issue of native self-government 
within the Constitution—in adopting some form of general code. 
But the procedure that all parties have agreed on, provincial 
government, federal government and others, is that this would do 
less than justice to the special historical facts and 
circumstances of each of the individual agreements.  But it 
should come and I would envisage in that case, if there were some 
sort of general code, that the explicitness in relation to the 
Constitution and the charter would be made.  The provision for a 
dispute settlement process, some form of third party 
adjudication, arbitral or otherwise, a mixed commission of which 
there are many comparative law models, would be there apart from 
the court itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am saying is that we are at certain steps along the road. 
This particular bill is at the moment limited to 14 nations of 
which five are from B.C., although others can opt in.  I do 
believe that the proceedings in this House, the further debate to 
occur this afternoon and at the next reading, as well as the 
deliberations in the Senate which could include hearings as well 
as study, will help take us further in the search for the best 
form of expression of the imperatives of giving heed to the 
concept of self-government within the Constitution for Indian 
nations, the concept of control over property, but subject again 
to the constitutional rights that apply to all Canadians and to 
rendering them uniform in some later general code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debate has been helpful and constructive in the general 
Canadian community, including, I would stress, B.C.  We sometimes 
are more heated in our statements, but it is the way of arriving 
at constitutional truths and I would like to pay tribute to the 
thousands of people, and I stress that, who have communicated 
with me over the last two months on aspects of this general 
problem. 
We have tried to answer each letter individually and respond to 
each individual case.  The message is “I am still working.  I 
appreciate the co-operation that has been extended by everybody 
in this House, the Senate and those whom I have discussed it 
with.  The book is not closed”.  I believe that constructive 
changes can occur in the general process of self-government 
within the Constitution and in the control and ownership of lands 
which are being spelled out at the moment by several distinct and 
separate measures of the government and which will also be 
present in each of the 50 treaties still to be discussed.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is my comment at this stage.  I hope to have studied the 
briefs in great detail, and they do require detail.  I hope to 
have more specific recommendations to make.  But I repeat again, 
even in the absence of express mention and in the Latin phrase, 
making assurance doubly sure that we have in the Nisga'a treaty, 
that the general constitutional rules prevail and are paramount, 
including the charter of rights.  And so the protections are 
given to all Canadian citizens, especially including the Indian 
communities, but they also exist in relation to the parties. 
<P><A NAME="LINK204"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
honoured to be able to stand to speak to this bill.  It is a rare 
privilege, since there are not many people who will have the 
right to speak due to the fact that the Liberal government by the 
careful pulling of the strings of their voters on that side said 
“You have no choice but to vote in favour of time allocation and 
we are not going to let anybody speak on this after today”. 
That is shameful in my view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember a number of years ago a colleague of mine at the 
Northern Alberta Institute of Technology where I worked had a 
little placard on the bulletin board in his office.  It is one 
that is very applicable to our situation here today.  It said 
“If you don't have time to do it right, when will you find time 
to do it again?”  I thought that was a very good principle.  We 
need to get things right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not speaking here only of a united alternative, I am 
speaking generally of what our purpose in parliament is.  It is 
to make rules and regulations which govern our country, which 
govern our people.  We need to get it right.  If we do not get it 
right all we have to do is look at history to see the number of 
countries around the world which have suffered immensely because 
of the fact that their government structure was not established 
in a correct way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is wrong here?  First, I would like to talk about this 
process.  Why would the government in this particular instance 
insist on invoking time allocation?  It is a mystery to me.  I 
think that the purpose of government, the purpose of the 
minister, the purpose of the Prime Minister should be to bring a 
solution to the long-festering problem which we have had on land 
claims.  Let us bring a solution that works. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Overriding all of those considerations is that thing which 
occupies our minds so much these days, national unity.  We need 
to be together on it.  We need to make sure that members of our 
society, all Canadian citizens, are respectful of each other and 
that they respect that the limitations which apply to one apply 
to others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A request has been made by the official opposition and indeed by 
Bloc members to make small amendments to this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I worked for a while on a school board.  I liked the form of 
democracy in the school board somewhat better than what we have 
here.  We did not have bills at our school board, but we had 
motions. 
If the motion was not a good motion, a number of members would 
speak against it.  When I happened to be the chairman for a while 
I would ask “All those in favour?” and maybe one or two hands 
would go up.  I would say “Who is opposed?” and the other 13 
hands would go up.  I would simply declare the motion defeated 
and we would go on with our business.

</I></B></P><P align=left>What do we do here?  Somehow we have this idiotic process.  I am 
not speaking of any individual member, but we have this idiotic 
process.  Parenthetically I have to say that it is mathematically 
possible and maybe even probable that occasionally a bill might 
be brought forward by a minister that is not perfect.  That is 
possible.  Yet we have this idiotic process which says that 
unless all members on the government side vote for it somehow 
they are being disloyal.  I contend that they are being disloyal 
if they vote for something that is not as good as it could be. 
Instead, it is reversed and then we have the government forcing 
this vote through.  Now we are not even able to speak on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One might ask why we do not use the time that we have to debate 
the issue.  It is bigger than that.  We are dealing with a 
relationship among Canadians.  We are dealing with people who 
live next door to their neighbours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of us have neighbours.  In my instance I have neighbours 
from a wide spectrum of national backgrounds.  They have 
different language backgrounds, different ethnic backgrounds and 
we get along just fine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happens if we have rules brought in by a distant, 
disjointed, ineffective federal government that controls how we 
live next to our neighbours, who happen to be natives living on 
reserve lands or on native lands as they are called?  What 
happens if we do not do that right?  It introduces friction that 
could otherwise be resolved.  All we are asking is that we take 
some very, very simple measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government could have avoided the embarrassment of the vote 
at noon today.  That was embarrassing.  It is incredibly 
embarrassing that there is no thought for democracy in this 
place.  “It is my way or no way.  It is my way or the highway”. 
That cannot be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part of the legislative process, in my view, is that we also 
make sure that the people who are affected have an opportunity to 
communicate.  They have done so to a certain degree already. Some 
of my colleagues have referred to a number of different letters 
that they have received.  We are dealing not only with members of 
municipal councils who are concerned.  We are not dealing only as 
the government tends to do, with those people who form the 
leadership of the natives.  What we need to do is to make sure 
that the input from grassroots natives is also taken into 
account.  We need to make sure that we hear them.  They have some 
very genuine concerns and we need to hear them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot for the life of me understand why this government would 
be so reluctant to enter into a few simple amendments and say 
“Yes, that is a good idea.  Let us adopt it.  Let us correct 
this slightly flawed legislation to make it the best bill 
possible”, instead of allowing it to just be jammed through in 
its present mediocre form.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, it is atrocious of the government to set up 
within the nation a separate set of nations without having an 
appropriate governance system.  It is inappropriate to do that. 
It is awful that the government is suggesting that there can be 
pockets of municipal-like governments that are not subject to the 
same rules as other adjacent municipalities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are asking for a very simple amendment, that when the law is 
passed first nations must obey the rules and laws of the 
municipal acts of the provinces in which they exist.  They have 
to enter into meaningful negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is atrocious that people who have been leasing land in the 
area to be affected can essentially have their life savings and 
their homes wiped out.  There is no protection for them.  I do 
not believe that is right.  The government should be paying 
attention to the very legitimate rights of landowners and 
investors who have put their life savings into their properties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prior to the bill becoming law some local band councils have 
been driving the value of property essentially to zero, putting 
lease rates so high that they cannot afford to stay there.  It is 
unconscionable that the values are down and they cannot afford to 
sell.  They ought not to be doing that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge members to support these amendments.  Let us do that 
instead of just ramming it through like a bull in a china shop. 
Let us listen to each other.  Let us listen to the reasoning.  If 
it is valid, let us make the changes that are necessary.  Then we 
will have an opposition that will be supportive of the 
legislation as improved.

will be difficult, after what I have heard today, to deal in any 
direct way with some of the ramblings of the opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend from Elk Island said they are not able to speak to it. 
We have been speaking to it since 10.15 this morning and I have 
not heard a great deal that is on the bill, the purpose of the 
bill, or why the bill has been 11 years in the making.  In fact, 
it has probably been 30 or 40 years in the making. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the enlightened first nations of the country have been 
trying to become responsible, have been trying to get out from 
under the paternalistic Indian Act for many years.  Three times 
in fairly recent history the government has offered to scrap the 
Indian Act and to bring native people into full partnership in 
Canada.  It has never been accepted, partly because it was too 
big a chunk to swallow and partly because first nations were at 
various levels of expertise or capacity for economic development 
of their reserves and their peoples.  They suffered from that 
paternalism.  They all recognized it, and we recognize it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are trying to take a step at the behest of 16 first nations 
and more that sought a review of federal policy on delegated land 
authority as part of a broader exploration of alternatives to the 
Indian Act.  They began work on the legislation in 1991.  In the 
last parliament it was Bill C-75 which unfortunately died on the 
order paper.

committee I have been dealing with this problem on behalf of the 
government, my fellow members in the House and the aboriginal 
people of the country for about five years.  It is not very long, 
as the native people count their seven generations, but I have 
been struck by the capacity of these people to look after 
themselves, to take a hand in their own development.  I have seen 
evidence where they have been given some encouragement in terms 
of what they can do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have read a good deal of the royal commission report on 
aboriginal peoples which talked about four things that were 
important if we were to bring first nations as citizens of Canada 
into Canada where they belong.  They were respect for their 
values, for their spirituality, for their history, for their 
sense of land and for their sense of community; recognition that 
they are in fact citizens of the country; responsibility, which 
we had been summarily taking away since the passing of the Indian 
Act; and sharing, to share in the future of the land because we 
realize this is the second largest country in the world in area, 
much of it north of the 60th parallel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In less than a month, on April 1, we will be celebrating the 
founding of Nunavut, a land, a territory, the northeastern arctic 
territory of the country which is one-fifth of Canada's land 
mass.  It has fewer residents than the town of Woodstock, the 
county seat of Oxford, but it will have control and 
responsibility for its people, its land and its laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first language of the territory will be Inuktitut.  Cree 
will be a language as will English.  They will start off on this 
great adventure and I wish them well.  It would be too bad to go 
on carping about what other first nations want to do with their 
land in concert with the provincial governments which they must 
respect in terms of environmental matters, the Constitution and 
the charter of rights and freedoms that they fully accept. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hear opposition members railing that they have not had enough 
time to speak to it.  If they had stuck to what was in the bill 
we might agree with them but they have not.  They have talked 
about it being slightly flawed.  I would like to know what 
legislation introduced in parliament since 1867 has been perfect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard from the opposition that it has to be right, that 
we have to do it right.  Nonsense.  We have to do it and do it 
the best way we know how with the best brains and co-operation we 
have.  We have to give aboriginal people the right to go on and 
make some mistakes as we have done.  We seem to think it will be 
perfection overnight.  It will not be, but we will move along the 
road in the way those responsible for the aboriginal people want 
us to go.

Perth is sitting and my colleague, Elijah Harper, addressed the 
House.  He said to all of us including the opposition:  “You

people here.  It was our land”.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Indians had a communal, co-operative system of government. 
They traded the length and breadth of this continent and the 
South American continent.  They have been here for 10,000 years. 
They existed in the face of the harshest conditions that the 
world knows.  They were never defeated in battle in this country. 
They welcomed the white skinned people.  They taught them how to 
survive in the wilderness, how to survive the winter, and they 
expect to treated with some respect.  That is what the report of 
the aboriginal people's commission said, and Gathering Strength 
which the minister published last year says how we will do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to pass the bill today.  Members of the opposition 
worked with me in committee.  They approved the bill in 
committee.  They listened to the witnesses, to the people.  They 
struggled with it.  We asked for an amendment which we got.  They 
said that was fine and they would support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of good work is done in our committees.  We match wits and 
we deal with a problem before us.  Politics normally stay out of 
the way if there are a good committee chair and good committee 
members like we have on our committee.  We came to an agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then I came in this morning and found that my colleague from 
Prince Albert was worried about giving band leadership more 
power.  He agreed to the amendment.  He agreed to the bill, but 
the big boss from Kootenay—Columbia came in and said “No, you 
can't do that.  You can't go along with your colleagues and bring 
in a good bill because we are going to make some trouble”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I had heard some enlightened discussion on what was wrong 
with the bill, I might not be so passionate about it.  I have 
spent a lot of time, a lot of effort and a lot of work on the 
bill.  I want it passed.  I want the chiefs to be proud of it. I 
want the 14 nations to get on with running their own affairs.  I 
want us to get on with Gathering Strength.  As one of my 
colleagues said earlier, the four principles of that document are 
increased governance, partners, new fiscal arrangements and 
strong community.

<P><A NAME="LINK206"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, this is 
actually an important bill to me because I have a large number of 
big reserves in my riding.  I will be presenting the problem with 
the bill in relation to a rural environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I start by saying that this is 48th time that time allocation 
and<I>or closure has been used by the Liberal government.  It is a 
shame.  I recall what members opposite said when they were over 
here about that issue.  They cried long and hard.  We stood here 
in the precincts of parliament unwilling to sit in our places 
this morning because it is inappropriate to be bringing in time 
allocation or closure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-49 actually has a lot of good things in it.  I will grant 
that to the member opposite.  This is in fact a move in the right 
direction.  Land management control to bands willing to accept 
that responsibility is the way we should be going.  The member 
opposite also has a large native community in his riding and is 
very interested in this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will enumerate the bands within my riding:  Eden Valley, the 
Peigan Band, the Blood reserve which is the largest reserve in 
Canada, and the Tsuu T'ina.  The chief of the Tsuu T'ina Band was 
my Liberal opponent in the first election.  He is a fine, 
articulate native man by the name of Roy Whitney.  There is also 
the Siksika reserve which is one reserve that is very interested 
in the bill.  It is a very advanced band with a highly educated 
administration.  They are computer literate natives of the 
highest standards who are ready for land management control if 
any band in Canada is.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our position, however, is that this bill is deficient in the 
area of co-operation with surrounding municipalities.  I would 
say to my colleagues that if my own home town of Okotoks, a small 
community coming close to 10,000 people now, does something in a 
developmental sense, it must consult with the municipal district 
beside it.  If it decides to put up an ammunition control 
facility, it must consult.  That only makes sense, would it have 
an impact.  If the municipality outside decides to put a golf 
course in place, it must let the town of Okotoks know. It gets an 
opportunity to interchange, comment and if there is a problem, 
there is a modification. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I give two practical examples from the Siksika reserve of how 
that sort of consultation is not taking place today.  It will not 
take place under Bill C-49 because Bill C-49 does not address 
this.  This is not a casual issue but a significant issue.  There 
is a boundary fence along the south side of the Siksika reserve 
which delineates.  For those who have not spent time in a rural 
riding, this boundary fence is important because it keeps 
livestock from one side getting on to the other side.  On the 
Siksika reserve there is a very large wild horse herd, 150, 175 
wild horses.  They spend much of the time during the day on the 
reserve and at night time cross the boundary fence which is old 
and broken down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The neighbouring municipality, the town of Vulcan, which is the 
closest town, has tried for 15 years to get this boundary fence 
fixed.  When it went to the band administration, it was referred 
to Indian affairs.  When it went to Indian affairs, it was 
referred to the band administration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members may say from an urban perspective this is not 
significant.  There is a roadway along that boundary fence. This 
roadway carries kids on school buses and large transport trucks. 
The number of close misses at dusk and at dawn when the horses 
are going back and forth is legion.  In fact a school bus with 
kids on board nearly overturned when it swerved to miss the wild 
horses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one would take responsibility.  There was no direct contact. 
Would this bill improve that?  Yes, if there were the necessity 
to have a consultation process with the neighbouring 
municipality. That should be there.  It could be there.  It is 
not a major amendment to have it there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second issue farming individuals will understand.  On one 
side of the fence is unfarmed, untended land, dirty land, weedy 
land.  On the other side of the fence is highly valuable farm 
land, kept clean, tilled regularly where no weeds are allowed to 
grow.  No one will take responsibility for the weedy portion 
inside the reserve.  No one will cut.  No one will look after it. 
Of course the weeds blow on to the farmland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a lawsuit in place because there is no consultation 
back and forth between the two administrative levels that could 
have and should have been addressed in this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To my colleagues opposite, would it be unreasonable to request 
the native administration to consult with the neighbouring 
administration?  Why not?  I can think of only one reason that we 
would not want to go that route and that is if we were treating 
the reserve as something unique, not as a municipal style of 
government but a country style of government.  That has not been 
envisaged.  It should not be envisaged.  I think it would be 
wrong to go that route. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am in a position where I would like to have the opportunity to 
have a reason that this is not addressed.  This is Group No. 1 
amendments and I tried to be very specific to the Group No. 1 
amendments, not to stray but to go directly to the consultation 
component.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish I could understand why my colleagues opposite would not 
address this consultation which, to my mind, is profoundly 
important and profoundly necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The municipal government from the outside has raised this with 
me and asked me to speak to it in the House.  The councillors 
have asked me to deal with this in the House and this is my 
opportunity.  It is an opportunity, however, that is attenuated 
by the fact that other MPs with exactly the same concerns now 
will not be able to speak.  I think that is a shame.  I think it 
is dreadful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to speak directly to the Siksika band so that I can 
reiterate how comfortable I am with the land management 
arrangements that it proposes.  I think it is likely to consult 
better with the surrounding municipalities without the department 
of Indian affairs as a buffer.  I think there will be a better 
relationship.  I would be profoundly reassured if this bill made 
that certain.  Every municipal act that I have read takes the 
time to make that certain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will try not to waste the House's time but to mention again 
how advanced these reserves are.  I have not spoken of the Tsuu 
T'ina reserve which has also a very highly advanced 
administration. Natives there have gone to university and can 
debate and discuss on any level with anyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The native communities do need to become independent.  They 
should not be subservient to the department of Indian affairs. 
They should move down this path but they should also be as 
accountable and consultation wise able to discuss with the 
surrounding municipalities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hope is that Bill C-49 will still be altered.  I wish it 
would be altered before we were forced to vote on it in this 
inadequate form.  I will look forward to the opportunity to 
discuss with my own native community things that could improve it 
from its perspective, as I represent it here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an honour to be its representative here, to represent 
individual needs of natives as well as their collective needs, 
Eden Valley, Peigan band, Blood reserve, Tsuu T'ina and Siksika. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask that the government still consider putting in a 
consultation component.  Amendments that have been put forward 
would stifle and still my concerns about this bill completely. 
Once again, it is an honour to represent those interests in the 
House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK207"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin—Swan River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to speak today on Bill C-49, the first nations land 
management act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like my colleagues, I am not happy with the government's evoking 
time allocation for the 48th time.  I certainly hope the 
government resists the temptation to invoke time allocation on 
certain other bills.  As I understand, next week it may do the 
same on Bill C-55. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come from a riding with 13 Indian reserves.  Bill C-49 will 
have profound implications from what I have heard today.  I hope 
the government slows down the process and consults the aboriginal 
community certainly at the grassroots level before passing this 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to focus today on the issue of simple fairness as it 
relates to Bill C-49.  Bill C-49 proposes to give significant 
jurisdiction to certain Indian bands, including the authority to 
collect taxes from residents on reserve land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-49 fails to take account of how these jurisdictions 
affect residents on reserve lands who are not status treaty 
Indians.  So far in dealing with the residents of the Musqueam 
development of lower mainland B.C., the Musqueam band is 
proposing the collection of horrendous rents from resident 
leaseholders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Musqueam's proposed rent will have the effect of driving 
residents who own homes built on leased lands out of their homes. 
I have received briefs from the people who are affected by this 
proposed change to the act.  They have had numerous town hall 
meetings and have many issues to be concerned about.

<A HREF="#LINKT52"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In some cases the band's rents are driving out senior citizens 
who have resided on the Musqueam development for the past 30 
years. Annual rental payments for each lot are now in the range 
of $28,000 to $38,000 depending on lot size.  Currently rents are 
based on a percentage of the property value if these properties 
were owned outright, including the land. The homeowners do not 
own the land on which their homes sit.  Property taxes have 
recently been doubled into the $7,000 range by the band's 
taxation authority. The homeowners' only recourse is through the 
courts.  Currently they are pursuing their case before the 
Supreme Court of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The homeowners have no voice on the Musqueam band council nor 
with the band's taxation authority.  The are not entitled to vote 
in band elections.  Even if homeowners choose to pay unreasonable 
land rent, they know their homes are now rendered worthless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under Bill C-49 the Musqueam band will obtain sweeping powers of 
expropriation.  Bill C-49 restricts recourse to the courts of the 
provinces and of Canada.  Under Bill C-49 charter protection is 
no longer guaranteed.  Where is the fairness in this kind of 
legislation.  Why is the Indian affairs minister pitting 
Canadians against Canadians? In the name of fairness to all 
stakeholders the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development should withdraw this unfortunate bill forthwith or 
certainly approve its amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most Canadians believe the granting of self-government powers to 
first nations is a reasonable solution to historical problems. 
However, the manifest unfairness of Bill C-49 is its effect on 
non-natives who have property interests on first nation reserve 
lands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been asked to bring forth to the House concerns about the 
Musqueam band issue.  The first nations law that Bill C-49 
enables will apply within the boundaries of reserve land. 
Therefore people can choose whether to subject themselves to such 
laws based on whether they choose to enter reserve lands. 
However, the reason Bill C-49 would be outrageously unfair to 
existing non-native leaseholders on reserve land is that such 
leaseholders would be automatically subject to any new first 
nation law.  Whether they approve or not by virtue of their 
pre-existing leasehold interests, choice is effectively violated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will present to the House some thoughts on the Musqueam 
situation vis-à-vis Bill C-49.  This is seen as a squeeze play by 
the federal government.  The government can give away all the 
self-government power it wants provided that it is acting fairly 
to all parties involved.  In other words, people caught in the 
middle like leaseholders on reserve land should not be destroyed 
in the process.  It is only reasonable.  After all, this is 
supposed to be a democratic country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is also seen as an abuse of power.  The powers granted 
under Bill C-49 are much too broad and are apparently not 
restrained by checks and balances.  Unchecked power tends to 
abuse, as we all know in the House.  In this case the law is 
giving aboriginal bands the right to abuse with impugnity. Bill 
C-49 would be all right if there were some safeguards, for 
example guaranteed charter protection for the non-native people 
who live on the reserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Concerning the lessons of history, the American revolution was 
in part fought over this issue.  The Americans objected to the 
authoritarian rules of the British monarchy and thus revolted in 
order to establish a system of government with fundamental checks 
and balances to counter the supreme power of the leader.  Today 
in Canada our system of government follows this model, 
supposedly.  It is known as democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Bill C-49 in the context of appeasement, appeasement does not 
always work since the party receiving the benefit will invariably 
ask for more power in the future.  Just ask Prime Minister 
Chamberlain before the outbreak of World War II.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thought on this bill is future uncertainty.  Once a 
break occurs, no one can control the direction in which it 
spreads.  Bill C-49 grants wide, sweeping powers.  Once 
established the future evolution and scope of the powers cannot 
be predicted with any degree of certainty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This dynamic evolution of law is a fundamental element of our 
common law system.  Therefore, once such broad powers are 
granted, they may be very difficult to restrain, since they will 
be able to use the full force of the legal system in the fight to 
keep such powers entrenched. Before granting such powers, the 
government should carefully consider all of the downside 
permutations lest there be future regrets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Musqueam situation is unique.  It is a 10 sigma event, one 
that just happens to fall through all the cracks.  The three 
pronged combination of property taxation, rental dispute, and 
Bill C-49 expropriation could be used to destroy the leaseholders 
completely. In other words, the leaseholders can be hit with any 
of the prongs in any order to maximum effect.  The catch is that 
it is perfectly legal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the provisions of Bill C-49, clause 28 deals with 
expropriation.  Expropriation can occur for any first nations 
purpose.  In other words, it is effectively carte blanche. 
Expropriation takes effect from the moment of its registration or 
30 days, whichever is shorter.  In other words, it can have 
immediate effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fair compensation is to be paid along the lines of fair market 
value.  In the case of the Musqueam, current FMV is zero. Appeals 
of fair compensation are to be had through their own internal 
review structure, one that is sure to confirm any initial 
assessment. It is uncertain whether or not the usual courts of 
Canada can be engaged in reviews of fair compensation.  It is 
arguable that they are not since this bill is essentially 
granting powers of self-government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to close by stating that self-government by the 
bands means that they are being granted the right to write their 
own criminal legislation along with penalties.  Penalties follow 
the summary conviction stream, meaning the maximum penalty is 
either a $2,000 fine or six months imprisonment. They are also 
being given the power to hire their own justice of the peace and 
police. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The combination of all the powers under this section would 
effectively allow a band to create its own criminal justice 
system.  And the application of the charter is uncertain. 
Therefore, there is no guarantee of fairness or due process. This 
is very alarming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge all members of the House to support the amendments. 
<P><A NAME="LINK208"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Sophia Leung (Vancouver Kingsway, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
as an MP from British Columbia I want to express the great 
concerns British Columbians have regarding Bill C-49. I have had 
a number of meetings and discussions with B.C. residents and 
mayors and also with the ministry of Indian affairs to express my 
concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First I want to speak on the consultation process between the 
first nations and the municipalities.  Let me refer to the 
correspondence between the Union of B.C. Municipalities to the 
Land Management Board representing the 14 first nations. The UBCM 
clearly supports the concept of mutual reciprocal consultation on 
land use and responded to a draft discussion paper in very 
favourable terms. I quote: “The UBCM aboriginal affairs 
committee has now considered the draft discussion paper on land 
use and related matters.  The draft discussion paper between 
first nation governments and the municipalities including a 
number of cities states they will consult with one another on a 
regular basis regarding the following issues of mutual concerns: 
First, their land use plans in existence at the time of this 
agreement and in the future. Second, environmental impacts from 
development on their lands. 
Third, the provision of the local infrastructure and services to 
their residents.  Fourth, cross-boundary land use issues.  Fifth, 
general concern regarding land development and its effect on 
their respective adjacent lands”.

<A HREF="#LINKT54"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased that the consultation process is already in place. 
The five B.C. first nations are involved in discussions with UBCM 
to develop a process to address the issue of consultation.  Those 
five first nations have agreed to consult off reserve governments 
and other interested parties on major developments that would 
affect them. They are currently working with the Union of British 
Columbia Municipalities to develop the appropriate consultation 
mechanisms.  Such a consultation process must protect the 
interests of all Canadians which is what I support the most. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under Bill C-49, first nations could not exercise expropriation 
powers arbitrarily.  Expropriation by first nations would be for 
community purposes only, such as water and sewage projects or a 
public building like a fire hall. Bill C-49 requires first 
nations to clearly define their expropriation powers in their 
land codes before they are ratified by the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to pay tribute to many British Columbians, officials and 
mayors for their input and opinions regarding Bill C-49.  I 
convey their opinions to my colleagues in this House as I speak 
now as their representative from B.C. 
<P><A NAME="LINK209"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
happy to take part in the debate at report stage of Bill C-49, 
and specifically the group one amendments that are before us 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that this is an area that needs a lot of work.  From 
my own experience in my riding of Peace River there are a number 
of reserves with significant problems which I think need to be 
addressed down the road by disbanding the Department of Indian 
Affairs and Northern Development and letting the reserves take 
control of the situation themselves. One aspect that is really 
hurting that prospect right now is the fact that they still have 
to have communal property.  I will speak to that in a moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The glaring problem in Bill C-49 is that it fails to require a 
band to consult with adjacent municipalities on land use issues. 
These issues have a potential impact and implication for other 
municipalities.  There needs to be consultation and co-operation, 
otherwise it may lead to conflict which quite often hurts and 
delays industrial development, environmental clean-up and many 
other issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why my colleague from this side of the House suggested 
that we should have consultational amendments that will help 
ensure that bands have local community support in writing, to 
create a much smoother transition from the remote control aspect 
that we have seen under this government and Indian and northern 
affairs to what we might have, which is local control by bands 
that do not meet development problems that exist when we have two 
municipalities existing side by side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest in many respects that is what we really should have 
here.  These reserves should really be municipalities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hear the NDP members talking. I guess they will probably have 
their turn in debate so I would hope they would use this 
opportunity to listen to others while they are speaking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that we need to have local government at the band 
level, a municipal style government, not government that gets 
into provincial or federal areas but which is a delegated 
government from the province on down. 
It seems to me that by having municipal type government on 
reserves, if we had a good municipal style election process, we 
would have greater responsibility on the reserves as well.  We 
would have an election process that was under the courts and 
would have to be adhered to more openly.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My big concern today has to do with the communal property aspect 
as I was suggesting earlier.  It is one important change we could 
make by repealing the Indian Act and moving away from the 
Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development and 
establishing a better relationship with the local reserves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that as long as we have communal property aspects 
rather than fee simple title on the reserves, we have the 
potential for a lot of problems. We know that the communal 
property aspect has not worked anywhere around the world in the 
socialist or communist countries.  I am not sure how we intend it 
to work here and work effectively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to tell the House about a friend of mine who passed on 
about two years ago.  A Cree Indian from northern Alberta, from 
the Beaver Lodge Hythe area, Archie Calihou was a friend of mine 
and I talked to him at great length.  Archie told me that he had 
some of the best advice of his entire life when his father said 
to him when he was a young man, “Archie, don't take treaty”. 
The reason, his dad said to him, “You are going down a dead end 
road, Archie”.  Archie took his advice. Archie went on to become 
a war hero for us.  He fought in the second world war.  He worked 
very hard to help his people out with substance abuse counselling 
and he worked very hard as an advocate for people on personal 
issues.  Archie said to me when I was elected, “You have to do 
something here to address this communal property aspect. Down the 
road in 100 years my friends out there on that reserve at Horse 
Lake and their descendants are going to be no better off in 100 
years than they are right now.  Look at my situation.  My wife 
and I did not take treaty.  We have our own home in Beaver Lodge. 
My friends on the Horse Lake reserve are having a great deal of 
difficulty.  They try to get ahead, yet what happens to them with 
the communal property aspect? There is no reward system”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Private property gives that reward. We take chances in life when 
we have private property. We have a farm ourselves. We make 
investments. We know that sometimes we make good investments, 
sometimes we make bad investments.  We make good decisions, or we 
make bad decisions, but we live by them and we learn from them. 
But when people have a piece of property that does not really 
belong to them, when they are working a piece of land and all 
they can do is lease it for a farm, and they do not know about 
the long term tenure of that lease, and there is no possibility 
of it ever becoming theirs, what hope do these people have? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to move beyond this situation. Clearly we have to move 
to a system where people have fee simple title to land. Fee 
simple title is an aspect of life we enjoy in Canada and I would 
suggest it has worked very well for us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see what is happening in some countries, for example Russia, 
which still has not been able to make that transition out of the 
communist system to go to private property. They are wallowing. 
They cannot produce enough food for their own people under that 
kind of system. I talked to people who were here from Estonia. I 
asked them if they had been able to move back to the private 
property aspect and they said that after having communal property 
it is very difficult.  People get used to that security of the 
government over all those years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest there is an analogy here with what we are talking 
about today. They get used to that security blanket and they are 
not willing to take any opportunities and chances for themselves. 
They said that the result is very little production.   The 
production levels in Estonia need to be increased. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that will happen over time, but only when we make the 
transition back to the fact that people can have private property 
and it will be their decision to go ahead or not based on their 
own industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support the amendment by my colleague which suggests that we 
need to have a consultation process between Indian bands on their 
reserves and the local municipalities.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know from firsthand knowledge in my area that it is important 
that we have that.  It seems to me that municipalities should 
work together.  In fact, it is a requirement in all other 
municipalities in Canada that if one is suggesting an industrial 
development that will affect the other they have to consult.  I 
am not sure why we would want to move away from a model that is 
working well throughout the rest of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a very good amendment.  I look forward to further debate 
on the other aspects of this bill later on. 
<P><A NAME="LINK210"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords—Lloydminster, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to speak to Group No. 1 
amendments to Bill C-49, a framework on first nations land 
management.  It is a great title. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues from Skeena and Prince Albert have done a 
considerable amount of work on this issue through committee and 
through the various stages in the House of Commons.  But we have 
only scratched the surface of what is really wrong with this 
government's approach to native Canadian issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our amendments to Bill C-49 call for the co-ordination of first 
nations land code changes in concert with their municipal 
neighbours and in line with the laws and provisions set out by 
the provinces in which the effected lands are located.  Otherwise 
it would seem to me that what this government has in mind is to 
set up a fourth level of government superior to the provinces and 
with no accountability to the other Canadians around it who are 
subject to property taxes and codes much more restrictive than 
what we see in Bill C-49.  Who would believe that a Liberal 
government would undermine the provinces and hand out special 
privileges based on who a person's grandfather was? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to assume that every member of the House and most 
Canadians are interested in the same thing, the greatest 
prosperity for the greatest number of people.  We all want to see 
a country that has stable families, good health and education for 
its citizens and the maximum opportunity for individuals not only 
to provide the necessities in life but also to enjoy leisure 
activities that make life more pleasant.  How a country can best 
provide these conditions is where the parties in this place 
disagree.  That is why Canadians vote for different parties and 
hope for the best. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians both aboriginal and non-aboriginal look at misguided 
legislation like Bill C-49 and they are still hoping for the 
best.  It is more likely that very few Canadians, including those 
aboriginals who are directly affected by it, will get to see this 
legislation or to understand its implication.  Again we have 
closure.  We forget how little time ordinary citizens have to 
follow the deliberations that consume our time in this place. 
When we do hear from them we tend to pick and choose what we want 
to hear depending on whether they already agree with us or not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot forget that what comes out of here in terms of 
legislation has real consequences.  While we are trying to 
appease one group we may end up victimizing another.  I am sure 
everyone is familiar with the plight of the residents of Salish 
Park on the Musqueam reserve in B.C.  Twenty or thirty years ago 
they signed 99 year leases with the federal government to build 
homes on the native land.  We have to assume there were perfectly 
legitimate reasons for the arrangements made by the federal 
government then.  But before a generation has passed a new 
ideology was loose in the halls of this government and all the 
promises and legal documents that once offered rights to one 
group were torn up in the interest of giving new rights to 
another group. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am aware that native bands are familiar with this process. 
They have been fighting it for years.  But to continuing to make 
and break deals with the victim group of the week is never right, 
no matter who is the victim and who is the beneficiary.  The 
non-native residents of Musqueam lands now find themselves cut 
off from recourse to such basic rights as voting for local 
representation.  They have no way to protect their property 
against expropriation by a band council that also has the right 
to raise their property taxes by any amount and then offer them 
arbitrary compensation after the value of their property has 
collapsed.  As I said, some may defend this abuse of 
constitutional rights of one group by saying they had a 
sweetheart deal in the first place and now they must pay the 
piper.  If I were a Musqueam band councillor or chief I would be 
nervous about this weak minded logic since it suggests that every 
agreement made by government can be tossed out at the discretion 
of a later government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not be mistaken that what we are talking about is a bunch 
of displaced white homeowners.  The provisions of this bill that 
hand over open ended powers to almost unaccountable legislative 
structures fall heavily on natives as well.  We as MPs should 
have all received an e-mail recently from Wendy Lockhart Lundberg 
who is described as a registered status native and a member of 
the Squamish nation.  Ms. Lundberg describes Bill C-49 as a 
legislative end-run around treaties and as a little publicized 
government bill. 
She said that her band council has sent a member to Ottawa to 
support Bill C-49 while not informing the general band membership 
of the existence of the bill itself.  That does not sound like 
the conditions for effective legislation are representative to 
me.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ms. Lundberg complains that the all too common tragedy of 
divorce on reserves leaves women and children high and dry. 
Frequently the male assumes ownership of the matrimonial home as 
dictated by their band council and there is nothing here to 
change this situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government might be willing to leave these issues dangling 
in its legislation but the B.C. Native Women's Council is not and 
is taking this government to court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The letter goes on to say that all band members, not just women, 
may be subject to the limitless powers being implied by this 
bill.  Anyone who is not interested in toeing the band council 
line may find their property expropriated for vaguely defined 
community works or other first nations purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can only speak from my experiences dealing with the complaints 
of native constituents in my riding, but the instances of abuse 
of band funding and administration are so outrageous that they 
would not be tolerated in any other part of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not have a system in this country for making sure that the 
benefits provided by all Canadians go to those less fortunate on 
reserves.  I can hardly blame native administrators for the way 
they take advantage of government handouts.  If somebody handed 
any one of us a cheque for millions of dollars and said that we 
could spend it however the receiver of the money saw fit, I do 
not doubt that we would all be tempted to dabble in a bit of 
mismanagement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it concerns the dispensation of taxpayer money to party 
favourites we are angered.  But this concerns people's lives. The 
Minister of Health and his colleague, the Minister of Indian 
Affairs and Northern Development, got an earful last week when 
they tried to brag to natives about the pitiful new health 
programs they came up with.  The natives were angered that $190 
million would not go far enough.  But they would have been better 
off getting an answer to the question where has all the money 
gone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This country spent billions of dollars to make things better on 
reserves and has far too little to show for it.  Most people 
would like to see a better way of doing things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I guess the government will finally see that it is a two edged 
sword to falsely accuse others of evil intentions while trying to 
address the problems of the day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to assume that the government is counting on goodwill 
and good intentions for the future implementation of this badly 
written bill.  The problem is no one can do a good job in a bad 
system.  This does not apply to certain races and not others for 
any kind of cultural differences.  We are people.  We all desire 
similar things from life.  But if we do not have accountable, 
open systems of government that apply equally to everybody, we 
will simply be exchanging one group of disgruntled citizens for 
another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a tremendous amount of people out there who say they 
have not been consulted on this bill, women's groups and rank and 
file natives.  They are all concerned that this will be an 
entrenchment of existing disparities and problems that are 
systemic in all levels of government acting on behalf of rank and 
file aboriginals.  Rank and file aboriginal peoples are crying 
for a voice, someone to carry their message to the House. There 
has been a number of petitions presented here with regard to 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleagues have said here today, parts of Bill C-49 are a 
step in the right direction but very tentative, small steps. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Before resuming debate it is my duty 
to inform the House, pursuant to Standing Order 38, that the 
questions to be raised tonight at the time of the adjournment are 
as follows: the hon. member for Winnipeg North Centre, Health 
Care; the hon. member for Prince Albert, Aboriginal Affairs. 
<P><A NAME="LINK211"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert D. Nault (Kenora—Rainy River, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is an honour for me as a representative of the most 
first nations of any member of parliament, some 51 and 40% of 
Ontario's first nations, to speak to this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first nations land management act obviously is a very 
important piece of legislation, important because it begins the 
trend and the change in direction of many years of a 
paternalistic policy that the federal government has had toward 
the more partnership oriented piece of legislation, a way of 
doing business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why anyone would be opposed to this is beyond me.  I will speak 
a little to the opposition and its problems with the legislation 
as I go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is about accountability and about fairness.  Again, I 
do not understand why anybody would be opposed to this bill. This 
is about 14 first nations opting out of the Indian Act sections 
on land management.  This is about allowing first nations to 
establish their own regimes to manage their reserve lands and 
resources.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know why anyone would be opposed to this in the modern 
society we live in today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important, if we want to speak to an amendment or to where 
we are headed as governments, that we ask ourselves what would 
flow from this new regime.  For a first nation chief and council 
what would this do for the first nation or the first nations that 
will flow over the years?  This is only a start. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hope other first nations will take on the challenge of this 
land management act.  What will come out of this is experience 
and expertise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Experience and expertise are important if someone is to change 
the way we do business between first nations people, the 
Government of Canada and the provinces involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What this will do is generate revenue through economic 
development.  I wish my colleague from Macleod were here because 
he represents a very large first nation that has the basic 
infrastructure in place. Once there is the basic infrastructure, 
the next issue is economic development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without the tools at someone's disposal locally, economic 
development does not occur.  I have a number of first nations in 
Kenora—Rainy River that are at the level of wanting to create 
employment for their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The way the Indian Act reads and is set up, they cannot even 
divide land for industrial development within their own reserve. 
That is ridiculous in the world we live in today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People opposite say why can first nations people not have more 
employment.  Here is a reason why.  We are now starting on a new 
regime in order to entice first nations to do just that, to have 
land management, to create industrial parks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly they may have golf courses and things like that. Would 
any other community trying to create economic development not do 
so?  Economic development flows from land management regimes. No 
one should have a problem with that.  We are trying to get 
unemployment down, are we not, in all different communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also ensures community decision making.  That is where I have 
a really difficult time with my friends opposite.  I have sat 
here now for a number of years listening to the Reform Party 
almost suggest that every first nation leader and council is 
crooked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am getting tired of that.  I am getting fed up with hearing 
people say those elected people are not capable of making local 
decisions. I can speak from authority on this subject. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many first nations people who are as qualified as we 
are to run their communities and more so.  Yes, there are 
problems in the aboriginal world relating to politicians who do 
the wrong thing.  I suggest it happens here.  It happens in 
provincial legislatures.  It happens in municipal legislatures 
with non-natives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot use this huge brush over people to make it seem like 
first nations people cannot run their affairs.  Quite frankly, 
that is total nonsense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To the amendment and the little spin the Reform Party put on 
consultation, there is no law in Canada that says that parliament 
has to consult.  It does not exist.  There is no law provincially 
that says consult.  It does not exist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ask Mike Harris.  He does not consult very often.  He did 
consult at election time.  He won.  I accept that.  Now first 
nations people get elected.  They have a chief and council.  If 
they decide not to consult and they do the wrong thing, then 
people will make up their mind at election time whether they are 
the right people for the job.  We will deal with that in a 
democratic process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the Reform Party position, it is very specific and very clear 
what its objective is.  It looks at first nation communities as 
municipalities.  A municipality is a creation of provincial 
legislation.  This is not in the Constitution.  It does not exist 
in the federal laws we have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They can be changed by provincial governments whenever they so 
choose.  I can say from experience in Ontario our friend Mike 
Harris has changed municipalities around so often we are not sure 
what we are any more.  That is a scary sight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think it is necessary to consult all the time but I do 
think it is the neighbourly thing to do.  We should consult 
because we live next door.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think it is necessary to put that in the legislation. 
If I am to expropriate a particular piece of property on reserve 
because I am building a subdivision and I want to build a road 
where there are two houses, I do not believe I should have to 
talk to somebody in Vancouver about that if I am a thousand miles 
away.  I think this is a frivolous and unnecessary amendment to 
the bill.  As we know, if one wants to expropriate and some 
people do not agree they can go to the courts under this piece of 
legislation.  They have rights just like we do.  That is fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If members of the opposition really want to help first nations 
people out of poverty, they should think about this as far as 
accountability of fairness goes, stop playing politics with the 
issue, and stop believing that first nations are municipalities 
because they are not.  They are more than that.  They sign 
treaties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If one wants to look at it from the perspective of the Liberals, 
first nations are more like provinces in jurisdiction.  They are 
our partners and we will deal with it in that way.  We cannot 
deal with it in the way we deal with municipalities because if we 
do we are destined to fail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a great beginning but there is a long way to go.  Only 
14 first nations have taken the leap to look at the new 
opportunity to have direct land management on reserves.  I wish 
all 51 first nations in my area, once they have had an 
opportunity to review this legislation, will make the decision to 
follow suit because what we are trying to do is create economic 
development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wanted to add my words today to those of the government side 
and tell the opposition members to get real.  If they really want 
to see unemployment go down, they should start allowing first 
nations to have some control over their own lives.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, right off, I 
want to congratulate the first nations on their patience.  I am 
sure they are watching the debate this afternoon, because they 
have been in on the debate since the start.  I remember even 
that the 14 first nations were here in the last Parliament when 
Bill C-75 was introduced.  I know they have worked long and must 
be very impatient to have this bill passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to give some clarification on the course of this bill, 
because there have been all sorts of rumours. The first nations 
even thought at one point that the Bloc Quebecois was 
intentionally holding up the process, which was entirely wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to note, and I hope to read it in </I>Hansard<I> tomorrow, that 
I myself asked my House leader to speed up the process, to ask 
the government to put it on the parliamentary agenda as soon as 
possible.  I think we were initiators in this matter, the people 
who really supported the bill of the 14 first nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was not even a request from the government before the 
recent recess.  The Liberal Party should have sought unanimous 
consent to extend the debate, but it did not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not in charge of the government's agenda.  We can only 
follow.  We are as anxious as the first nations to see this bill 
pass. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the Reform Party amendments, I have examined those that 
are grouped.  There are three motions.  I have a problem with 
the following wording in Motion No. 6: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—that the governing bodies of neighbouring jurisdictions have 
confirmed in writing that consultations respecting the land code 
have been completed— 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my view, this gives neighbouring jurisdictions a veto. 
Implementation of the land code and self-government for these 
first nations could be put off indefinitely, merely by claiming 
that consultations have not been completed and refusing to 
confirm in writing that they have been. 
There would then be an obligation to negotiate almost 
indefinitely, if that was what people wanted.  There is a 
certain danger here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to develop the concept of consultation, which the Reform 
Party often tells us is important.  And right they are.  But to 
go from that to provisions that could paralyse a process, or 
postpone it indefinitely, is something else again.  On the topic 
of consultation,  I look at how the first nations have lived 
here in North America long before our arrival.

<A HREF="#LINKT60"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Were they consulted when we landed in North America, in Quebec, 
in Canada, and decided to take over their lands and gradually 
squeeze them out? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Were they consulted when the decision was made to create 
residential schools and to break the aboriginal culture and 
language?  The children were sought out systematically on the 
reserves and taken to the residential schools.  Were the 
aboriginal people consulted properly?  Of course not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Were they consulted when the Indian Act was passed a hundred 
years ago or so, that obsolete piece of legislation that is 
still in force in Canada? 
It is close to being an embarrassment.  There are clauses in 
this act which date back to the last century.  At that time, the 
Indian agent had to be asked for permission to raise cattle on 
the reserve, to grow grain to feed the cattle.  The act is full 
of incongruities such as these. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All this to say that we whites have never done much in the way 
of consulting the aboriginal people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I referred to the aboriginal schools, but one could also refer 
to the treaties.  Some of my colleagues have spoken of their 
ancestors saying “Sign no treaties”.  The royal commission has 
certainly demonstrated very clearly that there has been a kind 
of reneging on signatures to treaties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has been seen recently with the social union.  Sometimes 
agreements are short-lived. 
A document is signed, and then within two or three days, they 
are reneging on their signature.  As the Premier of Quebec has 
said, the ink was not even dry on the document and they were 
already reneging on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is how it was in the past with the aboriginal people.  The 
treaties contained certain clauses.  These were nation-to-nation 
treaties telling the people “We will put you on reserves.  We 
will look after your health”.  Now, as soon as they set foot off 
the reserve, that is the end of it, the government no longer 
looks after them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for consultation, I believe that the concept ought perhaps to 
be pushed to the limit.  It is true that the aboriginal people 
have not been consulted.  Today, when the shoe is on the other 
foot and the aboriginal people want to assume responsibility for 
themselves, extreme consultation is going to be demanded, and we 
are going to protect ourselves in advance to the extreme against 
any potential aboriginal encroachment on our lands, our gardens, 
our pocketbooks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When people are told “We will give you the chance to fly on your 
own and to take control of your affairs”, provisions must not be 
included preventing them from doing so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it important to intervene with respect to the motions in 
Group No. 1, but I draw members' attention to the fact that 
there is a problem as well, and I hope we will have time today 
to speak to the motions in Group No. 2.  Some people have 
touched on the problem.  The Indian Act I mentioned earlier is 
so antiquated that it contains no provision on marriage 
breakdown.  There are Bloc Quebecois amendments on this in the 
second group. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the motions in Group No. 1, I wanted to say that the Bloc 
cannot support the Reform Party amendments that require 
consultations be signed, written, notarized and the whole 
shebang.  We cannot have that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, on the subject of marriage breakdown, I think my 
colleagues should listen carefully.  Aboriginal women in Canada 
and many Canadian women's groups have asked us to intervene on 
this, because no provision in the law covers these women 
currently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are the victims of a legal void that must be filled.  I am 
not sure that we can fill it with our amendments, because we 
will be filling it for 14 first nations, when there are 625 in 
Canada.  But it is a start, and the aboriginal women have asked 
us to do this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will be speaking again when the House considers the motions in 
Group No. 2, to shore up my argument in favour of these women a 
little more. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>]

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is a pleasure to speak to the amendments on Bill C-49.  Let me 
say at the outset how disappointed I am that the government chose 
to invoke closure once again.  I believe it is the 48th time the 
government has done so since it came to power, setting an all 
time record and thereby cutting off debate on an extraordinarily 
important issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This issue is of fundamental importance especially to many 
aboriginal women and children who are uncomfortable with some of 
the provisions of Bill C-49.  It does not give the public the 
ability to find out as much as it should possibly know about a 
measure which will effectively establish a third level of 
government in Canada.

<A HREF="#LINKT61"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We condemn the government for what it has done and for its 
anti-democratic stance which reared its ugly head too often in 
the six years since it has been in power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me speak specifically to some of the provisions in the 
legislation.  Although the Reform Party is sympathetic to parts 
of Bill C-49, we do have grave concerns about other aspects of 
it.  I just mentioned one of those things a minute ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party has sought amendments to Bill C-49 to ensure 
that property division laws are put in place, to ensure that 
aboriginal women and children are properly treated on reserves 
after the legislation is in effect.  Many people have made the 
argument—and we have heard it from grassroots aboriginal 
women—that in the past sometimes on reserves they do not get 
proper treatment when it comes to the division of property in the 
case of a divorce, for instance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government claims to have a social conscience.  I 
would think it would be very concerned about this aspect or this 
vacuum in the legislation.  It opens the door for abuse and I am 
very concerned about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I condemn the government for not being more sensitive to the 
needs of aboriginal women and children.  It is unconscionable 
that the government would leave this to chance.  Many right 
thinking Canadians would be alarmed to find out that a Liberal 
government would sit idly by and allow this legislation to be 
pushed through when it could be amended to ensure that women and 
children on reserves are protected.  Sadly the government sits 
there and does nothing.  It sits on its moral high ground, 
pretending and mouthing words that it cares, but when it comes to 
action it does absolutely nothing.  That is unconscionable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second point I want to make concerns the arbitrary ability 
of the third level of government of reserves to essentially go 
ahead and make changes to leases, to expropriate property with 30 
days notice.  In many cases people have invested hundreds of 
thousands of dollars in this land.  Now they will be subject to 
what amounts to a very arbitrary process which would imperil 
their investments.  It is ridiculous that the government would 
allow it to go ahead without proper protection for investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague a moment ago was arguing how it would do so much 
for investment on reserves.  They have this arbitrary power and 
have exercised it already in other examples.  I know my colleague 
from Abbotsford will be speaking to this point in a moment.  I 
think it will completely negate any positive outcome that we 
might see by the implementation of Bill C-49.  That type of 
uncertainty will act as a disincentive to people to invest on 
Indian reserves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage my friends across the way after they invoked closure 
and before they plough it through to listen to what the Reform 
Party is suggesting, which is that there be some amendment to 
ensure that people's properties are protected when they sign 
leases with the bands that will be affected by the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My final point with respect to the amendments is on 
consultation.  I do not understand why the government is so 
opposed to the principle of consultation with municipalities that 
will be very dramatically affected by the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend from Kenora—Rainy River said we do not really need to 
have it in there because we do it as a matter of course.  I am 
afraid that does not sit very well with municipalities that will 
be at the mercy of the reserve, the band next door, and with 
absolutely no guarantees.  They will have millions of dollars of 
investments in infrastructure of various kinds and absolutely no 
consultations with the reserve next door.  I think that should be 
in the legislation.  I think the government should be chastised 
for not putting it in there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are three of our concerns with respect to Bill C-49:  no 
protection when it comes to property division laws, the arbitrary 
power to change leases, and no consultation with municipalities.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, it does raise the larger question of how to ensure that 
native people in Canada do come to enjoy the prosperity that many 
Canadians take for granted, which they have been left out of for 
a long time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point out to my friend across the way, who is trying to enter 
the debate, that for the last 130 years we have had mostly 
Liberal governments in Canada and they have not served natives 
well.  In fact natives have seen their standard of living fall. 
We have seen unbelievable levels of alcoholism on reserve.  We 
have seen absolutely shameful treatment of natives by this 
government.  It should hang its head in shame instead of 
pretending that a band-aid bill like Bill C-49 is somehow going 
to help them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge my friends across the way, if they really care about 
natives, to do the things that would really help natives.  My 
friend from Peace River had an excellent suggestion.  What about 
adopting the idea of allowing natives to have title to fee simple 
property?  Every country in the world believes in private 
property, but this government is not prepared to give natives the 
ability to have private property on reserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We then end up in the situation where, although people can 
strive and work off reserve to build up their land and their 
assets, that is simply not possible if they want to stay on 
reserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is this government cutting off every chance that native 
people have to better themselves by not allowing that?  I think 
it is unbelievable that the government clings to this vestige of 
community property which simply does not work.  It does not work 
anywhere in the world, but the government seems to think it is 
the solution.  It is backwards and it is behind the times, but 
the government continues to hang on to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government should do a better job of listening to grassroot 
natives.  We had an example not long ago where we had grassroot 
natives who were asked to write the minister so they could tell 
her about some of the abuses that occur on reserves across 
Canada.  What happened when they wrote to the minister in 
confidence?  Someone in the minister's department sent the letter 
back to the band council, which ended up suing the person who 
sent the letter in confidence.  That is unbelievable but that is 
how this government treats natives in Canada today.  I think it 
is ridiculous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could point to a hundred other examples of how grassroot 
natives are treated disdainfully by this government.  Grassroot 
Reformers and Reform MPs have talked to hundreds of natives 
across Canada who have nothing but disdain for the way this 
government allows some of the abuses to continue on native 
reserves in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While my friends across the way can talk in that high moral tone 
about how they care and how compassionate they are, in the end 
their actions simply do not match their words.  We see natives in 
terrible trouble in Canada today.  Those members should hang 
their heads in shame. 
<P><A NAME="LINK214"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, it 
is a pleasure to address this bill today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As other people have said before me, I too am very disappointed 
that the government has chosen for the 48th time to use time 
allocation to shut down debate on this bill.  I hope, as it says, 
it is trying to give power to the aboriginal people at whatever 
level of government it thinks this is going to slot into. I hope 
the government is not suggesting to those aboriginal people, who 
are hopefully going to form some sort of new and improved 
democratic system amongst their own people, that they follow the 
Liberal example of shutting down debate in an open forum.  I 
certainly hope that is not their hope and dream. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Someone recently explained to me what the definition of insanity 
is.  Insanity is explained as doing the same thing over and over 
again and expecting a different result every time.  If that is 
the case, then I think the Liberal government is pushing the very 
levels of insanity.  It thinks that by tinkering with the way it 
treats aboriginal people, by tinkering with something like this 
land management bill, that somehow prosperity will spring from 
the ground and aboriginal people will suddenly be much better off 
because of it.  But such is not the case.

<A HREF="#LINKT63"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is again treating aboriginal people not the same 
as all other Canadians, but in a special category, a separate 
category.  It is not like a municipal government.  It is not 
really like a provincial government.  It is some other sort of 
government that will get different treatment, like the 
aboriginals have had for far too long in this country.  Instead 
of having full and equal access to all parts of the Canadian 
mosiac they are shuffled off into a special category, with a 
special set rules, a special set of tax laws, special land use 
contracts and all that stuff.  Suddenly they expect that they 
will become as prosperous as other Canadians.  It is not going to 
happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have 15 reserves in my riding.  I am quite familiar with the 
issues.  I met last week with realtors in my riding who sell both 
titled land, fee simple land, as well as land and houses that are 
leased from aboriginal groups and sold as condominium 
developments and so on in the local area.  These realtors, which 
represent some of the finest developers and realtors in our area, 
are more than willing to sell this product. They know about the 
bill.  Their question is:  What are we to tell our clients about 
the certainty of the land we are selling to them?  They are 
selling land based on a 99 year lease.  They say that there is a 
99 year lease so it is okay.  They say that may well be, but look 
at what has happened with the Musqueam Band.  Instead of helping 
the aboriginal people to develop their land with surety and 
certainty, they are pulling away and backing off.  Instead of the 
much needed funds that aboriginal people need to develop their 
land and their opportunities, that money is drying up because 
people are saying they cannot be sure of the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not just the Reform Party that is saying this.  I would 
like to quote from a letter that was sent by the leader of the 
Liberal Party of British Columbia.  When it comes to land use and 
assurances about expropriation and so on, Gordon Campbell writes 
in his letter: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was given similar assurances by former Minister Tom Siddon that 
Musqueam leaseholders' rights and interests would be fully 
protected before he would sign off on the transfer of authority 
over these leases to the band. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was a promise made by a minister of the government to 
Gordon Campbell when he was the mayor of Vancouver.  The minister 
promised him that the rights and interests would be fully 
protected.  That commitment was not honoured. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He further wrote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Musqueam Band is now using their unchecked authority to 
extract unconscionable lease and tax hikes from those residents, 
while your government has sat idly by and done nothing. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we have to live with this sort of bill it does not become a 
theoretical exercise.  It does not become an esoteric discussion 
of the pros and cons of clauses 4, 5 and 6 and the rest of it. It 
becomes an absolute economic life and death issue to the people 
who are concerned.  They do not say whatever and take their 
chances.  The proof is in the pudding.  The proof is that we 
cannot trust the government if it is not in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One minister may have good intentions.  I never doubt the 
Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development.  She says 
whatever she says in the House and I take it at face value until 
proven otherwise.  The problem is that if it is not in the bill 
we cannot trust the word of anyone in this place.  We cannot 
trust it because that minister may be gone tomorrow.  There may 
be somebody else in her place.  That minister could conveniently 
forget.  There could be a challenge to the constitutionality of 
it or the finality of it by an Indian band.  There could be a 
regular court challenge.  Who knows where it might end up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By not explicitly covering the concerns that we have brought 
forward in amendment, then I believe the government is ensuring 
that because of that uncertainty we will doom aboriginal people 
again not to be treated like others, but to be treated 
differently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a shame.  As I discussed with the realtors the other 
day, we can show example after example around the world where the 
creation of wealth, the creation of prosperity, is contingent on 
the right to own, possess and enjoy property.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some things we might want to do as a collectivity.  We 
might want to have the local arena owned as a collectivity.  But 
when everything we touch is owned as a collectivity, then how are 
we ever going to have prosperity?  It cannot work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I shake my head over a similar kind of philosophy which exists 
in the Nisga'a agreement. In my province there are particular 
types of industries that are in decline.  I can name them.  I 
used to be in one of them.  I was a logging contractor.  The 
future for logging is not what it once was in our province.  It 
is a declining industry.  It certainly is very important, but for 
a variety of reasons, including the actions of this government, 
it is in decline. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about the fishing industry?  It is not the industry it once 
was.  It is a very important industry, it is still a key 
industry, but it is not, as a percentage of our provincial 
output, what it once was.  I could give other examples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are they doing with the Nisga'a agreement?  They are making 
a deal with this group of people to ensure that they are stuck in 
industries which are doomed not to grow.  They will make sure 
they stay in those industries which are in decline.  They will 
make them hewers of wood, carriers of water and fishermen.  That 
will suddenly spring great prosperity upon these people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has basically told these people that it is going 
to give them the industries that are in decline and it will take 
all the rest of it.  It will create the wealth and enjoy the 
prosperity, and they can stay on their land out there and be tied 
to the industries that are in decline.  The government will take 
the cream of the crop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again aboriginal people are going to be shuffled off to the side 
and told to take what they are given.  The government will take 
the prosperous, the growing, the innovative industries for 
itself.  What a shame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to the concerns I mentioned about private property 
being treated differently and the fact that without certainty we 
are not going to get development, and without assurances on 
consultation with local municipalities we are not going to get 
good, harmonious working relationships, besides the obvious, I 
would like to mention another part of this letter that is very 
alarming.  It is the same letter from the Liberal leader of the 
opposition in British Columbia who writes about why this bill 
scares aboriginal women living on reserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When this bill passes there will be no assurances on the breakup 
of a marriage that the woman will have any access to what we 
would say is rightfully hers, half of the property the couple has 
built together.  The reason we have so many signatures from so 
many aboriginal women's groups saying “Please do not pass this 
bill” is because they are afraid for their financial well-being 
in the case of marital breakdown. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When this government pays lip service both to aboriginal people 
and to women, saying that it is concerned about both, and in this 
case proves that it is not concerned about either, then I share 
the concern of those women who have come to us.  All I can do is 
empathize with them, tell them that we do not agree with the bill 
and that we are doing everything we can to put amendments in 
place to protect them.  We will continue to work on their behalf.

</I></B></P><P align=left>He said: Madam Speaker, I was a bit worried that this group of 
motions could not be considered today, because they have been 
the focus of many representations from native women's groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Representations were also made to the parliamentary committee. 
The British Columbia Native Women's Society met with us, as did 
the National Native Women's Conference, of which Marilyn 
Buffalo, to whom I pay tribute, is a member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the time, the view was that, in a first nation, it was the 
band council's right to decide.  Those who came to testify 
during consideration of the bill by the committee seemed to say 
that their respective communities had been fully consulted. 
There were even petitions from women's groups saying that the 
bill was excellent and should be passed as written. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, following consideration of the bill by the committee, 
many other representations were made, in particular by  Quebec's 
native women.   Finally, the Bloc Quebecois decided to 
intervene. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an important point, I believe.  I mentioned it earlier. 
The Indian Act, which is over a hundred years old, contains no 
provision for marriage breakdown.  This means that, when a 
marriage breaks down on a reserve, the man can often order the 
woman out of the family home.  The woman is simply kicked out 
and obliged to find shelter elsewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Contrary to provincial legislation, there is no provision for 
the protection of matrimonial property or its division.  There 
is absolutely nothing.  It is a complete legal vacuum. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1720"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT67"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT67"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1720

<A HREF="#LINKT66"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>So the women started to show an interest in this issue.  They 
came to meet us, telling us that perhaps some amendments ought 
to be moved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 14 first nations are the pioneers as far as settling this 
issue is concerned.  As the act states, the 14 first nations are 
to prepare a property code, but where marriage breakdown is 
concerned, they have 12 months to include arrangements for 
settling this matter in their respective codes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our problem, however, is that during those 12 months no 
application will be possible, that is to say the legal vacuum 
will continue.  Hence the importance of our introducing an 
amendment which will cover that 12 month period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Looked at overall, this is a major problem for Canada.  There 
are no provisions at the moment, and if the proposed amendments 
are accepted, they will settle the matter for 14 first nations 
in Canada, whereas there are 600 in all.  The underlying issue 
must therefore be settled.  Will there be an amendment to the 
Indian Act?  Will there be special legislation?  This could 
always be looked into. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister had clearly understood the dynamics and knows there 
is a legal vacuum.  In June of last year, she decided to set up 
a focus group.  In June 1998, she told a group of British 
Columbia native women “I am going to set up a focus group so 
that you can cast some light on the issue for me”.  To our great 
surprise, confusion and disappointment, not one thing has been 
done to date.  No one has been appointed. 
The matter has not been given the importance it deserves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois is therefore obliged today to introduce 
amendments today to include provisions in the bill so that, in 
these 14 first nations, when a couple faces problems and the 
marriage breaks down, various questions can be answered, 
including: What will happen exactly to the family home?  What 
happens to the family heritage?  How will the basic question be 
resolved, as the provincial laws provide? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is where the problem lies.  That is related to the decision 
in the Derrickson case.  I cannot remember the year, but it is 
fairly recent.  This lady went to the supreme court to have the 
matter decided, and the court said simply “Madam, there is no 
provision in the Indian Act to protect you”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore the legal void has existed since then, and the 
government has, unfortunately, not corrected the situation. 
There is also some danger if this problem is not solved in 
general terms.  This is what native women have said.  They have 
said “Every time a bill on economic matters or management 
matters comes before the House of Commons, we are going to ask 
you to introduce amendments”.  I think it is important therefore 
to resolve the matter in its entirety and not piecemeal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every time a native bill comes before the House, there will 
likely be serious representation from native women.  They will 
say “You will introduce amendments to the bill to remedy this 
legal void that has existed now for 100 years”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois said “We will introduce amendments, even 
though we know the basic issue is not settled”. 
We have already questioned the minister on the issue generally. 
We will also continue to ask the minister what is going to be 
done about this problem, which may well get worse over time. 
There will soon be legislation with respect to the Nisga'a, to 
water management in Nunavut, to a host of problems that could 
end up with native women demanding amendments because they have 
been overlooked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The situation could get very difficult in the weeks, months and 
years to come, unless the underlying issue is resolved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also wish to pay tribute to the 14 first nations who were the 
groundbreakers, as it were.  It was they who pointed out that 
there was a problem, even though they were going to be allowed 
to govern themselves. 
They pointed out that the Indian Act would no longer apply, that 
they would be responsible for land management.  But they 
realized that there would be a problem, that women were not 
protected.  These people had therefore already done a very good 
study by the time they appeared before the committee.

<A HREF="#LINKT67"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, there are still at least eight or nine first nations 
that have not finished examining the issue and have undertaken 
to do so in the next 12 months.  We will have to take our lead 
from the work these people have done, because they are the first 
to look at the problem.  One day, this will have to take in more 
than the 14 first nations.  Otherwise, every time a native bill 
is introduced in the House, it will be held up by those who want 
amendments introduced to deal with the issue of women's rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The situation is clear, and I would like to draw it to the 
attention of members opposite.  They could perhaps test the 
feasibility by starting with this bill.  Once again, the 
provisions before us today cover only the 12 months in which 
women are still in a legal vacuum.  After that, there is a 
mechanism in the bill providing for mandatory arbitration in the 
event agreement is not reached. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means that the issue will go to arbitration and be 
resolved, but only for the 14 first nations, not for the 600 
others, hence the importance of dealing with the problem today. 
I urge members to support these amendments and give these people 
another 12 months in which to give some thought to their land 
code and include provisions for marriage breakdown. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So as to avoid a 12-month legal vacuum, we will implement the 
provisions before us today, the amendments moved by my 
colleague, the member for Laval East, and myself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore urge my colleague to support these amendments.  I am 
anxious to hear from them, even if time is running out, as the 
vote is at 6.15 p.m. I hope they will vote in favour so as to 
cover this legal vacuum for once and for all for these 14 first 
nations.  For its part, the Bloc Quebecois undertakes to 
pressure the government to come up with a comprehensive solution 
to the problem.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Iftody (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I would like to speak in support of Bill C-49 and 
address a number of important questions that have arisen as a 
result of the question of matrimonial property, an important and 
legitimate question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members are aware, the bill ratifies a framework agreement 
that will provide 14 first nations with authority to manage their 
lands at the community level and to pass laws for the 
development, conservation, protection, management, use and 
possession of their land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is a good bill, one which gives first nation 
communities control over their future, provides new opportunities 
to work with neighbouring communities, and creates jobs and 
growth both on and off reserve.  It is above all a bill that 
arises from the desire and the will of the 14 nations 
participating in this process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As hon. members know, matters involving changes to the Indian 
Act and the provisions of new powers and responsibilities for 
first nations can be very complicated and, as we have seen here 
today, complex.  The complexity has become more apparent in the 
past couple of years as the framework agreement took shape and 
began to elicit discussions among first nations.  What is 
inspiring about this process is the capacity for first nations 
communities to find ways to resolve issues that have arisen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one is suggesting that the federal government step in and 
resolve issues on their behalf.  We seek instead to provide a 
legislative framework in which the communities can get on with 
the task of running their own lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A good example concerns how matrimonial property will be dealt 
with in the case of matrimonial breakdown.  The signatory first 
nations will be at the forefront of this issue.  They have agreed 
to tackle an issue that today the government is grappling with: 
how to address the legislative gap respecting matrimonial real 
property on an Indian reserve.  This is a complex legal issue 
that must be resolved in the interest of fairness and equity.  I 
am glad to see that the first nations agreed to this process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me outline for the House the nature of this issue and the 
steps that are proposed to be taken to resolve these important 
questions.  In the Derrickson v Derrickson case the Supreme Court 
of Canada highlighted this issue very succinctly for us. 
Here was a case where matters respecting matrimonial property 
were challenged before the courts.  This case provided clear 
direction respecting reserve lands and access to marital real 
property rights. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1730"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT68"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The supreme court ruled that provincial laws respecting the 
division of matrimonial property assets in cases of matrimonial 
breakdown applied except to interests in reserve land. Reserve 
land being within federal jurisdiction, provincial laws 
respecting use, occupation, possession and division of an 
interest in cases of matrimonial breakdown are not applicable to 
interests in reserve land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In March 1997 the British Columbia Native Women's Society and 
two individual plaintiffs mentioned the framework agreement in a 
suit launched against the government in the Federal Court of 
Canada.  The plaintiffs claimed that the federal government 
failed to fulfill its fiduciary obligations to married Indian 
women with respect to the division of matrimonial real property 
upon the breakdown of marriage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As hon. members are aware, division of matrimonial property, and 
I know that some across the way do not know this because they 
argued contrary to that only a few moments ago, falls within 
provincial jurisdiction. The provinces apply the principle of 
division of matrimonial assets on an equal basis.  However, 
reserve lands are held by Her Majesty in trust of the crown for 
the use and benefit of the band.  Provincial laws therefore 
cannot be replicated in their entirety on the reserve lands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the federal level there is no provision in the Indian Act 
regarding the division of matrimonial property in the event of a 
marital breakdown.  Non-band members and non-aboriginal people 
cannot hold an interest in first nations land, nor can they 
reside there without the permission of the first nation council 
or the community.  That has been in the Indian Act and 
understood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where a lawful interest has been granted to an Indian member of 
the band, this interest cannot be reassigned unless the 
individual agrees to the transfer.  In addition the transfer 
cannot be made to the band or another Indian member of the band. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of Derrickson v Derrickson at the supreme court, the 
courts provided that compensation can be provided for the reserve 
assets which cannot be divided.  The end result is that the 
assets are still divided equally between spouses.  However, there 
is no access to an order transferring the matrimonial home or 
interest in reserve land, the same order that would be available 
outside a reserve to a woman or a man going through a marriage 
breakdown. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members will appreciate the problem.  The 14 first nations 
want to get out from under the land management provisions of the 
Indian Act.  Provincial laws respecting property cannot be 
applied.  There must be a solution to resolving how to divide the 
matrimonial property that both will be equitable and respectful 
of the capacity of first nations to come up with a system that is 
in keeping with the values of their own community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First nations are seeking the authority to develop solutions 
that fulfill the needs of their communities and the interests of 
equity.  The 14 first nations and Canada have amended the 
framework agreement and the bill before us to address the issue 
of matrimonial property on first nations land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The signatories have agreed to address these issues of property 
rights in the framework agreement and the bill before us today. 
Under Bill C-49 and the framework agreement the signatory first 
nation must, not should, shall or may, but must establish a 
community process that will develop rules and procedures within 
12 months from the date the land code takes effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rules and procedures cannot discriminate on the basis of sex 
and include a process of arbitration should the first nations not 
meet those criteria.  That would provide sufficient, broad based 
and complementary protections to those offered in the charter 
that of course apply in this particular piece of legislation.  It 
has to be done in 12 months.  It cannot discriminate.  More 
importantly in that process, even if the women in a particular 
community vote in a way that makes others unhappy, there is an 
appeal process that is allowed both in the framework agreement 
and the bill. 
That allows those who are grieved to seek redress properly if 
they so choose within the context of that agreement.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the bill before us, extensive consultations must be 
undertaken during the development of the land code to inform and 
seek the opinions of the community membership.  First nations 
have given strong assurances that as part of their first nations 
community process they will solicit the input of all on and off 
reserve members of their community, including aboriginal women. 
Nothing precludes a community from addressing the issue at the 
beginning of the process.  The important point is that the 
community decides when and how it will address these issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A dispute resolution mechanism will be available to both Canada 
and the individual first nation members.  I repeat that 
individual members can also challenge the rules before a court. 
Yes, before a court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a larger issue at stake here, one that goes beyond the 
14 first nations that have ratified the agreement.  What can be 
done to resolve the current vacuum concerning the division of 
matrimonial property in the Indian Act? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last June the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development announced that she was prepared to work in 
partnership with these groups in establishing a fact finding 
process with respect to the Indian Act.  This process will 
examine the effects upon breakdown of a marriage on first nations 
members' rights to real property such as land and homes.  Federal 
officials are now working toward the conclusion of this process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is committed with those member bands who have 
agreed to sign on to this process to work with them fairly and 
equitably with redress to the courts, the normal appeal 
processes, the provisions of the charter, all of which will apply 
to protect the legitimate rights of aboriginal women in Canada 
today.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, before I get 
into my remarks I would like to rebut a couple of things the 
parliamentary secretary had to say.  I am pleased to see him here 
but it is unfortunate he has not yet seen fit to apologize to the 
Musqueam residents about whom he said some erroneous things.  I 
have to be careful about the words I use here.  Many of them have 
written to him and have asked for an apology for statements he 
made in this House but he has not seen fit yet to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part of what he said was that band members on reserve who do not 
like what is going on can go to court.  The answer the government 
comes up with all the time is that they can litigate. What kind 
of an answer is that?  Go out and litigate.  If they do choose to 
litigate, Bill C-49 is the guideline the courts will be compelled 
to use when adjudicating any actions that are brought. It is 
obvious that if there is no specific guideline in Bill C-49 with 
respect to the disposition of marital property, the courts will 
be at a loss to determine how they will resolve that issue, as 
they are now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary is wrong.  This failure to include 
these protections is very simple.  These amendments go a long way 
toward putting those kinds of protections into the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will read something into the record.  Some of my colleagues 
spoke earlier about a letter written by Gordon Campbell, the 
leader of the official opposition in British Columbia.  He makes 
a number of observations about Bill C-49 and he makes some 
recommendations about how it can be fixed.  He says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, there appears to be no guarantee that women will have 
equal protection of property rights as men under the rules 
governing the breakdown of marriages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As you know, some aboriginal women have alleged that women 
living on reserve have not always been treated fairly by band 
councils when marriages fail.  They maintain that men have 
sometimes been granted preferential treatment with regard to 
housing issues, because property division laws that protect other 
Canadians do not apply on reserve.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>All aboriginal women are asking for are the same rights that all 
other Canadian women have from coast to coast in this country. 
Why is this government refusing to give them that kind of 
protection in Bill C-49? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will go on to quote Mr. Campbell, the Liberal leader of the 
official opposition in British Columbia: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—the act must be amended to ensure that the expropriation powers 
granted to first nations under section 28 cannot be abused.  In 
view of the recent controversy on the Musqueam reserve, it is 
understandable that some non-native leaseholders are very worried 
about how first nations might be able to use their expropriation 
powers. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, a very simple amendment would provide the protection that 
non-native leaseholders are looking for, and indeed native 
leaseholders because we know that those circumstances exist as 
well.  Again we have the government turning tail and refusing to 
listen to ordinary Canadians and grassroots aboriginal people 
about real concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to read into the record a letter that was written by 
Wendy Lockhart Lundberg who is a Squamish band member. This 
letter was written to the hon. minister of Indian affairs on 
January 31: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dear Minister, 
</UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a Canadian citizen and status member of the Squamish 
Nation.  I urge you to stop Bill C-49 from becoming legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did not know that the band council that I elected to represent 
me signed an agreement regarding land management.  I did not know 
that the Squamish Nation sat before a Senate committee in Ottawa 
in December, 1998 and made representations on my behalf. I was 
informed by band council about treaty negotiations which would 
allow me to participate in an open and democratic process in 
determining the future of the Squamish Nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am concerned that legislated council power will supersede the 
band's own land code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am concerned that the minimum participation of eligible 
members required to vote on the land code and process is only 25% 
which, for the Squamish Nation, currently represents, 
approximately, the number of members employed by the band. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am concerned about the consequences of legislation that will 
not protect women upon marriage breakdown.  I am concerned that 
if Bill C-49 is passed that native women will not have the 
protection of property division laws equal to all other Canadian 
women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am concerned about the content of Bill C-49, which legislates 
council power in their opinion to expropriate land.  I am 
concerned that the claim made by my mother, Nona Lockhart, to her 
father, Henry Baker's property, will never be realized and could 
be permanently lost through expropriation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am concerned that even though my mother was reinstated, 
pursuant to Bill C-31, that council will continue to exclude her 
from her property rights. I do not hold hope that if in 14 years 
they have not returned her property to her that her plight and 
situation will improve if Bill C-49 is passed.  I do not hold 
hope that if in 14 years they have not welcomed her to return to 
live among her family and friends on reserve where she was born 
and raised, that power legislated to council pursuant to Bill 
C-49 will end the discrimination she has suffered and endured 
ever since she married a non-native in 1947. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to read into the record a letter from Marcella 
Baker, also a Squamish Band member, written to Senator Ray 
Perrault: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dear Senator Perrault, 
</UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This letter comes to you in a state of dismay and disbelief.  I 
have just received a copy of—press release “Liberals Ready to 
Invoke Closure to Pass Bill C-49” dated February 23, 1999, 
regarding the above-mentioned proposed legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member of the Squamish Nation, I cannot believe that the 
Government of Canada is going to literally push this piece of 
discriminating legislation down our throats, without regard to 
the opposition we have presented to our members of Parliament and 
yourself. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>She wrote to Jane Stewart, the Minister of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development on January 21, 1999— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The hon. member for Skeena knows that 
he cannot refer to a minister or a member of the House by his or 
her name.  I would urge him to be careful.  He cannot do it even 
under the guise of reading from another document.  He has to be 
very careful.  I know he knows the rule in that regard and just 
forgot.  Perhaps he will be careful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott:</B>  I take your point, Mr. Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She wrote to the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development on January 21, 1999.  The letter goes on: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this letter, I asked her a set of questions that I thought 
were legitimate.  Yet, with no response from her, it makes me 
wonder if she operates her department like our elected council 
operates our affairs, on our behalf. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Isn't that a scary thought?  I am hoping that you, as Senator, 
do not condone the actions of either of these parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have presented our case of non-communication, non-democracy 
and total opposition to this proposed legislation and we have 
nowhere else to turn.  We will be saddled with legislation that 
will once again, make native women fight for their rights with 
their elected chiefs and councils.  I am sure that this is not 
the intention of the Senate Committee on Aboriginal Affairs.  I 
urge you to please consider stopping this proposed legislation at 
your level.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I have one more letter to read into the record.  This has to do 
with the expropriation of provisions of this bill.  It is written 
by a real estate agent in Vancouver, Dexter Associates Realty, to 
a Mr. Less Cosman who is a former resident of the Musqueam 
reserve: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dear Les, 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Re:  4314 Staulo Crescent, Vancouver, B.C. 
</UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further to our conversation regarding the MLS listing on the 
above noted property, enclosed please find a copy of the 
information I have obtained on Bill C-49 and the framework 
agreement on first nation land management.  It is my 
understanding that Bill C-49 has gone through two readings in the 
House of Commons; once it has passed a third reading through the 
Senate, it becomes in full force and effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The impact of draft Bill C-49 will have a devastating effect on 
the value and the marketability of your home.  In Section 28.1 of 
Bill C-49 the Musqueam Band will have the authority to 
expropriate your home for any band use they may decide upon.  In 
Section 28.5 and 6, which refers to compensation for 
expropriation, the band would be required to pay fair 
compensation and of course if you do not feel that it is 
satisfactory, you may appeal to the band itself, as set out in 
the framework agreement.  Your recourse may have little or no 
concrete effect.  Also the maximum notice for expropriation is 30 
days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regrettably, I recommend we immediately cease any and all 
attempts to market your home at this time.  In my professional 
opinion, there will not be any buyer prepared to purchase a 
property with this type of encumbrance. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are literally tens of thousands of leaseholders across 
Canada with leasehold interests on native reserves.  Think how 
they will feel when they wake up and realize that their leasehold 
interests on reserve lands across Canada have no market value 
whatsoever; 60,000 in Ontario, 20,000 in British Columbia, tens 
of thousands across the country and these people here are willing 
to sell them out.  They are not willing to consider the 
amendments to protect those leaseholders. I say shame on this 
government. 
<P><A NAME="LINK220"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is my 
pleasure to speak on Bill C-49 today and specifically on Bloc 
Motions Nos. 2, 3, 4 and 5. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These amendments make provisions within the legislation 
regarding matrimonial property.  This was discussed at committee 
and the B.C. Native Women's Society requested a number of 
amendments to ensure that provincial standards are met until the 
land codes, developed by the individual first nations, are 
established. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Allowing provincial standards to set the minimum standards for 
dealing with matrimonial property would be welcome if there were 
not already provisions within the framework agreement to ensure 
protection in the event of matrimonial breakdowns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation as it stands allows the first nations to 
develop their own requirements and standards with regard to 
matrimonial breakdowns within broad guidelines.  If provincial 
laws are imposed on the first nations, it impedes the objective 
of this legislation, namely to allow first nations to have 
greater control over management of their land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to note that this legislation deals specifically 
with resources so when discussing matrimonial property, it only 
includes the land but has no jurisdiction regarding children or 
financial assets other than property. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While it is important to ensure that matrimonial property is 
handled fairly for all parties involved should a marriage break 
down, the land codes developed with community consultation and 
approval should be enough to ensure that this occurs.  A dispute 
resolution process is also in place should the need for it arise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These amendments therefore question the objective of this 
legislation without being necessary to ensure adequate protection 
for the participants involved in a matrimonial breakdown. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill speaks to much more than just matrimonial division of 
assets in the event of a possible matrimonial breakdown for first 
nations that have signed this land code. 
This land code is a far too important piece of legislation to be 
lost by some of the amendments that have been introduced to it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was at an event in Nova Scotia this morning.  It was the 
unveiling of the newest quarter from the Canadian mint. It is a 
logging coin.  The reason I bring this up is that since 1749 my 
family has been involved in the logging business and the sawmill 
industry in Nova Scotia.  In the 1940s my grandfather ran the 
last steam mill that was located in New Ross, Nova Scotia where I 
grew up. In nearly 250 years never once as a landowner in Nova 
Scotia did we ask anybody if we could cut timber on our own land. 
Never once beyond the modern environmental guidelines did we ever 
ask somebody if we had the right to pursue an industry on our own 
property. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My sons are sixth generation on the small farm I live on. If we 
want to cut pulp wood, if we want to cut logs, if we want to 
build a fence, if we want to put in a pasture, if we want to 
build a road not once have we asked anybody if we could.  That is 
what this deal is about, the ability of first nations to get out 
from under the umbrella of the Indian Act and to decide for 
themselves what they want to do on their own property. It is to 
make sure that they have the ability to do that.  Prior to this 
piece of legislation they did not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a fact the House has to look at.  It is high time that we 
dealt with the subject.  We have ignored it for far too long.  It 
is a good piece of legislation and I support it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK221"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Beth Phinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Revenue, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to speak 
in support of Bill C-49, the first nations land management act, 
and in opposition to Motion No. 2 in which the hon. member for 
Saint-Jean wishes to provide an interim matrimonial real property 
regime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As this House is aware, the 14 first nations that signed the 
framework agreement have agreed to spell out rules on matrimonial 
real property rights that were not included when the agreement 
was drafted.  The bill before us and the agreement spell out that 
the signatory first nations must establish a community process 
that will develop rules and procedures for a matrimonial property 
regime within 12 months from the date the land code takes effect. 
The rules and procedures cannot discriminate on the basis of sex. 
In the case where a first nation has not addressed the matter the 
crown may invoke an arbitrary clause to seek closure from the 
first nation on its rules and procedures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the bill before us extensive consultations must be 
taken during the development of the land code to inform and seek 
the opinions of the community membership.  First nations have 
given strong assurances that as part of their first nations 
community process they will solicit the input of all on and off 
reserve members of their community, including aboriginal women. 
I point out that nothing precludes the community from addressing 
this issue at the beginning of the land code process.  The 
important point is that the community decides how it will address 
the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the new regime first nations will be able to develop their 
own rules and procedures on the use and occupancy of their lands 
by band members, non-band members and non-aboriginal people.  As 
well, a dispute resolution mechanism will be available to both 
Canada and individual first nation members.  Individuals can also 
challenge the rules before a court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should leave it to the first nations, using this process, to 
develop an appropriate regime to deal with matrimonial property 
in the case of marital breakdown.  The hon. member for 
Saint-Jean, however, would like to provide for an interim 
solution while the first nations come to grips with the issue. 
He would amend the bill to provide an interim matrimonial real 
property regime until such time as the first nations themselves 
establish a regime within their land codes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His motion would remove a basket clause respecting individual 
agreements that have been negotiated by the parties to cover any 
other elements to which the first nations and the federal 
government agreed. 
That clause is important as it would allow the first nations and 
Canada the opportunity to adjust for unforeseen circumstances 
that could arise during the negotiations of individual 
agreements. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1755"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT73"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the effect of the motion would be to make it mandatory 
for the first nations and the Government of Canada to include in 
the individual agreements elements contained in the new 
amendment.  The effect of the amendment is to restrict the 
elements that would be included in the individual agreement. 
Therefore we cannot support this amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of the division of matrimonial property in the event 
of marital breakdown will be resolved by the first nations.  The 
communities themselves will decide.  But there is a larger issue 
at stake here, one that goes beyond the 14 first nations that 
have ratified the framework agreement and affects all first 
nations: what can be done to resolve the current vacuum 
concerning the division of matrimonial property in the Indian 
Act? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last June the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development announced that she was prepared to work in 
partnership with the aboriginal organizations to assess this 
issue and to establish a fact finding process with respect to the 
Indian Act.  This process will examine the effects upon breakdown 
of a marriage on first nations members' rights to real property 
such as land and homes.  Federal officials are now working to 
establish the fact finding process.  Letters of invitation have 
been sent to the aboriginal partners to participate in a meeting 
where the terms of reference for the fact finding process will be 
discussed. The minister will make further announcements on this 
initiative in the near future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly then in Bill C-49 we have 14 first nations that will 
address the issue of real matrimonial property through a 
community process.  Supporting this community process is the 
right thing to do, rather than having some imposed solution as 
proposed by these amendments. 
<P><A NAME="LINK222"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, in 
listening to the debate we cannot correct wrongs against one set 
of people by implementing rules or bills which work against 
another group.  With all due respect to those members who are 
from the Ontario area, I do not think for a moment that they 
understand the impact this bill will have on our province of 
British Columbia where about 90% of all of the Indian bands are 
located.  I just do not believe that they understand. Even if 
they do not understand, can they not look at all the letters of 
protest from the people who are supposed to be their friends? 
The Liberal Party of B.C. is opposed to this legislation.  Two 
hundred and sixty Squamish band members in my riding have signed 
petitions, sent me letters or phoned my office in opposition to 
this bill. Can these members not at least ask themselves the 
question that perhaps there is something wrong with this bill? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Three mayors in north and west Vancouver and the union of B.C. 
municipalities are now opposed to it, contrary to what was said 
by a member earlier this afternoon who was reading historical 
material.  It was because the union of B.C. municipalities did 
not understand the implications of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When some of the mayors started to talk to the UBCM and said 
what about this and what about that, suddenly they became aware 
of the implications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I read from the Vancouver </I>Sun<I> of Saturday. There was a 
major article about this bill in which band members were quoted. 
Squamish band member Wendy Lockart Lundberg says federal Reform 
members are the only elected officials who have helped her and 
other native women concerned about this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reformers are also the only members who have taken seriously the 
concerns of the mayors of the municipalities in our region.  I 
have spoken to Liberal members on the other side, a few of them 
from the Vancouver region.  They know the problems with this 
bill.  They have spoken also with the mayors in their areas. Some 
of them have even been to the meetings of the Musqueam 
leaseholders.  They know this bill is defective.  They would like 
to see it changed and they have told me that they have tried to 
get that message through to the minister.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a shame that the minister is being so obstinate about the 
bill.  I just do not understand why they will not make a few 
simple amendments to the bill that would make it possible for us 
to support it.  The basic idea of the bill is excellent. 
Everybody agrees this is the right thing to do, but we cannot 
have expropriations that do not have to comply with the 
Expropriation Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Elders on the Squamish reserve are afraid that their own chiefs 
will expropriate their certificates of possession, their right to 
live in the homes on the reserve.  We cannot pass a bill that 
allows that to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The municipalities are concerned that the land code can be 
developed in complete isolation of the surrounding communities. 
That just does not happen at a provincial level.  The 
municipalities of West Vancouver, the district of North Vancouver 
and the city of North Vancouver must consult with one another. 
There is no veto power, but when there is a new development they 
must consult.  That is what should be happening in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to read from a piece which appeared in the North 
Shore </I>News<I> this last Wednesday because it involves the 
Minister of National Revenue.  We just saw the Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Minister of National Revenue stand to support 
the bill.  Yet her boss knows nothing about the bill.  He does 
not understand it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He met with the three North Shore mayors in North Vancouver just 
prior to last Wednesday and told them they could appear as 
witnesses at the committee.  The hearings are already done.  It 
is all finished.  Here is the minister, from a Vancouver area 
riding right in the middle of the problems, and he does not know 
which way is up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mayor of West Vancouver, Pat Boname, whose husband ran 
against the member for West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast as a 
Liberal, a self-confessed Liberal, a card carrying Liberal, said, 
as quoted in the Vancouver </I>Sun<I> on Saturday, that it was a 
genuine concern, not a Reform ploy.  That is what West Vancouver 
Mayor Pat Boname said of the mayor's request that the bill be 
amended to require bands to consult with neighbouring communities 
before undertaking major development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast and I organized a 
meeting in late January with great difficulty.  We managed to get 
Chief Bill Williams to come along and we met with the three 
mayors.  At that meeting the chief indicated that we would be 
entering a new era of consultation and co-operation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A week and a half later the chief is on the front page of the 
North Vancouver newspaper turning sod on a new housing area, 380 
housing units.  He had not mentioned it a week and a half earlier 
to the mayor of West Vancouver who has to provide all the 
policing, ambulance, sewer and water services, all the services 
that have to be provided.  After he said that there would be a 
new era of consultation he did not even mention it to her when he 
had the opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why the bill needs a requirement for consultation.  It 
is not a veto.  It is just so people know what is going on.  The 
difference between the Burrard band and the Squamish band in my 
riding disappoints me greatly.  The Burrard band has good 
relationships with the chief.  He is very progressive.  I have 
had lunch with him.  We get on well.  We can talk.  We do not 
agree on anything but we can talk, and that is what it is all 
about.  It is a completely different attitude from that of the 
Squamish band. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am terribly disappointed the chief cannot see that the best 
way to achieve his goals would be to sit down with people and 
talk about them.  The Squamish reserve is probably the most 
valuable piece of land in the entire country with beautiful views 
of downtown Vancouver, spectacular views of downtown Vancouver. 
There is nothing wrong with developing and earning a living from 
that land and doing what the Squamish band wants to do, but it 
cannot be done in isolation from the rest of the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>West Vancouver does not go ahead and build roads and high-rises 
without talking to neighbouring districts.  We do not want that 
to happen here.  We want harmony in the community and the harmony 
comes from talking together, not from acting as if it is a 
separate nation.  Unfortunately that is the kind of attitude that 
we are getting.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would certainly be remiss if I did not recognize people like 
Marcie Baker from the Squamish reserve and one of the elders, 
Maizie, who has worked so hard with the people on the reserve. 
When they first came to my office in December to ask me how 
parliament worked and about the bill, we provided them with 
copies and helped them get information about it.  How they have 
worked on that reserve to build the support levels, the 
understanding, and how they have pleaded with their chief to at 
least call a meeting to explain the bill.  It has never happened. 
I offered to go down and be part of that meeting.  I never had an 
invitation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it that we only have letters opposed to the bill?  Where 
are all the letters of government members that are in favour of 
the bill?  Where are their petitions in favour of the bill?  How 
come there are only letters against it?  Does that not ask a 
question?  Could there be something wrong here?  That comes back 
to the beginning when I stood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Supposed friends of the government, the Liberal Party of B.C., 
oppose the bill.  The municipalities of the greater Vancouver 
area are opposed to it.  The leaseholders on the Musqueam reserve 
and native band members themselves are opposed to the bill. There 
is something dreadfully wrong with that scenario, especially when 
the government side cannot produce a single letter or a single 
petition to support their side, other than from chiefs, often 
unelected chiefs.  They are bulldozing ahead with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will say in closing that I was very impressed with the land 
code that was produced by the Muskoday, the first exposure that I 
had to the type of land code that there could be.  I would 
sincerely hope that such a good land code could be adopted in the 
Vancouver area for the bands that are affected.  Unfortunately 
the present climate is not conducive to the development of that 
sort of land code.  The band members themselves are expressing 
concern that they will not have the input that they should have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the government one more time to please slow 
down, stop for a little while, have some more committee hearings 
and get some more input before we proceed with what is basically 
an excellent idea.  It just needs a few amendments. 
<P><A NAME="LINK223"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
seems like the Liberals do not want to hear it out in the field 
and they do not want to hear it in the House so we have closure 
everywhere on Bill C-49. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Saint-Jean, our colleague, has shown more concern 
and more initiative in looking after the needs and concerns of 
native women than all members opposite.  It puts the government 
to shame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members opposite have said that the current climate easily 
divides the assets of a family breaking up on a reserve.  That is 
just great, except that the assets do not include the family 
home.  I ask which is more important: a car, a few pieces of 
furniture, or a home where people can live and where children can 
be raised.  That is entirely important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We took a long second look at the legislation and saw that we 
would have a patchwork of rights.  There will be no legal 
standard applied from reserve to reserve.  That might be okay if 
there were no movement from reserve to reserve.  I have talked to 
native women who have grown up on one reserve, married someone 
from another reserve and found out that they did not have the 
rights they thought they would have as married women.  We do not 
think that is right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see the results of family breakdown in cities across the 
country.  My own offices are in the downtown cores of two of the 
major towns in my constituency, right across from a bar in one 
case, and I see what homelessness does to people.  The need is 
really extreme.  People need to have a home.  This legislation 
could be improved. 
Nobody would lose by adopting an amendment like this one.  The 
Reform Party will be supporting the amendments.  They will do the 
work for the bands that needs to be done.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary has indicated that the minister is 
willing to work on this problem.  That is good, but for a year or 
two or three nothing will be done.  If the legislation was 10 
years in the works, how long will it be before we get legislation 
from the minister?  In the meantime we have this patchwork 
legislation.  Provincial laws cannot be adopted by the bands, but 
if they were made into federal laws that could be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They talk about the values of a community as if the values of a 
community were paramount, over and above the need of children to 
have hope.  What are the values of a community that does not 
involve children?  We cannot talk about one without the other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They talk about discrimination on the basis of sex, that it does 
not happen.  They should not talk to me about that.  How many 
native women have I had in my office who have talked about losing 
their rights because they married outside the band?  That has 
been partially given back, not fully.  Land is given to the bands 
in their name and they are not even living on the reserve.  Or, 
if they want the benefits, they have to move to some remote 
reserve.  Is that equality?  Give us all a break. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to raise another issue.  We can talk about giving them 
freedom, which is good, but let me point out that government 
members interfere all the time in the affairs of the provinces as 
has been recently brought out.  They defer to individual bands of 
200 or 300 people or 1,000 people because they cannot be a threat 
to the authority of the Liberal government, but when it comes to 
the provinces there can be interference with all kinds of 
different rulings.  They have to make sure the authority of the 
Liberal government is paramount when it comes to the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to read something said by the Prime Minister when 
he was minister of aboriginal affairs in 1969.  He indicated that 
Indian relations with other Canadian peoples began as special 
treatment by government and society and special treatment had 
been the rule since Europeans first settled in Canada.  He said 
that special treatment had made of the Indians a community 
disadvantaged and apart and that obviously the course of history 
must be changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further he stated that the Government of Canada believed its 
policies must lead to full, free and non-discriminatory 
participation of Indian people in Canadian society.  Such a goal, 
he indicated, required a break with the past and that the Indian 
people's role as dependants be replaced by a role of equal 
status, opportunity and responsibility, a role they could share 
with all other Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With these few amendments we are looking for some equality and 
responsibility, the responsibility to consult and equality in the 
breakup of a marriage.  These are good things. These are not bad 
or difficult things.  They should be accepted by people of good 
will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also quote an elder from the Saskatchewan Indian 
Federated College talking about the problem of entrusting band 
councils to develop divorce laws.  He said that the problem with 
entrusting band councils to develop divorce laws was that 
traditional customs were vague. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the customs are vague and it is acknowledged by one of their 
leaders in the federated college, why in the world is it not seen 
as problematic by the federal Liberal Party?  It should allow the 
new amendments to go through which will protect and enhance not 
only the bill but people which the bill purports to benefit.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>HEALTH CARE 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK237"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to have this opportunity to elaborate on a 
question I raised with the Minister of Health on February 17. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that question I raised the serious problem of the growing 
privatization of our health care system and an ever increasing 
slide into an Americanized two tier health care system.  As part 
of that concern, I also raised the apparent tendency on the part 
of this government to stand by and let it happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an opportunity for the federal government to explain its 
position on the privatization of health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On February 17 I asked the government about the deplorable 
situation in Ontario where the entire health care program, 
specifically the home care program, has been opened up for 
competitive bidding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I raised with this government the matter of federal public 
dollars going into private, for profit companies.  I asked the 
government to ensure that not one penny of the new health care 
dollars in the so-called health care budget would go to line the 
pockets of for profit, and in many cases American owned 
corporations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary's position in my view was quite 
shocking, quite deplorable.  On behalf of the government she said 
to all of us that the federal government cannot and will not 
interfere with issues of delivery. She used jurisdictional 
arguments to avoid the issue and excuse the lack of leadership on 
the part of the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask for the federal government's policies on the matter of 
privatizing our health care system, notwithstanding the 
jurisdictional issues.  We would like to know from the government 
what its position is on the matter of public dollars going to for 
profit, private health care companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where does the government stand?  How does it feel about this 
issue?  What kind of leadership is it offering Canadians on this 
matter? Where is the vision of this government in terms of 
whether or not we will be able to uphold a publicly administered, 
universally accessible health care system?  Does this government 
agree or disagree with Mike Harris, and for that matter any 
provincial government that is using federal public dollars to put 
into private, for profit health care delivery of our system 
today? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an opportunity for the government to clarify. We did not 
get much clarification from the parliamentary secretary in 
question period.  We did not get much clarification throughout 
the budgetary process about where this government stands on the 
erosion of medicare and on the growth in the private sector 
ownership of our health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are now in a situation with well over 30% of health care 
spending being held in the hands of private sector companies. 
That is an amazing shift from years gone by.  We also know that 
with this federal budget we will only achieve in five years time 
a federal share of up to 12.5%.  That means very little will be 
done on the part of this government through this budget or any 
other subsequent measures to reverse this trend and to ensure 
that we have some ability to preserve medicare and to take this 
medicare model and apply it to the whole continuum of care.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Elinor Caplan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise once again 
to try to clarify the issue for the member opposite.  At first I 
thought that she did not understand.  Now I am not sure that it 
is that she does not understand.  I do believe that she is 
mixing, and perhaps deliberately, different concepts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Please stay away from deliberating mixing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Elinor Caplan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, inadvertently.  How is 
that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government, working in collaboration with the 
provinces and territories, achieved a historic national 
commitment on the future of publicly funded medicare.  We have a 
written commitment from every premier and government leader from 
every province and territory in Canada, including Quebec, to 
uphold the principles of the Canada Health Act: universality, 
comprehensiveness, accessibility, portability and public 
administration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They also committed that every penny of new dollars in the 1999 
budget transferred from the federal government to the other 
jurisdictions would be used for health services.  That guarantees 
the continued viability of a quality public, not private, health 
care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spoke about provincial jurisdiction and I want to explain to 
the member what that means.  The provincial government has the 
responsibility to see how its services are delivered.  For 
example, doctors do not work for provincial governments.  They 
are not provincial civil servants.  Across the country lab 
services are provided sometimes by the ministry of health, 
sometimes by private sector corporations, sometimes by a 
municipality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For many years in different parts of the country home care 
services are provided sometimes by not for profit corporations, 
sometimes by corporate entities.  Nursing homes are sometimes 
private, sometimes are not for profit.  The same is true for 
ambulance services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is called a mixed economy.  It is up to the provinces to 
decide how those services will be delivered.  We do not tell them 
how.  Even if we do not like it, there is nothing we can do or 
say about it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to see if I can get some answers to a couple of 
questions I asked on October 26. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I called on the government to initiate a forensic audit into the 
finances of the Hobbema reserve in Alberta which has been 
requested by rank and file members.  The conditions those people 
live in were reported in the </I>Globe and Mail<I>.  About 80% of 
the people on that reserve are living on welfare.  Children are 
sleeping on mattresses in the basement of burned out houses.  How 
does their leadership live? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will quote a couple of instances.  In the Saulteaux band in 
Saskatchewan the chief's salary and benefits for 1997 were some 
$200,000 tax free.  He had a brother who was a band councillor 
and pulled out a salary of $149,000.  We would think that this 
would be the head of a very large city. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mayor of Prince Albert probably makes a quarter of that 
amount of money to manage 35,000 people.  There are 1,050 people 
living on that reserve and they have an accumulated deficit of 
$1.8 million.  I could go on to talk about the Stoney band and 
the Samson Cree band and others.  That is the financial picture 
of the leaders of those bands and the Hobbema band is no 
different. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Living conditions on reserves have been historically 
unacceptable.  We agree with that.  If nothing changes, living 
conditions will continue to be unacceptable.  In addition to the 
living conditions that are terrible, the so-called democracy is 
terrible.  It does not exist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year I travelled to four or five different meetings where I 
listened to rank and file members of different reserves talking 
about the democratic and living conditions on reserves.  What has 
our government's approach been?  It has transferred power to the 
local band councils without ensuring that local accountability 
measures are in place to safeguard the interest of grassroots 
band members. 
Historically Ottawa has intervened to protect its own interests 
but who has intervened to protect the rank and file band members?

<A HREF="#LINKT86"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Band members exercise their authority with little input, 
direction or support from Ottawa, so what did we ask for?  We 
asked on behalf of band members that the government would conduct 
a forensic audit, not simply that it would do some different 
accounting but that it would find out if money was being well 
spent or poorly spent.  That is one of the purposes of a forensic 
audit.  You can find out if all the cheques add up but so what? 
That does not tell you how the money was spent and that is what 
we want to know.  When we look at the kinds of salaries paid out 
to the leadership we think there could be a lot of money left 
over for houses if it were not so much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people are making serious charges.  I think the money is 
there.  The children are suffering.  The need is urgent.  My 
question concerns why the minister will not initiate the forensic 
audits that the people she is responsible for are calling for. 
<P><A NAME="LINK241"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Iftody (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
before I begin my formal response to the member's intervention, I 
listened very carefully to his words and I noticed he mentioned 
he is very concerned about aboriginal children suffering on 
reserve and that he is concerned about an apparent 80% rate of 
unemployment for some reserves which he quoted from the </I>Globe 
and Mail<I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only a few moments ago he voted against Bill C-49 on land 
management which would allow first nations even in his own riding 
to provide access to resources and land and to bring investment 
into the community.  This was in defiance even of the chief who 
was here today in the House observing these debates.  So I 
question the legitimacy of these interventions in light of his 
comments on Bill C-49. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will address in a more particular form some of his concerns 
with respect to audits.  First nations prepare annual financial 
statements and have them audited by an independent and qualified 
auditor.  Those are independent audits.  Over the past 10 years 
we have made considerable progress in this whole process meeting 
auditing standards that are acceptable to associations of 
accountants across Canada.  We abide by their accepted standards 
for auditing and we are addressing those problems on reserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to report that those who are meeting the standards 
have risen recently from 57% to 82%.  We have marginally around 
16% to 18% of bands where there are some difficulties in the 
auditing practices.  It is not, as the Reform Party would have 
the House and Canadians believe, a generalized problem sweeping 
the nation of Indian members misusing the money.  In those cases 
where it does occur it is properly investigated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The motion to adjourn the House is now 
deemed to have been adopted.  Accordingly, this House stands 
adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 
24(1).
