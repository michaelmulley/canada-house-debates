	<B>Mr. Andy Mitchell (Parry Sound-Muskoka, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, today marks World No Tobacco Day. I wanted to take 
this opportunity to offer my support to the call for reduced use of 
tobacco products.
<P>
	When I was in the riding last week I had the opportunity to 
take part in a special event to acknowledge World No Tobacco 
Day. I helped launch the Muskoka-Parry Sound health unit's 
anti-smoking campaign to highlight the importance of 
maintaining the momentum toward smoking reduction in 
Canadian society.
<P>
	The federal government initiated its own tobacco demand 
reduction strategy not long ago as a major component of its 
anti-tobacco smuggling action plan. This strategy includes 
legislation, enforcement and public education.
<P>
	A recent survey conducted by the health unit in my riding 
indicates two of the high schools in our riding have over 30 per 
cent usage of tobacco on a regular basis. This is much higher 
than the provincial average and is a trend I would like to see 
reversed.
<P>
	I ask my colleagues to join with me today to encourage young 
people to stop smoking.

	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead,

hon. member for Berthier-Montcalm, the Prime Minister 
referred to Lise Thibault, who is currently president of the 
Office des personnes handicapées du Québec, as the president of 
an association for cripples-he used the French word 
``infirme''-right in the middle of National Access Awareness 
Week.
<P>
	The use of the French word ``infirme'' by the Prime Minister 
of Canada is a disgrace and an insult to all persons with 
disabilities. This word perpetuates a stubborn prejudice 
suggesting that a handicapped person is ill and must be taken 
care of.
<P>
	Although all persons with disabilities do have limitations, the 
vast majority of them are not ill. The Prime Minister should 
have the decency not to use disabled people for partisan 
purposes, let alone refer to them in a patronizing way.

	<B>Mrs. Sharon Hayes (Port Moody-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the month of May has been the month of the green 
ribbon of hope campaign for our missing children. May 25 was 
Missing Children's Day sponsored by Child Find Canada.
<P>
	Every year over 55,000 Canadian children under the age of 18 
are reported to the RCMP's missing children registry. Many of 
these children leave their homes voluntarily because of harsh 
and unbearable conditions. Others are abducted and disappear, 
often becoming the victims of heinous criminal acts.
<P>
	Child Find Canada is a charitable non-government funded 
organization dedicated to the elimination of this problem 
through its education and awareness programs such as its all 
about me ID program. This is a program that works with parents 
and local community organizations to document information 
about a child's basic identity.
<P>
	The problem of missing children is all too real. It reinforces a 
need to pursue policies that strengthen our criminal justice 
system and strengthen and protect the Canadian family.

<P>
	At present, this hormone provides only financial and 
economic benefits and may be prejudicial to the health of all 
Canadians.
<P>
	I am therefore asking the authorities concerned, and 
especially the Minister of Health, to ensure that all necessary 
studies, including the one on insulin growth factor-1, a hormone 
that may in some cases be linked to excessive limb and chin 
development, are conducted.
<P>
	If these studies do not prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that 
BST is safe, the Minister of Health should seek an indefinite

and all Canadians that May has been Cystic Fibrosis Month.
<P>
	Although significant scientific discoveries such as the 
identification of the gene responsible for cystic fibrosis have 
been made in recent years, the challenges of developing better 
treatments and a cure remain.

	<B>Mr. Paul Zed (Fundy-Royal, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, records 
fell as the port of Saint John reached new levels of throughput in 
many of the major commodities handled at the port, such as 
petroleum, potash, salt and sugar. Cruise ship passenger 
volumes increased dramatically in 1994 due to calls by Carnival 
and Princess cruise lines. Significant traffic gains and expanded 
shipping services were realized at the port by shipping lines like 
Star, Kent and National Shipping of Saudi Arabia.
<P>
	Two million dollars has been spent on facilities development 
at the port of Saint John. Its strengthened financial performance 
has resulted in improved revenues.
<P>
	The men and women who work at the port of Saint John look 
forward to challenges and opportunities ahead. Working with its 
stakeholders the port of Saint John has confidence in its 
collective ability to take advantage of new opportunities.

	<B>Mr. Richard Bélisle (La Prairie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, today is 
World No Tobacco Day, and I would like to take this opportunity 
to make parliamentarians as well as the people of Quebec and 
Canada aware of the importance of this day. This year, the theme 
of this annual event sponsored by the World Health Organization 
is ``The cost of tobacco is higher than we think''.
<P>
	It is worthwhile reminding people that smoking is one of the 
main causes of potentially fatal respiratory and cardiovascular 
diseases. And what about the effect of second-hand smoke, not 
to mention the miscarriages suffered by mothers who smoke and 
the low birth weight of children born to these women? The need 
to educate the young and the not so young about the health 
hazards associated with tobacco use is unquestionable.
<P>
	Today more than ever, we must make everyone, old and 
young, aware of the hazards of tobacco use. This campaign 
should have significant and lasting results.

	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
have yet another example of the Liberals shafting the west and 
rigging a decision to favour Ottawa.
<P>
	Last year the Minister of Canadian Heritage decided that 
Canada would support a bid for Expo 2005. He appointed an 
independent committee to recommend to him which city, either 
Calgary or Ottawa, would represent Canada in the bidding 
process. The process was completed and Calgary was the 
unanimous choice recommended to the minister.
<P>
	The minister promised to follow the recommendation of the 
committee and he has failed to do so. He has tainted the process 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13043"> 13043 </A></B>
<P>
by allowing Ottawa to continue lobbying. It appears that the 
minister is rigging the bid so that Ottawa gets the Expo. It 
appears that the fix is in.
<P>
	Calgary has the strongest of the bids. It has the financial 
backing of the city of Calgary and the province of Alberta. 
Calgary has a volunteer network which is the best in Canada and 
which will make the Expo a tremendous success showcasing 
Canada to the world.
<P>
	The minister promised to make a hasty decision but has failed 
to act for more than two months. I urge the minister to 
immediately follow the recommendation of the committee and 
give the Expo bid to Calgary.

	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
many constituents of mine are outraged at a recent mailing that 
every home in the riding received advertising a package of 
so-called erotic adult only films. The increased availability of 
such films called original, uninhibited and sexually explicit in 
the advertising brochure is openly attributed to the benefits of 
free trade which, according to the same brochure, has led to such 
films now not only being permitted but also encouraged.
<P>
	The wonders of free trade never cease to astound me. Good 
Canadian films still have a problem making it to market but 
American porn is given new opportunities.
<P>
	I share my constituents' feelings that this kind of junk mail 
should not be handled by Canada Post. So-called erotica may 
have its place but its availability should not be imposed on 
people whether they like it or not through such universal 
mailings.
<P>
	I call on the minister responsible to speak to Canada Post 
about this with a view to seeing what can be done to prevent 
further such mailings.

development of this country.
<P>

and integrating them into the daily operations of this industry. 
FORD-Q will pay special attention to ensuring that knowledge 
is shared and that the products and techniques developed in 
high-tech projects are marketed.
<P>
	In Canada, job creation has been spurred on by the vitality of 
our small business industry since 1992. That is why FORD-Q is 
committed to creating the conditions required for this industry 
to remain the driving force of economic growth. In a word, we

	<B>Ms. Maria Minna (Beaches-Woodbine, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to remind members of the House that May 
was Multiple Sclerosis Carnation Month.
<P>
	Multiple sclerosis, or MS, is a degenerative disease that 
affects the central nervous system. An estimated 50,000 
Canadians suffer from this disease, one of the highest 
prevalence rates in the world. There is presently no known cure.
<P>
	Research into finding a cure and better treatments for patients 
with MS is ongoing. Health Canada has contributed research 
dollars to help improve the lives of MS sufferers. However, 
there is still much work to be done.
<P>
	During the month of May, volunteers from the Multiple 
Sclerosis Society of Canada were out in our communities selling 
fresh carnations to raise money for research and support 
services for those affected by MS. As in previous years, the 
Multiple Sclerosis Society hopes to raise $2 million throughout 
the carnation campaign.
<P>
	Of course the success of this campaign depends greatly on the 
involvement of volunteers. To recognize their contribution this 
year's campaign slogan was ``volunteers can work wonders''. I 
salute the many Canadians who contributed their time.

Pierre Laberge and his wife since Mr. Laberge declared his 
support for Quebec's sovereignty is scandalous. Worse still is 
the fact that the government and the Prime Minister condone 
this witch hunt.

Review Committee currently has only two active members, 
instead of the five provided for in the legislation.
<P>
	The basic freedoms of Quebec sovereignists are jeopardized

	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
today we are talking about broken promises and one of them is 
on page 92 of the red book which says: ``In the House of 
Commons, a Liberal government will give MPs a greater role in 
drafting legislation through House of Commons committees''. 
Is it true? Well, let us have a look.
<P>
	On Bill C-68, the government invoked closure at second 
reading, limited the number of witnesses and refused to give 
time for legislative counsel to draft amendments.
<P>
	On Bill C-64, only four witnesses out of the 50 who gave 
testimony came from a list submitted by Reform. Reform MPs 
were not allowed to submit amendments in the language of their 
choice. They were refused the right to speak to some clauses due 
to a time allocation of five minutes per clause.
<P>
	On the MP pension bill, only expert witnesses are allowed to 
testify. MPs and ordinary Canadians are shut out.
<P>
	These arrogant actions by the Liberals make a sham of an 
MP's role in drafting legislation. This is another example of how 
the red book promises are being broken, one after the other.

	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, although he claims he will redefine the mandate of 
our peacekeepers in Bosnia, the Prime Minister has clearly 
indicated that his government does not intend to send additional 
support in terms of logistics and equipment. Meanwhile, the 
situation is deteriorating following a refusal by Bosnian Serbs to 
allow the Red Cross to visit the hostages and now that the 
Canadian government has no direct contact with Captain Ryan 
Lapalm, who is being held in Sarajevo.
<P>
	My question is directed to the Minister of National Defence. 
How can the government expect to be taken seriously when it 
says it wants to redefine the mandate of our peacekeepers in 
Bosnia but at the same time refuses to send adequate equipment 
like France and Great Britain?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence 
and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, first on 
the question of Captain Lapalm, it is true that we have had no 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13045"> 13045 </A></B>
<P>
direct contact with him for the last number of days. We have 
heard indirectly from our sources in Sarajevo that he is okay. We 
are trying to confirm this and we are trying to work through third 
parties such as the Red Cross to ascertain his true condition.
<P>
	With respect to Captain Rechner, I dealt with that yesterday. 
There has been no change. There has been no change with the 
other people who have been detained and held hostage in Ilijas.
<P>
	With respect to the question of the hon. Leader of the 
Opposition, I think we have made our position quite clear. There 
is no requirement at this time to send additional Canadian 
forces. None have been sought by the United Nations.
<P>
	I should point out that the secretary-general of the UN a few 
moments ago called for the gradual reduction or scaling down of 
the UNPROFOR mandate so that it could be reprofiled in a way 
to carry out those tasks that it could best be suited to carry out. 
This mirrors the position that has been taken not only by Canada 
but by many of our allies.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the minister just referred to an important statement 
from UN headquarters. We know that Secretary General Boutros 
Boutros-Ghali has proposed scaling down the number of troops 
while at the same time redeploying on site resources.
<P>
	I want to ask the minister what the Canadian government's 
position is, and perhaps he could tell us, not about what other 
countries think and do and the meetings that will take place but 
about what the Canadian government thinks and what it intends 
to do.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence 
and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
secretary-general flatly rejected a withdrawal from Bosnia, as 
has been advocated by some. He flatly rejected the status quo. 
He is talking about a redefinition of the UNPROFOR mandate in 
that country, and that is the position of Canada.
<P>
	As to how we do it, that will become evident in the next few 
days. As the House will know, my colleague, the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, is meeting today with his counterparts. A 
meeting has been called by the Prime Minister of France for 
defence ministers on Saturday. I shall represent Canada there 
with the chief of defence staff. We will try to see how we can 
adapt our positions into a common front to deal with what I think 
is the emerging consensus, one that we enunciated in the House 
in the last few days, that the UNPROFOR mandate is still valid. 
It can still work, but there has to be some reshaping or redefining 
of the mandate to lessen the exposure for the troops that are 
concerned.

<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, there is of course the very delicate matter of 
deciding whether to send more troops. I realize the government 
wishes to tread very carefully in this respect. However, there is 
also the matter of adequate equipment. We know that on a 
number of occasions, Canadian soldiers have mentioned the 
problems they had due to inadequate equipment.
<P>
	I want to ask the minister whether he would agree that any 
delay by the government in sending our troops adequate 
equipment will expose them to further hostage taking?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence 
and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, a lot of 
the charges about equipment are simply charges that no longer 
bear reality. Whether it is helmets, reinforced flak jackets for 
the very difficult situations, reinforced turrets of our M-113 
armoured personnel carriers and other equipment including very 
modern machine guns, we believe the troops in the last number 
of months have been given additional resources that give them 
better protection for more dangerous situations.
<P>
	That does not mean to say that we cannot improve that 
equipment. However, with respect to sending heavy armour, 
artillery and all of the rest of the paraphernalia of a greater 
entwining in a conflict over there, that is something that is not 
part of the government's agenda at this time. It may very well be 
part of the government's agenda should there be an eventual 
withdrawal, but that withdrawal would have to be 
all-encompassing, requested by the UN and discharged by 
NATO. At that time we will be prepared to add additional 
resources to effect the evacuation of Bosnia.

	<B>Mr. Philippe Paré (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Deputy Prime Minister.
<P>
	A CBC program reported that, in addition to spending 
donations from the public extravagantly, the $300,000 that Care 
Canada raised in its campaign to relieve hunger in Somalia 
never made it to its destination. Given the seriousness of the 
allegations and Ottawa's financial support of Care Canada, the 
Secretary of State for Latin America and Africa has announced 
the government's intention to investigate this agency.
<P>
	Ottawa funded Care Canada to the tune of $28 million in 
1993. Therefore, will the Deputy Prime Minister tell us whether 
the federal government's grants to Care Canada, especially its 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13046"> 13046 </A></B>
<P>
contribution to the campaign for Somalia, were really used for 
their intended purpose?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Christine Stewart (Secretary of State (Latin America 
and Africa), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have the 
opportunity to respond to my colleague's question.
<P>
	The CBC program last night made very serious allegations 
against Care Canada, but I should like to say at the beginning 
that those are allegations and not facts. We have to make sure 
that we make that distinction.
<P>
	CIDA carries on a regular program of auditing of all agencies 
that it has contracts with and which it funds. It has done that with 
Care Canada and has found that all the funds provided to Care 
Canada in whatever program were used properly as indicated 
through contracts.
<P>
[Translation] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philippe Paré (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
regarding the federal government's financial commitments to 
Care Canada, does the Deputy Prime Minister intend to suspend 
all federal grants to this agency until the announced 
investigation gets to the bottom of the troubling allegations 
against Care Canada?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Christine Stewart (Secretary of State (Latin America

contracts with Care. As I said before, we have no reason 
according to our audits to say that it is using its funds in any but 
the best way.
<P>
	On the other hand, we have very serious concerns about the 
allegations that have been made. CIDA is immediately starting 
its own investigation of the agency as an institution. That will 
include a review of the allegations that have been made.

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday the Prime Minister said that Canadian 
peacekeepers were not in the former Yugoslavia to make war 
with anybody. Unfortunately that view is not shared by the 
Bosnian Serbs.
<P>
	They have declared the 320 UN hostages, including 55 
Canadians, to be prisoners of war. They have declared that all 
agreements with the United Nations are null and void.
<P>
<B>(1425 ) </B>
<P>
	In response, NATO is calling on the UN to beef up its mandate 
and the contact group is asking for the power to aggressively 
attack the warring factions. The UN is at the brink of a 
protracted war with the Bosnian Serbs.
<P>
	Will the government today formally acknowledge that the 
peacekeeping mission in Bosnia is over and that our soldiers are 
now being asked to play an aggressive peacemaking role in that 
region?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence 
and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, what we 
have here is a question of semantics. Peacekeeping in the 
traditional sense has rarely been followed in both Croatia and 
Bosnia. It was not followed in Somalia. These are not traditional 
peacekeeping situations, but we all refer to them in the generic 
sense as peacekeeping because that terminology developed by 
former Prime Minister Pearson is an accepted role for the 
international forces.
<P>
	The Government of Canada does not accept the notion that the 
mandate of the United Nations in Bosnia is invalid. We feel it 
can still work and we feel it can work with a modification of the 
mandate in a number of areas. I outlined them in a speech the 
other night and the leader of the Reform Party heard them.
<P>
	We feel that the United Nations, the world community, has so 
much at stake that we should do all possible to ensure that a 
reformulated, redirected mandate can be discharged.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we are not arguing about semantics but about the 
substance of the situation.
<P>
	The major NATO allies are deploying reinforcements in the 
Balkans. The secretary-general of the United Nations is 
proposing to change the mandate and UN soldiers are being 
asked to play a more aggressive role in that part of the country.
<P>
	Our peacekeepers have become peace enforcers, a role which 
goes against the original mandate and for which they are not 
properly equipped.
<P>
	Given that our role is changing, no matter what words the 
minister wishes to use to describe it, and that the lives of 
Canadian soldiers are being placed at greater risk, will the 
government now demand a place for Canada in the UN decision 
making contact group?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence 
and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
contact group is not a UN sponsored organization. It is a group 
of nations largely European-it includes Russia and the United 
States-that have come together and have tried to effect a 
solution. We have made our position clear that we would have 
preferred to have been part of that group.
<P>
	As I said the other night, we have to look forward and not look 
back. As a result of some of the comments that have been made 
by our Prime Minister with respect to the specific issue, it has 
been agreed over the last number of months to expand the 
consultative process among troop contributors, of which Canada 
is a significant player. That will mean we will have even more  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13047"> 13047 </A></B>
<P>
consultations, including the meeting I have just described that 
will take place in Paris on Saturday.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Canadians do not just want to be consulted. Canadians 
want to have a say in key decisions that affect the lives of the 
forces in Bosnia. Canada invented peacekeeping. We have been 
major players in every key UN peacekeeping mission. Our 
soldiers have taken on some of the most dangerous assignments 
in the former Yugoslavia.
<P>
	The fact that Canada has no real decision making position in 
actions that have a direct impact on our soldiers is completely 
unacceptable to the House and the Canadian people.
<P>
	If the government is insisting on staying in Bosnia, a decision 
with which we profoundly disagree, will the minister at least 
insist on membership in the contact group as a condition for 
remaining?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence 
and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, without 
getting too much involved, the answer to the specific question is 
no.
<P>
	We have a forum that has worked well in the last few months 
and is expanding and will meet again on Saturday. It is the troop 
contributing nations.
<P>
<B>(1430 ) </B>
<P>
	I have been at other meetings of this group in the past number 
of months. It will be a decision making body; it is a decision 
making body.
<P>
	The hon. member quibbles about having a say not meaning 
consultation. We will be having a say, we are having a say. He 
obviously does not remember that when it came to the question 
of application of NATO air power Canada was very much in the 
forefront not just in consultation but as part of the decision 
making process and withheld approval until many of our key 
concerns were met. Those concerns were valid then, they are 
valid now and they will be valid in the weeks to come.

	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Minister of Finance, who is also 
responsible for regional development in Quebec.
<P>
	The federal government is preparing to review all of its 
regional development activities. In the future, the Federal 
Office of Regional Development will concentrate its activities 
on a single program focussed on small and medium businesses 
cutting its aid budgets by 60 per cent at the same time. With Bill 
C-91 on the federal bank, Ottawa intends to sign agreements 
directly with agencies that are under Quebec's jurisdiction.
<P>
	How can the minister responsible for regional development in 
Quebec talk of harmonizing federal and provincial action, when 
he is preparing, with Bill C-91 among others, to intervene, 
indeed to act as the representative of Quebec regional 
development agencies over the head of the Quebec government?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member does not understand this bill at all. It 
establishes a new mandate for the Federal Business 
Development Bank, among other things.
<P>
	I can tell the hon. member that the excellent co-operation 
between the bank and the federal regional development agencies 
will help small and medium businesses throughout Canada, 
particularly in Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
as I pointed out in this House, we can see that the real person 
responsible for regional development in Quebec is the minister 
from Ontario.
<P>
	As Quebec is increasingly decentralizing and regionalizing, 
are we to understand, with the establishment of a new mandate 
linking the federal office and the Federal Business Development 
Bank, that the minister, through the ever popular flexible 
federalism the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs referred to 
yesterday, is setting up a central Canadian agency to increase 
overlap and duplication and to attack Quebec's regional 
development policy head on?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I must say that the 
question of the hon. member, whom I hold in high regard, is 
completely absurd.
<P>
	Let me begin by saying that, when a question concerns the 
Federal Business Development Bank, it is directed to the 
minister, and this is why he responded. When a question 
concerns regional development, that is the federal development 
office, I am happy to reply.
<P>
	First, I am pleased to say that we asked Quebec whether it 
wanted to align itself with our policies, and we are awaiting its 
reply. The ball is now in Quebec's court.
<P>
	Second, we adjusted our operations to the requests of local 
authorities.
<P>
	Third, at the annual conference held by the Université de 
Chicoutimi in Quebec City two weeks ago, the provincial 
government was asked to do exactly what we are now doing at 
the federal level. So the hon. member should listen to what his 
fellow Quebecers are saying.

comes from British Columbia that at least three legal firms with 
no previous prosecution experience have been awarded standing 
contracts to act on behalf of the crown in putting criminals 
behind bars.
<P>
<B>(1435 ) </B>
<P>
	Since the government is so fond of citing the merit principle 
whenever it becomes clear we are really talking about the 
patronage principle, could the Minister of Justice explain the 
merit in handing over the responsibility for prosecuting 
criminals to law firms with absolutely no experience in that 
field?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Russell MacLellan (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is very difficult to answer a question when we do 
not know what the case was and we do not know who the law 
firms were. All we know is there was work supplied by the 
Department of Justice.
<P>
	Contracts by the Department of Justice are given very 
carefully with a great deal of forethought, and all the firms with 
which the Department of Justice does business are very 
competent in the field in which they are to be working.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
parliamentary secretary might be interested that all three law 
firms in question have absolute Liberal pedigrees.
<P>
	The law firm partner James Hutchison happens to be the 
president of the revenue minister's Victoria riding association. 
Another contract was given to David Mulroney who happens to 
be the vice-president of the minister's Liberal association.
<P>
	In light of the Liberals' promise to wipe out patronage 
appointments and bring integrity to government, why has the 
justice department failed to deliver on this important promise?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Russell MacLellan (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I think the hon. member is saying that because the 
Liberal Party was able to associate itself with very competent 
people during the election campaign and so many throughout 
Canada, as the popular vote would indicate, there will be quite a 
few of them who are Liberals.
<P>
	That person is a Liberal certainly does not discount them from 
being a capable lawyer. If we were to discount all the capable 
lawyers who are Liberals we would have a difficult time in

sole interest of reducing CN's debt, Ottawa will be sinking 
anywhere from $400 to $600 million into the purchase of CN 
buildings for which taxpayers have already paid.
<P>
	How can the Minister of Transport claim that the government

complex.
<P>
	I know the hon. member has had the opportunity to sit in 
committee and listen to people we consider to be as expert in this 
area as anyone in the country, who try to explain the need to 
provide an opportunity for CN to be sold in a viable way, to elicit 
enough investment interest to carry the issue to be put out this 
fall, but also to allow it to continue to compete on an equitable 
footing with Canadian Pacific.
<P>
	The hon. member knows representatives of the competitor of 
CN, CP, have gone before the committee and explained they 
understand the need to have a reasonable debt-equity ratio, that 
we have to qualify for a triple B bond rating in order to raise 
funds on the investment market to operate CN and provide 
money for the acquisition.

that taxpayers are going to have to pay not between $400 to $600 
million in the effort to privatize CN, but as much as $1 billion, 
and that this public support of $1 billion is nothing less than an 
indirect subsidy Ottawa will be offering to the future owners of 
CN?

<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, a fundamental question that has to be addressed by all 
members of the House of Commons as we deal with the 
commercialization of CN is whether members want to do it.
<P>
	We can address all the theoretical questions. We can discuss 
whether the deal is absolutely perfect or whether the taxpayers 
of Canada will get an absolute best value on every aspect of the 
deal.

support the commercialization and the privatization of CN. If it 
does, we will listen to its recommendations as to how we can do 
it well. However, if it does not want to do it, if it just wants to

	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Canadian Heritage.
<P>
	In another memo dated May 23, the CEO of the CBC informed 
his employees that 1,000 positions would be cut by September 
1995 and that 350 employees would be laid off in the short term.
<P>
	Mr. Beatty added that the exact number of positions to be cut 
in the various facilities remained to be determined, since 
management plans had not yet been approved by the resources 
planning and allocation committee.
<P>
	Does the Minister of Canadian Heritage realize how anxious 
the French network staff, particularly in Quebec, are about the 
decisions this committee is about to make, given that 
francophones are a very small minority on this committee?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage, 
Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I have explained time and time again in this 
House that we have several initiatives under way which should 
lead to fundamental decisions being taken concerning the CBC.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13051"> 13051 </A></B>
<P>
	There is, for instance, the heritage committee, which will 
hopefully table a report in a few days, a few weeks at most. 
There is also a task force reviewing mandates. It is quite normal 
for the president of the CBC to care about the restructuring that 
his house, so to speak, is about to undergo in order to make it 
more effective.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, given 
that the budget for the CBC's French network is 40 per cent 
lower than that of the English network, in spite of similar 
viewership, does the minister undertake to direct the board of 
directors of the CBC to spare the French network?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage, 
Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the government will do much more than 
issue directives. It will implement policy in due time, and I have 
just said when that would be, when we have in hand the reports 
we requested.

	<B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is to the President of the Treasury Board.
<P>
	I want to first congratulate the minister and the leader of the 
public service union on reaching an agreement to work together 
on managing downsizing of the public service.
<P>
	For all of us who are concerned about the future of the public 
service and about the tens of thousands of employees who are 
worried about their jobs, I wonder if the minister would explain 
exactly how this agreement will help those affected by 
downsizing and how it will improve relations with the 
employees and unions.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board 
and Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday I signed a joint agreement with union leaders 
that will provide for joint adjustment committees to assist 
employees who are leaving the public service as a result of the 
downsizing that is taking place. This is in order to help them find 
alternate jobs. This will provide transition support services. For 
example, one such committee here in Ottawa next week is 
providing a job fair for a number of people who will be leaving 
the public service. So these joint management and union 
committees right across the country will assist on a regional, 
local, and departmental basis to help the people who are being 
displaced by downsizing to find new jobs.

	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of the Environment.
<P>
	According to the auditor general, in the next 30 years, it will 
cost $9 billion to safely dispose of the mountains of high-level 
radioactive waste mainly caused by electric power companies 
such as Ontario Hydro.
<P>
<B>(1455) </B>
<P>
	The federal government has already subsidized the 
development of these companies to the tune of $370 million, 
without devising safe ways and sites to dispose of such waste.
<P>
	How can the Minister of the Environment justify that 
Canadian taxpayers are currently subsidizing Ontario Hydro to 
get rid of its nuclear waste, which accounts for close to 90 per 
cent of all such waste in Canada?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Natural Resources, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, The hon. member is right that the auditor 
general quite rightly identified that we have a long term 
radioactive waste disposal problem in the country.
<P>
	The government is working on the problem. In March I went 
to my cabinet colleagues with a long term strategy to deal with 
the problem and I will return to cabinet in November with a 
timetable and with cost estimates as to how we will proceed in 
the future to deal with the nuclear waste problem in the country.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, after 
investing hundreds of millions of tax dollars in the construction 
of Ontario Hydro's nuclear power plants, how can the Minister 
of the Environment now guarantee that she will not ask 
Canadians across the country to absorb the costs of an operation 
which is Ontario Hydro's sole responsibility, while the federal 
government never invested Canadian taxpayers' money in 
Hydro-Quebec?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Natural Resources, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I think I should make something very plain 
here. When I talk about developing a plan to deal with long term 
costs for radioactive waste disposal, I am talking about historic 
waste.
<P>
	The hon. member is quite right that various utilities across the 
country generate energy through nuclear power and they are 
responsible for the disposal of those wastes. We operate on the 
basis of a polluter pay principle and we as a government are 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13052"> 13052 </A></B>

working closely with those utilities to develop the safest and

Mr. Speaker, on Saturday, May 27, the Indians of the Upper

Lake Ranch road. The RCMP were met with threats of violence 
when they served a court injunction to remove the illegal 
blockade.
<P>

roadblock?

<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I would like to inform the hon. member that the 
off reserve nature of the dispute makes it a provincial matter. I 
understand that it is being addressed by the relevant parties.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, clearly the Constitution Acts of 1867 and 1982 
state in section 24 that the federal government has a statutory 
responsibility for Indians and lands reserved for Indians. 
Clearly this is a federal government responsibility. These people 
are breaking the law.
<P>
	Will the government desert the people of my riding, as it has 
done before, or will the government cut off the funding to the 
Upper Nicola Band until it removes the roadblocks?
<P>

<P>
	Mr. Speaker, the hon. member just said that these people are 
breaking the law. I did not get the first part of the question. I was 
not sure whether he meant the people who own the Douglas Lake 
cattle company are breaking the law or the aboriginal people are 
breaking the law.

my departmental officials would be prepared to assist in 
resolving the dispute.

issue of the Upper Nicola Band.
<P>
<B>(1500 ) </B>
<P>
	The matter of grievance is definitely in the federal area of 
responsibility. A major confrontation is taking place. Nearly 
200 First Nations people are on site this afternoon. There is 
bound to be violence on that blockade if action is not taken.
<P>
	Will the parliamentary secretary ask the minister to involve 
himself personally, go out to the site and attempt to resolve these 
critical issues before violence occurs?

cooler heads should prevail on this issue. If requested the

new information on the status of the enforcement and quota 
measures that were agreed to in April? Could he also tell us what 
Canada's position will be at this meeting?

her interest in the NAFO meeting in Toronto next week.
<P>
	At this meeting all of the NAFO member states will consider 
the enforcement provisions contained within the Canada-EU 
enforcement agreement. It is our hope, indeed our desire, that 
the provisions contained in the agreement will be endorsed by 
members of NAFO.
<P>
	I spoke as recently as yesterday to the ministers of fisheries 
from Norway and Iceland. My officials have spoken with 
representatives of other countries to ensure good strong support 
for these measures.

	<B>Mr. Reg Alcock (Winnipeg South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, there 
were two parts to the economic plan outlined in the red book. 
The first was to get our finances under control and the second 
was to stimulate job creation.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Finance. We have been bold 
in setting targets for reducing the deficit to 3 per cent of GDP. 
Why is there no target for a reduction in the level of 
unemployment?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the member does 
not ask easy questions.
<P>
	Canada, like many other countries, is undergoing a 
fundamental revolution in the job market. That is why the 
government is acting as it is with its reforms in employability by 
HRD, in research and development, in industry. It is why the 
access to capital for small business is so important.
<P>
	All of these are in the area where one sets the climate for the 
private sector. Therefore the questions that arise are: Should 
government be setting targets in areas where it does not have at 
least as much control as it should over the public finances? What 
about the kinds of jobs, part time or full time? What about the 
problem of the working poor, which is almost as important? 
These are questions I believe have to be addressed within the 
context of the member's question.
<P>
	The real answer is that no level of unemployment is 
acceptable.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
on a point of order. During the examination of the estimates of 
the Department of National Revenue, I pointed out department 
estimates on vote 1 were about $10 million higher than the 
amount specified in the federal budget submitted in February.
<P>
	The transcript will show the motion that: ``We approve the 
estimates in principle, reconciling them with the budget'' was 
passed unanimously. The motion to reconcile was ruled out of 
order and is not reflected in the minutes being tabled today.
<P>
	Because the department estimates of all departments are 
printed before the finance minister presents his budget, we have 
noted there will be discrepancies between ministry estimates 
and the finance minister's dollar allocation to these ministries.
<P>
	The solution might include Your Honour recommending to 
the Minister of National Revenue that he submit a 
reconciliation, as unanimously requested by committee 
members. If this was taken as precedent, your ruling would take 
a giant step to putting the members in charge of expenditures of 
taxpayers' dollars.

<HR>
<B><A NAME="13054"> 13054 </A></B>
<P>
	In summary, as a standard procedure when there is a 
difference between estimates and the budget, a reconciliation 
should be tabled by the minister when department estimates are 
tabled by a standing committee.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The Chair is in an in between position here. It is 
not for the Chair to make specific suggestions, but I wonder if 
the hon. member might recommend that this request be made 
through the committee itself when bringing in its report.
<P>
	Second, perhaps this question could be brought up later on

position or the prerogative of the Chair to intervene on this and I 
would decline to do so at this time.

	These petitions come from two different provinces yet they 
request the very same thing, that Parliament refrain from 
implementing a more restrictive control of firearms that will 
affect only law-abiding citizens.

<P>
	The petition draws to the attention of the House the fact that 
the current Criminal Code denies people who are suffering from 
terminal or irreversible and debilitating illness the right to 
choose freely and voluntarily to end their lives with the 
assistance of a physician.
<P>
	The petitioners call on Parliament to amend the code to ensure 
the right of all Canadians to die with dignity by allowing people 
with terminal or irreversible and debilitating illness the right to 
the assistance of a physician in ending their lives at a time of 
their choice, subject to strict safeguards to prevent abuse and to 
ensure  that the decision is free, informed, competent and 
voluntary.

<P>
	These petitioners state that whereas there is no connection 
between gun control legislation and a decrease in occurrence of 
criminal activity. Whereas all handguns in Canada are required 
by law to be registered, they feel that implementing more 
restrictive firearms controls will affect only law-abiding 
citizens and is unjustifiable. They feel that responsible 
governments should follow more effective prosecution and 
tougher sentencing of criminals.

Speaker, it is an honour and a privilege for me to rise today to 
present 343 petitions signed by 9,144 concerned Canadians 
primarily from the province of Saskatchewan.
<P>
	The petitioners protest the following provisions of Bill C-68: 
the universal registration of long guns; the replacement of the 
firearms acquisition certificate by a firearms possession 
certificate; restrictions and controls on the purchase of 
ammunition; provisions to ban the purchase and use of .25 and 
.32 calibre handguns and handguns with a barrel length of under 
4.14 inches; and regulation by orders in council.

<P>
	The petitioners draw to the attention of the House that 
managing the family home and caring for preschool children is 
an honourable profession which has not been recognized for its 
value to our society. They also state that the Income Tax Act 
discriminates against families who make the choice to provide 
care in the home for preschool children, the disabled, the 
chronically ill, or the aged.

implementation, to increased use of direct deposit.
<P>

<P>
	Public Works and Government Services Canada, PWGSC, 
issues payments on behalf of other program departments in the 
amounts and according to the schedules determined by those 
departments. Program departments determine individual 
entitlement to benefits in accordance with the policy and 
legislation governing specific programs. This process precludes 
PWGSC from adding up the benefits under various programs 
and issuing a single payment to an individual.
<P>
	Should the department decide to consolidate various benefits 
paid monthly into a single payment, individual program 
departments would require legislative and policy changes for 
their specific programs. Major changes would also be required 
to the computer systems of program departments and PWGSC.
<P>
	Public Works and Government Services Canada issues 
approximately 193 million payments annually. Approximately 
34 per cent are currently delivered electronically in the form of 
direct deposit.
<P>
	The average cost to issue a cheque, including production 
costs, banking fees and postage, is approximately one dollar. 
With the use of direct deposit significant savings are realized 
through reduced postage and banking fees as well as reduced 
cheque production costs. Direct deposit costs the government 
only one cent in banking fees compared with 10 cents for each 
paper transaction.
<P>
	As another important step to streamline operations and reduce 
costs, the Minister of Public Works and Government Services 
recently announced that direct deposit will become the 
government's standard method of payment. This expansion of 
the use of direct deposit is expected to save the government $18 
million to $20 million annually by 1998-1999.
<P>
	Program departments accord benefits in accordance with their 
legislation. In cases where individuals are entitled to payments 
based on individual characteristics separate payments must be 
issued as there is no authority to treat a married couple as a 
single beneficiary.

(Lethbridge) and amending clause 8.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank you very 
much for the opportunity to discuss Bill C-76 and the 
amendments thereto.
<P>
	I want to make general comments then some specific 
comments with regard to the amendments.
<P>
	With regard to the amendments before us that deal with public 
service measures, we generally support the government's 
decision to suspend the workforce adjustment directive and 
eliminate some 45,000 positions in the public service. However, 
we feel there are some concerns and because of that we have 
moved Motions 1, 3 and 4.
<P>
	With regard to our first motion, on clause 3, we are concerned 
that some employees will be declared surplus and be paid for a 
period of six months without doing any work. Officials have 
confirmed to us that this would be possible with the way the bill 
is written at the present time.
<P>
	With regard to clause 8, we have concerns that the legislation 
gives the Public Service Commission too much flexibility in 
appointing surplus workers to jobs in other departments. We 
would prefer that the appointments be subject to the competitive 
process in order to prevent any type of favouritism, cronyism, or 
unfair competition. We think the commission should be given 
the power to hold a closed competition confined to surplus 
employees only.
<P>
	With regard to clause 8, we are concerned the employment 
equity programs will be used to further the goals of employment 
equity during this period of downsizing. As I recall, earlier in 
this session the minister responsible for the public service 
mentioned that this would be one of the criteria taken into 
consideration. We feel that this could happen as a result of 
people being appointed without competition to jobs that would 
otherwise be occupied by surplus workers.
<P>
<B>(1535 ) </B>
<P>
	Those are the motions that will be looked at with regard to 
that. My colleague, the critic who is responsible for that in terms 
of the public service, will be making further comments on those 
amendments to the House.
<P>
	I think we have to understand the broader picture and the 
reason for Bill C-76. Bill C-76 has as its purpose to deal with 
the fiscal circumstances of Canada. It is to deal with the deficit 
in some way.
<P>
	We have to recognize that we have a very serious 
circumstance. We have said this many times in this House. My 
hon. colleague from Vancouver points out to me often that every 
day we have a deficit of some $100 million between the revenue 
that is available for us to take our responsibilities as a federal 
government and the expenditures that take place on a daily 
basis. That is $100 million a day in terms of a deficit. If we put 
that over a one-year period we have the accumulated deficit of 
this country, as projected in the current budget for 1995-96, of 
some $32.7 billion.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13060"> 13060 </A></B>
<P>
	If we look at what has happened with regard to the public debt 
charges during that period of time from 1994-95 to the budget of 
1995-96, our debt charges in this country have increased from 
some $42 billion to $50 billion. They have increased for two 
very basic reasons. First, the deficit is not being dealt with by 
this government. It continues to add on to the accumulated debt 
of the country of some $550 billion today. This is heading 
toward a major sum. From the government's own figures, it 
points out that the net public debt by the end of 1995-96 will be 
some $578 billion and by 1996-97 it is projected to be over $600 
billion.
<P>
	Because of that increased accumulated debt, the interest costs 
to the Government of Canada continue to increase. This has a 
major effect on the budget of Canada and the revenue available 
to administer and take care of the responsibilities that have been 
delegated to the federal government in this country.
<P>
	That is certainly one of the factors, the fact that the deficit 
continues to add to the accumulated debt and that larger 
accumulated debt creates a larger base on which the interest 
costs are enormous.
<P>
	The second factor, which is very obvious to all of us, is the 
increased interest costs that have occurred during the past year. 
For example, in the United States the Federal Reserve Bank has 
increased the interest rates over the last year seven times, and 
every time the interest rates have increased in the United States 
it has had a direct effect on the interest rates here in Canada. 
Over the year, we have had an increase of 3 per cent in interest 
rates, which has again affected the amount of interest we pay as 
a government annually.
<P>
	It is seriously affecting the programs that are to be delivered 
by the federal government. I have already mentioned that for 
1994-95 the cost of our debt charges from the cost of interest 
was in the $42 billion range. Now in 1995-96 it is projected to be 
$50 billion. We have had an additional $8 billion of interest 
costs because of that 3 per cent interest rate increase and also the 
larger base of debt in this country.
<P>
	What has that done? It means that in order to try to deal with 
the deficit we must in some way eliminate expenditures of some 
$8 billion just to cancel that out. Well, that is not that easy to do. 
The government has come up with certain measures. For 
example, it has increased tax revenue by $1.5 billion to $2 
billion. Well, that is only 25 per cent of the increased interest 
costs. Where does the other $6 billion come from?
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
	The government has attempted through other means to secure 
that expenditure reduction and at the same time in its budget is 
attempting to reduce the cost of program spending from $118 
billion down to $114 billion, a reduction of $4 billion.
<P>
	If we could have maintained at least the base from which 
interest is calculated, if we could have stopped the accumulation 
of debt by eliminating the deficit, we would  have had more 
money to reduce the expenditures of government. There would 
have been more confidence in the Canadian economy and the 
interest rates would have been lower because we were balancing 
the budget or we had a plan to balance the budget.
<P>
	Missing from the budget is the fact that the Liberal 
government has not put in place a plan to reduce the deficit from 
the projected deficit in 1996-97 of $24.3 billion down to zero. It 
is afraid to take the next step and say to Canadians we are going 
to take the deficit to zero by this plan. The government is afraid 
to stick its neck out and make that commitment to Canadians. 
That is costing us billions of dollars in higher interest rates.
<P>
	If we had at least held our interest costs in 1995-96 at $42 
billion, where they were in 1994-95, rather than the increase of 
$8 billion I have talked about, we would not have had to reduce 
our expenditures by $4 billion. We would have had an extra $4 
billion to work with. That is what the government should have 
been looking at.
<P>
	We can go through all these amendments and all the items we 
are going to deal with in Bill C-76, but we must get back to the 
basic problem we are facing. That is, the Government of Canada 
has not declared to the people that it will balance the budget 
during the term of this Parliament. It has not clearly said that, 
and it is incumbent upon them to do so.
<P>
	Moody's and the Dominion Bond Rating Service have told the 
Government of Canada clearly: ``In order for us to give you a 
better credit rating, which reflects on interest rates, you must 
commit to a plan''.
<P>
	As we go through these amendments we must keep in mind the 
very first item on the agenda, which is dealing with the deficit 
and stopping the growth of debt, which is destroying the 
country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Walker (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to deal with each of 
these four amendments in turn, because they hit on some of the 
essentials of what we are trying to do as a government to deal 
with the public service.
<P>
	I extend my thanks to the critics from the official opposition 
and from the third party for their work in the finance committee 
under the chairmanship of the member for Willowdale. I thought 
it was an outstanding collegial example of how to deal with a 
very difficult and major piece of legislation. I describe the 
treatment of witnesses as exemplary by all members of 
Parliament.
<P>
	With regard to the first motion, I would like to clarify what the 
intent of the legislation is. The surplus period is a notice period 
that the employee's job will end in six months. By definition the 
surplus employee will have a job for six months. I do not want 
the amendment to leave the impression that there is a system set 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13061"> 13061 </A></B>
<P>
up where people will be sitting around for six months. It has 
always been the practice of departments to plan their surplus 
declarations in this manner.
<P>
<B>(1545 ) </B>
<P>
	There are some exceptions to this rule which should be 
clarified. I can give an example of a military base closing prior 
to the six month period. We consider it costly for the 
government to transfer surplus employees to find jobs which 
may only last a month or two. It is more practical to leave them 
where they are until the six months have run out. In that case the 
legislation will have to build in these rare exceptions.
<P>
	Motion No. 2 is a technical change dealing with the wording 
the drafters have which now has to be changed.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The motion reads as follows: ``That Bill C-76, in Clause 7, be 
amended in the French version, by replacing lines 8 and 9, on 
page 7, with the following: «ou à toute personne appartenant à 
l'administration publique fédérale».''
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The third motion by the member for Lethbridge deals with 
clause 8. It appears the purpose of the amendment is to ensure 
competent employees are retained through the exercise of 
priority for surplus employees. Surplus employees are generally 
highly competent and their employment is in jeopardy for 
reasons beyond their control. The priority accorded to them 
ensures these competent people are retained in the public 
service and that the investment made in their training and 
development is not lost. A surplus person must be determined 
qualified in order to be appointed. It is not necessary to hold 
competitions to ensure competent employees are retained.
<P>
	Section 10 of the Public Service Employment Act which 
establishes that employments are to be based on merit does not 
require that these appointments be made by competition.
<P>
	The purpose of clause 8 is to make it possible for deputy heads 
to place their own surplus employees before having to consider 
priorities from other departments. The intent is to allow 
departmental restructuring and downsizing in a humane and 
efficient way.
<P>
	The delays involved in holding competitions lead to a longer 
period of uncertainty which is destructive to morale. Further, 
there are significantly greater costs involved in running 
competitions rather than considering people on a 
non-competitive basis.
<P>
	While competitive processes may be seen as being fairer and 
more transparent there are a number of reasons why other 
considerations may be overriding in certain situations. For some 
surplus employees there is a very limited period during which 
they can be considered for the positions. If a competition had to 
be run, especially national in scope, this period could be 
exhaustive while the longer processes that would have been 
involved in that competition have gone through.
<P>
	The amendment is also not consistent with the other 
provisions for priority entitlements in the act which provide for 
appointments without competition in priority situations.
<P>
	As drafted, the amendment creates internal inconsistencies 
within the clause that would require redrafting. In particular, the 
need to hold a competition is in conflict with the discretion 
given to the public service commission to formulate an opinion 
as to whether an employee is qualified.
<P>
	The fourth motion presented by the member for Lethbridge is 
also an amendment to clause 8. The effect of this amendment is 
to remove the commission's current discretion under paragraph 
35(2)(d) of the Public Service Employment Act to exclude 
appointments made under employment equity programs from 
the operation of the various sections of the act which give 
priority entitlement.
<P>
	Parliament chose two years ago through the Public Service 
Reform Act to give the commission the discretion it now enjoys. 
It also is currently considering amendments to the Employment 
Equity Act which would give employment equity programs 
more rather than less precedence in the public service. It is the 
government's place to decide what emphasis it wishes to put on 
these areas.
<P>
	Although the commission has chosen not to exclude these 
programs from consideration of priorities, this does not mean 
there would not be times when this would not be the right thing 
to do. The amendment would prevent the commission from 
exercising this discretion in future where it considers it 
necessary to achieve employment equity objectives.
<P>
	In reality the effect of this amendment is to defeat the effort 
made by the government for disadvantaged groups. This would 
be a setback in that it would allow surplus priorities to be placed 
ahead of disadvantaged group members. I know that would not 
be the objective of this member who has had a long public career 
and has been involved with disadvantaged groups in his home 
province before coming to the federal scene.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	It is still the objective of the government to have the public 
service reflect the demographic configuration of our society. 
This motion would stall the effort we have all been making.

<P>
	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, a number of 
things have already been said about the amendments to Bill 
C-76. However, much remains to be said, and we fully intend to 
do so in the days to come. I would now like to comment on the 
motions being presented by our Reform Party colleagues.
<P>
	The first motion says that a surplus employee who has not 
performed any work should not receive any money. I am afraid 
that if this amendment is passed, employees who lose their jobs 
would no longer be eligible for severance pay. That would be 
unfortunate, since severance pay is not intended as a gift to the 
employee who loses his job. It is meant to compensate him for 
the fact that he is penalized by the loss of his job. Severance pay 
is also a reminder to the employer that there is a price to pay for 
getting rid of a certain number of employees.
<P>
	It would be too easy for the employer to say: I am going to cut 
my staff and get rid of 25, 50, 100 or 200 employees, depending 
on the size of the company. It would be too easy to be able to do 
this with impunity, without having to compensate people who, 
after all, are human and, in most cases, have dedicated a good 
part of their lives to their employer.
<P>
	Severance pay must be included, and under no condition 
should we pass amendments that would allow the employer to 
dispense with severance pay.
<P>
	Motion No. 2 says that the text is to be amended by replacing 
it with «à l'administration publique fédérale». The wording of 
the bill is as follows: ``Any person authorized pursuant to 
subsections (1) or (2) to exercise and perform any of the powers 
and functions of the governor in council or the Treasury Board 
may, subject to and in accordance with the authorization, 
authorize any other person. . . who is part of the Public Service 
of Canada-''
<P>
	There are certain distinctions in the public service, and I am 
afraid that other agencies that are part of the public service 
might be excluded if this kind of amendment is passed, because 
one is not necessarily under the jurisdiction of the public service 
when one is part of the public service. The government still has 
certain obligations to those employees.
<P>
	As for Motion No. 3, there would seem to be a better case for 
this amendment because it would oblige the government, when 
it wants to replace a surplus employee, to offer the position 
``under a closed competition exclusively open to employees 
declared surplus within the meaning of the Workforce 
Adjustment Directive under the Public Sector Compensation 
Act, to another''.
<P>
	Still referring to clause 8 of the bill, according to its present 
wording, the Commission could, before the layoff becomes 
effective and if it is of the opinion that it is in the best interests of 
the Public Service to do so, appoint the employee, without 
competition and in priority over  all other persons, to another 
position under the jurisdiction of the deputy head for which, in 
the opinion of the Commission, the employee is qualified.
<P>
	We believe that this particular wording gives the Commission 
too much discretionary power and that the Commission should 
be more strictly regulated.
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	I think that the purpose of Motion No. 3 tabled by the hon. 
member from the Reform Party is to require the commission, 
whenever such a situation arises, to replace the employee by 
way of a closed competition, not by a competition that would 
bring another person into the system so that the number of 
employees would rise again. No.
<P>
	I think that the amendment is justified because it is aimed at 
restricting the competition to public service employees declared 
surplus. Instead of leaving these people without protection, in 
case other jobs are ever created, this amendment gives them a 
kind of recall priority. It would allow those already declared 
surplus to be called back to work-after a competition, of 
course-because the goal is to put people in positions for which 
they are qualified. We think that a closed competition would be 
more equitable to surplus employees and give much less 
discretionary power to the commission.
<P>
	Motion No. 4, which is also part of the first group, would 
prevent the commission from appointing a person already 
participating in a program designated by the Treasury Board as 
an employment equity program. In other words, the commission 
would be prohibited from appointing a participant in an 
employment equity program to a position that could be occupied 
by a surplus employee within the meaning of the work force 
adjustment directive.
<P>
	I think that we would be replacing one form of discrimination 
by another, for example, in favour of employees who are already 
protected as members of what we call visible minorities. It has 
been agreed that visible minorities would be those minorities 
currently recognized, that is to say persons with a disabilities, 
aboriginal people, people of a different ethnic background or 
non-white in colour, in a word those visible minorities the 
legislation was intended to protect. But with an amendment such 
as this one, we would be giving even more prominence to these 
minorities by saying in essence: ``You guys will get to take the 
place of employees who have been declared surplus.'' It is bad 
enough for employees to be declared surplus and lose their jobs, 
without making matters worse by discriminating against them, 
in favour of a visible minority group that is already afforded a 
certain degree of protection. Women are also considered a 
visible minority under certain agreements.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13063"> 13063 </A></B>
<P>
	When employment equity and fairness to all is the goal, it is 
not by penalizing one group of employees that the goal will be 
achieved. That has just not happened. An employer who wants to 
achieve employment equity in his business does not start laying 
people off, only to replace them with a larger number of people 
from a group described as a visible minority. What he does is 
take advantage of jobs opening up to make adjustments, to 
restore balance within the organization and attain some 
stability, a certain degree of equity between various groups, 
gender equity, wage equity, racial equity and equity between 
people with disabilities and those who do not have disabilities. 
That is how an employer can manage to meet modern standards, 
decent standards of employment equity.
<P>
	He does not tell an employee already penalized by a layoff: 
``What a shame. We have an opening, but instead of rehiring 
you, we will give the preference to an employee who already 
enjoys some degree of protection as a member of a visible 
minority''.
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	All employees should be on an equal footing. I think that there 
should be no exceptions when the time comes to recall 
employees who may have lost their jobs prematurely.
<P>
	I do not know how much time I have remaining. Do I have 
time for a few more comments? I gather that your silence means 
that I do, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	Based on the foregoing, the Bloc Quebecois cannot support 
Motions Nos. 1, 2 and 4. On the other hand, Motion No. 3 
appears to be much more reasonable, seeking a form of equity at 
work that is in line with our standards of sound human resources 
management. We will therefore support Motion No. 3.
<P>
	I thank you, Mr. Speaker, for having given me your undivided 
attention. For the time being, those are the comments I had on 
this bill.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am sure that you will be listening just as religiously to my 
arguments as I talk about Bill C-76, the Budget Implementation 
Act.
<P>
	It is a little unfortunate that at this late date we are discussing 
the implementation of February's budget some months later. It 
seems that as time passes and we get away from the budget 
process the government is hoping people will forget about some 
of the fiscal crises the country will still have to go through 
because of some decisions taken and some decisions not taken in 
last February's budget.
<P>
	It is interesting how we get taken up with other issues in 
Parliament when this overriding fiscal issue will drive the 
agenda in the months and years to come whether or not we like 
it. It is good to get to the fiscal issues.
<P>
	I would like to speak specifically to the first group of 
amendments to Bill C-76. I am most interested in Motions Nos. 
1, 3 and 4 within the group. I remind all members that the first 10 
clauses of Bill C-76 contain changes to the way we address the 
public service and changes to the workforce adjustment 
directive brought in by the government in the February budget.
<P>
	These changes mark a breach of a very clear and explicit 
promise by the Liberal government upon implementation of the 
budget. On July 22, 1994 the President of the Treasury Board 
wrote to the public service union. I think members opposite will 
be very interested in what he said. I quote from the letter to the 
public service union:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This government has stated in the past, and remains committed to the 
principle, that the employment protection provisions in the workforce 
adjustment directive will only be changed through negotiations.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	We all know what happened in the February budget. Like so 
many other Liberal promises, the promise to negotiate changes 
to the workforce adjustment directive went by the wayside. The 
government is now legislating change and the promise made by 
the President of the Treasury Board on July 22 is no longer being 
upheld.
<P>
	We in this party have always said we felt the workforce 
adjustment directive would have to be changed. We said that 
consistently. We said there would be some layoffs in the public 
service. We said that consistently. We did not change the story 
after the election. We kept the same story with the same truth 
from start to finish. It is unfortunate that the double tongued 
Liberals have decided to change the directive after they 
promised not to do so.
<P>
<B>(1605 ) </B>
<P>
	They should never have promised it in the first place. If they 
knew they would not keep it, that they would not be able to do it 
and that they would legislate it, they should have been honest 
enough to say that up front. At least the Reform Party has been 
consistent in its belief of what would have to happen to the 
workforce adjustment directive. I remind the public service 
unions and members opposite that the government has backed 
out on another promise.
<P>
	Another firm promise was made by the President of the 
Treasury Board in the House with respect to Motion No. 1. He 
promised that no public servant would be paid if he or she was 
not doing work. The promise was made in response to reports 
that this was happening in the public service. We tried to find out 
more particulars, but it seems there are no reporting 
requirements from departments to the Public Service 
Commission on how many people are being paid to stay at home 
or paid not to work under the workforce adjustment directive. 
Unfortunately we cannot get exact numbers, but we extracted a 
promise from 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13064"> 13064 </A></B>
<P>
the President of the Treasury Board that no one would be paid if 
he or she were not working.
<P>
	However, from the briefing departmental officials gave us on 
the bill, we learned that there may in fact be a six-month period 
when a public servant's position might be declared surplus. 
Then the public servant would be paid for six months without 
having a job to do.
<P>
	The first amendment simply calls on the government to fulfil 
the promise it made in the House which basically said that if a 
person is not working he or she will not be paid. That is 
something Canadians want and expect. Even public servants 
recognize that obviously they cannot be paid if there is no work 
to do.
<P>
	The second motion I would like to speak to amends clause 8. It 
would give power to the Public Service Commission to appoint 
employees without competition. The last part of clause 8 reads 
as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-the Commission may, before the lay off becomes effective and if it is of 
the opinion that it is in the best interests of the Public Service to do so, 
appoint the employee, without competition and in priority to all other 
persons, to another position under the jurisdiction of the deputy head for 
which, in the opinion of the Commission, the employee is qualified.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	We have some real problems with the power that provision 
would give to the government. It flies in the face of the whole 
idea of competition and merit in the public sector. Western 
democracies have always depended on a series of checks and 
balances. This is born out of a basic mistrust of government, an 
attitude that says: ``We might think you are nice right now, but 
we do not know what you will do later on if there are not checks 
and balances in place, so we need to put those checks in there 
while things are still smooth''. One of the reasons we have 
opposition parties in the House of Commons is to provide 
checks and balances.
<P>
	Checks and balances are vital to the health of the country. 
When we see that an opposition party, for example in some third 
world country, is being mistreated by the government, we see 
that democracy and the country in general are in trouble.
<P>
	There are checks and balances in the system in Canada. One 
check against nepotism, bribery and other forms of corruption in 
government is the competitive process developed in Canada for 
public service jobs. This means that people get jobs through 
merit, not because they are someone's friend or they contributed 
to someone's campaign or happen to know someone in an inner 
sanctum somewhere. The process is open. It is fair. It means that 
we get the best person for the job. That is what competitions do. 
The selection process within the federal government is quite fair 
for the most part. That is why I felt such a concern when I read 
clause 8 of Bill C-76.
<P>
	I realize we are in a period of flux in Canada following the 
Budget Implementation Act. Departments are downsizing and 
things are a bit chaotic. During this time of downsizing and 
readjustment within the priorities of the departments, controls 
and vigilance on the merit principle are perhaps not as strong as 
usual. The clause as  it stands now would empower the Public 
Service Commission at this chaotic and stormy time to:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-appoint the employee, without competition-to another position under 
the jurisdiction of the deputy head for which, in the opinion of the 
Commission, the employee is qualified.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	This is a dangerous trend to get away from the merit principle. 
Reformers believe that a system of checks and balances is the 
only way to ensure that corruption is weeded out of the system 
and that the competitive process is the check on errors in hiring 
in the public service. It is missing because of this clause.
<P>
	All sorts of irrelevant qualifications could be used here from 
good friends of decision makers to relatives, to political friends 
and so on, if it is just in the opinion of the deputy head that a 
person should be appointed. We think that is wrong. The way the 
clause reads now, a manager could use it to settle a score with 
someone. He or she could use the clause as a tool to get back at 
someone who has not been co-operative in the downsizing. At 
any rate people can be appointed without consideration of merit 
by using the clause.
<P>
	We agree with the idea that the commission should be able to 
appoint surplus employees to different departments because 
during this time the government needs the flexibility to preserve 
the best of our human resources. However to do it outside the 
competitive process is a big mistake.
<P>
	Our amendment would ensure that the Public Service 
Commission still has the power to appoint employees, but it 
would require that a competition be held among surplus 
employees for the jobs across the public service. This would 
ensure that the merit principle is preserved and would be fair 
therefore to surplus employees. Even government members 
would be able to support the amendment.
<P>
	I have another motion I would like to talk to. Perhaps in the 
next round of motions I will speak to a very important motion 
about how employment equity is affected by the bill.

	He said: Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to table this series of 
amendments to Bill C-76, more specifically to the part of the 
bill which repeals the Western Grain Transportation Act and 
which transfers, at least as regards that part of Bill C-76, the 
railway line regulations to the National Transportation Act, 
1987.
<P>
	These amendments are tabled for a simple reason. We feel it is 
unfair to apply a double standard when it comes to streamlining 
railway operations in western and in eastern Canada.
<P>
	Indeed, several sections of Bill C-76 seek to maintain western 
lines used for grain transportation, for reasons of public interest. 
In other words, under Bill C-76, a western line will be 
maintained if it is deemed to be of public interest, even if it is 
not cost effective, as long as it is used to transport grain.
<P>
	However, the rules are different in eastern Canada, and that is 
why we speak of a double standard. Indeed, at least until the 
Minister of Transport tables appropriate legislation, some 
branch lines and main lines are being closed in the east, 
particularly in Quebec, based only on cost effectiveness. This is 
why we say there is a double standard. In the west, railway lines 
are being protected.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	But the east is passed over because it is not cost effective. Just 
look at the double standard regarding the west: a huge 
compensation package, literally huge, will be paid to western 
producers to offset the decision to abolish the Western Grain 
Transportation Act.
<P>
	And when the federal government commits to paying $1.6 
billion in tax-free compensation over the next three years to 
prairie farmers because it is going to phase out the Crow rate, a 
preferential rate, over a period of six years, that $1.6 billion 
tax-free is really worth $2.2 billion.
<P>
	The federal government did not compensate Quebec 
industrial milk producers when it reduced dairy subsidies. 
Neither did it compensate them when it announced, after GATT 
negotiations, that it will be opening up our borders more and 
more to foreign competitors. Quebec farmers were not 
compensated when federal subsidies were cut here and there. 
They were told: ``We are cutting, so deal with it''.
<P>
	The federal government is asking all Canadians, all 
Quebecers, to tighten their belts while it hacks away at the 
unemployment insurance fund, social assistance transfers to the 
provinces, post-secondary education and health, tax benefits for 
seniors. For example, when the Minister of Finance's first 
budget abolished the old age tax credit, it took $500 million out 
of seniors' pockets. There is also the threat of cuts to old age 
security. But, at the same time, the federal government' old 
double standard comes into play: it is greasing the palms of 
western producers, the ``cattlemen'', to the tune of a $2.2 billion 
package to compensate for the gradual phasing-out of the 
preferential rate for western grain transportation, which was 
already loathsome in itself. There was no uproar from Reform 
members regarding that move.
<P>
	When subsidies are paid to their constituents, there are no 
shouts of protest. Not a peep from the hon. member for 
Capilano-Howe Sound, who merrily keeps hitting at the 
neediest in our society, day in, day out, and who even suggested 
abolishing all social programs in Canada. There were no 
protests from him when it was about subsidizing the people in 
western Canada, the people he represents. It is perfectly proper 
to pay billions of dollars to grain producers in the Prairies.
<P>
	Yes, a double standard, because by getting rid of the Crow rate 
and paying a subsidy of $2.2 billion, the government is upsetting 
the balance achieved at the end of the last century, in 1897, when 
this rate structure was introduced. It upsets the competitive 
balance that developed over time between western grain 
producers and eastern producers who are mainly involved in 
meat and dairy production.
<P>
	Although the gradual phasing out of the Crow rate destroys 
this balance, there is no mention of compensation for eastern 
producers. Not a word about compensation for farm producers in 
Quebec. However,  destroying this competitive balance will 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13067"> 13067 </A></B>
<P>
result in losses estimated at from 24 to 40 million dollars 
annually, losses that Quebec farm producers will have to absorb. 
The federal government, which has always applied a double 
standard in the case of eastern farm producers and farm 
producers in Quebec is not providing any compensation for 
Quebec producers.
<P>
	Negotiations between the federal government and Quebec 
producers have just ended. Last week, I was told that what the 
federal government offered was peanuts, a small amount that 
might be paid at some time in the future, provided Quebec 
producers keep quiet and do not condemn the inequities of this 
system.
<P>
	A double standard, because abolishing the Crow rate means 
that local grain prices in western Canada will go down-not the 
international price but the local price. This provides an 
incentive for animal production.
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	As the preferential rate is phased out and ultimately abolished 
in 2001, western beef and pork producers are being given a 
considerable competitive edge over Quebec producers. And on 
top of this, as I said before, they are getting $2.2 billion in 
federal funds, part of which, in fact 23.8 per cent, is paid for by 
Quebec taxpayers.
<P>
	And so federal subsidies are being given to western farmers, 
subsidies paid for in part by Quebecers' taxes, enabling western 
pork and beef producers to come and compete with Quebec 
producers in their own market.
<P>
	If this is fair federalism, what can unfair federalism be like? If 
flexible federalism means looking only at the collapse of a 
balance in the west and not looking at the other part of the 
country, which is affected by a decision such as the one to 
eliminate the WGTA and then compensate western farmers, 
there is a serious problem here.
<P>
	We would have preferred, and this is the thrust of our 
amendments, first, that the Crow's Nest rate, the preferential 
Crow's Nest rate, be eliminated immediately and not over the 
next six years. The debate on this issue has been going on in 
Canada since 1978. I was present at the first, the second and the 
third debate, in different positions. Quebec's position has 
remained unchanged: if the preferential Crow's Nest rate, which 
has no equivalent in the east, is to be abolished, let us get on with 
it. As for the producers, and here I agree with the Reform Party 
on certain points, when they talk about areas other than those 
they serve, they should be made competitive right away.
<P>
	Why gradually reduce the Crow's Nest subsidy and why 
gradually get around to increasing railway transport rates, when, 
according to the Reform Party, all of the west should operate as a 
free market system, efficiency driven and subsidy free?
<P>
	They are engaging in double talk. When it suits them, they 
oppose subsidies. When it does not suit them, because the 
pressure in their ridings is too great, they say nothing. Look at 
them. They have no amendment to eliminate the $2.2 million in 
compensation to western grain farmers.
<P>
	We in the official opposition would have preferred this rate 
structure and the compensation to be dropped immediately, 
because Quebecers and Canadians everywhere else are being 
asked to tighten their belts. They are not getting any 
compensation. There is no transition.
<P>
	When the Minister of Finance decided to withdraw $2.5 
billion from the unemployment insurance fund, he did so in one 
shot, all at once. He said nothing about transition. He said 
nothing about transition for the poorest families either, for those 
who are the most disadvantaged whom we have deprived of their 
only way out, through public housing, for example. He made no 
mention of transition, the Minister of Finance. There was no talk 
of spreading these decisions over five or six years.
<P>
	It is outrageous that, for election purposes, the Liberals, who, 
as we know, are not strong in the west, are offering gifts to 
western voters and forgetting about voters in Quebec and the 
rest of Canada in general.
<P>
	I find this double talk, this talk of the extreme right, from 
those beside us really distasteful in the context of subsidies to 
the most disadvantaged to ease their misery. The Reform Party's 
attitude toward our society's most disadvantaged is of the 
extreme right, but when it comes to paying out $2.2 billion to 
western producers, it becomes most conciliatory, nearly 
socialist.
<P>
	The thrust of our amendments is: let us get rid of the Crow 
rate.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Walker (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we are now looking at 12 motions 
in group 2. I will explain the government motions and the 
reasons for them and then return if time permits to some of the 
motions being presented by the other parties.
<P>
<B>(1630 ) </B>
<P>
	The two motions being presented by the government are 
Motions Nos. 12 and 14. In Motion No. 12 the Minister of 
Finance is proposing that subsection 181.12(2) of the National 
Transportation Act, as contained in clause 21, be amended so 
that the agency will establish maximum regulated rates from 
and after the 1996-97 crop year.
<P>
	This motion, together with Motion No. 14, which I will 
explain in a minute, will amend the NTA so that the maximum 
regulated rate provisions will be retained beyond July 31, 2000 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13068"> 13068 </A></B>
<P>
as currently provided in Bill C-76. The motion is a 
consequential amendment required as a  result of the proposed 
amendments to sections 181.18 and 181.19 as set out in Motion 
No. 6.
<P>
	The Canadian Federation of Agriculture and Prairie Pools Inc. 
both proposed to the Standing Committee on Finance that the 
review to be conducted by the Minister of Transport be 
expanded to include whether efficiency gains are shared 
between shippers and railroad companies.
<P>
	In proposing this amendment and the amendment to section 
181.18, the government is being responsive to the concerns of 
farmers, as expressed widely throughout western Canada and by 
many industry spokespeople. I compliment the minister for the 
number of hours he spent with groups across the country making 
sure that the bill is absolutely correct.
<P>
	Many of these farmers ask that the Minister of Transport 
conduct a review of the grain handling and transportation 
system and whether efficiencies of the grain transportation 
system are being shared by shippers and railroad companies 
before moving to a deregulated system.
<P>
	In Motion No. 14, the Minister of Finance is proposing that 
the review conducted by the Minister of Transport pursuant to 
subsection 181.18(1) be broadened to include whether 
efficiency gains are being shared between shippers and railroad 
companies.
<P>
	Under subsection 181.18(2), the Minister of Transport will 
also consider whether the repeal of the maximum regulated rate 
provisions will have a significant impact on shippers and if 
those provisions should be repealed.
<P>
	Section 181.19 will be amended so that if the Minister of 
Transport in conducting his review determines that the 
maximum regulated rate provisions should be repealed, those 
provisions will be repealed as of a date fixed by order of the 
governor in council.
<P>
	The Canadian Federation of Agriculture and Prairie Pools Inc. 
both proposed to the Standing Committee on Finance that the 
review to be conducted by the Minister of Transport be 
expanded to include whether efficiency gains are shared 
between shippers and railroad companies.
<P>
	In proposing this amendment to section 181.18 the 
government is being responsive to the concerns of farmers who 
asked that this review be done. In addition, the Minister of 
Transport in conducting his review in 1999 will take into 
account the interests of both the railroad companies and the 
shippers in determining whether the maximum regulated rate 
provisions should remain in place. Both the shippers and 
railroad companies will have ample opportunity to make their 
views known to the minister before he completes his review.
<P>
	The motions being presented, first by the official opposition, 
will completely undermine the efforts being made to modernize 
the western Canadian grain transportation system. I do not have 
to tell members that there is a lot of history in the legislation we 
are presenting. It is one in which the farming community has 
been back and forth on for one generation after the other.
<P>
	This is that rare time when the major actors in the industry 
have come together to support legislation that will be a giant 
step forward in the reorganization of the grain industry. Like 
others, there is lots of speculation on what these changes are 
going to mean. Nevertheless people see many positive benefits 
coming out for western Canadian agricultural producers.
<P>
	Considering how much wealth they contribute to this whole 
country, anything that benefits the farmers of western Canada 
can very quickly benefit the rest of the country.
<P>
	Motions Nos. 5 to 11, because of the nature of the official 
opposition amendments, would result in the deletion of the 
provisions that identify grain dependent branch lines and 
exempt designated grain dependent branch lines from certain 
provisions of the NTA, such as the notice of intention and 
conveyance provisions with respect to abandonment of branch 
lines. These motions would make it more difficult for rail 
companies to improve the efficiency and reduce the cost to ship 
grain from the prairies.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	In Motion No. 5, the financial critic for the opposition party is 
proposing that clause 11, which amends section 4 of the 
National Transportation Act, 1987 to add a definition of grain 
dependent branch lines, be deleted.
<P>
	The definition of grain dependent branch lines is necessary as 
this and other provisions in Bill C-76, identify grain dependent 
branch lines and exempts designated grain dependent branch 
lines from certain provisions of the NTA, such as the notice of 
intention and conveyance provisions with respect to 
abandonment of branch lines.
<P>
	This provision and other provisions in Bill C-76 will make it 
easier for railway companies to abandon inefficient and costly 
grain dependent branch lines.
<P>
	The motion proposed by the official opposition would make it 
much more difficult for railway companies to improve the 
efficiency of the grain transportation system and to reduce the 
cost to ship grain from the prairies.
<P>
	Motion No. 6 proposes that the heading of clause 12 be 
amended by replacing the words ``the act'' with the National 
Transportation Act, 1987. This is a proposal which follows from 
the changes and the refusal of the opposition to deal with the 
changes we are proposing.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13069"> 13069 </A></B>
<P>
	The official opposition is proposing in Motion No. 7 that 
clause 16, which exempts grain dependent branch lines from the 
notice of intention provision under the NTA be deleted. As I 
stated, this proposal would make it more difficult and 
cumbersome for railroad companies to abandon inefficient and 
costly grain dependent branch lines.
<P>
	I will not take the time of the House to go through some of the 
other motions. In these I have reviewed the major differences we 
have with the official opposition. As I stated before, the changes 
being proposed in Bill C-76 will be of great benefit to the 
western Canadian agricultural community and that spills over to 
the rest of the country. People in every province will see a much 
stronger Canada as the western grain farmers and other 
agriculture producers gain maximum advantage from changes in 
our regulations and laws.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
is a pleasure to speak to this group of proposed amendments. We 
have some difficulties with some of the clauses of the budget 
implementation act. Some of the clauses give arbitrary powers 
to cabinet to make decisions.
<P>
	I reminds me a little of earlier in the bill of some of the powers 
given to the Public Service Commission, for example, where it 
is allowed to appoint people without competition. Arbitrary 
powers are never a good thing to give out.
<P>
	Under the powers of the Public Service Commission, 
members will know that over the next three years the 
government will be spending some $41 million to, among other 
things, recruit new public servants from designated groups 
under the special measures initiatives run by the Public Service 
Commission. At a time of substantial layoffs it is a huge amount 
of power given to a commission to recruit people at the cost of 
tens of millions of dollars, when we are laying off 45,000 others. 
It seems a little ridiculous to me. It is obviously unfair to be 
hiring new workers at a time when thousands of surplus ones are 
eager and willing to work at any of the jobs.
<P>
	It is particularly an insult to hard working civil servants who 
have spent many years working in a position only to come to 
work one day to find that their desk has been cleaned out and a 
fresh new face is in the office doing their work and the job they 
are fully qualified for, but they lost it because another person 
was hired under the special measures initiative or the 
employment equity program.
<P>
	That is the kind of arbitrary power we do not think the Public 
Service Commission should have. We believe that arbitrary 
powers giving cabinet or in the case I am talking about, the 
Public Service Commission, the ability to bypass merit or the 
regular way of doing business, to hiring, promoting, firing and 
so on, is not a good thing.
<P>
<B>(1640 ) </B>
<P>
	We need checks and balances on government. The bill gives 
too much power to a select few people. The power I mentioned 
the Public Service Commission has under the bill is typical of 
that. Other clauses in this transportation area give the cabinet in 
our opinion too much power but I will leave it at that.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mark Assad (Gatineau-La Lièvre, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Bill C-76, which is the continuation of the budget and deals with 
the Work Force Adjustment Directive, is a rather important one. 
It drew many comments, especially from the Reform Party and 
the Bloc. I believe there are some fundamental elements we 
should take into account in Parliament. For all intents and 
purposes, we are the voice of our fellow citizens, and it is 
important that they know exactly what is at stake here.
<P>
	I listened to the Reform members talk about the deficit, 
government spending, and the debt which is growing at the rate 
of $100 million a day, and also to all their arguments to the effect 
that the government must cut expenditures. As we know, it has 
been proven, on many occasions, that at the present time, except 
for the debt service, the regular operating expenditures of the 
government do not exceed its revenue. The debt service is very 
high in Canada because we have an accumulated debt of close to 
$500 billion.
<P>
	Members opposite keep on talking about government 
spending. But we must not forget that expenditures are only one 
of the elements of the deficit we are facing in this country. One 
must not single out the expenditures of the Canadian 
government as the only reason for our deficit.
<P>
	In the past, deficits were very high, as compared to total 
expenditures. Expenditures were high in the past, as we saw 
under the previous government. I am not trying to say that we 
were blameless in the past; in some instances, expenditures went 
well beyond what should have been tolerable. In any case, what 
is important now is to correct the situation. One must not lose 
track of the fact that expenditures are but one element.
<P>
	Second, we must recognize that our tax system being slightly 
obsolete, the in-depth reform of our tax system is one of the 
elements which is going to put our economy back on a level that 
is acceptable to all Canadians, especially the middle class.
<P>
	Third, and this is important, it is the monetary system of this 
country which causes our interest rates to be too high. We must 
recognize that the Bank of Canada has a role to play. In the past, 
the Bank of Canada played a very important role in controlling 
interests rates nationally. But, because of our deficit, we lost 
this power. However, with good management, it should be 
possible to get it back. We are trying. It will take several years, 
but let us hope we will succeed within one mandate or one and a 
half at the most. We want the Bank of Canada to  really play an 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13070"> 13070 </A></B>
<P>
active role, we want complete fiscal reform, and we hope that 
our monetary system, which is not working to our advantage, 
will be modified.
<P>
	So three different elements come into play.
<P>
	Furthermore, the Minister of Finance proposed some 
workforce adjustments. Since we are being told to reduce 
spending, we tried to achieve this by streamlining of the public 
service.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	When I hear that 45,000 employees will lose their jobs, I think 
this is a bit of an exaggeration, because this will happen over a 
three-year period, and most of these 45,000 people will either 
take normal retirement or early retirement, or accept what we 
call a buy-out.
<P>
	In conclusion, therefore, I would like this House to 
understand that our problems cannot be ascribed to one thing 
only, that is spending alone. High interest rates, largely the 
result of our monetary system of the last 15 to 20 years, made it 
difficult for us to carry out reforms, especially the reform of the 
tax system which is sorely needed because of the very heavy tax 
burden on the middle class.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to take the floor to talk about the amendments to Bill 
C-76. When I heard the hon. member for Gatineau-La Lièvre 
talk about the monetary system and cuts in the public service, 
when the subject is really amendments to the Crow's Nest Pass 
policy and to the subsidy to Western grain farmers, I thought I 
had got my day wrong.
<P>
	Well, we cannot very well prevent him from talking about the 
subjects dear to his heart, but I am happy to hear that he does not 
share the views of his Minister of Finance, and I urge him to 
point that out to the minister, who is following a monetary 
policy basically similar, if not identical, to that of his 
Conservative predecessors. I also urge him to mention it to his 
constituents.
<P>
	This is a good illustration of a policy which makes it difficult 
to deal equitably with an issue. It happened in the past, and it 
continues in the budget, which treats dairy producers from 
Quebec and grain producers from the West differently. This is 
the continuation of a long series of historical decisions 
regarding agriculture and rail transport which, in both cases, 
worked to the advantage of Western Canada.
<P>
	I am quite pleased to point this out, because we still hear 
Liberal and Reform members criticize the fact that Quebec 
receives, in some areas, transfer payments or equalization 
payments. They called them gifts to Quebec, but they do not 
criticize this policy which, for a long time, has allowed the West 
to develop. The development of the railway system cost billions 
of dollars, and allowed a lot of farmers to grow and prosper in 
Western Canada. However, we seem to forget all the money that 
was poured into this because it is less visible nowadays, since it 
was done over a period of time.
<P>
	But now, with all the financial choices and spending cuts we 
face, this resurfaces. A moment ago, my colleague from 
Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot talked about that. When the 
unemployed are victims of cuts, we do not say to them that we 
are going to allow them transition, adjustment periods. Soon, we 
will be making changes to the Canada pension plan or looking at 
the income security program, and throughout this debate that 
will be held in the fall, I am sure that these changes will not 
provide for long transition periods for the persons affected.
<P>
	But when we speak about capital gains, family trusts, and 
other matters, then we have to have long transition periods to 
give people a chance to adapt. However, when the ordinary 
people, who are the most affected, are concerned, we forget 
about that.
<P>
	I talked briefly about the impact of this policy on the 
development of the railway system. This has also encouraged 
farmers. For years now, in Quebec, we have been told that every 
rail section must be viable. When they are not, the tendency is to 
privatise them, to get rid of them, to give them to anybody, and 
not to keep them. Under the same policy out west, we have 
always supported the maintenance of this system, because they 
were very clearly linked to the development of the farming 
industry.
<P>
	Earlier, I tried to describe the situation in this way: if you are a 
grain producer, it is not the dairy truck which goes by your 
house, but the rail system, to help you, support you or allow you 
to send your crop to the export points. Over the years, things 
have evolved. At the beginning, almost 90 per cent of the 
financial support came from the government.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	And now, financial choices have to be made. In its budget, the 
federal government says that it must cut in that area, but it is 
planning a $1.6 billion compensation package. An important 
factor to consider is the fiscal side of the equation. When we talk 
about non-taxable money, the amount is higher than that, 
perhaps more than $2 billion.
<P>
	In the same budget, we are told that tens of millions of dollars 
will be cut for milk producers in Quebec, but no mention is made 
of any compensation. So, we have the unfair treatment given by 
the federal government which has supported the railway system 
and supported Western Canada to the tune of hundreds of 
millions of dollars, on the one hand, and has funded 
development differently in Quebec, by giving it less support, on 
the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13071"> 13071 </A></B>
<P>
other hand. And now, this historical imbalance is being 
perpetuated, under the pretext that market forces must now be 
left to come into play.
<P>
	In Quebec, there is no compensation package, no transition 
measure. The federal government is saying to milk producers 
that they can raise their prices, and that they have the flexibility 
to do that. In other words, it is saying to Quebec consumers that 
they will pay for that. We account for some 23.8 per cent of total 
tax revenues, so we will also pay 23.8 per cent of the 
compensation package given to Western producers.
<P>
	In this bill, there are many examples of the federal 
government's approach toward development in the different 
regions, particularly those in Quebec. This is the same bill sets 
up transfer payment negotiations which, for Quecbec, can only 
lead to reduced transfer payments, and a smaller percentage than 
what it is getting now. No matter what solution is found, I am 
convinced that Quebec will not receive more than before.
<P>
	The Ontario government will come to the negotiating table 
with many huge claims. This has been going on for several 
years, and just because Ontario changes government does not 
mean that these claims will also change. Quebec is facing cuts 
that will affect it more than the other provinces. It is said that 
more than 40 per cent of the cuts will be made in Quebec. In the 
same bill, dairy producers are also being hit harder, because they 
will not get any compensation package.
<P>
	There are many reasons why, once this bill is passed, the 
federal government will be even less committed than before to 
supporting Quebec's development. These people are the same 
ones telling us that this system is cost effective, that it is good 
for Quebecers.
<P>
	I want to raise a point in response to what the hon. member for 
Gatineau-La Lièvre said about federal public servants. 
Whenever the issue of sovereignty comes up, the people across 
the way are eager to tell us that it would spell disaster for the 
Outaouais, although they are saying very little about the roughly 
15,000 jobs they are cutting in the region. The hon. member was 
very subdued in the House, probably because he has a carefully 
crafted quote for his next householder. He does not criticize his 
government's decisions in the newspapers or anywhere else. He 
did not defend them in committee. Where was he? Where are 
these great champions of the Outaouais who enjoy telling us that 
we are very well served by the current system? This bill also 
contains provisions affecting federal public servants.
<P>
	The government whip did not rise either. Government 
members make timid speeches to keep their constituents happy; 
their remarks are never very searing. There are fiscal choices to 
be made. If the Western Grain Transportation Act must indeed 
be repealed, they should stop trying to provide indirect financial 
support and incentives, and stop attempting to raise the Liberal 
Party's profile in the West, as was recently done in Manitoba. 
Although we understand why they want to improve Liberal 
prospects in that region, $2.2 billion is a lot to pay just to buy 
votes. We have serious reservations here. If this policy must be 
scrapped, they should have  the courage to do so now and to 
respect the commitments made by the Bloc Quebecois.

<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-76, be amended by deleting Schedule II, on pages 46 to 48.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Mr. Riis:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have an opportunity to 
speak to this part of Bill C-76, an act to implement certain 
provisions of the budget that was tabled on February 27, 1995.
<P>
	At the outset I want to say that while we are speaking on a 
number of sections of the bill we find that this is one of the more 
regressive pieces of budgetary legislation that this country has 
ever seen in terms of moving Canada backward into a bygone 
era. I had hoped that a budget would be brought in to advance the 
economic, social and cultural agenda of the country. I do not 
think anyone can say anything other than this will set us back. It 
is like looking only in the rear view mirror while driving.
<P>
	The provisions we are looking at under group 3 by and large 
eliminate the Crow rate benefit from the legislation. It takes the 
whole matter of the demise of the Crow outside of this piece of 
legislation. Farmers in western Canada developed their grain 
industry on the basis of three fundamental pillars and in close 
partnership with the federal government.
<P>
	One pillar was a grain transportation system built around the 
Crow subsidy. I recognize that to compete particularly with the 
United States which has a whole set of subsidy programs for its 
western grain producers and the fact that our grain producers 
were some distance from the coast where the grain would be 
exported, having some kind of a grain subsidy built into the 
transportation system made a lot of sense. It enabled us to 
become a global bread basket as a result.
<P>
	The second pillar was the orderly marketing system through 
the Canadian Wheat Board on the basis of equal delivery 
opportunity and a price pooling system. We could say if people 
were to evaluate this objectively that over the years this has 
served this country well.
<P>
	The third pillar was a grain handling system owned by the 
farmers through a western Canadian co-operative system.
<P>
	When I look at this particular initiative of the government, 
which in a sense is abandoning the Crow rate, it reminds me of a 
previous Prime Minister who spoke of certain sacred trusts. He 
said that as a result of these trade deals we would not see any 
diminution in the quality of our social programs. We know that 
did not take place. We have seen the erosion of virtually every 
social program. We have seen the disappearance of social 
programs as we have moved our social programs to harmonize 
more closely with those in Mississippi, Louisiana, Tennessee 
and east Texas. That is not the kind of Canada we expected.
<P>
<B>(1700) </B>
<P>
	Prior to the government's taking office it said it did not agree 
with the provisions of NAFTA either; that unless the provisions 
of NAFTA were dramatically shifted, altered and amended it 
would abrogate the deal. That did not take place at all. As soon 
as it took office there were a couple of little tinkers; it has now 
become a NAFTA cheerleader like we have never seen before.
<P>
	I do not think the government has a mandate to proceed with 
this section of the bill. On May 10, 1993 the present Prime 
Minister said the following at a press conference he called to 
unveil the party's election campaign farm policy platform: ``As 
federal Liberal leader, our government would prefer to retain the 
existing Crow rate benefit method of payment rather than 
change it as the Conservative government is proposing''. That 
was on May 13, 1993 from page 17 of the <I>Western Producer</I>.
<P>
	In other words, heading into the election campaign the Prime 
Minister, articulating the Liberal Party's agricultural policy, in a 
sense said they want to retain the Crow rate; the Conservatives 
do not, but they do as a political party. On that basis people, 
particularly from the Canadian plains, voted Liberal in such 
sufficient numbers that they were able to form the government. 
Now they are doing exactly the opposite. They are abandoning 
the Crow rate provision.
<P>
	I do not think it take a rocket scientist to figure out if they say 
their party policy is to maintain the Crow rate and as soon as 
they become a government they decide to abandon the Crow 
rate, they seem to be pulling a fast one on the electorate. They 
seem to be saying one thing and doing another. I do not think it is 
unreasonable for us to question whether the government 
actually has a mandate to proceed with this. Strictly on the basis 
of principle we are suggesting this section be abandoned.
<P>
	There is another reason we are suggesting this section of the 
bill should be abandoned. What are the implications of 
abandoning the Crow system? I know we have differences of 
views in the House of Commons. Some people feel this is a good 
idea for all sorts of reasons; others feel this is a bad initiative. 
Most people 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13073"> 13073 </A></B>
<P>
probably wonder about the implications of making this major 
change to the way the western grain sector is supported.
<P>
	To my friends on the government side and to my good friends 
in the Reform Party and in the Bloc, I encourage those endorsing 
this initiative to articulate what the implications would be of 
this major change. How will this affect the future of western 
grain farming?
<P>
	Before we proceed as Parliament with agreement on this 
provision we should have a clear understanding of whether this 
will or will not cause difficulties. My colleagues and I believe 
very strongly this will not be in the best interest of western grain 
producers. We will be hearing some of the reasons in detail, 
particularly from those who represent prairie constituencies.
<P>
	I appreciate the opportunity to bring forward these 
amendments in hopes of retaining what I think every grain 
farmer felt was a sacred trust.
<P>
[Translation] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, once again, I am pleased to participate in the debate on 
the transportation of western grain.
<P>
	Most of the amendments now being discussed concern the 
compensation to be paid to western producers since, by the year 
2001, the preferential Crow rate applied to the transportation of 
western grain to the main points of export will be abolished, as 
will the Crow rate itself.
<P>
<B>(1705) </B>
<P>
	The government is trying to transform a grain transportation 
policy which has been in effect since the end of the last century 
into a western agriculture development and diversification 
policy. The Crow rate has been an issue for many years. Many 
attempts were made to abolish that tariff system dating back to 
the 19th century, but no consensus was ever reached on how to 
do it.
<P>
	Eliminating the preferential rate has the effect of triggering a 
decrease in the price of western grain. Consequently, abolishing 
the preferential Crow rate on grain exports provides a 
competitive advantage to western beef and pork producers. 
According to various studies, that advantage is estimated at 
somewhere between $8 and $15 per metric tonne of western 
grain. So, by triggering this $8 to $15 decrease in the price of a 
metric tonne of grain, the elimination of the Crow rate destroys 
the competitive balance between the western and eastern 
economies, which are respectively based on grain and livestock 
production.
<P>
	The abolition of this transportation tariff provides a 
competitive advantage for western pork and beef producers, 
who will be in a better position to compete with their Quebec, 
Ontario and even international counterparts.
<P>
	During the numerous debates that we have had in recent years 
concerning the Crow rate farmers in Quebec, Ontario, the 
maritimes and some in the prairies and British Columbia said 
that they accepted this fact. The accepted the fact that abolishing 
the preferential rate would have an impact on the local price of 
grain in western Canada and that it would change the balance.
<P>
	If my memory serves me well, even in Quebec, the Union des 
producteurs agricoles was saying in 1982: ``Abolish the 
preferential rate, stop paying hundreds of millions of dollars a 
year to maintain this rate structure and we are prepared to accept 
the fact that such a measure will lower the local price of grain 
and will thereby help increase livestock production in Western 
Canada''. And now, not only will the reduction in the local price 
of grain help increase livestock production in the west to the 
detriment of eastern producers, but the government is telling 
western producers that it will compensate them for the 
elimination of the Crow benefit, that it will give them $1.6 
billion tax free in transition payments, which is more like $2.2 
billion.
<P>
	Not only has the government reduced local grain prices 
thereby encouraging livestock production in the west, but it is 
giving western producers $2.2 billion based on the farmland 
they own, and that goes for grain producers as well as for beef 
and pork producers. It is ridiculous to abolish a transportation 
rate structure and, at the same time, to give compensation 
payments that will serve to subsidize western economic 
diversification and the development of livestock production.
<P>
	It makes no sense that this part of the bill provides for the 
payment to western producers of $2.2 billion, when 24 per cent 
of this money, which is federal, comes from producers in 
Quebec. It makes no sense that these subsidies are being handed 
out so that western pork and beef producers can compete with 
our producers in Quebec. In any event, there are many who say 
that that is not how they see the federal regime. It makes no 
sense at all.
<P>
	Those who are sceptical about the effect of this approach on 
the production of pork and beef in Quebec need only look at 
what happened in Alberta in recent years with the Crow offset, a 
policy that my Reform colleagues probably know all about. The 
result was a 10 per cent annual increase in Alberta's pork 
production with a policy that was almost identical, but that was 
provincial in scope.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	So that is clear. We are saying that this policy is inequitable. It 
is inequitable because it disrupts the balance between the east 
and the west and, in addition, gives western businesses a 
competitive edge over their eastern colleagues, particularly 
those in Quebec.
<P>
	If at least some thought had been given to the effects of this 
subsidy on eastern producers and some sort of compensation 
considered for eastern producers, had the funds been available, 
that would already have been a  slight improvement. 
Furthermore, it has been estimated that just abolishing the Crow 
rate 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13074"> 13074 </A></B>
<P>
would have an effect on Quebec's agricultural economy of 
between $24 million and $46 million. So we were told by the 
UPA president himself, Laurent Pellerin, when he appeared 
before the finance committee two weeks ago.
<P>
	Quebec is offered nothing, even though it is recognized that 
there is an imbalance that goes back to the end of the last 
century.
<P>
	We find it deplorable that this second crop of Liberals are 
doing exactly the same as the first crop. In 1982 a similar bill 
was tabled, a bill that provided for compensation to the west. 
The federal government was not in the financial situation that it 
finds itself in today, compensation could perhaps have been 
considered, but no thought was ever given to the negative effect 
on Quebec producers.
<P>
	Now, they come back, because that bill was put aside, when 
Mr. Eugene Whelan was the Minister of Agriculture. At the 
time, they said: ``Since we cannot come to an agreement, we will 
put it aside''.
<P>
	Today, they come back with this bill, at a time, moreover, 
when the financial situation is far from rosy, and they want to 
pay western producers $2.2 billion as compensation for the 
elimination of the Crow rate, just like that.
<P>
	The official opposition is strongly opposed to such a decision, 
because at a time when the UI funds, the transfers for the 
underprivileged and the transfers to the provinces are being 
slashed, the government is able to come up with $2.2 billion to 
meet the electoral needs of the few Liberals out west and to try 
and win over the Reformers' supporters.
<P>
	We support the elimination of the Crow rate, but it should be 
eliminated immediately, without any compensation. We also 
deplore the fact that the Reform members, who are usually so 
eager to protest when the underprivileged are subsidized, are 
keeping quiet, because this compensation is being granted to 
their own constituents. I find that most deplorable.
<P>
	What I also find deplorable is not only what the Liberals did, 
but also what the Reformers did. They did not attend the sittings 
of the finance committee when we talked about ways to improve 
or to repeal some of the provisions found in Bill C-76. If I were 
in their shoes today, I would be ashamed to put forward 
amendments, since they refused to hear anyone, except for a few 
witnesses from western Canada who are as far to the right as the 
Reformers have been since the election.
<P>
	This is totally unacceptable. The decisions of the government 
concerning the western grain transportation sector are 
unacceptable, and the attitude of the Reform members in this 
House is unacceptable.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It is my duty, pursuant to Standing 
Order 38, to inform the House that the questions to be raised 
tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows: the hon. 
member for Burnaby-Kingsway, health; the hon. member for 
Québec-Est, Agusta.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to 
speak to the group 3 amendments before us which affect the 
Western Grain Transportation Act, the National Transportation 
Act and the Crow rate for the future of western farmers.
<P>
<B>(1715 ) </B>
<P>
	Reformers said it very clearly during the election campaign. 
We were not like the Bloc Quebecois or the Bloc finance critic 
who stands up and says that they are going to cut certain things 
in the House of Commons while back in Quebec they talk about 
greater and more handouts for the people of Quebec.
<P>
	There is a continual inconsistency. The hon. member has just 
spoken as the finance critic for the Bloc Quebecois. He talked 
about not giving the western farmers anything, that the Crow 
benefit and the Western Grain Transportation Act benefits 
should be cut off as such. The Bloc wants to cut it off but not give 
the western farmers any kind of transitional payment whereby 
they will then take the responsibility of paying the full amount 
for the freight rate.
<P>
	Let us look at Quebec. Let us look at some of the tax 
expenditures that never get raised in the general public. In 
committee I raised the tax expenditures for the labour venture 
capital fund, $360 million in terms of tax expenditures. Three 
hundred million of that is to the people of Quebec. Other 
Canadians do not benefit from that tax expenditure. In raising 
the matter in the finance committee I asked the hon. member 
what he had to say about that because other Canadians are not 
getting a fair deal. There is a broad base of Quebecers benefiting 
from this tax expenditure.
<P>
	One day the hon. member is against tax expenditure when it 
supposedly relates to the rich or those who are planning for their 
estates; the next day when it is in their home political ground, it 
is a great thing to do. The hon. member should think about that 
when he talks about the benefits the western farmers are going to 
get with regard to a payout on the Crow rate.
<P>
	Let us look at that payout. Most likely, some $2.2 billion will 
be paid out over a two year period. What does it amount to in 
terms of the farmers of western Canada? It is not a major amount 
of money. It will be a one time payout, most likely of $16 to $18 
per acre. How much money does that really amount to? What 
will that do for a farm operation? Not very much when putting 
fertilizer on irrigated land costs $40 to $60 an acre.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13075"> 13075 </A></B>
<P>
	What is $18 an acre? The spray for crops costs $5 to $10 an 
acre. What does that $18 really mean? In that portfolio farmers 
will have to pick up the major cost of shipping their produce to 
the coast by rail. They will pay 100 per cent of that in the future.
<P>
	Within a year the farmers will not be dependent on the federal 
government for the transportation allowance. Farmers are 
willing to buy that and accept that responsibility but it does not 
hurt government when phasing out a program like that to have 
some type of transitional support system. It has done that and I 
commend the Liberal government for taking that specific 
position on this matter.
<P>
	Although the Crow benefit, the Western Grain Transportation 
Act, will have an effect on western Canada, we have to look at 
transportation on a broader base. The government must give 
some leadership there as well.
<P>
	When the free market system goes into transportation, the 
government will have to assure Canadians and assure the 
western farmers that they have access to alternate routes by 
which products can be shipped into a variety of markets in the 
world. That must be looked at.
<P>
	I raised the question with the minister of agriculture as to 
whether there were any impediments that would prevent western 
Canadian farmers from shipping their grain through the railway 
system or the port system of the United States. I asked whether 
we could use the Mississippi River to ship our grain if that were 
a more expedient, more efficient and less costly way of doing it.
<P>
<B>(1720 ) </B>
<P>
	The minister has assured me there are no impediments and 
that we will be able to do that kind of thing. I ask that the 
government ensure that will happen because we farmers in 
western Canada will look at innovative ways by which we can 
market our produce. We will look at the means by which we can 
come up with different crops. We will diversify our agriculture. 
That is a spinoff benefit of terminating the western grain 
transportation allowance and also the Crow benefit. That is a 
spinoff benefit which will be there. It will restructure 
agriculture.
<P>
	It is unfair for a member of the House to say that western 
farmers should not have any type of transitional compensation 
to make the adjustment over the next year or two. It is certainly 
unfair when that member sits in committee and talks about tax 
expenditures of over $300 million which are specifically 
targeted at a group within his province, when other Canadians do 
not have access to those kinds of tax expenditures. It seems to be 
an attempt to speak in two different arenas. There is one arena 
here but there is another arena back home that wants to hear 
those kinds of political words.
<P>
	We cannot support the amendment of the hon. member for 
Kamloops. It is a rather traditional approach to what has 
happened in Canada with respect to transportation. We think 
changes are needed and we are prepared to support them.
<P>
	We also oppose vehemently the comments and the 
amendment put forward by the hon. member for 
Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot which ask the government to 
terminate the benefits to western farmers.
<P>
	That is where we stand. We believe that under those 
circumstances we can clearly and with good conscience vote as 
we feel is right.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to put in my two cents worth on the 
report stage motions. It is not a loonie, it is two cents worth 
today.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> A double loonie.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> The member wants to hear about the double 
loonie. I am very pleased to have aroused some interest from 
members opposite. It is a pleasure to know they are listening at 
such an important time.
<P>
	The report stage motions before us relate to Bill C-76, the 
budget implementation bill. The amendment put forward by my 
colleague from Kamloops, which was seconded by me, proposes 
to eliminate those sections of Bill C-76 which deal with the 
government's proposal to remove the Crow benefit. That is the 
benefit that applies to western Canadian farmers for the 
movement of their grain from farm gate to port.
<P>
	I have been engaged in this debate for quite some time. The 
constituency I represent is rural and relies heavily on 
agricultural income to survive. The constituency which I have 
represented for six years has been engaged in the debate over the 
future of the Crow benefit for quite some time. My constituents 
have advised me frequently and constantly of the need to retain 
the Crow benefit.
<P>
	Through the motion which is before the House today, I ask 
members to consider eliminating these sections from the bill in 
order that we can study in greater detail the future implications 
of this very rash move which the government has undertaken.
<P>
<B>(1725 ) </B>
<P>
	The minister of agriculture will recall that at the beginning of 
this debate I asked the minister to withhold the sections of the 
bill, the intention to eliminate the Crow benefit, until such time 
as we did investigate the full implications of this move on the 
prairies.
<P>
	I put forward that proposal before this debate began and here 
we are at report stage, prior to third reading, and the government 
has not indicated any understanding of the implications of what 
the elimination of the Crow benefit will mean to the prairie 
economy.
<P>
	The argument comes down to the fact that for each elevator 
point on the prairies those communities will lose $1 million in 
income currently in those communities. I have previously used 
Glaslyn, Saskatchewan, a community of about 350 people, a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13076"> 13076 </A></B>
<P>
fairly large elevator market area with a very good, strong 
delivery point.
<P>
	Currently $1 million in that community will not be there after 
August 1 when this bill comes into effect; $1 million from that 
community, $4 million from the city of North Battleford and 
millions more taken from rural Saskatchewan as a result of the 
implications of this bill.
<P>
	What does that mean in terms of the future of those 
communities simply because they are growing wheat which is 
demanded by countries all over the world, countries not paying 
the freight on that product but expecting our farmers to pay the 
freight to get it to port position so that it is competitive?
<P>
	A presentation by the prairie pools to a committee in Ottawa 
on April 27, 1995 concluded: ``The termination of government 
transportation assistance and the resulting decrease in farm 
incomes not only threaten the vision but the ability of the 
Canadian industry to even maintain its current competitive 
position in the world markets''.
<P>
	These are people who deliver a product to that competitive 
marketplace telling us very clearly in response to this move on 
this bill the vision of agriculture as presented by the government 
enhancing our competitive position is threatened and that our 
ability to compete is threatened. We should pay heed to some of 
these experts who have been commenting on this over the years.
<P>
	I also quote from another presentation made before the 
finance committee studying Bill C-76. The national farmers 
union's report concluded that the cuts in the federal budget, 
which are in addition to the elimination of the Crow benefit and 
including it, will have an unprecedented impact-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am very sorry to interrupt the hon. 
member but the time has expired for this debate. Unless there is 
unanimous consent, we will be into Private Members' Business.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Perhaps, Mr. Speaker, the House would agree to 
allowing the member to conclude his comments. I also think a 
member of the Reform Party attempted to rise. If the House 
would consent to adding 10 minutes or so to do that I would have 
no objection. This would then enable us to finish that clause.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> If members wish to do anything by 
unanimous consent they can do exactly what they want. Is there 
unanimous consent to extend the time?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Mr. Speaker, the Reform Party would be 
happy for the hon. member for the Battlefords-Meadow Lake 
to complete his speech and then we should move on to private 
members' business.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I did not hear the official opposition's 
opinion on this point. Do you agree?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Members are giving the hon. member two or three minutes to 
finish his speech.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the largesse of the 
government and opposition members on this matter. I did not 
request the opportunity to finish my remarks, but I am very 
happy to do so. I regret cutting into the time provided for private 
members' business, because to me it is a very important time in 
Parliament. I will wrap up my remarks very quickly.
<P>
	When private members' time arrived I was quoting from the 
conclusion of the presentation made by the National Farmers' 
Union to the committee. I will start the quote again: ``The cuts 
announced in the federal budget will have an unprecedented 
impact upon Canada's agriculture sector. These cuts, from the 
loss in transportation subsidies to the cuts to food inspection, 
increase producers' costs of production, making us less 
competitive''.
<P>
	Members will recall that one of the red book promises of the 
government was to reduce the input costs of farming. These 
matters have increased the costs of farming. Therefore, the red 
book promise on agriculture has certainly been broken.
<P>
	I will finish the quote from the National Farmers' Union: 
``The Canadian government has cut far beyond the requirements 
of the GATT agreement, leaving farmers alone to fight the 
European Union and the United States treasuries. The 
government should reassess its policy of unilateral 
disarmament, which leaves Canadians vulnerable in the 
international marketplace''.
<P>
	This is a very serious matter. We have long term implications 
to communities on the prairies and to the future of Canadian 
agriculture in the international marketplace. We should be 
setting these provisions aside until we have had a full study of 
everything that has been done. We should not be dealing with it 
in terms of just balancing this year's budget.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It being 5.30 p.m., the House will now 
proceed to the consideration of Private Members' Business as 
listed on today's Order Paper.

	<B>Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Don Valley North, Lib.)</B> moved 
that Bill C-274, an act respecting a national grandparents day, 
be now read the second time and referred to committee.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I recognize there are many grandparents 
in the gallery. I appreciate their presence and I thank them for 
taking the time to join us in the debate.
<P>
	It is an honour for me to stand today in the House to speak on 
Bill C-274, a private member's bill that I introduced on 
September 27, 1994. Bill C-274 is an act respecting a national 
grandparents day in Canada. It would set aside the second 
Sunday in September every year as a national day to honour 
grandparents in Canada from coast to coast.
<P>
	It is a pleasure for me to address a generation of individuals 
who may be older but surely are wiser. They should not be 
forgotten or left behind.
<P>
	As I said earlier in the House, we have the honour of having 20 
grandparents and members of the growth society, an 
organization whose purpose is to safeguard the vital 
grandchildren and grandparents relationship.
<P>
	I have received numerous letters in support of Bill C-274. I 
will read part of one letter I received: ``On behalf of our 
grandparents group and all other grandparent groups in Canada, 
I commend you for introducing Bill C-274, an act respecting a 
national grandparents day. Many of us will be here in the 
members' gallery for a debate on your bill. We sincerely hope 
that you will have the full support of the House and that it will be 
voted on favourably''.
<P>
<B>(1735) </B>
<P>
	Another letter, sent by the vice-president of focus on the 
family association of Canada, states: ``Thank you for your 
request for the designation of grandparents day. Our calendar 
printed by focus on the family U.S. has the second Sunday in 
September marked as grandparents day. We applaud the effort 
you have put in to recognize this day in Canada''.
<P>
	I have received numerous letters of support from my riding 
from seniors groups and organizations in favour of this day to be 
celebrated in Canada. Ironically tomorrow, June 1, 1995, will 
also mark the beginning of senior citizens month in Canada.
<P>
	At this time Bill-C-274, has been deemed not votable by the 
subcommittee on private members' business. I ask for 
unanimous consent so that the order be discharged and the 
subject matter of the bill be referred to the health committee for 
further consideration.
<P>
	I did not have the pleasure or the honour of having 
grandparents. My grandmother passed away when I was very 
young. I missed that link between a grandson and grandmother 
or grandfather. I hope that no one will have to miss that link 
between grandparents and grandchildren anywhere in the 
country.
<P>
	Grandparents day would give national recognition to the 
growing number of grandparents in Canada. I will attempt to 
raise the emotional conflict of interest drama that grandchildren 
face when one parent assumes custody and they no longer have 
the opportunity to see their grandparents. Many provinces and 
municipalities have already recognized that grandparents do 
contribute greatly to the family and they are a basic and 
fundamental element of our society. It is time the federal 
government recognized this fact as well.
<P>
	The focus of Bill C-274 on grandparents day will serve a 
child's best interest and show Canadians that grandparents are a 
significant part of our family structure. Most important, without 
grandparents a child will lose a valuable role model and 
nurturing.
<P>
	In the United States in many homes of the aged grandparents 
day was celebrated as a national holiday as far back as 1961 and 
was officially declared as grandparents day in the U.S. in 1977 
by President Jimmy Carter. It is the second Sunday in September 
every year.
<P>
	Last year in the province of Quebec the Quebec senior citizens 
federation urged Quebec families to mark the occasion of 
grandparents day by getting the different generations together. 
Obviously this is not possible in all cases, especially for those 
grandchildren who do not live nearby. I am sure they could get 
the long distance feeling by calling them on grandparents day.
<P>
	The relationship between grandparents and grandchildren has 
taken on even greater importance as the result of the number of 
broken marriages. As we approach the 21st century we see more 
and more single parent families. Single parent families would be 
helped a great deal if we have grandparents' recognition and 
grandparents' connection tied to the younger generations so we 
can build for a stronger future and face it with more confidence.
<P>
	Grandparents day was officially proclaimed in 1978. Since 
then every year the United States observes the second Sunday in 
September as grandparents day.
<P>
	I call on my colleagues to accept the bill and refer it to the 
House committee on health in order to adopt it as soon as we can 
for the coming September. We have tremendous support. There 
is no harm in doing it. There is no one who opposes it as far as I 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13078"> 13078 </A></B>
<P>
know. Let us go forward and have grandparents day, which will 
give the proper recognition they deserve.
<P>
<B>(1740 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> If I understood the hon. member 
correctly, he has asked for unanimous consent that the order be 
discharged and that the subject matter be referred to the 
Standing Committee on Health. Is there unanimous consent 
among the members present for this to happen?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> There was an indication that one of the 
members does not give unanimous consent to that happening.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I wish to commend the hon. member for Don 
Valley North for his bill. Indeed, who could be against a bill 
aimed at honouring the contribution grandparents make to 
society by designating the second Sunday in September of each 
year as ``National Grandparent's Day''?
<P>
	Such bills always put us in the same dilemma. On the one 
hand, there is the honourable intention of designating a 
grandparent's day but, on the other hand, we wonder if the 
government will go beyound good intentions and pay close 
attention on a daily basis to these seniors who helped build our 
society.
<P>
	The old age pension plan is a case in point. As you may recall, 
there have been previous government attempts to reduce 
seniors' benefits, and a reform of old age pensions is planned for 
this fall. In every golden age club, people like the directors in 
my riding who have already retired or will do so in a few years 
have a lot of questions about their future financial security.
<P>
	While it is nice of the hon. member to ask that the second 
Sunday in September be designated ``Grandparents' Day'', we 
should be checking with his government to see if the member's 
wishes will be acted on and whether these seniors will be 
guaranteed fair and equitable treatment.
<P>
	This bill also gives us an opportunity to look at the way 
seniors are treated sometimes. Take for example the voice box 
issue. Do we really show seniors respect when they need 
information about a pension cheque that is late in coming or a in 
different amount than usual, or any other matter, and we cannot 
provide it to them? Having dealt myself with the voice box at the 
Department of Human Resources Development, I can tell you 
that there is cause for frustration, and serious frustration.
<P>
	I think that we would show much greater respect for seniors 
and grandparents by remedying this kind of situation effectively 
than by simply dedicating one day out of the year to them. We 
would be showing that we care year-round.
<P>
	The other example I would like to give you is that of repeated 
computer errors in recent months. I have received dozens of 
calls at my office about computer errors, and the problem was 
from coast to coast. Pensioners were no longer receiving the 
income supplement they were entitled to. They were not always 
provided with adequate information in this matter. Again, this is 
a case where the really respectful thing to do would have been to 
treat them fairly and with compassion.
<P>
	At any rate, this bill on grandparents' day is very 
commendable. We can all dig out an anecdote from our pasts. 
My paternal grandfather has always been a model of honesty to 
me. He was a man who wanted the matters he discussed with 
others to be clear and to get settled. That is something that he 
taught me and that is now part of my background. Each and 
every one of us in this House could tell a similar story.
<P>
<B>(1745) </B>
<P>
	The same is true of my maternal grandmother. I could tell you 
about her strength of purpose and about how she inspired me 
through my studies. We have to realize that we are definitely 
influenced by such role models, and grandparents do make an 
important contribution to their grandchildren's education. As 
we get older, we realize the full significance of that 
contribution, particularly when we know what grandparents 
have gone through and what a source of wisdom they can be.
<P>
	Who knows? Having a grandparents' day might trigger a 
debate on how to better benefit from their experience. I 
remember my grandfather telling me about voting on 
conscription during the Second World War, and about the 
political context of the fifties. The past is a treasure trove of 
information to help us make decisions, now and in the future.
<P>
	We often notice that young people lack a sound knowledge of 
our history. One way to remedy that might be to rely more on the 
experience of grandparents, who can bring us a lot, in a concrete 
way, in our daily lives, rather than in terms of our formal history. 
When we think about the grandparents' contribution, it should 
not only be in terms of their role with grandchildren, but also 
with the parents who are sandwiched between the two 
generations.
<P>
	In the daily grind of raising children, it is sometimes useful to 
take time out to turn to grandparents, who have often raised 
much larger families than those of today and have been through 
all sorts of situations that have equipped them to give us useful 
advice.
<P>
	It seems to me that this bill is a good idea. It is recognition 
that is only reasonable and which our grandparents deserve. But 
this recognition should be given in the same spirit year round, it 
should be reflected in government services for seniors, in our 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13079"> 13079 </A></B>
<P>
concern for their basic financial security, so that we are sure that 
the way they are treated on Grandparents' Day is the way they 
are treated every day.
<P>
	I will conclude by saying that in addition to the idyllic images 
of grandparents that we often see on television, the traditional 
families, but there are also much more difficult situations. 
Grandparents are often excluded from family life and live alone 
in cramped quarters, and I think the setting aside of a national 
grandparents' day, as with everything to do with the family, 
would be an opportunity to recognize that there is no one model 
of a family, any more than there is no one type of grandparent. 
These seniors have contributed in a variety of ways to the 
growth of our society.
<P>
	I hope that by recognizing grandparents' day we will make it 
possible for values to be transmitted from one generation to 
another, that we will realize what the past has given us and what 
we must still seek in order to attain our vision of the future, and 
it is for these reasons that the members of the Bloc Quebecois 
support this bill.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Julian Reed (Halton-Peel, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is my 
pleasure to second the bill on grandparents day, declaring the 
second Sunday in September every year national grandparents 
day.
<P>
<B>(1750 ) </B>
<P>
	Earlier this month I introduced a bill which would declare 
1995 the year of the grandparent. I believe this is the third time 
this year grandparents have been recognized by various parties 
in the House. During the last debate, on May 2 of this year, there 
was a unanimous endorsement of that private member's bill.
<P>
	It was rather disappointing that the committee assessing the 
bill considered it non-votable. Whether the arguments I put to 
the committee were not convincing enough, I am not sure. 
Perhaps I should bear some responsibility for that. 
Nevertheless, the feelings in the House crossed all party lines, a 
rare occurrence. I wonder whether in this, the third instance of 
recognition of grandparents this year, the hackneyed phrase 
family values has again risen to the fore in our society.
<P>
	In the debate on May 2 there some statements registered very 
strongly with me. One was that grandparents are a pillar of our 
existence. I had the privilege of having one grandparent whose 
strength and values were imparted to me as strongly as those of 
my parents. He was a pillar of my existence.
<P>
	I have underlined showing the way by example. Grandparents 
do their very best in leading by way of example. They impart 
those examples to their grandchildren. The word wisdom caught 
my attention. Grandparents are most often much wiser than 
parents because of the accumulation of experience and the way 
they can interpret life for their grandchildren.
<P>
	Another word which came up was tolerance. As we grow older 
we tend to be either more tolerant or less tolerant. I have found 
the grandparents of our children and my own grandfather had 
tolerance. They set the standard for tolerance.
<P>
	They provide strength and enrich the family. When things go 
wrong, as they often do in family life, grandparents are often a 
source of strength and security. Children need to feel secure on a 
continuing basis. It cannot be a start and stop affair or catch as 
catch can. Very often grandparents can fill the role of providing 
security. That leads me to one of the great concerns all of us in 
the House share. With the divorce rate and the break-up of 
families very often grandparents at the present time find 
themselves without access to their grandchildren.
<P>
<B>(1755) </B>
<P>
	I will be doing everything I can to make sure that state is 
changed so grandparents in future will be able to have proper 
access to grandchildren especially at the time in their lives when 
they need them so badly.
<P>
	Other words I found are grace and dignity. I have talked about 
family strength. The grandfather I had a great experience with 
lived by a very strict code. He imposed a code of conduct on 
himself, for which he was admired by so many in the small 
community where we lived.
<P>
	He did not always preach about it. He did not always try to 
impose it, although sometimes he looked with wonderment at 
the way the world seemed to change. We all agree the more 
things change, the more they remain the same.
<P>
	As I get older I find myself more appreciative of that code my 
grandfather imparted to me. I hope some of that has by example 
been shared with our children who did not know that 
great-grandfather.
<P>
	They also knew grandparents; they grew up with more 
grandparents than I had. Those grandparents were wonderful 
people in the way they helped our family, the graciousness with 
which they accepted responsibility we often imposed on them 
when they took care of our children, when we needed them.
<P>
	Grandparents have a much stronger role to play in family life 
than society has acknowledged to this point. The year 1995, with 
the recognition and debate we have put forward in the House, 
should set the stage for the years to come as recognizing the 
importance of the family and the role grandparents have in it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak on Bill C-274, proposing to 
make the second Sunday of September every year national 
grandparents day.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13080"> 13080 </A></B>
<P>
	When I arrived at the House I had some good feelings about 
this bill and I was in a good mood. Then I watched as the member 
for Don Valley North sought unanimous approval to have his bill 
made votable. I understand the member for Don Valley North 
first sought in committee to have his bill made votable and was 
denied. I just wonder what kind of heartless minds exist in the 
Liberal Party opposite. The member for Don Valley North 
simply sought to have his bill recognized by a vote in the House, 
hoping for a majority vote for a bill which would stir the 
emotions of Canadians and was denied.
<P>
<B>(1800) </B>
<P>
	I proudly support this bill. It was put forward by a member of 
the Liberal Party and I am very pleased to support because it 
does not cost the Canadian taxpayer one red cent. It is very 
unusual for a bill to come forward from the Liberal Party that is 
not going to cost the taxpayer some money. I congratulate the 
member for Don Valley North for putting it forward because it is 
something we have not been used to in the House.
<P>
	In the past a number of bills have been forced through the 
House by the Liberal Party. Bills C-33 and C-34 will cost the 
taxpayers millions upon millions of dollars. They were rammed 
through the House using closure. The government tried to put 
Bill C-22 through the House. It would take away the freedom of 
private citizens to challenge the government in a court case.
<P>
	We saw the Liberal government try to put through a budget in 
the House last February that is going to increase our national 
debt by $100 billion over a three-year term and add about $10 
billion or $12 billion to our annual interest payments. The 
government is trying to put through Bill C-68 which will cost 
the Canadian taxpayers perhaps $500 million.
<P>
	It is a great day in the House of Commons, a great day for the 
Liberal Party and a great day for Canada to have a member of the 
Liberal Party try to put through a bill in the House that is not 
going to cost the taxpayers one red cent. I congratulate the 
member for Don Valley North for this bill.
<P>
	That is a celebration in itself, but I have another reason for 
speaking to this bill. As a member of Parliament I get a special 
perk today. I can stand up in the House of Commons of Canada 
and on national television I can announce that yesterday I was 
informed that I am going to be a grandfather before this year is 
over. Therefore this is absolutely appropriate. This proves 
beyond a shadow of a doubt that you do not have to be old to be a 
grandfather.
<P>
	I am proud of my daughter, Lisa, in Vancouver. She will be a 
mother some time later this year and she will make me a 
grandfather. I am going to be able to realize some of the personal 
satisfaction that you get from being a grandfather, particularly 
when I get to babysit and the kids get cranky, I will know the 
parents are coming home sooner or later that night.
<P>
	In a more serious vein, it is very important to recognize a day 
like grandparents day because it not only recognizes the 
important role that grandparents play in the lives of families, but 
it also recognizes the tremendous contribution that our 
ancestors have played in the building of the country.
<P>
	I am a firm believer that it is the family unit; the mother, the 
father, the children, the grandparents, the aunts and the uncles 
who built this country as strong as it is now. I also believe above 
all else that this Parliament has a responsibility to ensure that 
the family unit is not broken down any more than it is already. 
Parliament has a responsibility to try and rebuild the family unit 
as it was prior to the 1960s.
<P>
<B>(1805 ) </B>
<P>
	The taxation levels since the mid-sixties have risen to a point 
where it is almost a demand that the mother of a family go out to 
work in order for the household to have enough disposable 
income to support the family. That is a tragedy and is one of the 
things that has broken down the family unit.
<P>
	Grandparents can and do play an important role when the two 
spouses in a household are working. It is an absolutely critical 
time in the lives of children who become, through no wish of 
their own, latchkey kids. The parents of these kids, because of 
their jobs, are too busy to spend time with them. This makes the 
grandparents' role even more important.
<P>
	I want Parliament to recognize that grandparents are part of 
the formula for making a family unit strong. For that reason 
alone, just that one reason, we should support this bill.
<P>
	Another thing about grandparents that I find very important is 
they tend to pass down family values and history from one 
generation to another. Grandparents who spend a lot of time with 
their grandchildren generally have more time to talk to the kids 
about how their parents are working so hard to try to provide a 
home for them, to try to provide an education for them, 
something the parents often do not have time to do. This is a very 
important role for grandparents and they should be recognized 
for that as well.
<P>
	A huge number of grandparents have also played an important 
part in the protection of democracy. They fought in the wars. 
They fought against fascism and communism in order to 
preserve the democracy we hold in such high value. They should 
be recognized for this as well.
<P>
	I can speak from experience because I was a child in a one 
parent home. My mother worked every day while we were being 
brought up. Many times the only people I had to turn to for help 
with problems were my grandparents. I am eternally grateful for 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13081"> 13081 </A></B>
<P>
the role they played in my life and the values they tried to instil 
in me that became beneficial when I grew up and started a 
career.
<P>
	Grandparents day would provide an excellent opportunity for 
all Canadians to recognize the very important role grandparents 
play in a family.
<P>
	I move that the House respond in a fashion that would come 
from the heart and not from instructions received from a 
committee and that unanimous consent could be given today that 
Bill C-274 become a votable motion.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Hon. members, is there unanimous 
consent for transforming the motion on Bill C-274 to make it a 
votable motion?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members: </B>No.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Resuming debate. The Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Prime Minister.
<P>
<B>(1810 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Jean Augustine (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime 
Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to address 
the House on the private member's motion to establish a special 
day in recognition of grandparents for their enormous 
contribution to families and society. Liberals recognize this.
<P>
	There is a process whereby private members' business gets to 
the House. The procedure was followed by an all party 
committee with the member across the way being a member of 
that committee. Tonight I will address the private member's 
motion on the recognition of grandparents.
<P>
	Creating a special day for grandparents will afford Canadians 
the opportunity to further demonstrate their continuing 
commitment to the family. As Liberals we believe this. It is not 
dollars and cents. It is a philosophy Liberals believe in and share 
with members across the way.
<P>
	I fondly remember my own grandmother. She was a wise 
woman, though uneducated in a schooling sense. She affirmed 
me with words like: ``Child, you can do it''. It is women like my 
grandmother that most of us in this room do remember. Maybe 
most of us are here as a result of the affirmation we received 
from our grandparents.
<P>
	In December 1991, Canada ratified the convention on the 
rights of the child, a landmark in Canadian social history. 
Countries agreed that children should grow up in an atmosphere 
of happiness, love and understanding with the protection and 
assistance required for the full development of their 
personalities to better prepare them to become responsible 
adults. One of the central truths of the convention is based on the 
conviction that the family is a fundamental group of society and 
the natural environment for the growth and well-being of all of 
its members, particularly children.
<P>
	The role of a grandparent is vital to the child. Grandparents 
can be companions, becoming friends more than parents. The 
relationship can be a major source of satisfaction to both the 
grandparent and the grandchild. Other members have referred to 
the fact that in today's society with marriage breakdown and 
single parenting, some grandparents take on the role of 
surrogate parents.
<P>
	According to a study conducted by the British Columbia 
council for the family, grandparenting provides the older adult 
with a feeling of self-worth, a source of love, respect and 
support. Being a grandparent is a potential source of giving and 
receiving affection.
<P>
	Grandparenting is also a means of establishing a link between 
past and future generations. Continuity, together with 
unconditional love, forms the cornerstone in the development of 
a child's self esteem and sense of trust. Among the riches that 
are passed down are language, culture and the wisdom that 
comes from experience.
<P>
	A recent television show characterized the role of 
grandparents as one of providing both the roots and the wings of 
a whole generation of people. This is an apt definition of 
grandparenting.
<P>
	Seniors, the majority of whom are grandparents, are a vital 
part not only of their own families, but also of all aspects of 
community life. They are active members of their communities. 
Some continue to do paid work, as does the member across the 
way. Some are members of churches, seniors organizations and 
clubs. Fitness and sports groups and cultural organizations such 
as art galleries, drama and musical groups all have the talent of 
our seniors. Seniors are involved in social action. They are 
teachers. They are board members. They are volunteers and they 
are politicians.
<P>
<B>(1815) </B>
<P>
	As we consider a grandparents day we should also 
contemplate our collective Canadian family in which seniors 
play a critical role. The uniqueness that grandparents bring to 
the family is in my opinion and that of many others worthy of 
being celebrated with a national grandparents day in Canada.
<P>
	Grandparents and seniors in general deserve a day to 
commemorate their extensive and important contributions. This 
is why I support the private member's motion that is before us.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
welcome this opportunity to take part in the debate on Bill 
C-274, an Act respecting a national grandparent's day, 
introduced on September 27 by the hon. member for Don Valley 
North.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13082"> 13082 </A></B>
<P>
	I want to commend the hon. member on his praiseworthy 
suggestion that throughout Canada, and each year, the second 
Sunday in September shall be known as grandparent's day. He 
can count on my full support and that of the Bloc Quebecois. I 
have a special interest in this proposal, being myself a 
grandfather and representing the riding of Bourassa in Montreal 
North, where 15 per cent of the population is in the 65 and over 
age group.
<P>
	In 1994, the AQDR of Montreal North was founded as a 
branch of the Association québécoise pour la défense des droits 
des personnes retraitées et pré-retraitées, whose basic objective 
is to improve the living conditions of this group: income, taxes, 
health, accommodations, transportation, social policies and so 
forth. The organization already has more than 300 members.
<P>
	I would like to express in the House my profound gratitude 
and best wishes to the members of the executive elected at the 
annual meeting held on May 29, the day before yesterday: 
Jean-Claude Potvin, president; Roger Lagacé, vice-president; 
Pierrette Vallières, secretary; Martine Leduc, treasurer; and 
advisers Umberto di Genova, Audette Thibault, Régine Daigle, 
Guy Baril, Claude Ouimet, Pierre Grondin and Joseph Zara. 
Like many other seniors, these people do a lot of volunteer work 
and are known for their dedication and generosity.
<P>
	Bill C-274 is justified in every respect. This day should have 
been established long ago. Fortunately, a number of provinces 
and municipalities as well as many organizations and seniors' 
homes already unofficially celebrate a day known as 
grandparent's day. I think the time has come to officially 
recognize the second Sunday in September of each year as the 
day on which we pay tribute to our seniors and especially to 
grandparents.
<P>
	In 1978, U.S. President Jimmy Carter decided that the first 
Sunday after Labour Day would be set aside to pay tribute to 
grandparents. A dynamic and remarkable grandmother from 
West Virginia, Marion McQuade, had fought for years to have a 
special day set aside for senior citizens in the United States. I 
hope that Canada will be inspired by this example and act 
accordingly.
<P>
	The government, in particular the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage, must take the lead on this issue. Grandparents are 
extremely important for their grandchildren, especially until 
they reach adolescence.
<P>
	Seniors are becoming a proportionately larger sector of our 
population. We estimate that their numbers will increase by 40 
per cent in the next 15 years. Therefore, the government must 
take real steps to recognize the important contribution they 
make to society. Unfortunately, despite its many promises, the 
Liberal government has done nothing to improve the situation of 
seniors.
<P>
<B>(1820) </B>
<P>
	On the contrary, they cut their tax credits, and, knowing this 
government's philosophy and vision, it is quite likely that they 
will take even more away from them, in particular in the area of 
old age security benefits.
<P>
	Furthermore, I would ask the government to stop reducing 
grants for organizations which finance seniors, in particular 
programs like New Horizons.
<P>
	I have had the great joy of being a grandfather for two years 
now. In fact, the wife of my oldest son gave birth to little Olivia 
in 1993 when the election campaign was in full swing. My whole 
family, including the child, was a great help to me during that 
period. I regret that my work as a parliamentarian does not leave 
me much time to play with and take care of my granddaughter 
Olivia.
<P>
	According to recent statistics, 90 per cent of all children have 
at least one living grandparent. Unfortunately for me, my 
grandparents all passed away before I was born. I even lost my 
mother and father when I was 11 and 13 years old respectively. 
Admittedly, one half a century ago in Chili, a developing 
country, life expectancy was not very high.
<P>
	The fact that I never knew my grandparents did not prevent 
me from understanding and valuing their importance for 
families and society, be it for children, adolescents or adults. 
They convey stability, link the generations and transmit certain 
fundamental values which must be preserved. And today, with 
so many break-ups in couples, their role has become even more 
important. In certain instances, they are the ones who raise their 
grandchildren and care for them.
<P>
	Three Canadians out of four 65 years of age or older are 
grandparents. Naturally, you do not have to be 65 to be a 
grandparent. Some grandparents today are even in their forties 
or fifties.
<P>
	I am proud to point out that Quebec has officially recognized 
the role of grandparents in article 611 of the Civil Code, which 
reads as follows: ``In no case may the father or mother, without a 
grave reason, interfere with personal relations between the child 
and his grandparents''.
<P>
	This provision, therefore, accords grandparents the right to 
visit and take their grandchildren out. Unless there is an 
agreement between the parties, the terms of these relations are 
decided by the court. In all cases, the judge will consider the 
welfare of the children first and will consult them as need be.
<P>
	Grandparents are very concerned about the happiness and 
well-being of the children and do everything within their power 
to improve their world.
<P>
	For all these reasons, I enthusiastically support Bill C-274.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
realize that private members' hour is coming to an end, but I 
want to take the opportunity to thank the member for Don Valley 
North for raising his private member's initiative.
<P>
	Private members' bills very rarely get selected to be votable 
in the House and very rarely get passed. That does not mean they 
are not important. They are extremely important. I assure all 
members of the House and all the people of Don Valley North 
that their member has worked extremely hard lobbying all 
members of the House to support this important initiative.
<P>
	I do not know anybody who does not like grandparents. 
Everyone has stories. One of my grandfathers was a butcher and 
the other was a carpenter. From one I learned how to do 
carpentry work in my home along with other related home 
improvements and from the other I learned about foods and 
about eating. He had a grocery store as well. It was wonderful to 
go there to see him work. He loved his grandchildren so much. 
They are both gone now.
<P>
<B>(1825) </B>
<P>
	The grandmothers, the matriarchs of all families, took care of 
us and loved us as if they were our mothers. They took very good 
care of us when we were young and learning. They were always 
there when our parents had problems. They were always there to 
provide the support and the love we all need. Obviously 
grandparents play a very special role in our lives.
<P>
	I want the hon. member for Don Valley North to have a couple 
of minutes for his final rebuttal, but I simply reiterate that he has 
worked hard to bring recognition to an important aspect of our 
lives, our grandparents. I congratulate him and all members of 
the House who have taken the time to thank the member for 
raising it and to make special mention of their grandparents.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The mover of the motion will speak 
last and will have the right to close the debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Don Valley North, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I thank all members who spoke in favour of the motion. 
I notice that nobody spoke against it.
<P>
	However I would like to set the record straight. The hon. 
member for the Reform Party said that Liberal members did not 
support the motion. The subcommittee on Private Members' 
Business did not recognize the motion as being votable. Once 
the subcommittee says no it is highly unlikely members of the 
House will say yes because we respect the independence of the 
subcommittee. On that subcommittee there are members of the 
Reform Party, of the Bloc Quebecois and of the Liberal Party.
<P>
	Once again I thank all members who supported the motion. As 
the expression goes, he who runs away may live to fight another 
day. We will come back to the issue at some other time. We will 
ensure we pass the motion with the support of all parties before 
this Parliament is dissolved in 1997 or 1998. We will ensure that 
the grandparents of the country have a day to celebrate.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The time provided for the 
consideration of Private Members' Business has now expired.

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">ADJOURNMENT PROCEEDINGS</H2>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 
deemed to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="HEALTH">HEALTH</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Kingsway, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in the middle of March I asked a question of the 
Minister of Health concerning the betrayal of budgetary 
promises for federal funding for the community action program 
for children, or CAPC, a program for vulnerable and at risk 
children. At the time I urged the minister to reconsider the 
drastic cuts in funding for the program and pointed out to her 
that in effect she and her government were cutting the deficit on 
the backs of the poorest and most vulnerable children.
<P>
	In response the Minister of Health stated that the budget did 
not dramatically cut CAPC. She said that it reduced the actual 
growth of the program.
<P>
	I have a memo written by the regional director for health 
promotion and social development in the British Columbia 
region who confirmed that in fiscal year 1996-97 there will be 
an approximate 30 per cent reduction to the original allocation 
and the following fiscal year, 1997-98, will see an approximate 
50 per cent reduction to the original allocation. If that is not a 
dramatic cut in funding for programs for poor, at risk, and 
vulnerable children, I do not know what is. It is a shameful 
betrayal of the promises that were made. Certainly groups such 
as the B.C. coalition for children and individuals who are 
working with poor children share that sense of concern. Minister 
Joy MacPhail with the B.C. government has spoken out strongly 
against these cuts.
<P>
<B>(1830) </B>
<P>
	It is very clear that these cuts are part of a broader agenda of 
the government. We see it in Bill C-76, enormously destructive 
legislation, which this government is now ramming through the 
House without even allowing the public to have hearings across 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13084"> 13084 </A></B>
<P>
the country, without even allowing the possibility of a 
committee of eminent persons to review the destructive impact 
of this bill.
<P>
	We know that the bill will gut the Canada assistance plan of its 
national standards. This will open the door to  workfare and 
cheap labour standards. We know as well that it will 
dramatically cut funding for post-secondary education.
<P>
	It is in the area of health care and medicare that I want to raise 
a couple of very grave concerns as well. The implications of this 
government's policies in the area of health care are very serious, 
the implications of Bill C-76. There is no doubt that we are 
going to see the possibility of a massive erosion in the quality of 
health care. We will see two tier health care. It is a direct 
consequence of the North American free trade agreement. We 
know that once the provincial governments move to de-insure 
any medical services it is open season for private insurance 
companies. Under NAFTA this is considered to be a market 
commodity. That is why the private insurance companies are 
just waiting to get in and make money.
<P>
	This legislation is enormously destructive for the social 
fabric of the country. It was the member for 
Notre-Dame-de-Grâce who said that these cuts will cause 
considerable harm and pain to a segment of the population that 
has already been hit very hard. He said: ``The cuts are not only 
wrong in principle, but contrary to what we said in the red book, 
contrary to what we did during nine years in opposition, and 
completely junking all of the principles we stood for''.
<P>
	I call on the government to reinstate the funding for the 
community action program for children. I call on the 
government to reverse Bill C-76, to recognize that the United 
Nations committee on economic, social and cultural Rights has 
been very critical of this legislation and recognized that we are 
in breach of our international obligations under the international 
covenant on economic, social and cultural rights.
<P>
	There are alternatives. The Prime Minister has suggested that 
medicare was only intended to be temporary in terms of federal 
involvement. He said it was only intended for catastrophic 
illness. Well it is time for this government to look at 
alternatives. It is time they rescind Bill C-91, which was a gift 
to multinational drug companies. It is time they implement the 
1995 alternative federal budget, which was a very different 
approach. It is time in the area of health care that we place far 
more resources into preventative health care, as was 
recommended by the Canada health coalition, the Hospital 
Employees Union in British Columbia, the National Federation 
of Nurses Unions, the Council of Canadians, the Canadian 
Labour Congress, and many others.
<P>
	It is time that this government came to its senses and 
recognized that the impact of Bill C-76 and of its budget and 
budgetary policies is to shred the social safety net, is to mean 
that poor kids are going to get even poorer, that the gap between 
rich and poor will be greater, and that our health care system, the 
Canada assistance plan, and post-secondary education will all 
come under attack.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Jean Augustine (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime 
Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to respond to the 
member for Burnaby-Kingsway's question of March 15, and 
not really the last gospel that we just heard recited.
<P>
	Children continue to be a priority for the Government of 
Canada, especially those who currently live in conditions of risk 
and poverty. As the House is aware, given the fiscal realities that 
all Canadians face, the federal government has had to make 
some very difficult choices.
<P>
	The budget for the community action program for children, 
CAPC, has not been reduced dramatically and is still quite 
substantial. In the next two years over $92 million will be 
available through the community action program for children.
<P>
	Let me assure the hon. member that the reduction to the 
community action program for children was applied in an 
equitable manner. All jurisdictions, including British Columbia, 
will continue to receive the percentage of total CAPC funds 
originally agreed to in the respective protocols signed with all 
provinces and territories.
<P>
<B>(1835) </B>
<P>
	The community action program for children remains a model 
of how different levels of government can work together with 
community groups to address the health and social needs of at 
risk children.
<P>
	In addition to the children's action program, the government 
is making significant investments in new programs. For 
instance, the aboriginal head start and the Canada prenatal 
nutrition programs also address the social and health needs of 
children at risk and their families.
<P>
	As stated in the red book, we must give our children the best 
possible start in life. Investing resources in our children is 
investing in the future of our country.
<P>

<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="AGUSTA">AGUSTA</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we have another instance of lobbying, patronage, and maybe 
corruption with the Agusta affair involving an Italian firm, 
Agusta S.p.A., a manufacturer for the EH-101 helicopter 
contract which was cancelled and for which there was to be no 
compensation.
<P>
	The present Prime Minister said that there would be no 
compensation. And I quote:
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="13085"> 13085 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
``The program is cancelled and there isn't any compensation for 
anybody''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	And yet, there has already been some compensation. The firm 
Unysis has received $166 million in compensation. There are 
ongoing negotiations with Agusta, and with Westland, regarding 
compensation, despite the fact that the Prime Minister said that 
there would be no compensation, despite the fact that some 
ministers have already spoken against it and would have liked an 
inquiry into this affair.
<P>
	This is serious. As we know, Agusta was found guilty of 
corruption in Belgium, and gave bribes in Italy. This firm has a 
very bad reputation. Yet, the government is now reaching 
agreements with lobbyists, some of whom, like James Deacey 
and Daniel Despins, are well known Liberals with very close 
connections to the party, are currently negotiating compensation 
for a firm. At the same time this government is cutting social 
programs. It has reduced the social housing program by some 
$300 million in Canada. Of course, the poorest people arre 
getting hit, but the government is about to give millions and 
even hundreds of millions of dollars to a firm which does not 
deserve it at all.
<P>
	This is another example of the power lobbyists exert on the 
federal government, as was seen in the case of Power DirecTv, 
which was perhaps an even more serious example of nepotism. 
As we know, the son-in-law of the Prime Minister had 
succeeded in having a CRTC decision overturned, in favour of 
his own company. This is yet another example of the power of 
lobbyists and of the patronage which prevail with this 
government.
<P>
	The issue concerning Agusta is whether or not to provide 
compensation. We asked the minister responsible and he seemed 
to indicate that he was negotiating to that effect. But do we 
compensate or not? I know that the government's answer will be 
very vague. We will not know for sure. The government will tell 
us: ``Well, we are negotiating, we are discussing, but this is not 
really about compensation''.
<P>
	We are suspicious because, in fact, the government will once 
again try to find a few hundred millions and give that money to a 
company which does not deserve it, all this at a time when it 
makes cuts in social programs and social housing in this 
country.
<P>
	Can we say that the Prime Minister of Canada is keeping to his 
word, since he said this regarding the EH-101 helicopter 
program:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
``The program is cancelled and there isn't any compensation for 
anybody''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Those are the Prime Minister's own words. Is this Prime 
Minister keeping his word or not? We want to know if there is 
any compensation. If there is, and if there are negotiations, 
perhaps we should even have an inquiry into this case, because 
Agusta, as I said earlier, has a very bad reputation, and has 
already been convicted of corruption in Italy and in Belgium.
<P>
	So, I ask the question, and I hope to get a clear answer from 
the government.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have never 
been nebulous in my life.
<P>
	Which word did my hon. friend not understand? I will do this 
very slowly to make sure the member gets it. The Government of 
Canada did not breach the contract with EH industries. The 
government terminated the contract in accordance with the 
termination clause and in accordance with our promise in the red 
book which we kept on November 5, 1993 as soon as the Prime 
Minister took office.
<P>
	The Prime Minister did say absolutely that there is no 
compensation for anybody. Furthermore, he said that ministers 
involved would make sure we do not pay a cent more than that 
we are obligated to pay. His statements are entirely correct. The 
Government of Canada is not negotiating a compensation 
settlement with EH industries.
<P>
	I ask my hon. friend to read the contract. The contract was 
arranged and signed by a previous government which had as a 
member the hon. gentleman who sits in the front row and leads 
my hon. friend's party. However, a mere bagatelle.
<P>
	Contractors are being reimbursed only for costs legitimately 
incurred up to the point of termination plus those costs arising 
directly out of termination. No compensation is being paid; no 
penalties and no lost profit for the cancellation of the contract. 
Which word does the member not understand?
<P>
	If people should choose to hire lobbyists when the 
government goes forward in the purchase of other military 
equipment, that is their prerogative. I make it very clear that no 
firm requires the services of a lobbyist to do business with the 
Government of Canada.
<P>
	We might ask, however, who is lobbying the hon. member 
across the way on this issue? As for the suggestion there are 
backroom negotiations between members of the government 
and lobbyists in this matter, it is simply untrue.
<P>
	I am confident the errors being presented as fact by the Bloc 
are the results of poor research and misunderstanding rather
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="13086"> 13086 </A></B>
<P>
than a desire to mislead. Thankfully I have had the opportunity 
to explain the real facts.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Pursuant to Standing Order 38(5), the 
motion to adjourn the House is now deemed adopted. 
Accordingly, the House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 
a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 6.42 p.m.)
