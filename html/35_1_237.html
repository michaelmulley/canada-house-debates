	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (St. Boniface, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
Winnipeg last week I had the privilege of taking part in the CRTC's 
regional consultations on violence in television, violence which, I 
believe, has a negative impact on our children.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Parents need better information and better tools to ensure they 
can make wise decisions with respect to the kinds of programs they 
want their children to watch.
<P>
	The industry must continue to self regulate. A standardized 
classification system is needed. New technology, for example the 
V-chip, could also be extremely helpful to parents. Media literacy 
for parents and children is required.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I would urge hon. members to work together to ensure that 
television becomes a positive tool for us and especially for our 
children.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="ROYROMANOW">ROY ROMANOW</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, Roy 
Romanow, who also took part in the strong-arm tactics against 
Quebec when the Constitution was patriated unilaterally in 1982, 
has stated that francophones in Saskatchewan may lose the 
governance of their schools if the Yes side wins in the referendum 
in Quebec.
<P>
	Condescending and irresponsible, that kind of statement is 
typical of a man who would stop at nothing to impose his views.
<P>
	In the past, Mr. Romanow has shown that to be the case. He has 
no respect for francophones or Quebec. The question now is, 
whether his attitude reflects the views of Canada today.
<P>
	If it does, if the survival of francophones outside Quebec 
depends solely on the presence of Quebec within Canada, the 
Canadian ideal of equality in diversity has ceased to exist. If that is 
the case, respect for our most fundamental rights no longer exists. 
Too bad for Canadians who still had a dream.

	<B>Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
congratulate a Canadian company on a noteworthy 
accomplishment.
<P>
	Syncrude Canada, a mining company and major contributor to 
the economy in Canada, has just opened a nature trail north of Fort 
McMurray that reflects the mining industry's commitment to 
Canada and our environment. In the spirit of co-operation and 
responsibility, the Wood Bison Trail was opened by the premier of 
Alberta at a ceremony attended by 4,300 spectators.
<P>
	Most notable is the trail's entrance which is marked by a native 
carving of bison that stretches 30 feet in the air. It is called the 
Bison Gateway and was sculptured by the native artist Brian Clark. 
This monument marks Syncrude's $2 million reclamation project 
on a mined out area around Wood Bison Trail. As further evidence 
to this commitment a herd of wood bison has been reintroduced to 
the area after being extinct for hundreds of years.
<P>
	I congratulate everyone involved in this project. It is an example 
of what can be accomplished when government, industry, 
environment and native groups work together to harvest our 
resource wealth and leave the area productive for future 
generations.

<P>
delegation making representations  with regard to the relocation of 
its community from Davis Inlet to Little Sango Pond.
<P>
	The delegation informed me that on February 25, 1994 the Innu 
people received a statement of political commitment from the 
ministers of Indian affairs, health, justice, as well as the Solicitor 
General of Canada. Through these ministers the Government of 
Canada agreed to support the relocation subject to a number of 
conditions. The delegation has informed me that these conditions 
have now been met and the community is anxious for a favourable 
federal cabinet decision that will begin the process of its relocation.
<P>
	Today I want to put on the public record that I am completely 
supportive of the Innu relocation to Little Sango Pond. They have 
satisfied the terms and conditions required and it would seem that 
the federal government has a clear obligation to respect its 
commitments as set down in February 1994.

no spoken or written word can. Such is the case of the completion 
of a 20-day marathon swim by Fin Donnelly of Coquitlam who on 
September 24 completed a mammoth swim down the Fraser River. 
He completed the arduous 1,325 kilometre journey in 20 days.
<P>
	Fin Donnelly's ``Swim For Life'' was a personal campaign to 
raise awareness about environmental abuse of the Fraser River and 
the need to protect this unique waterway. In his 20-day journey Fin 
kept up a gruelling pace in spite of personal and natural obstacles.

<P>
	Language is one of the most important aspects of a culture. The

prepare the budget for year one of an independent Quebec, having 
realized that, despite repeated calls for it by the general public and 
the business community, the Quebec separatists were still refusing 
to put any figure to their plans for separation.
<P>
	The first year budget as presented yesterday represents a 
scientific update of what the leader of the Parti Quebecois had 
presented in 1973.
<P>
	From it we learn that an independent Quebec will inherit a 
deficit of $15.6 billion, minimum. Quebec workers will therefore 
find themselves having to pay at least $3,000 in additional taxes 
annually.
<P>
	Quebec's separatists refuse to talk about the costs of separation. 
We shall do it for them, since the public has a right to know. On

indicate in advance what the offer of partnership to be made to 
Canada the day after a yes vote would be.
<P>
	The supporters of separation refuse to make that offer of

Liberals. If it looks like opposition, talks like opposition and smells 
like opposition, then it must be opposition.
<P>
	The Liberals have pretty well abdicated leadership and have 
vacated the role of promoting real solutions to Canada's problems. 
The Reformers on the other hand are acting like government by 
proposing real, workable, common sense solutions.
<P>
	It was the Reform Party which proposed a clear response to the 
Quebec referendum. The Liberals caught up about a week later. We 
have urged since the beginning that it is most important to set real 
targets on balancing the budget. We hope they will catch up soon.
<P>
	The Liberals spend more time criticizing Reformers than they 
spend promoting their own proposed legislation because they do 
not seem to have any. The most significant evidence is that they are

	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, now we know that to get applause from all sides of this 
House, you have to play hockey.
<P>
	In its secret document prepared for Operation Unity, the federal 
Department of Industry made a list of Quebec companies, 
indicating subsidies they had received or will receive from Ottawa. 
And all for the sole purpose of urging business leaders to support 
the No side. By strange coincidence, yesterday senior executives of 
one of the companies targeted by Industry Canada, Spar Aerospace, 
urged employees at the plant in Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue to vote 
No.
<P>
	My question is directed to the Prime Minister. How can he go on 
claiming that Industry Canada's secret document is a routine 
economic report, when it actually lists the political views of top 
business leaders?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Canadian government has a responsibility to ensure 
that jobs are created in Canada and that jobs are kept. That is our 
responsibility. And as politicians it is very important for us to know 
what we are doing for businesses in Quebec, because the important 
thing is to keep those salaries and jobs in Quebec.
<P>
	I was once Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce, and that 
was quite a few years ago. When Canadair was closing its doors, 
which would have had a disastrous impact on Spar Industries, we 
managed to save Canadair. When General Dynamics was leaving 
Canada, as Minister of Industry I took action, and today, Canadair 
is the best company in Quebec. And Canadair buys services from 
Spar. We want those jobs to be kept. This is very important.
<P>
	In fact, the workers themselves admitted as much, because when 
I left politics, members of the Canadair employees' union asked me 
to work for them, and they told me: ``You are aware of our needs. 
When we needed you, you were there. We want you to keep 
working for us''. I am concerned about workers' wages, about high 
tech jobs for Quebec and ensuring that the markets will still be 
there, not only in Canada but throughout the world, for the benefit 
of the economy and the people of Quebec, especially in the 
Montreal region.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am still looking for the connection  the government 
seems to see between job creation and examining political views of 
business leaders. The document we are tabling today contains an 
analysis, an assessment of the likelihood of influencing members 
of the Kruger family. That is going a bit too far and has no 
connection with jobs.
<P>
	In the same secret document prepared by Industry Canada, we 
read, and I quote:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
``The threat of cutting support for world class industrial facilities 
such as Pratt and Whitney, Spar Aerospace, and Canadian Marconi 
might bring reaction and support for the federalist cause''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	How can the leader of the government keep denying that 
Operation Unity is actually blackmailing companies like Spar by 
threatening to cut off federal subsidies for research and 
development unless they speak out on behalf of the No side?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is the duty of the government to make sure everybody 
understands what this is all about. This is all about a party 
dedicated to destroying Canada. You do not break up a country that 
easily anywhere in the world.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	Our preoccupation is very simple. We want to keep the country 
together. We can have industries in Quebec, we can have industries 
in Ontario and the rest of Canada that can compete in the world. It 
is our duty to tell that to Quebecers, because if they vote yes and 
there is a separatist government there can be no guarantee they will 
be able to have the same types of operations in Quebec.
<P>
	The leaders of the unions can talk, but the owners of a company 
do not know what they talk about.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	What does Mr. Beaudoin want? He wants to maintain the number 
of jobs Quebecers have with Bombardier in Quebec. That is his 
concern. He is doing this first of all for the sake of the workers, 
their salaries and the shareholders, and it is his responsibility to do 
so.
<P>
	If we can help people tell workers in Quebec that they are taking 
a risk by voting Yes, it is our duty to tell them that, in their own 
interests and those of their families, they should vote to stay in the 
best country in the world: Canada.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the first duty of any government, federal or otherwise, is 
to respect democracy, to let people enjoy their freedom of opinion.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15212"> 15212 </A></B>
<P>
	Democracy calls for the respect of the freedom of those people, 
whether business people or anybody in Canada, to be free to 
express their opinions and not be forced to be federalists because 
of blackmail. It is not very noble to be federalists because we are 
blackmailed.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, would the Prime Minister admit that what the 
vice-president of Spar Aerospace told his employees yesterday is a 
direct result of this conscription exercise in which Ottawa is 
pushing business people to support the No side?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, everyone has a right to express his opinions, including 
heads of companies. And they have an obligation to tell their 
employees-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> Yes, they have an obligation to 
say so.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> Not by using blackmail.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> Mr. Speaker, since when is the 
truth blackmail? Since when is telling people that their economic 
and political future is at risk blackmail?
<P>
	We are telling the truth. We are not looking for trick questions 
with ``virages and mirages''. We want to tell Quebecers the truth. 
We have proved in Canada that we can live together, even if we do 
not all speak the same language or have the same colour skin. I am 
delighted to see the best example of what we can do in Canada in 
our gallery today: hockey players who worked as a team.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
They have proven they can become the best in the world, French 
and English, but all of them proud Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
distressing to note that the Prime Minister is prepared to use every 
means to ensure his truth wins, including standing behind 
documents that advocate blackmailing business.
<P>
	The Prime Minister persists in claiming this is perfectly normal. 
Imagine, it is perfectly normal for Industry Canada to keep the 
political opinions of the heads of Quebec business on file. The 
Prime Minister thinks it is perfectly normal for a government 
document to describe ways to armtwist Quebec businesses into 
voting the way the Prime Minister wants them to.
<P>
	When the Industry Canada document identifies the political 
affiliation of a number of heads of Quebec businesses, when it lists 
the subsidies granted them, when funding cuts to Spar, Pratt &amp; 
Whitney or Canadian  Marconi are threatened, how can this still be 
claimed to be a simple matter of economics and not a political 
matter for the special unit of the Prime Minister's office?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, quite frankly, the people in the Bloc Quebecois are really 
desperate. Two days ago we were being accused of giving Quebec 
nothing for research and development.
<P>
	Do you recall, hon. members, Mr. Speaker?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Yes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> We were not doing enough. 
Now we are doing too much, because we told the people of Quebec 
that these industries developed thanks to the presence of the federal 
government. The federal government has been giving subsidies to 
these businesses for 25 years. They are not being given because of 
an upcoming referendum. Twenty-five years ago we developed 
these programs of assistance to industry, which have resulted, in 
certain sectors, in Quebec workers being able today to sell their 
products worldwide.
<P>
	This is why the heads of business who succeeded, with the help 
of the federal government, in developing these businesses want to 
keep them for the benefit of people working there.
<P>
	Mr. Beaudouin probably has a pretty solid bank account, but if a 
disaster strikes, it will not be he who suffers, it will be the the 
families of people working in his plants. These are the people we 
want to protect, rather than leap into the void in the adventure that 
these folks here are proposing for Quebec. Quebecers know they 
are living in Canada, the best country in the world, and on October 
30, they will vote for Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, if the 
Prime Minister would like to talk research and development, he 
should take note and acknowledge before the cameras and before 
this House that the document prepared by his officials confirms the 
figures quoted by the official opposition last week to the effect that 
only 17 per cent of all research and development is done in Quebec, 
when the figure should be much higher than that. It should be at 
least 30 per cent.
<P>
	Indeed, Mr. Speaker, it is not desperation when we call for

<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The question please.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier:</B> In a democratic society such as ours, how can the 
Prime Minister find it normal and try to tell the House that a group 
of officials in the federal government's special operations unit, 
connected with his office, is systematically violating the charter of 
rights and freedoms by classifying the heads of Quebec businesses 
according to their political affiliation?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15213"> 15213 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, our request was not very complicated. We simply asked 
officials to tell us the truth about federal involvement in Quebec 
businesses.
<P>
<B>(1430)</B>
<P>
	It is very important for them to know, because we want people to 
know the truth. We did not do as the Bloc Quebecois and the Parti 
Quebecois did and say: ``We will come up with a winning 
question''. Not a real question, a winning question. They did not 
want to tell Quebecers they are separatists. The leader of the Bloc 
Quebecois, the Leader of the Opposition, told the Americans, 
because they do not understand what the word ``souverainiste'' 
means, and besides, it is not in the French dictionary-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> It is in the new Quebec 
dictionary which has not been approved by the Académie 
Française.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> For the first year, because we 
silenced them a few times recently.
<P>
	The leader of the Bloc Quebecois said to the Americans: ``I am a 
separatist''. But he did not have the courage to go to Lac-Saint-Jean 
or Trois-Rivières or Rouyn-Noranda or Montreal and say: ``I am a 
separatist''. Everyone knows I am a Canadian and that I will still be 
one on October 31.

	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	Both the Canadian people and our armed forces deserve better 
than the culture of cover-up which has taken hold of the 
Department of National Defence. It seems that every day we 
discover new evidence of deception within the DND hierarchy. 
Access to information documents are forged. Police investigations 
are obstructed. Evidence is destroyed.
<P>
	We have warned the Minister of National Defence repeatedly, 
yet he has adopted a hear no evil, see no evil attitude and 
continually expresses confidence in his senior officials. Canadians 
have lost confidence.
<P>
	When will the Prime Minister recognize the chronic systematic 
failure of the leadership in the Department of National Defence?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I think Canada is very well served by a very good Minister 
of National Defence.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister is just like the defence minister. 
He is hiding behind camouflage. The failure is in leadership and it 
begins at the top.
<P>
	The most basic principle of parliamentary democracy requires 
the minister to take responsibility for the decisions of his officials.
<P>
	Why should we be surprised when officers in the Canadian 
forces chain of command begin passing the buck? This is an 
example set by the minister.
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister. Who is calling the shots 
in the Department of National Defence? When will he appoint a 
minister who will take responsibility for the defence department?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fred Mifflin (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in response to the hon. member, the critic for the third 
party, he is suggesting there have been cover-ups.
<P>
	Let me just tell him, his party and the House that it was this 
government that commissioned the inquiry into the Somalia events 
and the deployment of the Canadian forces. It was this government 
that made all the documents, every single document related to that 
inquiry, open to the public. It was this government that made 
available and encouraged members of the Canadian forces to 
appear in front of the commission and to do everything they could 
to bring light to the commission.
<P>
	This government has not just been open; it has been terribly 
open.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, terrible is the correct response for sure.
<P>
	I remind the parliamentary secretary that external inquiries are 
not the question. It is the question of the internal inquiries where 
cover-ups, corruption and mismanagement are the daily practice at 
DND.
<P>
	The Prime Minister knows the Canadian Armed Forces has 
served the country with honour. He knows that his minister has lost 
the respect of Canadians and has entirely lost control of his 
department.
<P>
	Why does the Prime Minister refuse to demand the resignation 
of the Minister of National Defence who consistently demonstrates 
poor judgment and flees not only from his responsibilities but from 
questions in the House.
<P>
<B>(1435)</B>
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I think the parliamentary secretary very eloquently 
explained the situation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15214"> 15214 </A></B>
<P>
	When we formed the government there was this problem which 
was created before we came into government that was causing a 
lot of problems. We decided to get to the bottom of it.
<P>
	There were some very difficult decisions to be made. For 
example, when we had to decide to dismantle the airborne regiment 
it was not easy to do. I think it was the right decision. Now all the 
files are available to everybody and an inquiry has been named that 
will look at every document.
<P>
	It is public. The press is there. How can we be more open than 
that? All the documents are there.
<P>
	The incident in Somalia occurred before we formed the 
government but there was a desire by the public to get to the bottom 
of it and the commission will get to the bottom of it. It will make 
recommendations. If there is some need for changes in the way 
decisions are made in defence, we will change them. But so far so 
good.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> Yes, yes. There is an inquiry 
and the minister has made available everything required by the 
commissioners. It is a public inquiry and we will wait for the 
results. After that if there is a need for changes we will make them, 
but first we will let the inquiry do its job.

	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in the secret Industry Canada document it is stated that 
Oerlikon will likely adopt a federalist position in private, but that 
its public position will be determined by its head office instead. We 
also know that the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs has 
recently been in touch with that company.
<P>
	Can the minister assure us that neither he nor any member of his 
staff has used the fallout benefits from the armoured vehicle 
construction contracts to pressure Oerlikon to position itself on the 
No side, as recommended in the secret Industry Canada document?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, the only communication between myself and Oerlikon has 
been one letter in which I forwarded to them, with General Motors' 
permission, a letter from GM stating that there would be 
discussions between the two companies to see whether it would be 
possible for Oerlikon to take part in the General Motors contracts.
<P>
	That is all there was to it, and the allegations of the opposition 
are once again based on dreaming, obviously in technicolour, and 
without any basis in fact.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, no, the dreams were in black and white, a printed black 
and white document from the Department of Industry, a secret 
document. He might read it from time to time. It would be helpful 
to us if he took time off from his dreaming to read something once 
in a while. How can the minister explain that Ottawa continues to 
put off clarifying its intentions concerning the regional benefits of 
the contract to purchase armoured vehicles, while as long ago as 
March Oerlikon was being clearly identified in a secret Industry 
Canada document as a possible subcontractor for the tank turrets?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, once again the opposition is mixing all kinds of issues 
together. Oerlikon and General Motors will be discussing their 
plans to perhaps enable Oerlikon to obtain subcontracts from 
General Motors.
<P>
	But to give you a an idea of what is really in the Department of 
Industry document referred to, I will read you some excerpts. For 
example, in the aeronautics sector, what the ``secret'' Department 
of Industry document says is as follows: The generally stable 
climate and the availability of funding programs are what have 
been responsible for the industry's continued growth. The threat of 
separation might offer the companies an opportunity for out of 
province consolidation and restructuring.
<P>
<B>(1440)</B>
<P>
	That is what the document has to say about companies in the 
aeronautical sector. I might mention other sectors, but the 
conclusion is that this document states very clearly that separation 
will cost Quebecers dearly in all of the province's industrial 
sectors.

destruction of the two videotapes by Colonel Kenward is clear 
evidence of a violation or an obstruction of justice.
<P>
	Colonel Kenward's promotion is an exoneration of wrongdoing 
determined by the most senior members of our military and viewed 
by many as a cover-up. Clearly an external inquiry into the 
operation of the entire military apparatus beyond the mandate of

integrity of our military is beyond question and functioning within 
the confines of law.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Fred Mifflin (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, with respect to the issue of promotion of the officer in 
question, I have to tell the hon. member and the House there is a 
system in place that has existed for 43 years.
<P>
	That system essentially is that the chief of the defence staff is 
responsible for promoting officers and non-commissioned ranks up 
to the rank of colonel. The minister is responsible for all general 
officers' promotions.
<P>
	The system is in place to prevent political interference. It works 
and it worked on this occasion. If the hon. member is suggesting 
that we politicize the system of promotion then I suggest he is 
suggesting the wrong thing. The Canadian forces would not agree. 
The House would not approve it and the Canadian public would be 
appalled.
<P>
	He would be the first one to scream if this were the case and I 
would be there to join him.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this is 
another incident of preferential treatment under the law for certain 
Canadians. The destruction of evidence by Colonel Kenward is 
clearly a violation of the law. His exoneration by military brass 
rather than through due process places our rule of law in disrepute.
<P>
	Could the Prime Minister explain to the House why this senior 
military officer was promoted rather than held accountable for his 
actions? Why do we not all stand equal before the law?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fred Mifflin (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I ask the hon. member in asking questions to make sure he 
has his facts correct.
<P>
	I remind the House of something that came out yesterday. Had 
he watched the press conference by the chief of the defence staff, 
he may have discovered that he was not entirely correct in his 
question.
<P>
	The senior judge in the Canadian forces, the judge advocate 
general, on the recommendation of the chief of the defence staff 
and the commander of land forces, did a special inquiry and 
concluded that the officer in question did nothing illegal.
<P>
	With respect to being open, I have to tell the hon. member who 
talked about destroyed tapes that these were copies. The original 
tape is now answering to our question and a previous question 
about transparency.

	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs.
<P>
	The secret document intended for Operation Unity reveals that 
top executives at CAE Electronics, a subsidiary of the parent 
company in Toronto, strongly support federalism in private. It also 
indicates that they will publicly follow in the footsteps of their 
Bombardier and Marconi counterparts.
<P>
	Can the minister, who is obviously well aware of the referendum 
position of potential government contractors, tell us what contract 
he has set aside for CAE Electronics should its executives come out 
publicly in favour of the No side?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, the opposition is repeating-in the hope of making it 
come true-the allegation that there is a link between the analysis 
of various industrial sectors in the Industry Canada document and 
federal subsidies to these industries.
<P>
<B>(1445)</B>
<P>
	There is clearly no link between the two. What the report 
correctly describes is the fact that a great many Quebec industries 
are dependent on various federal subsidies and that if Quebec 
separates from the rest of Canada, many Quebec businesses will go 
bankrupt. That is simple. That is clear. That is transparent.

<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in June Ty Lund gave an 
interview to Vicki Barnett of a newspaper in Alberta in which he 
said, and this is his quote in June in reference to the meeting that 
took place: ``Referring to federal minister Copps, Lund said, 
`Come on, lady, if you want to come to Alberta and see what's 
happening with Indian reserves and logging, we would have had it 
shut down and charged them a long time ago. Where have you 
been? In our last meeting with Sheila Copps-she's an interesting 
lady-she was giving me the gears for trying to get into a 
harmonization. She sput and sputtered about that one and she said 
to me, `You don't look after our lands'. Lund is leading the charge 
which would see the province have complete responsibility for 
Alberta land while Ottawa would oversee national parks and Indian 
reserves''.
<P>
	Those were the comments of Mr. Lund in a newspaper interview 
in June.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solberg:</B> So what?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Red Deer):</B> Apologize.
<P>

comments are absolutely true. That is the jurisdiction of the federal 
government. Why does she not live up to it and make sure it is 
abided by?
<P>
	She accuses the provincial minister of saying this and exactly 
this: ``You can have the national parks and the Indians. We want to 
look after all the rest''. That simply is not true. He did not say that. 
Regardless of what comments may have been taken out of context 
in that news article, why will she not-
<P>

back on track?
<P>

claimed that I had misrepresented the views of Mr. Lund. Mr. Lund 
has never denied making the remarks at a private meeting with nine 
other ministers at which I heard very specifically the comments he 
made.
<P>
	It is a sad day when the member for Beaver River gets up in the 
House and repeats the position of the Alberta government that the 
Government of Canada has no place  in Alberta other than to deal 
with Indian reserves and national parks.
<P>
	Surely the Canadian people support a national government that 
will establish national environmental standards and give some 
national leadership. Surely she understands that the point I was 
making to Ty Lund, when I would not cave in to his blatant threat to 
tell me to get out of the province, was specifically because I 
believe, and the Government of Canada believes, that the people of 
Canada expect Canadian environmental leadership.

	<B>Mr. Jean-Marc Jacob (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs.
<P>
	The secret document prepared for Operation Unity shows that 
the federal government is set to spend $5.6 billion on the potential 
acquisition of defence equipment, including armoured vehicles, 
submarines and helicopters. According to the document, these 
equipment acquisition contracts could have a profound impact on 
Quebec businesses. The document identifies eight Quebec 
businesses likely to benefit economically and outlines the political 
views of their top executives.
<P>
	How should we describe the federal government's behaviour in 
dangling in front of some businesses generous contracts in return 
for their support for the No side? Is this not pure blackmail?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, again, the opposition's allegations are totally unfounded.
<P>
	Yesterday, the Leader of the Opposition made comments to the 
press, which were reported by Hugh Winsor and which indicate that 
there is absolutely nothing to support his allegations and no 
evidence whatsoever that any company has been subjected to 
pressure.
<P>
	In fact, as far as the defence industry is concerned, the report 
points out that companies such as Expro and SNC-IT that are very 
dependent on federal ammunition contracts could be forced to 
close their doors, while the companies that now rely on support and 
service contracts could be compelled to move part of their 
operations.
<P>
	I have here a whole list of excerpts from the report pointing to 
the main conclusion, namely, that separation would create very 
serious economic problems in Quebec and eliminate a great many 
jobs. I am willing to show the hon. member for Roberval, who 
requested it yesterday,  the proof that the vast majority of the 
<P>

industries identified in the report, the proof that Quebec's 
separation would be an element-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Marc Jacob (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
again, the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs did not answer the 
question at all. I did not talk about defence supplies but about 
defence equipment. He did not say anything about that.
<P>
	Here is my supplementary: As the secret document prepared in 
March refers to defence contracts in the next three months, how 
does the minister explain that they have not yet confirmed the 
benefits from the equipment acquisition contracts? The 
government is probably saving this lever to put pressure on some 
Quebec businesses.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental </B><B>Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, again, we gave very clear answers to those questions. 
Quebec receives a proportion of capital defence spending that is 
much higher than its percentage of the population.
<P>
	Again, page after page of the document in question shows that 
the separation they want would hurt Quebec employees as well as 
investments and the various industries in Quebec. Again, the 
document he is quoting from is the best proof that, on October 30, 
Quebecers will vote No to separation to preserve the economic 
benefits from their association with Canada.

speech in 1991 the Minister for Human Resources Development 
worried about the concerns and anxieties of Canadians over future 
levels of funding for the Canada pension plan. In the past four years 
those concerns have not gone away, they have only gotten worse. 
The minister has had two years to address these concerns, but he 
has failed to do so.
<P>
	Will the minister end the speculation and uncertainty for 
Canadian seniors, deliver on his promise to reform the Canada 
pension plan and announce here and now a specific date for 
reforms of the Canada pension plan?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, if the hon. member has been 
waiting since 1991, she might want to wait a few days longer.
<P>
	I understand the concern of the hon. member. We all share a very 
deep interest in ensuring that Canadians in retirement have 
effective and sustainable pension programs. The government is 
very committed to it because it authored the major old age pension 
and income security programs. That is why in the last budget we 
underlined once again our strong commitment to maintain and 
strengthen those programs and to enhance them.
<P>
	To prepare ourselves for that, the Minister of Finance in working 
with my department is preparing a paper that will outline for 
Canadians the choices and options we will have to face in the 
Canada pension plan in order to ensure that we can sustain its 
financing over the next years to meet the very large growth in the 
number of Canadians that will be retiring. We are working on that 
as well as we can. When the paper is right and ready we will 
present it, certainly to the hon. member. We will also present it to 
every other Canadian.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
tell the minister that the Reform Party is ready to go. Just watch for

The minister of HRD has made it very clear that the government 
intends to take such action. Meetings have already been held with 
the officials. There will be meetings with provincial finance 
ministers. That is where the changes have to take place.
<P>
	I look forward to hearing the Reform Party's suggestions. I hope 
they are a little bit better than the budget it came out with last year.

September 22 the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs stated in 
this House that his government was not carrying out any studies on 
overlap, just analyses. A fine distinction. The secret Industry 
Canada document confirms the existence of factual analyses on 
overlap, and I quote: For further details on duplication and overlap, 
refer to analyses.
<P>
	Now that we have confirmation that such analyses on duplication 
and overlap do exist, does the Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs plan to make them public before the referendum?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, I shall repeat my position, because it is true; the unity 
group within my Department has carried out no analysis 
whatsoever on duplication and overlap, and has carried out no 
study whatsoever on duplication and overlap.
<P>
	We do have a process to reduce and eliminate duplication and 
overlap, and this has led to the signature of a number of action 
plans by the first ministers. So, that is a process which does exist. I 
greatly regret that the present Parti Quebecois government has 
refused to help us eliminate duplication. But the truth is: no studies 
of that type have been carried out for us.

	<B>Mr. John Duncan (North Island-Powell River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday the chief of the Saugeen First Nation signed a 
declaration claiming authority over 300 kilometres of shoreline up 
to 11 kilometres out into the water around Bruce Peninsula.
<P>
	Chief Kahgee claimed sovereign status under international law. 
The chief said he will start today to implement fishing season 
quotas, issue commercial and sports licences, and analyse 
resources. The department of Indian affairs has known about this 
for over three years.
<P>
	Can the minister tell the House his plans to prevent this 
subversion of the legitimate authority of the Government of 
Canada?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, if a claim has been issued it has 
not come to my desk. Anyone can issue a claim in Canada. If it is 
by writ, it winds up with the Minister of Justice. If it is a claim, the 
member knows there is a process, and if it is a legitimate grievance 
then it is negotiated.
<P>
	In 1993 in the Nadjiwon case the Ontario provincial court found 
that the Saugeen Ojibway have a right of access to and use of their 
traditional fishing ground around the Bruce Peninsula. The 
provincial court did not find a right of ownership. If there is an 
issue there, I am sure in due course it will be decided by a court.
<P>
	I think the hon. member is doing a disservice to a court system 
and a claim system we have in Canada that provides for due 
process and not political brownie points.

<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="BILLS-9">BILL S-9</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. George S. Baker (Gander-Grand Falls, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise on a point of order relating to a finance committee 
meeting I attended yesterday, an excellent committee, as I am 
reminded. This committee dealt with Bill S-9, a Senate bill referred 
to the committee and on which we heard evidence.
<P>
	During the evidence in the committee meeting it became clear 
that the bill imposes expenditures on the Government of Canada. 
The amount of money involved per year, as was pointed out in the 
committee and which evidence I could lay before you, Mr. Speaker, 
involves  perhaps hundreds of millions of dollars. It was part of 
budgetary provisions dating back to 1992, budget papers from 1992 
and 1993. A provision of the bill also is retroactive to November 
10, 1988, which requires an expenditure of public funds.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I refer you to two decisions made in this Chamber 
and contained in the books of Speaker Lamoureux, which are truly 
the decisions that mark the difference between the powers of the 
Commons and the powers of the Senate. I do not have the decisions 
of Justice Lamoureux before me, but one of them is on page 174 
and the other 175.
<P>
	The decision on page 174 was made on November 12, 1969 
when the Senate approved a bill for the dissolution of the Dominion 
Coal Corporation at that time. An MP by the name of Baldwin 
stood in the Chamber and objected that this involved an 
expenditure of public funds.
<P>
	The Speaker at the time set aside a period in which he heard 
arguments as to whether it was an expenditure of public funds. 
After listening to the arguments he said no, this bill must come in 
as per Standing Order 62 at that time, which is Standing Order 
79(1) today, which is that royal recommendation is required for any 
expenditure of public money.
<P>
	The second decision was made on June 12, 1972, again by 
Speaker Lamoureux. It was the same instance where a government 
bill came through the Senate. An objection was launched at that 
time that although the bill did not involve an immediate 
expenditure of public funds, it committed the government to an 
expenditure in the future.
<P>
<B>(1510)</B>
<P>
	The ruling at that time was that yes, according to Standing Order 
63, presently Standing Order 80(1) under Beauchesne's sixth 
edition, if a bill involves an expenditure of money then it cannot be 
brought in through the Senate.
<P>
	My objection is according to Standing order 79(1), which says 
quite clearly that it is the crown that demands, the Commons that 
grants and the Senate that accedes to that grant, it is the prerogative 
of the House of Commons, not the Senate, and it must be done with 
royal recommendation by the executive, by the crown. It cannot be 
done through the Senate. Standing Order 80(1) states quite clearly 
that the Senate's only role is to accede to such a request. It cannot 
even amend such a request.
<P>
	The evidence is quite clear that on the one hand the expenditure 
of public money involved is that it reduces by 50 per cent the tax on 
any profits made by U.S. multinationals in Canada. That is the 
expenditure, approximately $130 million to $135 million per year. 
This is supported, incidentally, by the Reform Party and the Bloc 
wholeheartedly.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15220"> 15220 </A></B>
<P>
	The expenditure involves in the last clause of the bill a 
retroactive provision in the case of payments that involve the 
payment by the Government of Canada of a tax credit for anybody 
who was subjected to the estate tax in the United States. If people 
who had property of over $600,000 in the U.S. are subjected to 
the estate tax, Canada will provide a tax credit to offset that on 
their foreign based income. That is dated back to November 10, 
1988, which would impose an immediate expenditure on the 
Government of Canada. The rest of it would impose an 
expenditure, a loss in tax expenditures for all time to come.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, it is not that the bill would be defeated by your 
ruling, because all of the political parties in this Chamber support 
the bill. I am saying this violates the privileges of the Canadian 
House of Commons as seen in precedent and as seen in our 
standing orders. This should come back and be presented in the 
correct manner.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
with great respect to the hon. member's very able argument, I think 
he has misconstrued the point in Standing Orders 79 and 80 of the 
House of Commons.
<P>
	Standing order 79(1) reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This House shall not adopt or pass any vote, resolution, address or bill for the 
appropriation of any part of the public revenue, or of any tax or impost, to any 
purpose that has not been first recommended to the House by a message from 
the Governor General in the session in which such vote, resolution, address or 
bill is proposed.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He is quite correct in stating that is the case.
<P>
	Bill S-9, an act to amend the Canada-U.S. tax convention, is not 
a bill for appropriating any part of the public revenue or for any tax 
or impost. What it does is change the effect of the taxation laws of 
Canada through the application of various rules under this tax 
convention, which may result in the refund of revenues already 
received by the Government of Canada. This is not an expenditure 
of government funds; this is a refund of money that was collected 
from Canadian citizens pursuant to the tax laws of Canada, which 
are being amended by this tax convention because similar moneys 
were taken from these persons as a result of the application of the 
tax laws of the United States.
<P>
	Everyone in the House is aware that tax conventions exist for the 
purpose of avoiding double taxation on the citizens of the two 
countries involved in the convention.
<P>
	The hon. member has misconstrued the repayment of tax 
revenues already received as appropriations of public money. That 
was not the intention either of the standing order or of the 
constitutional practice in this regard. In support of that submission 
I refer Your Honour to citation 599 of Beauchesne's sixth edition:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>If any motion, whether in the House or in a committee, requires, but fails to 
receive, the recommendation of the Crown,  it is the duty of the Speaker to 
announce that no question can be proposed upon the motion, or declare the bill out 
of order, or to say that the problem may be rectified by the proposer obtaining a 
Royal Recommendation.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1515)</B>
<P>
	I do not disagree with that. Citation 600 states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The principle that the sanction of the Crown must be given to every grant of 
money drawn for the public revenue applies equally to the taxation levied to 
provide that revenue.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In other words, a royal recommendation is required on a bill to 
impose a tax on the subject-and this bill does not; there is no 
dispute on that-and any bill to authorize the expenditure of public 
funds.
<P>
	There is no expenditure authorized. What is authorized here is 
different. It is a refund of taxation which has been taken from the 
subject that is being changed by virtue of the application of the tax 
treaty. The tax treaty was ratified in the other place in the form of 
this bill which has been sent to the House for concurrence and the 
committee was very properly studying concurrence in the bill.
<P>
	In my experience, and I have watched this kind of procedure for 
some time, tax conventions are almost invariably introduced as 
bills in the other place. Many of those tax conventions as a result of 
their passage involve repayment of money to Canadian citizens. In 
my experience there has not been a royal recommendation attached 
to any of those bills. There could not have been, or they would not 
have been introduced in the other place first.
<P>
	They are introduced there because it is permissible to introduce 
technical bills of that kind in the Senate, the ones that do not 
require royal recommendation. That has been done in this case. In 
my experience it has been the invariable practice with respect to tax 
convention implementation legislation. I submit there is nothing 
irregular in this procedure. The hon. member has simply 
misconstrued the notion of refund of taxation as an expenditure of 
public funds. I submit they are not the same.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Peterson (Willowdale, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on the 
same point of order.
<P>
	The hon. member for Gander-Grand Falls referred to Standing 
Order 80 which would preclude a Senate bill coming to the finance 
committee if it dealt with aids and supplies. This is not an aid or 
supply.
<P>
	As the hon. parliamentary secretary has indicated, it has been the 
custom of the House for as long as I can recall to have tax treaty 
amendments of which there have been probably 70 or 80 in the past 
decade and a half originate in the Senate. I commend the Senate for 
the excellent job it has done in dealing with these very complicated 
and detailed pieces of legislation. It is not an area where those who 
<P>

<B><A NAME="15221"> 15221 </A></B>
<P>
have not done a lot of work and a  lot of study are really capable of 
assessing the implications.
<P>
	I concur with the hon. parliamentary secretary. This is not an aid 
or supply. This has been our tradition. It has worked very well. This 
is an excellent piece of legislation, supported by all members of the 
House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
rise on behalf of the New Democratic Party on this point of order.
<P>
	The New Democratic Party agrees with the hon. member for 
Gander-Grand Falls who raised the matter of Bill S-9 being a bill 
that will cause a great deal of expenditure from the treasury to 
people retroactively, in particular to people who have a great deal 
of wealth to start with.
<P>
	There is an assumption that the New Democratic Party supports 
Bill S-9. I make it perfectly clear that the bill is an unfair bill for 
taxpayers. The New Democratic Party does not support it. I support 
the contention of the hon. member for Gander-Grand Falls with 
respect to having the bill reviewed by Your Honour to see if it is in 
order.
<P>
<B>(1520)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Nunziata (York South-Weston, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I rise on the same point of order. I have a letter in front of me from 
the Minister of Finance in which he refers to the subject matter my 
friend from Gander-Grand Falls raised as a cost presumably to 
the taxpayers of Canada. He pegs that cost at $125 million for 
1995-96 and $145 million for 1996-97.
<P>
	We are not dealing with petty cash here. We are dealing with a 
significant amount of taxpayers' dollars. What ordinary Canadians 
want to know is if it is such an important piece of legislation, why 
is it coming via the unelected Senate of Canada? Since when does 
an unelected group of men and women down the hall from this 
elected Chamber introduce legislation that will have the result of 
withdrawing from the public purse $125 million this year and $145 
million next year?
<P>
	Surely that moral and legal right ought to be that of the 
government of the day. It is the government that should be setting 
public policy, not unelected senators.
<P>
	I lend my support to the member who raised this point. If it is the 
government's wish, and I understand the government is supporting 
this initiative, why bring in the back door what they do not have the 
courage to bring in through the front door?
<P>
	Let us have an honest debate in the House of Commons. Let us 
have them introduce it as a government bill. Let us debate it at 
second reading. Let us send it to the committee. Let us have the 
courage as elected people to call a spade a spade.
<P>
	The minister refers to it as a cost in his letter. It must be a cost 
because it will cost you and I and every other taxpayer close to 
$300 million over the next two years.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> As a general rule I do not want to get into a debate 
on a point of order. The parliamentary secretary has spoken once. I 
appreciate the interventions that have taken place.
<P>
	This is a very important point of order that has come before the 
House. I wonder if members would give me a day or two to do the 
research on my own, to have a look at it. Then I will come back to 
the House at that time with a decision and we will see where we are 
going from there. I would prefer to do that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to answer the allegations 
made by the hon. member for York South-Weston. Not that I am 
seeking to defend the other place in my comments, but it is very 
important that he recognize this is a government bill.
<P>
	The bill was introduced by the government in the other place. It 
is sponsored in the House by the Minister of Finance. It was 
debated at second reading in the House, referred to committee and 
will be debated at third reading in the House. It is a government 
bill. It is going through the same process that every other 
government bill goes through in the House.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I thank all hon. members for their interventions. I 
will apprise myself of the situation. If members will give me time 
to look at it, I will come back to the House with a decision.

<P>
	The petitioners understand that more than 100 million 
anti-personnel land mines are laid around the world and 
indiscriminately kill or maim between 1,000 and 2,000  men,

impoverish communities by denying access to land and impede 
social and economic post-conflict reconstruction.
<P>
	Therefore they petition Parliament to legislate the prohibition in 
Canada of the use, production, stockpiling, sale, trade and transfer 
of all anti-personnel land mines; to work for an international 
convention banning these activities; and to ask the Canadian 
government to increase its contributions to the United Nations for

<P>
	The petitioners would like to draw to the attention of the House 
that managing the family home and caring for preschool children is

	The House resumed from October 3 consideration of Bill C-64, 
an act respecting employment equity, as reported (with 
amendments) from the committee; and of Motion No. 7.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Mr. Speaker, after consultation with the 
Liberals, the Bloc and the New Democratic Party yesterday, we 
agreed and would seek unanimous agreement to amend clause 25 
which will be debated as part of group 5, with an amendment 
already given to-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Will the member please excuse the Chair. 
The member probably thought the debate was over yesterday. 
Other speakers wish to speak. We will have to deal with his point 
when the other speakers are finished on the earlier group of 
motions.
<P>

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ménard:</B> Mr. Speaker, when we left off, you were about to 
put the question on the last motion that had been debated, which 
happened to be mine. Do you still intend to do that or are we 
proceeding with a new group of motions?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker: </B>To assist the hon. member, we are still on 
group No. 4. I believe he already spoke to this group of motions, if 
I remember correctly. Does the hon. member wish to speak again to 
this question? If he does, we will need the unanimous consent of 
the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ménard:</B> When the debate was adjourned, you were about 
to put the question on Motion No. 7, which happens to be mine. If 
there are still members who wish to speak to this motion, I would 
be glad to listen to them. I was just wondering when the vote would 
be.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> As I said before, there are no members 
who wish to speak, so we will have the vote later on.

<HR>
<B><A NAME="15224"> 15224 </A></B>
<P>
	I understand the hon. member was first on the speaking order 
and that I would speak second, if that pleases Your Honour.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The Chair was given a list of three people 
wishing to speak. The hon. member for Central Nova was the first 
on the list. Does she wish to cede her place to the hon. member for 
Rosedale?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Skoke:</B> Yes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Graham (Rosedale, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
hon. member for Central Nova for ceding her place to enable me to 
attend to other business later this afternoon.
<P>
	Equal access to job opportunities is a principle Canadians 
adopted several years ago. Other nations think highly of us because 
we do more than pay lip service to equality. We take proactive steps 
to make equality a reality in the everyday lives of our citizens.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Bill C-64 will do much to expand opportunities for genuine 
equality in the workplace for women, aboriginal peoples, persons 
with disabilities and members of visible minorities.
<P>
	It is our responsibility to ensure that this legislation achieves this 
important goal whenever possible.
<P>
	That is why, like many of my colleagues who spoke earlier, I 
have a serious problem with Motion No. 7 introduced by the hon. 
member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The hon. member's motion takes the need for co-operation in 
implementing the Employment Equity Act to an extreme that I do 
not believe would achieve the desired result. The government's 
perspective is to do what is necessary to implement and administer 
Bill C-64 in the most productive way possible but responsibility for 
implementation administration must remain with employers. They 
are the ones who ultimately have to answer to the commission if 
they fail to meet their responsibilities.
<P>
	Let us consider what would happen if we adopted the hon. 
member's motion and moved from the bill's current requirements 
for collaboration between employers and employees to what might 
be called a co-management arrangement. For one thing, it would 
reduce the bill's requirement for consultation. The hon. member's 
motion if adopted would mean that there is no longer any need to 
consult regarding implementation or revision of employment 
equity plans.
<P>
	Bill C-64 as it presently stands allows the commission or a 
tribunal to order consultation. I find it surprising that the hon. 
member who is seeking to enrich and improve the bill would want 
to delete provisions regarding consultations and replace them with 
weaker  provisions that would not be subject to a direction or order. 
I would ask him and the party he represents to reconsider the bill 
from that perspective. It seems to me and to the government that 
the amendment as proposed actually weakens rather than 
strengthens the bill, contrary to the avowed intent of the hon. 
member.
<P>
<B>(1540 )</B>
<P>
	Another Canadian characteristic that makes us the envy of others 
is our willingness to work together for the collective good of all our 
citizens. Voluntary collaboration and co-operation are innate 
qualities of being Canadian. I know many of us in the House seek 
and strive to enshrine those principles in all the work we do. I have 
every confidence that management and labour will collaborate to 
ensure the most effective implementation of employment equity 
plans. Why should they not? It surely is to the advantage of both.
<P>
	It is in creating plans and legislation of this kind that one 
achieves an appropriate balance between the needs of labour and 
the needs of management. In doing so we have created a 
labour-management relations atmosphere which is beneficial to 
both parties. That is what we seek to achieve in this bill.
<P>
	As my colleagues before me have said, we have already 
deliberated over the Bloc's concerns in committee. The 
government feels that having given these concerns due 
consideration, we are satisfied with the way the provisions now 
stand.
<P>
	I remind the hon. member that the Employment Equity Act is 
designed to help move us closer to true equality in the workplace. It 
is not designed to change other aspects of employer-employee 
relationships. However, that would be the unfortunate result if we 
adopted the hon. member's motion.
<P>
	The way the bill now stands, collaboration is a requirement. The 
ultimate responsibility for making decisions however lies with 
employers and that is the way it should be. There is a difference 
between the requirement for collaboration and discussion and the 
ultimate responsibility for the decision which surely must be taken 
by employers who have both the financial and managerial 
responsibility for ensuring that those decisions are properly carried 
out.
<P>
	Hon. members know from their own experiences that we put 
much more effort into something when the effort is willingly given 
and not obtained through coercion. One cannot legislate 
co-operation and a positive attitude. We have seen that in the 
workplace and we are trying to strive to avoid confrontational 
situations in the workplace.
<P>
	Positive co-operation comes about because the parties involved 
bring the right attitude to the task at hand. That is what the current 
provisions in the bill will achieve. They will create an atmosphere 
within which collaboration, co-operation and discussion will take 
place.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15225"> 15225 </A></B>
<P>
	They will not seek however to create what the member's 
amendment seeks to create which is a sort of co-management 
regime that would by its very nature lead to strife between those 
on the management side with their responsibilities and those on 
the labour side with their responsibilities. It would totally confuse 
the two roles which both parties properly play in the workplace 
and would substitute, instead of this atmosphere of co-operation 
and collaboration, an atmosphere of mistrust between the two 
parties between which it is very important to establish good 
working relationships.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I wish to thank the hon. member for his contribution to this 
debate. Unfortunately, for the reasons I just mentioned, I cannot 
support Motion No. 7.
<P>
[English] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Roseanne Skoke (Central Nova, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
my privilege to address this honourable House today with respect 
to Motion No. 7 brought forward by the hon. member for 
Hochelaga-Maisonneuve.
<P>
	The government appreciates the hon. member's input into Bill 
C-64. However, we are concerned that his motion would have an 
effect that would not be beneficial to the administration of the 
Employment Equity Act. The way the motion reads, if it were to be 
adopted, it would in essence establish an employer-employee 
co-management arrangement under the act.
<P>
	Members of the Bloc raised this issue in committee and the 
government was responsive and flexible in giving it due 
consideration. However, if we adopted the motion before us it 
might very well have negative ramifications in the way 
employment equity is administered. Responsibility must be clear in 
this regard.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	Nevertheless I hasten to add that the intent of the legislation 
before us is not to create situations where management is imposing 
employment equity on workers without their input. This is not the 
intent at all. On the contrary, the current act encourages and 
requires productive consultations between employer and employee 
representatives. As I said previously, the government appreciates 
constructive suggestions. That is why we listened and accepted 
recommendations made in committee.
<P>
	The effect of those recommendations is that Bill C-64 now 
requires collaboration between employer and employee 
representatives when preparing, implementing and revising 
employment equity plans.
<P>
	However, the key aspect of this arrangement is collaboration, not 
co-management. The responsibility for making final decisions 
must remain with employers. After all, they are the ones who must 
answer to the commission regarding implementation of the act. 
Hon.  members will agree that the person who is held responsible 
for an action must retain the ability to make final decisions.
<P>
	The government is trying to send a clear message here. For 
employment equity to be fair and effective, a co-operative effort in 
implementing its principles is required by both management and 
labour. The emphasis is very much the same, emphasis the 
government takes in its own relationships with other governments, 
the private sector, community organizations and so on. I am 
referring to the concept of partnership, a productive effort by all 
concerned to reach the same goal. That is exactly what came 
through in committee regarding the issue: collaboration, yes; 
co-management, no.
<P>
	I remind the hon. member that adoption of his motion is not as 
simple as he may think. It would have widespread implications 
because the act does not have a provision which allows a tribunal to 
issue orders against a bargaining agent. In other words, 
collaboration requires just that, the two parties work together to 
reach a common goal voluntarily. Enforced collaboration is an 
oxymoron and experience shows that it makes for unproductive 
relationships.
<P>
	Management must have final responsibility for its obligations 
under Bill C-64. It is management that must answer to the 
commission if it fails to meet its obligations under the act. It is 
unacceptable to adopt a situation wherein the employer is held 
responsible but does not have the ultimate authority to address that 
responsibility.
<P>
	The government does not wish Bill C-64 to alter the framework 
of labour relations in a fundamental manner. That is not the 
purpose of the legislation before the House. Its purpose is to help 
move Canada toward true equality in the workplace. This is a step 
of which all Canadians should be very proud. Passage of Bill C-64 
will enshrine in law the principle of equality for all Canadians. It 
will help to lay down a level playing field for those in the 
designated groups, specifically women, aboriginal people, persons 
with disabilities and members of visible minorities.
<P>
	Bill C-64 also fulfils the government's pre-election commitment 
to strengthen the existing Employment Equity Act by extending 
coverage to virtually the entire public service. I believe hon. 
colleagues should also agree that fairness dictates that all 
Canadians have due access to employment opportunities. 
Therefore we must implement this legislation in a manner that will 
encourage co-operation and goodwill on the part of both employers 
and employees.
<P>
	We thank the hon. member for his input. However, the 
government is satisfied with the bill's emphasis on collaboration. 
We are not prepared to move toward co-management. For that 
reason I cannot support the member's Motion No. 7.

<P>
<B>(1550 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Harvard (Winnipeg St. James, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am glad to rise during debate to discuss Motion No. 7.
<P>
	The hon. member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve and his 
colleagues have made some eloquent points on behalf of this 
amendment, both here and previously in committee. That is the 
reason the government has already amended the original bill. That 
amendment made sense. To accept this amendment does not.
<P>
	I want to take a few minutes to underline some of the essential 
elements in the government's approach to government equity to 
show why I will not be able to vote for this motion.
<P>
	Two years ago at this very moment, almost every one of us was 
engaged in one of the most important federal election campaigns of 
our time. I was proud to campaign under the banner of a party and a 
leader with a clear plan. Our red book was a blueprint for action. It 
was no wish list. It was based on years of listening to Canadians 
and an active policy development process. It was a comprehensive 
approach grounded in a realistic perspective on what government 
can do.
<P>
	As we well know by now, one of the commitments we made was 
to strengthen the Employment Equity Act. The old government had 
the information. It knew what needed to happen but it chose not to 
act. We said that it was time to move on this issue and we have with 
Bill C-64.
<P>
	The red book was more than just a series of individual 
commitments. It was based on a sense of how Canada works best. 
Part of that was our understanding that business and government 
are not adversaries. We need each other. Canada needs a strong 
business community. We need an attractive business climate. A 
government that operates in an intelligent and strategic way fosters 
that kind of community in that kind of climate.
<P>
	In essence we let business people do their work without 
reasonable interference from government and we look for ways to 
build productive partnerships. That has been our approach to 
employment equity. We know that voluntary efforts at equity 
simply have not worked, therefore legislation is needed but not 
heavy handed approaches.
<P>
	Many of my colleagues have spoken of the willingness of the 
federally regulated business community to work with us on equity. 
I need not repeat the points they have made. One basic reason they 
are doing so is that we have adopted a human resource planning 
model for this legislation. We have designed this process to 
maximize co-operation. We also designed the process to maximize 
co-operation in the workplace.
<P>
	Unions most certainly do have a place in this process. Unions do 
care. The labour organizations that made  presentations to the 
committee stressed their commitment to social justice. We 
understand their contribution to workplace attitudes toward equity 
programs. We appreciate their concerns about making employment 
equity work well, given issues such as seniority rights.
<P>
	For all those reasons, government members on the committee 
decided to amend the bill, to underline the requirement for 
consultation with bargaining agents. The government understood 
the need to ensure that consultation was real and the bill, as it has 
come to us from committee, requires collaborations.
<P>
	This is an important step. To go further is to make a mistake. To 
require employers to share authority with unions in some kind of 
co-management regime is to blur accountability. At the end of the 
day employers in law and in fact are responsible to the government 
for their achievements in employment equity. Unions are not.
<P>
	The plan we offered to Canadians in 1993 did not envision the 
federal government shaking up the framework of federal labour 
relations. We believe that businesses understand the approach we 
have laid out for employment equity. We also believe they 
understand that getting unions on side makes sense in a human 
resources planning model. We believe that they will pursue 
collaboration in the spirit that is set out in this bill as it is before us 
now.
<P>
	However, the government sees no need to force a process on 
employers that may simply not work for any number of local 
reasons. We hope they will take on partnerships for employment 
equity but we will let them decided based on their own situations. I 
have a great deal of faith that the businesses and federal 
government employers covered by this legislation will see as we 
do. They will capitalize on this opportunity to break down the 
barriers that may deny them the best from their workers or those 
who could be. I think they will do the right thing and they will do it 
in the way that works best.
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	The bill has already moved to underline the need for 
collaboration. It retains the emphasis on employer accountability. 
That is the right balance. It is the approach I will continue to 
support.

<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, those thousands of Canadians watching 
this on television have just seen that we really do earn our keep 
from time to time.
<P>
	The amendment speaks to the fact we live in the land of 
employment equity or affirmative action. Because this is the first 
time today in which we are going to be speaking to Bill C-64, I 
should bring to the attention of those hundreds of thousands of 
Canadians glued to their television sets wondering what is going on 
that this bill is the affirmative action or employment equity bill.
<P>
<B>(1600 )</B>
<P>
	Employment equity is a phrase coined by Judge Abella about 15 
years ago to describe affirmative action because there were people 
who felt that affirmative action really did not find a lot of 
popularity in the land. So we are living with employment equity.
<P>
	Bill C-64 would expand the notion of affirmative action in the 
federal workforce to everyone covered by the Treasury Board and 
to any company in the private sector doing business with the 
Government of Canada with 100 employees or more.
<P>
	On the face of it, who would argue with the notion of affirmative 
action or employment equity-except that employment or any 
advantage or anything in our society based on race or on quotas is 
inherently discriminatory.
<P>
	One of the very first articles in the Canadian Charter of Rights 
and Freedoms speaks to the notion of all Canadians being equal. 
Then the next paragraph says except those Canadians who are in 
specific designated groups and these Canadians may be assisted at 
the expense of the equality of everyone by special advantages. If 
that were not in the charter this amendment would certainly not see 
the light of day, because it would be against the Canadian Charter 
of Rights and Freedoms.
<P>
	That is the kind of anomaly we have to understand and somehow 
work around. Here we have the Canadian Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms which says this kind of discrimination should not exist in 
our land, and then we say we will allow this kind of discrimination. 
The net result is that we have affirmative action laws. We have a 
system whereby people are able to gain promotion or gain 
employment or advantages of some description based on a quota.
<P>
	As members know, today we are speaking to the amendments. 
We are supposed to be keeping our comments closely related to the 
amendment before us. The amendment I am speaking to relates to 
the responsibilities of the compliance officer.
<P>
	We are now living in a country that is under the rule of 
employment equity or affirmative action. That means that certain 
employers, including the federal government, and certainly all of 
the private sector employers who  have 100 employees or more, 
will wake up one day to a knock on the door. The knock on the door 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15228"> 15228 </A></B>
<P>
will be from the compliance officer who is representing the federal 
government. The compliance officer will have significant powers 
to be able to delve into the affairs of the company to see if the 
employer is in compliance with the legislation, and the employer 
must prove it.
<P>
	This is where race questions come in on the forthcoming census. 
This is why the questions about race have to be asked. The 
compliance officer will say that according to the last census, in a 
certain geographic area there are a certain number of green people, 
a certain number of yellow people, a certain number of people who 
speak this language and that language, and therefore the employer 
must employ people in the same proportion as the people in that 
community and they will be given quotas.
<P>
	The employer will say that normally they hire the best people; it 
does not matter who they are or what their education is, what their 
sex is, they are hired on merit. The compliance officer will say they 
will have to take affirmative action into the mix, that they cannot 
just hire on merit any more, they have to look at both of the 
equations. Then the employer says come in and have a look around 
and see what we have.
<P>
	Let us say that in a room there are 20 people working, and every 
one of them is from a visible minority or from some other 
designated group. The compliance officer looks at his list and says 
it says on the sheet that they do not have anybody who 
self-identifies as one of the disadvantaged groups. If you look 
around, my God, everybody in the place is in the designated group.
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
	The problem is that we Canadians do not get up in the morning 
and ask what part of what victim group we are in and look for the 
support of the state to get anywhere in my life, seeking advantages 
that are not common to everybody.
<P>
	In the purview of the House of Commons there are 1,700 
employees. Recently, people were asked to voluntarily identify 
themselves as to what designated group they fall into. Only 50 
people said they fell into one of these designated groups. Only 30 
per cent of the people responded. That is not the kind of people 
Canadians are. We do not respond to that. We do not want a 
constitution or laws based on race. We want laws based on the 
equality of all individuals.
<P>
	In any event, we have this legislation and we have pointed out 
the error, the problem, or the hole in it. The government looked at it 
and very wisely assumed our counsel and said we had a good point.
<P>
	We do not like the legislation and we will vote against it. If we 
can improve it we will try because when we wake up in the 
morning it will be in the driveway.
<P>
	I visited my brother-in-law a few years ago. He was looking at a 
new motorcycle and he had the brochure on the kitchen table. His 
wife came home, saw the brochure, and went ballistic. He asked 
her why she got so mad and she said ``Because the brochure is on 
the kitchen table today and tomorrow the motorcycle will be in the 
driveway''. That is the same story on this legislation. Today the 
brochure is on the table and tomorrow the legislation will be in the 
driveway, and there is nothing we can do about it. The government 
has its massive majority and it is going to push the legislation 
through come hell or high water. We must try to make it better in 
any little way we can.
<P>
	Giving credit where credit is due, the government saw that the 
amendment improved the legislation and it made an amendment 
that improved the amendment we submitted. We end up with better 
legislation, which is how the House works from time to time.
<P>
	I am speaking in support of the amendment, which will make 
this draconian legislation a little less draconian, perhaps a bit 
better. There is a ray of sunshine and light that comes into the 
House from time to time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
thought I would yield to my hon. colleague from Toronto. 
However, I thank her for the privilege.
<P>
	Speaking very briefly to this amendment, I would like to refute 
some of the misinterpretations, though not done with malice, by the 
hon. member.
<P>
	He indicated in his opening remarks that while subsection 15(1) 
talks about the equality of all Canadians, in essence he argued that 
subsection 15(2) negates this by saying that we are not equal 
because of race. That to me is a misinterpretation of the Canadian 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms. I have more faith in the framers, 
fathers, and parents of the Canadian Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms.
<P>
	I think what section 15 tells us is that we should have equal 
benefit and protection of the law, all Canadians on an equal basis, 
irrespective of race, disability, origin, or gender. At the same time, 
subsection 15(2) deals with disadvantaged people, as visible 
minorities may be, people of First Nations origin, women, and 
persons with disabilities.
<P>
	In subsection 15(2) the framers of our charter of rights and 
freedoms were trying to prevent possible dilatory tactics on the part 
of people who would complain that government can introduce 
legislation that will address those very disadvantages. They are not 
being given advantages; they are only being restored to equality. 
They are disadvantaged, so we must restore them to equality. They 
are not being restored to superiority. I think that has to be made 
very clear to all Canadians.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15229"> 15229 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	Therefore subsections 15(1) and (2) demonstrate the ingenuity of 
Canadians.
<P>
	In his opening remarks the hon. member indicated that quota is a 
way of giving advantages. For the same reason, it is not. On a very 
close reading of the bill itself, quota is prohibited. How clear can 
we be? The law as proposed and tabled in the House states that no 
one may impose a quota, not even the enforcement officer. We have 
to forget about this being quotas.
<P>
	Certainly the member in trying to sustain his argument about 
quotas indicated those people in this disadvantaged group are to be 
employed in the proportion they exist in the population in the 
community. That is wrong. That is not what the bill states. The bill 
states that it is in proportion to the available qualified people. Why 
not? Why would one argue against the qualification of others only 
because of colour, disability, origin or gender? The bill states that it 
is in proportion to the number of qualified people, again sustaining 
the principle of equality.
<P>
	On the point of census on race, as I indicated to the media, we 
have nothing to be ashamed of when we are asked that we should 
say that we are Canadians. The census is one taken among 
Canadians. Therefore it is a given that this is a census of 
Canadians. If we are asked about our origins and our heritage, we 
should be proud. I am proud to be a Filipino Canadian. The Jews 
are proud to be Jewish Canadians. Ukrainians are proud because 
they are Canadians as well. We are proud of our heritage. That is 
what our nation has taught us. It has given us self-confidence, 
self-worth and dignity.
<P>
	On the motion itself, I agree with the hon. member that this is an 
example of co-operation taking place in the House. It is also a clear 
example that the government, when it sees a good amendment, tries 
to improve on it and makes it even better. We deal in this 
amendment, which was reached by consensus by all parties in the 
House, with non-fulfilment of the employment equity plan as a 
consequence of a poor identification that is based on 
self-identification.
<P>
	I call to the House's attention that with this improved 
amendment we have also sustained another principle, 
confidentiality. I see the member who originally proposed the 
motion is smiling. I think this is what reconciliation is all about. 
We should be able to have a new principle without killing another 
principle. We should have one principle strengthen the other. Here 
we are preserving the principle of confidentiality.
<P>
	Why does the government agree to this amendment, which was 
also refined by the government? It is because we heard witnesses 
acknowledge the limitations of the self-identification system. 
However, witnesses have also told the committee that we must 
retain the privacy and  confidentiality of information. Obviously, 
we have to reconcile these two views.
<P>
	We were not shown any other method by which to identify 
except by coercion. We agreed at the committee level that coercion 
would do more harm than good. Therefore, in the absence of an 
alternative tool, in the absence of limitation, the committee 
initiated that we should retain the self-identification approach. 
However, at the same time, the committee proposed that there be 
more openness on the part of employers to hold employer and 
employee meetings on a regular basis so that there would be a 
feeling of rapport between employees and employers. At the same 
time information sessions must be held by the employers to inform 
employees of the importance of identifying themselves so we can 
truly monitor the progress of employment equity in a given 
workplace.
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	As well, the committee recommended that managers in those 
businesses be given special training to enable them to be more 
persuasive of the need for self-identification.
<P>
	On the issue of self-identification, in the spirit of this act it is 
very critical that the process be held in a climate or atmosphere of 
trust and confidentiality. It can only be accomplished if we truly 
convince employees that the purpose of self-identification is to 
ensure employment equity in the workplace. Nobody would 
disagree with that kind of approach.
<P>
	On that note, I am pleased we have been able to arrive at the 
motion proposed by the member for Edmonton Southwest that has 
refined by the government. It is a classic example that the 
government always listens to good proposals whether they come 
from the opposition or from its own members.

	He said: Mr. Speaker, for your information, my colleague is Mr. 
Deshaies, and I thank him for supporting the motion.
<P>
	I would simply like to say what it is about. One of the 
innovations in this bill, which has earned the support of the official 
opposition, is that the Canadian Human Rights Commission will be 
made specifically responsible for enforcing the Employment 
Equity Act. No doubt, for those not familiar with employment 
equity, it would be useful to point out that it involves making 
arrangements to ensure that four categories of people in our 
society: women, persons with disabilities, aboriginal peoples and 
members of visible minorities may finally take their rightful place 
in the labour market.
<P>
	One of the means the bill proposes, is obligation, which applies 
to both the private sector and the public sector-making the public 
sector subject to the provisions  of the bill is another one of its 
innovations. This means that, once the bill receives royal assent, 
300,000 other Canadians and Quebecers will be covered by 
employment equity.
<P>
	One of the obligations under this bill is that of preparing an 
employment equity plan, which is to be submitted the following 
June to the director responsible for the program at Human 
Resources Development Canada. It will be up to the Minister of 
Human Resources Development to combine all the plans submitted 
by both the private and public sectors.
<P>
	The reason I say this is very important is because, when plans are 
missing, when an employer fails to submit an employment equity 
plan within the required time period and fails to make all 
reasonable efforts-the expression used in the bill-to achieve the 
employment equity objectives he set for himself, then a course of 
redress is possible. That is where the amendment enters in.
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
	For the first time since the Employment Equity Act was assented 
to, that is since 1986, the human rights commissioner will be able, 
on request and as he sees fit during summary proceedings where 
there has been an admission of guilt, to establish an employment 
equity review tribunal.
<P>
	This is an extremely important body for enforcing the act 
because there is no provision for a right of appeal. The 
commissioner will therefore have the responsibility of creating a 
committee from whose decisions there may be no appeal, as the 
hon. parliamentary secretary who is so fascinated by these 
questions is aware. In other words, decisions will be final and 
binding.
<P>
	The Bloc's amendment, which I believe is a well thought out 
amendment, will certainly gain government support, since this 
government is beginning to feel more and more alone.
<P>
	The amendment will consist in ensuring that the three 
administrative officers called upon to hear the case will come from 
designated groups.
<P>
	We feel that this is important, that there must be a correlation, a 
link, between what it is felt that this act represents and those who 
will be bringing down a decision in one of these administrative 
proceedings.
<P>
	These are the reasons it is so vital for this bill to be amended and 
for the commission members not to be already in the employ of the 
Human Rights Commission. The Human Rights Commission 
employees do a good job, no denying; they are well informed about 
the various statutes concerning human rights, but they have never 
brought down decisions relating to employment equity. We on this 
side of the House would like to see a specific clause in this bill 
devoted to the Human Rights Commission's ability to select from 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15231"> 15231 </A></B>
<P>
among the general  population people to represent women, the 
disabled, visible minorities and of course aboriginal people.
<P>
	We feel that it will be far more worthwhile for this tribunal not to 
require any exceptional procedures and for it to be flexible. The 
only thing that will be exceptional will be the rights of appeal, as I 
have already stated. The principles of natural justice will have to 
apply, but should a tribunal decision be found to have been in error, 
there would still be the possibility of applying for an appeal to be 
heard in the Federal Court of Appeal.
<P>
	Basically, we think it would be useful to amend the bill so that 
the commissioners who sit on these tribunals are members of the 
groups for whom we are trying to ensure representation.
<P>
	I must say I regret, and I say this with my usual frankness, that 
the government was not very receptive to this amendment in 
committee. Now you know my philosophy: I always do everything 
out in the open. I told the government I would introduce an 
amendment, and they have not been very receptive.
<P>
	I hope that between consideration in committee and the debate 
we are having today, the government will have reconsidered, 
because this is supported by representatives of the cultural 
communities who appeared before the committee and by the 
unions.
<P>
	I may recall that this amendment would not involve additional 
expenditures, since in any case, it does not change what the bill 
now prescribes, which is the presence of three commissioners 
whose remuneration shall be paid by the Canadian Human Rights 
Commission.
<P>
<B>(1630)</B>
<P>
	Since the government has maintained the same designation 
procedure and did not feel it was necessary to add another category, 
the groups are still the same, in other words, women, aboriginal 
peoples, persons with disabilities and visible minorities. In 
committee we discussed the relevance of adding a fifth or sixth 
category but concluded that we did not have enough information on 
other groups in society that might experience specific 
discrimination in the workplace.
<P>
	Since the designated groups were maintained and are still 
designated on the basis of self-designation, I think it makes sense 
to take the same approach when administrative authorities are 
asked to hand down rulings, that is, when an employment equity 
review tribunal is appointed.
<P>
	I have the impression, and I say this with the utmost caution, that 
this is also an amendment the Reform Party would like to see. 
Again, and we cannot repeat this often enough, this will not involve 
any additional budgetary expenditures, since the composition of 
the employment equity review tribunal remains the same when a 
tribunal  is established at the request of the human rights 
commissioner, since according to the bill, establishment of a 
tribunal may be requested by either the employer or the Canadian 
Human Rights Commission.
<P>
	We feel this amendment will considerably improve the bill. I 
hope it will receive the support of a majority of the members in this 
House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Vaudreuil, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, let me first 
say that I am proud, as a Quebecer and a Canadian, of the major 
step forward we are about to take in matters of equality and human 
rights with the passing of this bill on employment equity.
<P>
	I would also like to thank our colleague for 
Hochelaga-Maisonneuve for his strong and sincere commitment 
to human rights and to promoting equality and equity for all of 
Canada's citizens.
<P>
	I thank him for his ongoing efforts in this regard, both on the 
Standing Committee on Human Rights and the Status of Disabled 
People and here in the House of Commons. He continues to express 
his commitment with the motions he is putting before the House 
today in order to further improve this bill on employment equity.
<P>
	With the motions we are debating, that is, Motions Nos. 13 and 
14, he is proposing that the people appointed to an employment 
equity review tribunal themselves represent designated groups or 
have knowledge or particular experience in this area.
<P>
	Given the legislation it applies to, the motion is highly justifiable 
in theory. However, it seems fairly clear to us, as some of my 
colleagues have already mentioned, with all due respect to my 
colleague, that it is literally inapplicable in practice. For the 
information of my fellow members, I think it would be useful to 
first look at the nature and the function of this tribunal and to put it 
in the context of the logic of this bill so we can understand when 
and how it intervenes and how it is made up. First, when does it 
intervene?
<P>
	The employment equity review tribunal takes action following 
an intervention by a compliance officer with an employer governed 
by the act. When should a compliance officer audit an employer? 
When there is a need to determine if an employer fulfils his or her 
obligations under the act.
<P>
	Who decides if an audit must be conducted? Again, this decision 
is made by the Canadian Human Rights Commission, to which the 
bill gives the authority to enforce the act and monitor employers' 
compliance.
<P>
	Clause 22 of the bill provides that the commission is responsible 
for the enforcement of the obligations imposed on employers by 
the sections that concern them.
<P>
	The human rights commission determines if a given employer is 
complying with the employment equity requirements outlined in 
the act.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15232"> 15232 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1635)</B>
<P>
	To assume this responsibility, the commission may designate a 
person to conduct compliance audits of employers on its behalf. 
This person is the compliance officer referred to in clause 23. If the 
audit reveals that the employer failed to fulfil any of his or her 
obligations, the compliance officer tries to reach an agreement with 
the employer to implement the corrective measures required.
<P>
	However, if the compliance officer and the employer cannot 
come to an agreement, the commission may order the employer to 
correct the situation. During the time limits set out in clause 27, the 
employer can challenge the commission's decision by asking the 
president of the human rights tribunal panel to conduct a review, 
again under clause 27. As for the commission, it has the same 
recourse if the employer does not comply with its decision within 
the prescribed deadline.
<P>
	It is at this point that, in either case, the employment equity 
review tribunal becomes involved. Under clause 28, the tribunal 
consists of one member of the human rights tribunal panel 
appointed by the president of that panel. In more complex cases, 
the president can appoint a tribunal of three members.
<P>
	The most basic arithmetic shows that the first part of Motions 
Nos. 13 and 14 tabled by the member for 
Hochelaga-Maisonneuve are unnecessary since, in most cases, 
the tribunal would consist of only one person. Indeed, we cannot 
see how a single person could represent designated groups in a 
proportion that reflects their representation in the Canadian 
population as a whole.
<P>
	The member supports his argument by saying that the tribunal 
will often consist of more than one member if Motion No. 12 is 
carried, in addition to those cases where the president will deem 
appropriate to appoint three people. But again, the number of 
members would still be too small to ensure significant 
representation of designated groups.
<P>
	Even if we implement the idea of a degree of representation for 
designated groups, we will unnecessarily complicate the already 
complex task of the president of the panel, while also, in some 
cases, casting a doubt regarding the impartiality of this judicial 
process. In short, that part of the motion would create more 
problems than it would solve.
<P>
	The second part of the motion is definitely more reasonable and 
easier to implement. It provides that, in the opinion of the 
president, the persons appointed as members of an employment 
equity review tribunal are highly knowledgeable about 
employment equity, or have substantial experience in this area. The 
government has already said it agrees with that idea. The standing 
committee which reviewed the bill passed an amendment requiring 
that, when appointing tribunals, the president  of the panel take into 
account the knowledge and experience of people in the area of 
employment equity.
<P>
	I believe that the amendment proposed by the committee is quite 
similar to the one tabled by the hon. member for 
Hochelaga-Maisonneuve. Moreover, the same clause, 
specifically clause 28(7), provides that the president of the panel 
may hire persons having technical or special knowledge to assist or 
advise a tribunal. Clearly, the bill already provides sufficient 
guarantees that the tribunal will rely on sound knowledge in the 
area of employment equity. Consequently, in my opinion, the 
amendment proposed by the hon. member is absolutely not 
necessary.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Before recognizing the hon. member for 
London-Middlesex, it is my duty to inform the House that the 
questions to be raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as 
follows: the hon. member for The Battlefords-Meadow 
Lake-Indian Affairs.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pat O'Brien (London-Middlesex, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
begin my remarks by thanking the hon. member for 
Hochelaga-Maisonneuve for his proposed amendment. Clearly he 
has heard an argument that was made during the hearings of the 
committee that he believes has merit. Having said that, I will not 
vote in favour of his amendment. I believe the essential goal of the 
amendment has already been captured in the change which the 
committee made to Bill C-64.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	The standing committee achieved the appropriate balance in the 
legislation. It responded to the essence of the points it heard on the 
issue. It did so in a way that is consistent with the spirit of the bill. 
There are many practical reasons why going further simply will not 
work.
<P>
	We have often heard that justice must not only be done, it must 
be seen to be done. That should apply in the work of the new 
employment equity review tribunals. If we want the system to work 
as well as it must, then we should want the most competent persons 
to hear cases.
<P>
	That becomes even more important when we understand how 
complex the cases that will come before these tribunals can be. 
They will often involve equity and human rights considerations. 
They will consider real world business practices and human 
resource management approaches. They will involve a careful 
assessment and balancing of needs and priorities. That demands a 
reasonable level of expertise in the members of a tribunal. Yet, as 
many witnesses pointed out, some members of the Canadian 
human rights tribunal panel have not necessarily had any real 
knowledge of employment equity issues in the past. They have not 
necessarily come in to cases with any expertise in workplace 
issues.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15233"> 15233 </A></B>
<P>
	Some employer and labour representatives said this was no 
place for on the job training and yet that is what they have seen. 
They cited examples in which the individuals hearing cases clearly 
knew far less than the people appearing before them. The result 
was frustration, added cost and some doubt as to whether a truly 
just decision could be rendered. In the same vein, representatives 
of designated groups saw a need for tribunal members who were 
truly aware of their situation. They were concerned that tribunal 
members would not understand the barrier they faced and the need 
for action.
<P>
	When we look at the committee's report we see that witnesses 
offered many suggestions on how to improve this state of affairs. 
This proposed amendment draws on some of those ideas.
<P>
	The committee took a different course. I think it was a better 
course. It chose to amend Bill C-64 by requiring the president of 
the Canadian human rights tribunal panel to give due consideration 
to the expertise of individuals he or she might appoint to 
employment equity review tribunals. That amendment would give 
the president of the panel a clear direction without tying his or her 
hands.
<P>
	In a way, that decision is consistent with the direction of the 
entire bill. The emphasis is on reasonable efforts to place qualified 
people in this role. It does not set a quota. It does not incorporate 
the labour relations based model into the process. It does not 
assume that there should be representatives of perspectives that are 
in probable opposition to each other. Moreover, it permits a flexible 
approach where appropriate. The goal is to appoint tribunal 
members who understand the issues and who can rule on them 
fairly.
<P>
	Not only are there sound philosophical reasons for the House to 
support the committee's approach and to reject the amendment, 
there are sound practical reasons to do so as well. One of the most 
important pertains to the size of the tribunals. Tribunals do not 
have seven or nine people on them who can be chosen to fill certain 
quota needs. A tribunal will have either three or just one person.
<P>
	If three persons are hearing a case, and that was the preference of 
the committee as hon. members may recall, how will the 
representation issues be resolved? That problem becomes 
unsolvable if a one person tribunal is established. Hon. members 
should remember that one person tribunals may often be appointed 
in less complex cases. In those instances, representation of 
designated groups, expertise and experience simply cannot be 
achieved in a fashion that most people will see as fair.
<P>
	Clearly it is not possible to make a system of proportional 
representation work well for three people and it simply cannot 
work for one person. It is far better to concentrate on expertise and 
experience. In any event, representation is taking care of itself.
<P>
	When Keith Norton, the president of the Canadian human rights 
tribunal panel, appeared before the standing committee he agreed 
that the tribunal should have membership from all walks of life. It 
would be similar to what we see happening across the judiciary. It 
is growing more and more representative of society all the time.
<P>
	The committee has done its work and has done it very well. I 
commend its members for that work. Because of that direction I do 
not think we should support this amendment.
<P>

	The House resumed from June 5 consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réginald Bélair (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
a pleasure for me to rise in the House tonight to speak on Motion 
M-292 which reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should consider 
implementing a new program of mining incentives which would encourage 
exploration and development in Canada.</BLOCKQUOTE>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	But before going any further, I would to state some very 
important facts, for the benefit of our viewers. First of all, Canada 
is the third largest mining country in the world, extracting about 60 
metals and minerals, including zinc, uranium, potash and gold. The 
mining industry provides employment for approximately 335,000 
Canadians in 150 communities. Mining companies in Northern 
Ontario have created 18,000 direct jobs in the metal industry and 
5,000 in the non metallic minerals industry. I am very proud to say 
that the Williams mine, in Marathon, in the riding of 
Cochrane-Superior, is the largest gold mine in Canada.
<P>
	There are however many barriers to the survival of the mining 
industry. First of all, mining exploration is a temporary land use 
that disrupts small areas for a very short time period. Once the 
mineral deposit is depleted, cleanup procedures are undertaken and 
land can be used for other purposes. Unfortunately, land use issues 
are fraught with uncertainty because of the development of new 
parks and native land claims, some of which are being negotiated 
as we speak.
<P>
	The industry is facing new difficulties since countries like Chile, 
Argentina and Mexico are upgrading their economies and taking 
steps to attract mining exploration and, thus, investors.
<P>
<B>(1740)</B>
<P>
	In 1993, Canadian companies with budgets over $1 million 
invested nearly $260 million, or half their budgets, in exploration 
outside of Canada. This represents an increase over 1992, when 
these companies devoted 40 percent of their exploration budgets 
abroad.
<P>
	Why is that? First of all, at the natural resources committee 
hearings last year, the Canadian mining industry had a lot to say 
about stringent environmental standards-that is the first 
problem-and the slow licensing process as well. The second 
problem is non-unionized labour in Latin America and Mexico. 
Because of this, wages are extremely low; also, the standard of 
living is lower in these countries than here. Investors enjoy a much 
higher return on their investments over there than in Canada.
<P>
	Since the licensing and environmental assessment processes are 
under federal and provincial jurisdiction, they are characterized by 
duplication and delay. We need at least $900 million to $1 billion a 
year in exploration capital in Canada to rebuilt our ore reserves 
which have dropped dangerously.
<P>
	We must bear in mind that, from 1990 to 1994, while 44 mines 
shut down operations in Canada, only 24 were opened.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	If we want mining exploration to continue and to keep investors 
interested, there should be incentives from the government. We 
need a new program of mining incentives that will encourage 
exploration and development, encourage Canadian companies to 
keep investing in their country. That will permit the industry to 
help stabilize the economy and create employment.
<P>
	Last year, as I mentioned a while ago, the committee for natural 
resources issued a report after its very long hearings. The report 
says:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Canada needs to remove existing structural impediments to the achievement 
of a sound mineral investment climate. These have been identified as: the tax 
burden on the industry, particularly the one imposed by non-profit taxes; the 
inefficiencies of the current environmental regulatory regime; and the 
uncertainty surrounding land use policies and security to mineral title.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Another recommendation coming from the report is that the 
government has to work with mining communities and the 
provincial governments to establish those crucial partnerships to 
work together to ensure that we have a viable mining industry in 
Canada.
<P>
	There is a great need for the harmonization of environmental 
guidelines. As it is today, the federal government's guidelines 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15240"> 15240 </A></B>
<P>
differ from those of many of the  provinces. This simply adds 
complexity to opening new mines.
<P>
	The mining companies are not asking for grants but they want a 
level playing field and a tax system that is truly competitive with 
the rest of the world. There should be security of land tenure and a 
certainty of continuity in the rules of the game in terms of issuing 
permits and doing environmental assessments.
<P>
	After extensive hearings the Standing Committee on Natural 
Resources have recommended nine key points on mining 
incentives. These points were also present in the Whitehorse 
mining initiative report.
<P>
	I would like to emphasize a few of those recommendations. 
First, change the adjusted cost base of flowthrough shares from 
zero to the actual costs of the shares for five years only, to kickstart 
mining exploration again.
<P>
	Flowthrough shares would provide a less costly means of raising 
equity based financing for exploration and development by 
facilitating a widespread share issue. Flowthrough shares allow 
access to a broad range of investors while minimizing the impact 
on corporate management and control.
<P>
<B>(1745 )</B>
<P>
	Second, there should also be harmonization in the federal and 
provincial environmental guidelines. Co-operation agreements 
should be established among the jurisdictions for the development, 
administration and enforcement of environmental standards to 
improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the regulatory system 
and to reduce unnecessary industry regulatory compliance costs.
<P>
	A new mining project should be subject to only one timely 
environmental assessment by a single lead agency with only one 
set of recommendations that meet all the requirements. We should 
try to conciliate conserving the environment with the creation of 
employment.
<P>
	Third, we should amend the Income Tax Act to defer taxation of 
income generated by mine reclamation trusts until the funds within 
these trusts are finally allocated for reclamation purposes. 
Reclamation funds should be treated also like RRSPs.
<P>
	Therefore I support Motion No. 292 by my colleague from 
Timiskaming. I insist at the same time that we should provide a 
newer direction for our mining industry and ensure that it continues 
to make a strong contribution to the Canadian economy.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I would like, first of all, to thank or congratulate the 
hon. member for Timiskaming-French River for tabling this 
motion, and introducing it in the House on June 5 of this year. This 
motion reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should consider 
implementing a new program of mining incentives which would encourage 
exploration and development in Canada.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	When he talked on his motion, the hon. member mentioned in 
this House that in the area of mining, there was a substantial 
increase in exploration throughout Canada in 1994. However, this 
is not the opinion expressed by the Association des prospecteurs du 
Québec in a letter dated March 30, addressed to the Minister of 
Finance.
<P>
	The letter said in particular that the government does not seem to 
realize that there is presently in Canada a lack of exploration which 
is mortgaging the future of the whole Canadian mining industry. 
The letter also said that it was urgent to try to replenish our mineral 
reserves. If we neglect to do that it will have an impact on a whole 
economic activity which is directly or indirectly connected with the 
mining and smelting industry in Canada.
<P>
	I would like to say that we should make a distinction between 
mining exploration itself, where there was substantial growth in 
1994 compared to 1993, and activities dependant on mining 
exploration, which also grew in 1994. We should mention, 
however, that despite this strong growth, we are a long way from 
the levels which existed in the early 1980s.
<P>
	This being said, we can realize the scope of what the hon. 
member for Timiskaming-French River was saying and I quote: 
``Despite this, major problems and impediments still exist to a 
sound and sustainable mining sector in this country.'' It is in this 
context that the hon. member was asking the House to press the 
government to implement a program of incentives which would 
encourage exploration and development in the mining sector in 
Canada.
<P>
	Of course, there is no reason why we should oppose this motion, 
even though it seems to be nothing but an expression of intent. 
However, assuming that the House of Commons agrees to this 
motion at the time of the vote, what will it give us that we do not 
have already?
<P>
	The problem is not that Motion M-292 is inappropriate, but that 
it is not sufficient to solve the mining problem in Canada. In its 
report on the Canadian mining industry that was tabled before 
Parliament in December 1994, the standing committee on natural 
resources made a series of recommendations that all committee 
members, whatever their party affiliation, agreed on.
<P>
	Of these recommendations, there are two that I will now outline 
for you. First, recommendation No. 3 which says: ``That the federal 
government introduce a mineral exploration incentive by 
modifying the Income Tax Act to incorporate a change in the 
adjusted cost base of flow-through shares from a value of zero to 
the actual cost of the shares''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15241"> 15241 </A></B>
<P>
	Then, recommendation No. 4, which everybody agreed on: 
``That in order to enhance the effectiveness of exploration work 
financed by means of flow-through shares, the feral government 
enable the exploration activity funded through such shares to be 
carried out over a period of one full year after financing''.
<P>
<B>(1750)</B>
<P>
	The problem with the motion of the member for 
Timiskaming-French River is that, as it stands currently, it would 
do nothing concrete to stimulate mining exploration. It would be 
insufficient in itself to ensure implementation of the 
recommendations of the standing committee on natural resources, 
that the hon. member moving this motion is a member of.
<P>
	If I brought to the attention of the House the committee 
recommendations that deal with flow-through shares, it is because 
my colleague from Abitibi also moved before Parliament a motion, 
Motion M-247, that has the same objective as Motion M-292, but 
would have a more obvious impact on mining exploration.
<P>
	I do not intend to deal at length with the motion moved by my 
hon. colleague from Abitibi, but rather on the one moved by the 
hon. member for Timiskaming-French River. However, since 
both motions are very similar, I think it is relevant to speak to both. 
I would like to indicate that members of the Bloc Quebecois will 
support motion M-292 inasmuch as it does not work at cross 
purposes with motion M-427 which we will also all support.
<P>
	I will not dwell at length on the positive impact tax incentives 
could have on the mining industry, since my colleague from Abitibi 
covered that very well, but I would like to mention that this kind of 
incentive has proved to be useful in Quebec, and more particularly 
so with small mining companies, which have a positive impact on 
local economies through their exploration operations.
<P>
	The hon. member for Timiskaming-French River has given lots 
of figures, which my colleague opposite repeated a moment ago, to 
demonstrate the importance of mining in Canada and describe the 
Canadian position in mining exploration throughout the world in 
several sectors.
<P>
	Despite all those figures, the government does not seem to get 
the point that the mining industry is one of the strongest 
foundations of the Canadian economy and deserves more than lip 
service. If motion M-292 carries, it will have a positive impact 
because we will at least know which way the government is 
heading as regards the development of our mining industry. And if 
the motion of the hon. member for Abitibi is agreed to, the mining 
industry will be able to know how the government intends to reach 
its goal.
<P>
	In the time remaining, I would like to comment on statements 
made by the hon. member for Fraser Valley  East in reaction to 
remarks made by the hon. member for Abitibi on his motion. The 
hon. member for Fraser Valley East said among other things, and I 
quote:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``I am surprised and I might almost say astonished that this 
particular motion would come from the hon. member for Abitibi''. 
Let me paraphrase what he says. He says that he wants the federal 
government to pour money into subsidies for industry in Canada 
and in Quebec.
<P>
	My colleague did not seem to understand the difference that 
exists between a federalist in Quebec and a sovereignist. A 
federalist in Quebec effectively always asks for more power and 
money. Sovereignists in Quebec do not want that at all. They want 
all the power and no money. We fully understand that being a 
minority in a majority means that we will fight forever, day after 
day, for bits of power and morsels of rights. We do not want bits of 
power and morsels of rights. We want all the power and all the 
rights. However, as long as we are in Confederation we will ask for 
our fair share of the federal expenses.
<P>
	I will quote again the hon. member for Fraser Valley East who 
said: ``I am surprised because the hon. member for Abitibi is a 
member of the Bloc Quebecois which, as we all know, is a political 
party with only one purpose and that is to destroy Canada as we 
know it by taking Quebec out of Confederation''. That is a very 
strange affirmation.
<P>
	Most Canadians actually believe, concerning Quebec of course, 
that we are a bunch of troublemakers, that we receive much more 
money from Canada than we put in, and that if the economic 
situation in Canada goes bad it is partly due to the political 
instability in Quebec. If those three assumptions are right and if 
people really believe them, the sovereignty of Quebec should be 
seen by most Canadians as a good way to solve a problem once and 
for all and save money, providing that we assume our fair share of 
the Canadian debt. That is exactly what we intend to do.
<P>
	We are not a problem; we are the solution to a problem. If the no 
vote wins in Quebec we are back to square one. It will be 15 years 
of political debate to the next referendum, and I am sure nobody 
wants that. We do not want to destroy Canada. We simply think that 
Canadians should be able to run their country the way they want, 
without having to please Quebec at each moment, and that Quebec 
should be allowed to do the same.
<P>
<B>(1755)</B>
<P>
	My friend from Fraser Valley East continued: ``I hope the 
member understands that people from my riding are frustrated by 
this kind of behaviour''. I am frustrated too. I fully understand 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15242"> 15242 </A></B>
<P>
what frustration means,  but the only way to put an end to that 
frustration is to support the sovereignty of Quebec.
<P>
	A certain amount of Canadians believe that we are sovereignists 
because we hate Canadians. This is absolutely not true. We love 
Canadians but love has absolutely nothing to do with politics. I 
love my father very much; that is love. However I would never let 
my father run my business; that is politics.
<P>
	Personally I have worked everywhere in Canada: Edmonton, 
Toronto, southern Ontario, Regina, Saskatchewan and Saint John, 
New Brunswick. I have also worked in the United States: Texas, 
Florida, West Point and New York. I fully agree with the Prime 
Minister of Canada. If I were an immigrant from anywhere in the 
world trying to find a new country in which to live, Canada would 
be my first choice. However I am not an immigrant trying to find a 
new country in which to live. I already have a country. My country 
is Quebec.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robert Bertrand (Pontiac-Gatineau-Labelle, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to rise today to speak on the motion 
put forward by my colleague, the hon. member for 
Timiskaming-French River, which urges the government to 
consider implementing incentives to promote mining exploration 
and development in Canada.
<P>
	Canada extends over some 10 million square kilometres and is 
one of the richest countries in the world in terms of natural 
resources. Its mining industry was ranked amongst the best in the 
world in many areas of mineral production. Mining has always 
played a major role in the Canadian economy, which is hardly 
surprising, since Canada is one of the biggest producers and 
exporters of non-fuel mineral resources.
<P>
	Statistics for 1992 show that the non-fuel mineral resources 
industry accounted for a little over 4 per cent of the Gross 
Domestic Product and almost 3 per cent of employment. Also, 
these statistics indicate that the total value of the non-fuel mineral 
resources production for 1992 reach $14.6 billion, which is 41 per 
cent of overall mineral production in Canada. It is important, also, 
to remember that Canada produces a little over 60 minerals. Except 
for phosphorus, manganese, bauxite and chrome, our country can 
meet its own needs in terms of minerals.
<P>
	Statistics on exploration also speak volumes. Non-fuel mineral 
resources exports reached $23 billion, a little over 15 per cent of 
total exports for Canada. During the same period, the value of our 
non-fuel mineral resources imports was estimated at $13.2 billion, 
for a trade surplus of over $9.8 billion. All these statistics reflect 
the outstanding progress made by the Canadian mining industry.
<P>
	Technological innovation also has something to do with the 
boom enjoyed by this industry. However, the  industry did not 
escape from the upheaval caused by the recession during the late 
1980s and the early 1990s. Mining was hard hit during this period. 
But since 1993, it is recovering nicely. All of us in this House 
recognize that several irritants are still preventing Canada's mining 
industry from hitting its stride.
<P>
<B>(1800)</B>
<P>
	This is why I wholeheartedly support the motion put forward by 
the hon. member for Timiskaming-French River, whom I wish to 
congratulate for this excellent initiative, especially since my hon. 
colleague showed, in the eloquent speech he made when he 
introduced his motion, that he is very much aware of the current 
codition of federal finances.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This motion has nothing to do with tax breaks, grants, or 
subsidies. Its only goal is to bring the government to consider 
measures that would not cost a lot of money to the Canadian 
taxpayer but will go a long way to ensure a brighter future to the 
Canadian mining industry and to the mining communities across 
Canada.
<P>
	In its report of December 1994 entitled ``Lifting Canadian 
Mining Off the Rocks'', the House of Commons Standing 
Committee on Natural Resources proposed nine recommendations. 
Some of those recommendations would cost money if 
implemented, while others would emphasize collaboration and 
partnership that would alleviate some problems for the industry. 
Here are some of the recommendations.
<P>
	Recommendation number three: ``That the federal government 
introduce a mineral exploration incentive by modifying the Income 
Tax Act to incorporate a change in the adjusted cost base of flow 
through shares from a value of zero to the actual cost of the shares, 
that this new fiscal measure incorporate a cap on a given 
company's take-up of the tax benefit, and that the new incentive 
vehicle be in place for a maximum duration of five years''.
<P>
	Recommendation number four: ``That in order to enhance the 
effectiveness of exploration work financed by means of flow 
through shares, the federal government enable the exploration 
activity funded through such shares to be carried out over a period 
of one full year after financing''.
<P>
	Recommendation number seven: ``That once initial steps have 
been taken to improve the investment climate in Canadian mining, 
the federal government, its provincial and territorial counterparts, 
and the domestic mining industry develop through consultation an 
integrated approach to communicate the positive features of the 
Canadian mining sector to potential investors''.
<P>
	In May 1995 the Minister of Natural Resources responded very 
favourably to the report of the Standing Committee on Natural 
Resources on mining. She stated:  ``The Government of Canada 
remains committed to fostering a modern environmentally respon-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15243"> 15243 </A></B>
<P>
sible mining industry that contributes significantly to Canada's 
economic growth and job creation. We are committed to ensuring 
in conjunction with provincial governments and the Canadian 
mining industry that there is a positive environment for investment 
in mineral exploration in Canada''.
<P>
	A month earlier, in Miami, Florida, at the Investing in the 
Americas Conference, the Minister of Natural Resources stated in 
her speech to the conference: ``The Government of Canada 
recognizes the importance of the mining industry, its contribution 
to economic growth and jobs, and the challenges it faces''.
<P>
	During the last Canadian federal election the Liberal Party of 
Canada was the only political party to release a detailed policy 
outlining its commitment to the mining industry. This commitment 
has not wavered. We are proud of our mining industry and we 
believe its present and future prospects are excellent.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	From the statements made by the Minister of Natural Resources, 
one can only conclude that the federal government is acting in good 
faith in this matter and, particularly, that it is prepared to help the 
mining industry, in co-operation with all the other stakeholders.
<P>
	It even seems fairly clear that our government is already 
responding to the request made in today's motion, with the 
intention of keeping government initiatives in the mining industry 
in line with the present fiscal situation.
<P>
	This approach was clearly expressed in the response the 
government gave to the fifth report of the Standing Committe on 
Natural Resources entitled ``Lifting Canadian Mining off the 
Rocks'', which was tabled in the House by the hon. Anne 
McLellan, Minister of Natural Resources, on May 8, and I quote: 
``While mining remains a priority of this government, budgetary 
conditions also require that new ways be sought to deliver quality 
programs and services at a lower cost. To this end, the federal 
approach will be to exercise a role that complements that of the 
provinces and provides a national co-ordination capacity, where 
required, so that government policies and strategies have the most 
favourable impact on mining in Canada''.
<P>
<B>(1805)</B>
<P>
	Heads of the mining industry in Canada are quite aware that the 
federal government cannot do it all on its own and offer a miracle 
cure for the ills of the mining industry. However, they can count on 
the federal government's cooperation and total support.
<P>
	Already in 1994, in its action plan entitled <I>Building a More 
Innovative Economy</I>, the federal government had announced its 
intention to implement a number of  measures concerning the 
regulations governing the climate for investors. Improvements are 
being considered in the following areas: decisions regarding land 
use; definition of garbage and recycling; regulatory systems north 
of the 60th parallel; better evaluation of environmental and 
economic factors in the review of the impact of new regulations-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Unfortunately, the member's time has 
now expired.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as a former prospector and mining consultant I am 
especially pleased at this opportunity to comment on Motion No. 
292.
<P>
	Hon. members should be concerned that after adjusting for 
inflation, domestic mining exploration expenditures for 1992, 
valued at $385 million, were at the lowest levels since 1967. 
Despite increases in the past two years, they remain substantially 
below levels of the $800 million yearly it will take to maintain 
required reserves.
<P>
	It is painfully obvious that mineral exploration and therefore the 
Canadian mining industry is in serious trouble. The question of 
course is what do we do to correct this sorry fact.
<P>
	I want to ask my hon. colleagues what they think makes 
prospectors like myself tramp around in the bush for months on end 
looking for solid indications that a chunk of northern Ontario 
muskeg and rock or a Windy Craggy on the mountainside in British 
Columbia has enough concentration of minerals that it could be 
developed into an economically viable mine.
<P>
	Men like me go prospecting in the Canadian bush because we 
love it. Bad weather and tough living conditions do not stop us. 
Worried mothers or lonesome housewives do not stop us. Not even 
the low prices of the minerals we are seeking can stop us, because 
we know the world needs those minerals and it will only be a 
matter of time before prices rebound to profitable levels.
<P>
	Only one thing has stopped me and other prospectors in Canada, 
the irrational, short-sighted, muddle-headed, counterproductive, 
feeble-minded policies of the federal Government of Canada: 
outrageous taxes, conflicting rules, red tape so endless that it 
routinely takes three years to get environmental approval for a new 
mine in Canada, compared to six months in countries like Chile and 
elsewhere else in the world.
<P>
	Let me spell out some details regarding what I have labelled as 
outrageous taxes. I want to be perfectly clear that I believe that 
everybody who is making more than they need to live decently 
should pay taxes. That includes profitable mining companies. 
However, Canadian businesses and industry must face a host of 
taxes that are not based on profit.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15244"> 15244 </A></B>
<P>
	One glaring example is tax imposed on gasoline, an absolute 
necessity for mine exploration. Taxes account for half of our 
Canadian costs for gasoline. This government recently increased 
that tax by another half a cent per litre. That is a tax that must 
be paid regardless of whether a mining company is in full or 
profitable production or merely struggling to complete its first 
program of diamond drilling.
<P>
	By contrast, Mexico, our partner in the North American free 
trade agreement, is far more realistic about what gas taxes can do to 
their economy. In Canadian cents per Canadian litre of gasoline 
during 1994, Canada's base price for gasoline was 26 cents, 
whereas Mexico's base price was 44.5 cents. Yes, that is right, 
Mexican gasoline, excluding tax, was nearly 20 cents a litre more 
than our price. The Mexican government taxes gasoline like the 
essential commodity it is, rather than following the wrong headed 
policy of the Canadian government, which zaps consumers and 
businesses by doubling the price by the time it reaches the gas 
pump.
<P>
<B>(1810)</B>
<P>
	The final result for 1994 was that our NAFTA partner had 
gasoline prices of 48.9 cents a litre versus the Canadian average of 
52.2 cents a litre. That is a big difference.
<P>
	The federal government for the past many years has taxed 
gasoline like it was champagne in order to pay for high spending 
federal programs that allow the federal government to meddle in 
every sector of our economy, including direct grants to businesses 
and industry, which still cannot make Canadian costs competitive. 
Compared to our new NAFTA partner, that is the kind of thing I 
mean when I say that it is the muddle-headed contrary federal 
government policies that have stopped mining exploration in 
Canada.
<P>
	Another example of outrageous taxation is the application of the 
large corporation tax to mining companies that may have only one 
mine they are struggling to bring into production. Still another tax I 
believe is wrong taxes the interest on money that mining 
companies must place in trust to ensure proper clean-up of the 
environment in the form of mine reclamation funds. When a mine 
starts up the principal has to raise a fortune in preproduction costs. 
Part of that cost is setting aside sufficient funds to ensure that the 
environment is returned to a safe and useable condition when the 
mine shuts down. Creation of the mine reclamation trust fund is 
being legislated by the provinces, but the federal government is 
requiring even single mining operations just getting started to treat 
the interest from the mine reclamation fund as annual income and 
to pay tax on it right from the first year. Instead, I believe mine 
reclamation funds should be treated like an RRSP.
<P>
	Another way in which the present tax system is unfair to mining 
development lies in the treatment of shares. I  am very much in 
favour of flow through shares, especially for non-diversified or 
junior mining companies, which may not have revenue against 
which they can use the deductions available. It is good to let 
deductions available at the front end flow through the investor who 
just buys the shares, but I see no justification for requiring that the 
adjusted cost base of those same flowthrough shares must be 
regarded as zero, whereas the adjusted cost base for other shares is 
the actual cost of those shares.
<P>
	The hon. member from the Bloc Quebecois has looked at the 
national mining industry, which despite these awful federal 
policies managed to create $16.34 billion of total mineral 
production in the year of 1992, $15 billion for 1993, and $16.29 
billion for 1994. Even though the hon. member claims he wants to 
get out of Canada, he is proposing that the federal government 
introduce a new program of mining incentives to encourage 
prospectors to return from countries such as Chile, Brazil, 
Indonesia, and wherever else Canadian prospectors have found 
government policies they can live with.
<P>
	The last thing a prospector wants is yet another batch of federal 
red tape to try to figure out. What is basically wrong with 
government starting such an incentive program? For one thing, 
governments cannot predict very accurately when the international 
price of gold or any other mineral may suddenly climb 
substantially.
<P>
	In 1983 the price of gold was $350 U.S. per troy ounce, and 
mining exploration was relatively flat. In 1985 the Tory 
government introduced the $100,000 lifetime capital gains 
deduction. In 1987 gold was selling for $500 U.S. per troy ounce. 
Throw in the additional government incentives like the mining 
exploration depletion allowance, and small wonder that in 1987 
over $1.2 billion was poured into mining and mineral exploration 
here in Canada. It went predominantly to precious metals rather 
than the base metals, which are more essential to our economy.
<P>
	Who can say whether the policies of flow through shares, the 
lifetime capital gains deduction, the increased price of gold, or the 
MEDA program was responsible for the influx of the exploration 
dollars in the mid-1980s?
<P>
	Government programs are by their very nature crude tools. 
Communist countries learned that they cannot entrust management 
of their economies to some central brain trust. It is far better to 
make as few government rules as is consistent with ensuring 
sustainable resource development and generally leave the field of 
natural resources to provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
<B>(1815 )</B>
<P>
	Another significant factor preventing people from investing in 
Canada today is our many conflicting rules, especially regarding 
the environment. The Reform Party believes that environmental 
concerns must be part of sustainable resource development right 
from the initial  planning stages. We see absolutely no valid reason 
that federal and provincial regulations should not be harmonized 
right across Canada. Instead, the present federal Minister of the 
Environment has scuttled harmonization negotiations with the 
Council of Canadian Ministers of the Environment because she 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15245"> 15245 </A></B>
<P>
wants to be the star performer instead of merely a member of the 
chorus.
<P>
	The 1993 report of the Committee on Competitiveness of the 
Resource Industries pointed out:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The applicant has no way of knowing at the onset of the approval process 
what the regulations will be, the amount of time that the approval process will 
take, what it will ultimately cost, or what the outcome will finally be.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I definitely agree. It is time for government to get its act 
together.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Steckle (Huron-Bruce, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to rise this evening and speak in support of Motion 
No. 292 which was put forward by my colleague, the hon. member 
for Timiskaming-French River.
<P>
	The hon. member and I have much in common when it comes to 
sport shooting and matters pertaining to our great Canadian 
outdoors. We also share similar views when it comes to mining 
issues.
<P>
	I congratulate my government colleague for submitting this 
motion to the House. Mining is a very important activity in 
northern Ontario. It is crucial to the economy there as well as in 
many other areas. Also, the fact that he is representing his 
constituents' concerns really matters. It should be the first and 
most important duty for us all.
<P>
	As a member from southwestern Ontario, home of Canada's 
largest salt mine, I am pleased to speak in favour of the motion. I 
too recognize the importance of mining to the Canadian economy. 
The motion states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should consider 
implementing a new program of mining incentives which would encourage 
exploration and development in Canada.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is certainly consistent with our red book. I refer to the 
October 15, 1993 mining policy announced by the hon. member for 
Sudbury, who is now the Minister of Health. She stated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The mining industry is a vital part of the Canadian economy. Not only is it the 
lifeblood of over 150 communities, but it accounts for 330,000 jobs. A Liberal 
government will offer the leadership needed to ensure a strong future for 
Canadian mining.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	One of the recommendations made in this policy is a direct 
connection to today's motion. Our policy proposed to undertake a 
comprehensive review of income tax laws with provincial and 
territorial governments, industry and other interested parties to 
ensure that the financial assurance mechanisms are complemented 
by federal tax policies and to provide policy support to help mining 
and mineral service industries expand their competitive advantage 
in foreign markets.
<P>
	This is an important motion, especially in light of today's 
condition of the mining industry. It is facing a future of uncertainty. 
Public policy initiatives are needed to sustain the industry as a 
world class producer of mineral and metal products and to 
stimulate investment in mineral exploration and development in 
Canada.
<P>
	I speak of an industry which accounts for 2.7 per cent of total 
national employment, one in which depleting reserves and mine 
closures outnumber mine openings, one which represents $23.6 
billion or 17 per cent of total Canadian exports, and one which 
contributed $10.8 billion to the mineral trade balance. It is an 
industry in which the total value of mineral production was $14.6 
billion, or $35.4 billion if fuel minerals were added. It is an 
industry which represents one of the highest industrial wages paid 
in Canada: $847 per week in some of Canada's most isolated 
communities.
<P>
	As a result of these challenges, we need an enhanced 
commitment from the federal government especially in the area of 
exploration stimulation which will attract sufficient levels of 
exploration investment to ensure that the economic growth rate and 
the level of Canadian mineral reserves will not continue to decline.
<P>
	Our mining industry is a world leader in technology innovation 
and information. We must always strive to keep it that way. As 
members know, mineral exploration and for nearly a decade 
mineral reserves have been on a decline as the developing world 
attracts mineral investment away from Canada. They do this 
through aggressive marketing, joint ventures and legislative and 
policy changes.
<P>
<B>(1820)</B>
<P>
	The competitiveness of Canadian mining in the 1990s is plagued 
by uncertainty. There are disincentives now in the mineral 
investment climate that are discouraging proper investment levels 
which are needed to maintain a reserve base.
<P>
	These factors include mineral taxation, exploration incentives, 
environmental assessment, land access, aboriginal land claims, 
mine reclamation deductions and security of mineral tenure. The 
mineral potential in Canada is as inviting as any other country in 
the world. However we cannot maintain our position as a world 
leader among mineral-producing nations unless steps are taken to 
reduce the doubts.
<P>
	I am sure all members from both sides of the House understand 
full well the implications of inadequate incentives for primary 
mineral exploration. Without ample exploration the mineral 
reserves necessary to replace what is being mined today will not be 
found. For many reasons, exploration levels have dropped 
dramatically since the mid-1980s. We all realize there is no quick 
fix for this problem nor do governments currently have the 
financial capacity to intervene in a significant way.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15246"> 15246 </A></B>
<P>
	Along with an exploration incentive program as called for in 
the votable motion being debated today, there also must be an 
overall competitive and supportive investment climate. This will 
create the proper framework in which mining can thrive and this 
will in turn promote exploration.
<P>
	We must work hard to find solutions. We must work hard to keep 
mining in Canada. While world demand for minerals is increasing, 
Canada's share of world mineral supply is declining and mining 
investment capital is leaving Canada for other parts of the world.
<P>
	The mining industry has worked hard to reduce costs, improve 
its environmental and safety performance and increase productivity 
through technological innovation and upgrading of worker skills. 
Yet today the industry faces its toughest challenge of all to keep 
mining in Canada.
<P>
	According to the Mining Association of Canada, in 1992 there 
were 28 closures or temporary shutdowns of mines compared with 
only eight openings, meaning a net loss of 5,800 jobs. From 1981 
to 1991 there was a decline of nearly 40 per cent in investment 
levels in the sector. Between 1986 and 1991 Canada failed to attract 
a single new mining project with a capital cost of more than $250 
million. By contrast, Latin America had five. These facts make 
support of my colleague's motion so important. It centres on the 
encouragement of exploration. This is crucial.
<P>
	We know that investing in exploration and development is the 
only way to ensure a future for mining in Canada but from 1991 to 
1992 more than 150 companies worldwide reduced spending on 
Canadian projects by 30 per cent. In 1987 Canadian companies 
spent 81 per cent of their exploration budget in Canada. In 1992 
that number went down to 61 per cent. In contrast, over $7 billion 
has been committed to exploration and development in Chile, 
Mexico, Venezuela, Argentina and Bolivia.
<P>
	It is ironic that Canada is the biggest foreign investor in mineral 
exploration in Chile with over 40 Canadian companies involved. 
The average government approval for a mining operation takes six 
months in Chile as opposed to three years in Canada. When Chile is 
admitted to the NAFTA agreement, what chilling effect will this 
have on Canadian mines?
<P>
	Earlier in this Parliament, the Standing Committee on Natural 
Resources conducted extensive hearings with all the stakeholders. 
The result was nine key recommendations on mining incentives 
which my colleague from Timiskaming-French River has 
outlined.
<P>
	Canada has the resources, skilled workforce, infrastructure and 
commitment to environment and technology to support a 
prosperous mining industry today and in the future. But without a 
strong co-operative effort to keep mining here, this may well be  
the last generation of miners in Canada. As future mining activities 
shift to other countries, the decline of Canadian mining would have 
a devastating impact on over one million Canadians living in 
mining communities or working in businesses related to the mining 
industry.
<P>
	Through this motion, it shows we urgently need a national 
mining strategy with policies and actions that will reverse current 
trends. Mining is important to Canada and we must support Motion 
No. 292. Canada has always counted on its mining industry to be a 
key foundation for export driven growth.
<P>
	Today mining is a $20 billion industry in Canada. We must keep 
it growing and thriving. I am certainly supporting this motion and I 
urge all hon. members to do the same.
<P>
<B>(1825 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to enter the debate on Motion No. 292 in the name of the 
hon. member for Timiskaming-French River who from time to 
time is my seatmate. I am sure his constituents in mining 
communities such as Kirkland Lake, Cobalt and Haileybury are 
very proud of his initiatives in the House in support of the mining 
sector.
<P>
	Over time as Canadians became more involved in the service 
sector they have forgotten some of their roots that go back in our 
history over the last 200 or 300 years. The mining sector was a very 
important part of it.
<P>
	We all consume goods and products that come out of mining. We 
are either consumers or work directly in mining or do both. 
Invariably during the day we consume some products that actually 
started off in the mining sector.
<P>
	I will refer to some of the statistics: 4.2 per cent of our GDP is 
accounted for by the mining sector and 14.6 per cent of Canada's 
entire export trade is related to the mining sector. It directly 
employs 327,000 people. These are some of the positive statistics 
and I will now refer to some negative ones.
<P>
	From 1991 to 1992, 150 companies in Canada reduced their 
worldwide expenditures in our mining sector by 30 per cent. There 
were reductions of expenditures from $430 million to $302 million. 
In 1987 Canadian companies spent 81 per cent of their exploration 
budgets in Canada. By 1992 that had declined to only 61 per cent. 
As the previous member mentioned, ironically Canada and 
Canadian companies are now the biggest investors in Chile. Over 
40 companies are involved.
<P>
	What is happening to our mining sector? Our own companies are 
leaving. Why is that? In one word it is taxation in spite of 
interjections by members of the third party. It was surprising when 
I heard the hon. member from the third party talk about flow 
through shares. I have listened to that party constantly talk a flat tax 
or tax changes which would eliminate flow through shares. We  can 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15247"> 15247 </A></B>
<P>
see that Reform Party members are basically speaking out of both 
sides of their mouths at the same time.
<P>
	Taxation has created confusion. When people are investing in 
industry, confusion is one thing that forces capital to leave the 
country. Capital likes certainty and taxation and administration in 
Canada have created tremendous confusion. With that an outflow 
of capital has been created.
<P>
	Mining is a very significant capital intensive industry. Within the 
industry each job represents $100,000 of investment in capital. 
Many of the taxes the mining sector faces have nothing to do with 
income. Once again in spite of the intervention by the member 
from the third party, many of the taxes relate to provincial 
jurisdiction and not federal. A more mature attitude would be to 
realize that tax administration in the mining sector is outdated, 
outmoded and in dire need of change.
<P>
	Let me explain some of the taxes so members will understand 
why the mining sector is having such difficulty. First there is a 
significant insidious tax, what I would call a capital tax. Many 
industries in Canada are subjected to it. Basically a capital tax is 
just that: a tax on the capital invested in a business.
<P>
	Perhaps that sounds reasonable to some people, but when we 
take it to the next step we discover that a capital tax also involves a 
tax on employed capital like bank loans. For instance, the more 
debt one has, the more taxes one pays With a capital intensive 
industry like mining clearly this is a very retrogressive tax. The tax 
is administered by provincial jurisdictions.
<P>
	I have had some discussions with my colleagues in the Bloc. The 
problem across the country is that there are all kinds of tax 
administrations in each province. It is very difficult for a 
multinational corporation to understand the best place to run a 
mine based on tax administration in an individual province.
<P>
<B>(1830)</B>
<P>
	Another aspect that has created great consternation and a great 
deal of uncertainty in the mining sector has been the whole concept 
of a resource allowance. Let me try to explain resource allowance 
in a very short period of time.
<P>
	The provincial governments levy what are called royalty taxes. 
Royalty taxes are somewhat closer to a profit type tax because 
essentially they are oriented on production. There are royalty taxes 
in the oil and gas sector. There are royalty taxes in the mining 
sector, basically based on the amount of extraction that takes place.
<P>
	What the federal government attempts to do is to try to make 
some kind of recognition that mining companies are subject to 
these royalty taxes. Some people might ask: Why not simply allow 
them as a tax deduction?  Some people have suggested that as a 
way to amend the taxation of mining companies.
<P>
	The problem we have, and getting back once again to the speaker 
from the Reform Party, is that each province calculates royalty 
taxes differently. There is a different administration in British 
Columbia, Alberta and Saskatchewan. There is a totally different 
one in Ontario and also in Quebec.
<P>
	What the federal government attempts to do is to develop a 
formula which will allow some kind of methodology of calculating 
what would be a uniform royalty tax across all mining sectors. The 
problem is it has become so unbelievably complicated to calculate 
what a resource allowance is.
<P>
	We have had the spectacle of the Gulf case. That company was 
able to argue effectively under the tax laws for a totally different 
interpretation of resource allowances than did the federal 
government. The federal government's bottom line was a loss of 
over $1 billion worth of tax revenue.
<P>
	This has created further consternation within the tax 
administration system and it is continuing to be a problem. Mainly 
it is a problem because governments cannot sit down together and 
work things out in a reasonable and harmonious fashion.
<P>
	That is not the end of the problems of the mining sector. There 
are all kinds of other non-profit taxes which take place within the 
mining sector. The hon. member has mentioned gasoline taxes 
because he basically likes to criticize the federal government, but 
we also have other forms of taxes, not the least of which is energy 
taxes.
<P>
	The mining sector is a huge consumer of electricity. Most of 
these electrical utilities are administered by provincial 
administrations. Quite frankly, I believe they have been 
mismanaged over the years. At one time Canada had a very 
attractive energy rate making it a cheaper place to undertake 
mining in North America. That competitive advantage has been 
lost over the last 20 years through what I consider to be different 
types of practices and basically mismanaging that resource. As a 
consequence, our mining sector faces some of the highest energy 
rates of any mining operation in North America.
<P>
	This reminds me of a story. I was once in the jungles of Peru, 
long before I started this job. Somebody asked me: ``When I look at 
Canada, a big huge country, the third largest country in the world 
geologically, a small but well educated population, why is it that 
Canada cannot manage its resources effectively and be a world 
leader?''
<P>
	I come back to this debate. We are seeing how people within 
governments, no matter what public administration is involved, 
whether it is federal or provincial, are basically out to kill the 
golden goose.
<P>
	Another area that is a federal concern is payroll taxes. I do not 
have to tell most members that the increases in  UI rates and

<P>
Canada pension plan rates have had a tremendous impact on the 
mining sector because it is capital intensive and also uses a lot of 
labour.
<P>
<B>(1835 )</B>
<P>
	I believe the various governments sat down in November 1994 
and signed an agreement, the Whitehorse Mining Initiative. I will 
read one section of that concerning the area of taxation: ``to 
establish a tax regime that is seen to be simple, pragmatic, fair, 
including an overall greater reliance on profit-based taxes as 
opposed to non-profit-related taxes and charges''. I think this is a 
great objective. And I note this agreement has been signed not only 
by our Minister of Natural Resources but most of the provincial 
natural resources ministers. Of course the problem is we have a lot 
of talk going on but we do not have much action.
<P>
	In conclusion, I am very supportive of the motion by the member 
for Timiskaming-French River that has brought this to our 
attention. I could go on and on about how tax administration should 
perhaps be different in this country. I believe we must move 
forward quickly to address the concerns of the mining sector.

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 deemed 
to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="INDIANAFFAIRS">INDIAN AFFAIRS</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on September 27, just days after the standoffs concluded 
at Gustafsen Lake and Ipperwash, Ontario, I rose in this House to 
question the Minister of Indian Affairs about what should happen 
next. Obviously, the issues raised in grievance by those occupying 
land and the concerns expressed by many who had not been 
occupying land had not been addressed and the frustration of 
aboriginal people concerning land was still outstanding.
<P>
	I continue to believe that the federal government's approach to 
land claims and self-government, an approach that is slow, 
confusing, and filled with uncertainties, is the first area of concern 
that needs to be dealt with if the frustrations and anxieties are ever 
to be reduced. Indian leaders throughout Canada and through the 
Assembly of First Nations have said for many years  that the anger 
among the people of their communities had to be addressed quickly 
or it would boil over.
<P>
	Earlier, during the second week of September, when I called on 
the minister to get involved in the specifics of Ipperwash and 
Gustafsen Lake, I said that the only way to deal with the slow and 
uncertain nature of how land claim disputes are currently settled 
was with the understanding and intervention of the federal Minister 
of Indian Affairs. Only he has the authority to make the necessary 
changes. Only he has the jurisdiction to address the issues in a way 
that will adequately address the problems outlined by so many. 
Obviously those closest to the issue are the ones who should be 
consulted first, and those who work in the field must be consulted 
as well.
<P>
	It comes as no surprise then to learn that the latest annual report 
of the Indian claims commission published this summer calls for 
the development and implementation of a new land claims policy 
and process. Here is the group caught in the middle between the 
bands and the government, receiving the applications, hearing and 
judging the evidence, and presenting the recommendations. Here is 
a group that does the work saying that it should be replaced; saying 
that the workload is increasing dramatically and the ability of the 
existing commission to respond is limited; saying that it is wrong 
for the government to have a process in place that allows the 
federal government to be a judge in claims against itself.
<P>
	To quote the commission, ``Everything that we have learned as a 
commission to date indicates that it is imperative to commence the 
process of reform immediately. It is imperative that an independent 
claims body be established to perform at least the initial 
assessment of the validity of First Nations land claims in Canada.''
<P>
	Upon reading the commission's report the editors of the 
Montreal <I>Gazette</I> newspaper had this to say: ``It is important that 
aboriginal communities establish a solid land base. From it, 
economic development and self-government can follow. In its red 
book of campaign promises the Liberal Party said the current 
process is simply not working and promised to set up an 
independent claims commission. It should do so sooner rather than 
later.''
<P>
	That was my sentiment when I first asked the minister if it was 
his intention to establish a new process in policy.
<P>
	That was my intention when I said I did not believe it would be 
in Canada's best interest to have First Nation's people from all 
across the country who may have legitimate land claims occupying 
land and leaving the resolution of those disputes to the local police. 
Land issues are not police matters. They are matters of critical 
concern to all Canadians and only the minister can deal with them. 
Therefore I was disappointed when the minister said he had to 
consult further. I hope he has now had the time to talk to the chiefs.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="15249"> 15249 </A></B>
<P>
	I ask again, will the government take the first step to relieve 
the anxieties over the land claims process and establish the new, 
independent commission called for by the Indian Claims 
Commission in its 1994-95 annual report?
<P>
	<B>Mr. John English (Parliamentary Secretary to President of 
the Queen's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
respond to the question raised by the hon. member for The 
Battlefords-Meadow Lake on September 27 regarding the 
1994-95 report of the Indian Claims Commission and its first 
recommendation which called for the establishment of a new, 
independent land claims policy and process.
<P>
	First, I would like to say that the work the Indian Claims 
Commission is currently doing in the area of claims is 
commendable. The minister has the highest respect for this effort.
<P>
	Second, the Liberal Party of Canada's election platform states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A Liberal government will implement major changes to the current approach. 
A Liberal government will be prepared to create, in co-operation with 
aboriginal peoples, an independent claims commission to speed up and 
facilitate the resolution of all claims. The commission would not preclude direct 
negotiations.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Let me assure the House that the government is committed to 
building new partnerships with aboriginal peoples based on trust 
and mutual respect. The resolution of land claims is an important 
part of this initiative.
<P>
	In fact, the federal government is committed to increasing the 
rate of land claim settlements. We are seeking innovative ways to 
resolve the impediments that slow this process. There has been, 
however, significant progress in resolving claims, including 44 
specific claim settlements as well as five comprehensive claim 
settlements since the government took office.
<P>
	The minister has invited substantive commentary from First 
Nations and First Nation organizations on concrete proposals for 
change and is awaiting further guidance from aboriginal people and 
others. The government, in co-operation with First Nations, needs 
to think through how the claims policies could be overhauled 
within the climate of restraint that affects us all. The recent report 
of Justice Hamilton will assist in this regard.
<P>
	It is important all Canadians understand and respect this process 
as it benefits all Canadians.
