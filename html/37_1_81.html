	Mr. Speaker, residents of Pickering and all Canadians
					 mourn the passing of a truly exceptional children's entertainer with the death
					 yesterday of Mr. Ernie Coombs.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Known by generations of Canadians as Mr. Dressup, Ernie
					 thrilled countless children with his beloved television program from 1967 until
					 1996, a program still seen in reruns today.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ernie was a gifted entertainer who encouraged his
					 audiences to use their imaginations. In 1994 he was awarded a Gemini for
					 lifetime work and an ACTRA Earle Grey Award for excellence in Canadian
					 television.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ernie was made a member of the Order of Canada in 1996
					 for his lifelong achievement in providing quality children's programming. In
					 1997 he was awarded a Special Save the Children Canada Award for his work on
					 behalf of that organization.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Especially during these difficult days, Canadians are
					 blessed to have had a person like Ernie Coombs provide them with a better view
					 of our society. While Ernie's warm personality and love for children will be
					 missed, Canadians will fondly remember the time they spent growing up with Mr.
					 Dressup.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know all members of the House will join me in
					 extending sincere condolences to Ernie's family and friends throughout this
					 great nation. God bless Ernie.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, 60 years ago President Roosevelt called
					 Canada the aerodrome of democracy for its efforts in wartime air training. On
					 September 11 Canada was destined to receive many hundreds of airliners within
					 mere hours as American airports were closed by terrorism. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirty-five thousand America-bound air travellers
					 landed safely on Canadian airfields. Over six thousand went to Newfoundland's
					 Gander alone, doubling the community's population. It was “like two large
					 conventions arriving with only two hours' notice”, were the words of the mayor
					 of St. John's.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once more in a time of great need, Canadian workers,
					 volunteers, the Salvation Army and the Red Cross all met the challenge and
					 renewed Canada's status as the aerodrome of democracy.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, like many Canadians I have American
					 relatives, some living in New York City. The vicious terrorist attack on the
					 United States is being felt personally and deeply in Canada. Canada will
					 support the U.S.A. and our NATO allies in the important campaign to bring these
					 criminals to justice.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my city of London, Ontario, the leaders of our
					 Muslim community have repeatedly and forcefully condemned the attack on the
					 United States. I join them in that condemnation. I also stand with them in
					 denouncing the misguided actions of a few of our citizens who wrongly accuse,
					 threaten or attack our Muslim friends and neighbours in London or anywhere
					 else.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is exactly the kind of hatred and twisted logic
					 which, taken to the extreme, produces the insane violence that victimized so
					 many innocent Americans last week.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May those who were killed rest in peace. May those who
					 mourn their loved ones be assured of the prayers and support of peace loving
					 people everywhere.</p>

					 his race. Such acts of violence have no place in our country. </p>

	Mr. Speaker, 52 years ago this week the Right Hon.
					 Lester B. Pearson represented Canada at the first NATO meeting in Washington.
					 This is the same man who was honoured with the Nobel Peace Prize for his
					 unwaivering commitment to global peace. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I submit that former Prime Minister Pearson would not
					 have endorsed a body such as NATO unless he believed it could be an instrument
					 of peace. With this in mind, and in light of the horrific events that took
					 place in New York and Washington last Tuesday, I applaud the government for its
					 support of article 5 of the NATO charter.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deliberate acts of terror directed against innocent
					 civilians cannot be permitted to go unchallenged. That being said, let us heed
					 the intentions of our former prime minister and use global organizations such
					 as NATO to support peace and not to wage war. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the coming weeks we will begin to see the changes
					 that the western world faces, the stark realities brought about by the actions
					 of madmen. I pray that we will keep our focus on the re-establishment of
					 confidence and not on sponsoring vengeance. We must remember that our actions
					 today will set the foundation for the world we will pass to our

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We look back fondly on mornings spent around the

					 positive influence of the show on the lives of those who watched will be

					 rescue efforts.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the coming weeks and months, and indeed years, we
					 will be called upon in this place to make many difficult decisions. Perhaps the
					 most difficult task facing us will be that of balancing the new concern for our
					 collective safety with the longstanding Canadian values of acceptance and
					 compassion.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot allow ourselves to dictate something as
					 fundamental as our immigration policies based on the terrible acts of a
					 cowardly few. We cannot let fear change our way of life and the way we treat
					 others. To do so would send a message to those who advance their own agendas
					 with the murder of innocent civilians that they could win this new
					 war.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would also diminish Canada as a nation. We are a
					 country built on the backs of immigrants. The diverse cultures represented here

				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, maybe those less interested in
					 reconfiguration can reconfigure outside.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, on September 12, I wrote to you advising
					 that 20 members had united to establish the PC/DR coalition to function within
					 the machinery of the House of Commons. I sent a full list of members of the
					 House who are members of the PC/DR coalition. Earlier today we held our fourth
					 caucus.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also advised you in that letter that the officers of
					 the coalition are the right hon. member for Calgary Centre as leader, the
					 member for Fraser Valley as deputy leader, the member for Edmonton North as
					 caucus chair, the member for Prince George--Peace River as whip, and myself as
					 House leader.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, first I want to thank you for your
					 assistance in getting us seated in the House for the very important business
					 that confronted us on Monday. My colleagues have been able to discharge their
					 essential parliamentary functions thanks to the efforts of the
					 Chair.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now need to raise several issues that so far have not
					 been capable of resolution with the whips of other parties. I do so with
					 considerable regret because as you recognize Mr. Speaker, it is always better
					 for the harmonious workings of the House that these matters be settled through
					 parliamentary machinery.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is the matter of the location of our seats in
					 the House. Second is the allocation and precedence of questions in question
					 period. Third is the allocation and precedence of speaking times during debate.
					 Fourth is the allocation of supply days.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, the PC/DR coalition asks that you grant
					 changes. These changes would recognize us as the fourth largest political
					 entity in the House. The PC/DR coalition is comprised of 20 members of the
					 House. All 20 members recognize the right hon. member for Calgary Centre as our
					 leader and we sit in opposition to the government. As such, our leader assigns
					 critic roles, names House leaders and provides leadership to the caucus as a
					 whole. My colleague, the whip and member for Prince George--Peace River
					 similarly acts for the 20 members in facilitating the working of our
					 caucus.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As House leader, I speak for 20 members of the House.
					 In my capacity as such I perform many functions on their behalf, including the
					 presentation of this argument today. We are a single unit of 20 and we have
					 collectively taken the decision to present ourselves in this fashion, but at
					 present we are being treated as a group of 12.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast, the Canadian Alliance has parliamentary
					 resources, speaking time, access to supply days and financial resources based
					 on a membership of 66. In fact its membership has now been diminished to 58
					 seats. Nearly a million Canadians represented by members who now sit in the
					 PC/DR coalition are having their access to parliamentary representation
					 compromised by the practices that no longer conform to the proportionate
					 parliamentary realities. Certain decisions taken at the beginning of this
					 parliament are no longer applicable. We suggest that they should now be
					 revised.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would add this imbalance is not fair to all other
					 parties in the House. The Alliance enjoys a disproportionate allocation in
					 relationship to all other entities in the House of Commons, not just the
					 coalition. The changes I am requesting have no serious impact on any other
					 party in the House. The resources and allocation of the numbers of questions
					 and opportunities for participation in debate for Liberal members will not
					 change, nor will they change for the Bloc or the NDP.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc and the NDP will not have their allotted days,
					 questions or debate time reduced. Let me say that again for emphasis. The
					 Liberals, Bloc and NDP will not have their allotted days, questions or debate
					 time reduced. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are however now the fourth largest political entity
					 in the House and claim all of the privileges and rights associated with that
					 position. The Alliance currently has resources to which they are not entitled
					 and these resources should therefore be reassigned on a per capita,
					 proportionate basis. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be no additional political entities created
					 which would require additional negotiations or resources or consultations with
					 the government. What we are doing is simply working within the system to
					 facilitate the work of the House of Commons. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, while I recognize this is not an issue
					 before you, I want to point out that we will be asking for fair and equitable
					 financial treatment through reallocation of existing resources. That, however,
					 is a matter for the Board of Internal Economy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, we contend that the guiding principle in
					 your decision should be equitable treatment for the rights of individual
					 members to act individually and collectively here in the House of
					 Commons.</p>


	<A NAME="T1505"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1505"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1510"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1500"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1505)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As individual members we are free and have a duty to
					 come to the House to consider the business before the House and vote on
					 questions put to the House by the Speaker for decision. In so doing we may seek
					 to participate in the proceedings and debate, and may try to influence
					 decisions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of us act as individuals and indeed all of us act
					 as part of collective organizations within the House of Commons which exist to
					 help facilitate the organization of the business before the House. Accordingly,
					 when individuals choose to act collectively, the threshold for access to
					 certain parliamentary rights is set out by the Parliament of Canada Act at a
					 minimum of 12 members. We have met and surpassed that threshold. We are 20
					 members. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, we view ourselves as a whole and simply
					 request that you do likewise. We have chosen the name PC/DR coalition because
					 we feel this describes the collective will of the group. It accurately depicts
					 our origins and defines our common purpose. For the purposes of the House of
					 Commons, we participate and vote just as do other political entities, such as a
					 party, an alliance, a bloc, a confederation, or a union. I choose these
					 descriptive words that other political entities have used in parliaments past
					 and present to illustrate that parliamentary entities come in many forms and
					 configurations. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, as you are well aware, there is no precise
					 definition of a party in the Parliament of Canada Act.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us examine for a moment what political parties and
					 bodies do in the House of Commons. Political bodies are an important part of
					 the machinery of this House. They are vehicles to communicate the collective
					 will of the members, but foremost they provide assistance for the Chair and the
					 House in the organization of the business of the House. Individual members have
					 delegated certain authority to other members to act on their behalf, which we
					 have done. The nature of that relationship is defined between those members.
					 The existence of that relationship is signalled to the Chair by various means,
					 some implicit and some specific.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not aware of any other instance when members who,
					 having formed a group of 20, have had their collective rights challenged or
					 denied.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members who have crossed the floor or changed
					 allegiances have never been asked to prove their political affiliation, abandon
					 their past, or produce political membership cards to the Speaker to justify
					 their existence. What we call ourselves outside the House should be of no
					 concern to the Speaker. It may be a delicious tidbit for journalists or others,
					 but within the walls of this Chamber and the precinct of parliament, external
					 political labels should be left outside. Membership cards that may or may not
					 be found in my wallet do not fall within the Speaker's jurisdiction.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of us arrived here as equals in response to a writ
					 of election. As equals we have rights; as equals we are free to associate as we
					 individually choose. Indeed the right to associate freely is guaranteed by the
					 Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. I am not suggesting that the Speaker
					 will rule on a constitutional legal question. Rather I want to make the point
					 that members of the House of Commons, as free Canadians, have the right to
					 belong to whatever lawful organizations they choose, both inside and outside
					 the House.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, I completely understand you do not rule on
					 questions of law. However, I do suggest that in considering past practices, the
					 Speaker is entitled to take notice of the important charter rights that were
					 given to Canadians in 1981. In fact earlier this week the Prime Minister
					 referred to the importance of the charter, which protects all Canadians. This
					 certainly extends to all members of the House of Commons and the Parliament of
					 Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On June 1, 1994 my friend, the member for
					 Winnipeg--Transcona, stated in this Chamber, and I quote from
					 <i>Hansard</i>:</p>

<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>Parties present themselves to the House as parties and are not

						  parties or be asked to leave our parties. We can create new parties, merge two
						  parties into one, as did the Progressives and the Conservatives, or change the
						  name of our parties as we in the New Democratic Party did.</small></td>

</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not comment on the fact that they are still
					 calling themselves new after 30 years. My colleague then went on to say:
					 </p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right">

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is what we have done. I agree with my colleague
					 and fellow House leader that it is not for anyone other than the participants
					 to decide how to label the parliamentary group. It has been stated in the past
					 that it is a privilege to be seated anywhere in the House. It follows that
					 having been elected to the House members have the privilege to be affiliated
					 and seated anywhere they choose.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no requirement in the Parliament of Canada Act
					 that any member must belong to any political party, as evidenced by the number
					 of independent members we have seen in the Chamber in the past. This concept is
					 also defined on page 186, chapter 4 of the <i>House of Commons Procedure and
					 Practice</i>, edited by Marleau and Montpetit, which states:</p>

<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>Although most Members are elected with a party affiliation (a

</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we have decided to do and call ourselves is
					 strictly a matter of choice so long as we are not seeking to duplicate an
					 existing name. The various titles that are used in the House, whether a group
					 styles itself a caucus, an alliance, a bloc, a confederation, a union or
					 coalition, is a matter of internal decision.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That title is used to convey whatever stylistic
					 information the members of the group wish to convey. Even the Liberal caucus
					 has contained members of another party, the Liberal Labour Party. We choose to
					 call ourselves the PC/DR caucus coalition. We do not define other parties. Nor
					 should they define us. We have taken the conscious decision to perform and
					 present in a cohesive manner, and our name reflects that decision. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some members may argue that this is a matter which
					 should be referred to a committee, as occurred in 1963 in the case of the
					 Social Credit-Ralliement créditiste split. I suggest that it would be dangerous
					 to go down that road. That would mean that government supporters would
					 determine the fate of an opposition party. Government sanctioned parliamentary
					 opposition is unworthy of our contemplation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the nature of government domination of
					 committees, we do not want to enter into a world where government licensing of
					 the opposition side of the House is the rule of the day. Our actions will
					 eventually be judged by our party supporters and by the electorate on another
					 day. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately precedents since 1963 indicate that no
					 group of 12 or more members has ever been denied party status. This is the
					 basis upon which we make our argument today.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coalitions have been formed in the past under the
					 parliamentary system. It is understood that this is done for the good of the
					 country and to further the cause espoused by the members who believe in that
					 cause. When it has happened in the past it was understood that it was done for
					 the furtherance of the public good and in the best interest of the Parliament
					 of Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleagues in the coalition are here to do the
					 important business of the House. I genuinely regret that the Speaker has had to
					 become involved. The House and the speakership would have been better served if
					 this question were not placed before you. However the 20 members of the
					 coalition have been left with no option. We seek equitable treatment for the
					 members of the coalition, for the good of parliament and Canada.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, the member for
					 Pictou--Antigonish--Guysborough said that he talked to other House leaders and
					 whips. As the House leader of the official opposition I have had no official
					 meeting with that group about how they should sit in the House. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had one phone call last Saturday evening from you,
					 Mr. Speaker, about seating, to which I agreed. I have no disagreement with
					 where they are sitting right now. I checked with my whip and he has had no
					 official meeting. If you put the onus on yourself, it is the onus of that group
					 and not of my party.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are at all tempted to grant this status and
					 arrangement that the members of the DRC are seeking, you will be creating a
					 parliamentary enigma in deciding a matter that is the proper decision of the
					 House.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To comply with the member's request for a coalition,
					 this group must be recognized as a separate entity. For official parliamentary
					 purposes a separate entity can only be defined as a party. I will address the
					 party issue first.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The concept of a political party, and particularly the
					 funding of smaller political parties, is a relatively recent phenomenon. For
					 example, in 1944 Prime Minister Mackenzie King argued that in consulting the
					 opposition he was obliged only to deal with the leader of the opposition, not
					 the leaders of other parties. He said, at page 554 of <i>Hansard</i> from
					 February 16, 1944, “If the opposition wish to be divided into groups, that of
					 course is their own affair”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The granting of money to the leaders of smaller parties
					 did not begin until 1963. It was also at that time that the so-called 12 member
					 rule was established. It is here where I will begin examining some of the
					 history of these types of requests.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1963, 13 members of the Social Credit Party split
					 off and declared themselves a separate party under the name Ralliement
					 créditiste. The matter was referred to the Standing Committee on Privileges and
					 Elections. In committee the issue was not treated merely as a matter of
					 applying the 12 member rule but rather as one determining the validity of the
					 claim by the Ralliement créditiste to be a political party.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The committee looked at the legal and electoral
					 evidence that would support the Ralliement créditiste claim. The committee
					 refrained from committing itself to a full definition of the requirement that
					 would be needed to be met in order for a group to be recognized as a political
					 party.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the <i>Canadian Journal of Political Science</i> of
					 March 1978 in reference to the 1963 case, John Courtney states “A pragmatic
					 solution was brokered amongst the existing party and groups in the
					 House”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On page 33 of Marleau and Montpetit it states “Speakers
					 have been clear in rulings that it is up to the House itself to decide such
					 matters”. This references the 1963 case as well as February 18, 1966, October
					 11, 1979, November 6, 1979 and June 16, 1994.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On September 30, 1963, at pages 3008 and 3009 of
					 <i>Hansard</i>, the Speaker explained it in this way:</p>


	<p>

						  bring to the attention of the House the novel character of the situation now
						  before it, and more particularly the payment of allowances and the effect on
						  the organization of parliament and parties and of the work of this House that
						  naturally must be reflected by the emergence from time to time of new groups

</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are few precise rules regarding the recognition
					 of parties in the House. Much depends on the will of the House.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1988, when members of the Conservative and Liberal
					 caucuses quit their parties to form the Bloc Quebecois, they were not granted
					 party status even though they went on to register under the elections act and
					 managed to have a representative elected in the 1990 byelection. They were
					 denied party status because the House was guided by the 12 member
					 rule.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, in the 1974 general election the
					 Ralliement créditiste were reduced to 11 members. Even though it did not
					 qualify for a research budget it continued to receive funds because its members
					 were elected in a general election and the House made that decision, not the
					 Speaker.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first step in becoming a registered party under the
					 elections act is the application process. There are a number of items to be
					 included in the application such as the names, addresses and signatures of 100
					 electors and the names and addresses of party officers and the leader. Once a
					 party has become eligible it becomes registered after it has obtained
					 candidates whose nomination has been confirmed in 50 electoral districts. So
					 far the DRC does not qualify under the elections act as a party.</p>


	<A NAME="T1520"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1520"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1525"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1515"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1520)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should also be noted that these requirements under
					 the act are fairly new. They were made with the passage of Bill C-9, which
					 received royal assent on June 14, 2001.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If anyone wants to know how the majority of members in
					 this parliament might feel about the issue of a party status, they need to look
					 no further than to the recent changes to the elections act. The passage of Bill
					 C-9 made it more difficult for small fringe parties to emerge and be recognized
					 under the elections act.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be inconsistent for the House to make it more
					 difficult for small fringe parties to be recognized through the elections act
					 and easier through the parliamentary procedure.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another aspect of the law to consider is the bylaws of
					 the House, specifically bylaw 302. This bylaw defines a recognized party as a
					 party recognized by the House that has 12 or more persons elected to the House
					 as members of that party.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The members of the DRC, by their own admission, are not
					 an official party. According to the elections act they are not a party. The
					 recent decision by the House with the passage of Bill C-9 would suggest there
					 is no appetite to make them a party. Pursuant to the bylaws of the House of
					 Commons they do not qualify as a party.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without party status, they cannot apply for a coalition
					 arrangement with a recognized party. The reason is that there is nothing
					 official to coalesce with. We cannot expect the Speaker to depart from
					 convention and grant this group special status.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the September 30, 1963 <i>Hansard</i>, at page 3008,
					 in reference to the 1963 party status debate, the Speaker stated:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>It is
						  not one where the Speaker ought by himself to take a position where any group
						  of members might feel that their interests as a group or a party have been
						  prejudiced. Nor should the Speaker be put in the position where he must decide,
						  to the advantage or to the disadvantage of any group or party, matters
						  affecting the character or existence of a party, for this surely would signify
						  that the Speaker had taken what was almost a political decision.</small></td>

</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you are aware, Mr. Speaker, the members of the DRC
					 are still card carrying Canadian Alliance members. What political party will
					 they claim to belong to when asked?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If that question were put to the hon. member for Prince
					 George--Peace River, for example, his response would be “I am a card carrying
					 member of the Alliance Party. In parliament I am a member of the democratic
					 representative caucus, and the leader of the Progressive Conservative Party has
					 just appointed me whip”. The hon. member is obviously suffering from some
					 multiple parliamentary party disorder.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most political parties would find it unacceptable for
					 any of its members to be part of another federal party or caucus. It was not
					 that long ago that former Liberal cabinet minister Doug Young bought a
					 membership in the Canadian Alliance. The Liberal Party leadership reacted
					 quickly and revoked Mr. Young's Liberal membership.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If members get ejected from their party, that should be
					 as a result of the decisions of the political players involved. A Speaker's
					 decision should not be the cause for a member's ejection from a
					 party.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It could be argued that either way your decision may
					 bring about a political action. The possible result of your not granting the
					 members the status they desire could be that they quit the Canadian Alliance
					 altogether in order to better qualify for special status. The difference is
					 this: maintaining the status quo is the traditional position taken by
					 Speakers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will go back to when the Reform Party was tied with
					 the Bloc Quebecois in the House with 50 members each. The Reform Party asked to
					 be the official opposition because it represented provinces right across Canada
					 and the Bloc represented only one province. The Tories of that day, there were
					 two of them, could have joined and made that a better argument. It was not to
					 their advantage at the time so they did not try to do that to make sure that
					 the opposition in Canada was a party that would represent all of
					 Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same party, with the House leader for the
					 Conservative Party who has just made his argument without any precedents, which
					 I find amazing for a lawyer, lost five Tories in the last parliament. I did not
					 hear them get up once and offer the Canadian Alliance a few more questions in
					 question period, or the Liberals who gained four of the five members. They kept
					 the same number of questions. That was the rule at the start of that parliament
					 and it was the rule at the finish of that parliament. They cannot have it both
					 ways.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You should not feel responsible for what may happen,
					 Mr. Speaker, if you turn down the member's request. If a preacher refused to
					 marry a couple because one was already married, the preacher could not be
					 responsible if a divorce resulted in his decision.</p>


	<A NAME="T1525"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1525"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1530"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1520"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1525)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, he would feel very responsible for
					 the sequence of events that followed a decision to marry the couple. I will put
					 that aside for now, Mr. Speaker, and ask you to consider another
					 point.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assuming that all the conditions were met to entertain
					 a request for a coalition, it is up to the Speaker to unilaterally allow a
					 party to form a coalition with another party. I would argue that it would be a
					 departure from convention for the Speaker to make a decision on behalf of the
					 House. It would be a giant departure from convention to allow small group
					 without party status to form a coalition with any party in the
					 House.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only coalition at the national level in Canada was
					 Sir Robert Borden's 1917 union government. Faced with strong opposition to
					 conscription and with other major difficulties during World War I, Borden
					 brought several conscriptionist liberals into his government. The political
					 party system has come a long way since 1917. The groups in 1917 were not vying
					 for funding and increased resources. It was a matter of a coalition government,
					 the first world war and the issue of conscription. It was not an issue of
					 organizing or re-organizing the opposition. A coalition is necessary to govern
					 but certainly not necessary to oppose.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said in my argument regarding the party's status,
					 the concept of a political party, and particularly the funding of smaller
					 political parties, is a relatively recent phenomenon. The granting of money to
					 the leaders of small parties did not begin until 1963. Even if the members of
					 the DRC had the so-called magic number of 12, they are not registered under the
					 Canada Elections Act. There must be some cohesion between parliamentary law and
					 the common law with respect to party recognition.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I wrap up I want to discuss briefly the issue of
					 other jurisdictions because we are members of the Commonwealth and we have
					 taken our lead all through the centuries from the mothers of all
					 parliaments.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The funding of opposition parties in the U.K. is based
					 upon votes received in the last general election. This is known as Short money,
					 so named after a previous leader of the House. The DRC received zero votes in
					 the last election. According to the practice of the United Kingdom they should
					 receive zero money and zero consideration.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In New Zealand the rules regarding party status and
					 coalitions are spelled out a little clearer in their standing orders. The
					 relevant standing orders of the New Zealand house of representatives are as
					 follows. Standing order 34(1) states that every party in whose interest a
					 member was elected at the preceding general election or at any subsequent
					 byelection is entitled to be recognized as a party for parliamentary purposes.
					 Members who cease to be members of the party for which they were originally
					 elected may be recognized as a party for parliamentary purposes if they apply
					 to the speaker and their new party is registered as a registered party by the
					 electoral commission. Once again, even if the DRC had 12 members they would not
					 qualify.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing order 35(2) from New Zealand deals with a
					 coalition. It says that a coalition between two or more parties must be
					 notified to the speaker but each party to the coalition remains a separate
					 party for parliamentary purposes. Again, the DRC does not qualify as a party in
					 the House.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Australia, coalitions have been an important part of
					 Australian political life since the 1920s. In 1923 a nationalist party
					 coalition government was formed which lasted until 1929. Since that time most
					 non-labour governments have been coalitions between the major conservative
					 party and Australia's rural party. As with the New Zealand example, each party
					 to the coalition remains a separate party for parliamentary purposes. The DRC
					 would not have a chance in the Australian parliament either. The same concept
					 holds true for the U.K.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other consideration is that coalitions are
					 creatures of governments, not opposition. We can debate these examples from
					 other jurisdictions all we want. The bottom line is that the Speaker has clear
					 Canadian precedence and has no choice but to rule that it is the House that
					 must decide this matter. The House could consider the New Zealand, Australia or
					 U.K. models if it wanted. It could choose not to decide at all and maintain the
					 status quo. That is its prerogative.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe the House should seriously consider the private
					 member's bill sponsored by one of the members from the DRC, the member for
					 Saskatoon--Humboldt. In his February 21 press release that launched one of his
					 many initiatives, he said that the bill would end official party status in the
					 House of Commons for political parties with less than 30 seats or without
					 representation from at least three provinces or territories.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For several years parliament's time has been wasted on
					 fringe political parties that are not national in their effectiveness or
					 appeal. With 4% of seats in parliament, the NDP and Progressive Conservatives
					 do not deserve the financial resources that go along with official party
					 status. Maybe the member has changed his mind.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I would like to comment briefly on the
					 impact of the minor fluctuations in the size of party issue in the course of a
					 parliament. Since 1963, when funding for parties began, parliamentary resources
					 for parties remained stable, regardless of any change in the numbers of each
					 party. Even when there was significant fluctuation, resources would not be
					 distributed. I use the example that I mentioned earlier, the Conservatives in
					 the last parliament lost five members. They did not ask to have their numbers
					 reduced, their questions reduced.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were other examples. In 1983 and 1984 the
					 Liberals went from 147 to 135 elected members. In the 34th parliament the
					 Conservatives went from 169 down to 151 elected members. Despite these changes,
					 resources remained stable. In the 35th parliament we had a situation where a
					 tie occurred between the two largest opposition parties. In that situation the
					 Reform Party claimed the title of official opposition. The Speaker ruled that
					 the status quo be maintained, preserving the Bloc Quebecois as the official
					 opposition.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Speaker MacNaughton said, the Speaker should not be
					 put in the position where he must decide to the advantage or disadvantage of
					 any group or party or that would signify that the Speaker has taken what is
					 almost a political decision.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the U.K. during the passage of the European
					 Community's finance bill, 1994-95, the Conservatives expelled eight MPs, with a
					 ninth voluntarily resigning. With this change, the government lost its
					 majority. The House debated the composition of standing committees on January
					 11, 1995. It concluded that the composition of the committees would not have to
					 be altered. There were no further repercussions over this situation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, the present distribution of resources
					 for the opposition parties must be maintained. An official coalition between
					 the PC Party and the DRC cannot be entertained because the DRC has nothing
					 official to bring to the table with which to coalesce. The DRC can only be
					 recognized officially as independent members for parliamentary
					 purposes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not saying that parties, groups and independents
					 cannot co-operate with each other in parliament. It is far from that. They are
					 welcome to co-operate all they wish. In fact, the Alliance co-operated with all
					 opposition parties in the last parliament. The Reform Party co-operated with
					 other parties in the parliament before that. It could be said that technically
					 the opposition is always setting up a coalition of parties for the purposes of
					 opposing the government with the leader of the opposition taking centre stage.
					 Our rules would appear to reflect that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have two principal leaders in the House: the Prime
					 Minister, who leads the government, and the Leader of the Opposition, who leads
					 the opposition. To boldly recognize the arrangement being sought today would be
					 a departure from our practice. Accordingly, the matter should be left for the
					 House to decide, not the Speaker.</p>

					 BQ): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I will be much briefer than the member who
					 spoke before me. I simply wish to remind the House that section 62 of the
					 Parliament of Canada Act provides that in order to receive financial benefits,
					 a party must elect at least 12 members in a federal election.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nowhere else does tradition depart from these
					 provisions of the Parliament of Canada Act. We have checked and, to date, no
					 new political party has been registered with the chief electoral officer. No
					 one in this House may therefore request research funding or operating budgets
					 when these are traditionally given to parties.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very sorry for the members sitting as
					 independents, but the only way to be able to request resources is to do what
					 has already been done in the past and to officially become Conservative
					 members. However, to my knowledge, this has not been done so far
					 either.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since there is no new party called the Alliance PC
					 Coalition, and since no Alliance members have become Conservatives, I therefore
					 do not see the point of prolonging this debate. The Parliament of Canada Act is
					 clear.</p>

					 Government in the House of Commons, Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, the issue before us today is a serious one
					 for the Speaker to consider. What we are talking about today is not whether a
					 political party has a right to change names. Obviously, the party across did at
					 some point in the past, but that is not before us today. To claim that PC/DRC
					 is similar to changing the name of another party, I do not think is factually
					 accurate. It is not the same and I will get back to that later.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been some attempt to make a parallel between
					 this and the issue of the role of the Speaker regarding the Créditistes in the
					 1960s. That also is very different. The situation that we had at the time, if
					 my memory serves me correct, was that there was only enough members to make one
					 party and a large number of the members of that party had defected to create
					 the new political party. The issue before the House then was which one of the
					 two groups was the real party. The Speaker at the time referred it to a
					 committee where eventually it was decided that the Ralliement des créditiste
					 would maintain its status because it met the criteria. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was the issue then. Again, I do not think that is
					 the same as what we have in front of us today. It is of little consequence to
					 me, as a partisan, what goes on in this regard because it does not change the
					 status of the government in any way. However, it goes beyond that. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Leader of Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition in the
					 House referred to Short money and the role in the British House. The parallel
					 of my position as leader of the government in the House is referred to in the
					 British House as leader of the House. In a way, without being presumptuous, I
					 consider my role to be analogous to that in the sense that if colleagues across
					 the way ask me why the government or a minister has failed to respond to a
					 question or anything like that I take it upon myself to ensure that I can do
					 what I can because I feel that I have that responsibility to members
					 individually and collectively in the mandate that has been given to me. It is
					 in that regard that I make the comments that are before us today, not for any
					 particular advantage because obviously there is not one either way. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The debate before the House today concerns whether a
					 significant material change in membership affects the benefits that members
					 would have. In other words, if a political party across lost a grand sum of
					 members and that sum was added to another political party, there could be a
					 debate. I do not know what the outcome would be, it is not before us, but there
					 could be a debate as to whether or not that changes the resources between one
					 political party and another one. Again, that is not the issue that is before us
					 at the present time. It goes beyond that. This is also not a case of whether or
					 not there is or has been a coalition government in this country. There has
					 been. We know that. It has been referred to in previous contributions.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue before us is whether or not a political party
					 and some independent members can be collectively identified as an opposition
					 coalition, not an opposition coalition party. If that was the name of their
					 party--I do not happen to think it would be a particularly attractive name but
					 that is a personal view--anyone could use whatever name they think is
					 attractive to the electors to who they are appealing. That is certainly none of
					 my business but it is something that members might want to consider at another
					 time. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue before us in whether or not independents can
					 be grouped with a political party in order for the sum of the two to change the
					 status of other parties in the House, because that is the effect. That is
					 really the issue before us. This is my interpretation of it and I would ask the
					 Speaker to consider it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, the standing orders that we have at the
					 present time, along with the board bylaws, Beauchesne's and Marleau and
					 Montpetit can perhaps guide us and indicate what structure in the House has
					 official recognition.</p>


	<A NAME="T1540"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1540"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1545"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1535"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1540)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing Order No. 5 states:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right">
</td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>No
						  Minister of the Crown, nor party leader, shall be eligible for the election to
						  the Office of Speaker.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The office of Speaker is the highest office in this
					 room. Does that mean a leader of a coalition could be a candidate for Speaker?
					 I do not know, but we must realize the implication it would have were we to
					 make a decision in the House.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does it mean that an officer of the House who is not a
					 member of a party could be eligible for some of these offices? Again there are
					 repercussions to consider.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will draw Beauchesne's to the attention of the House.
					 Beauchesne's sixth edition refers to the role of party whips. This is
					 particularly important today because one of the debates before us is whether
					 someone who is not a member of a political party can be a whip for an entity,
					 whether we call that entity a party or something else.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beauchesne's sixth edition, citation 201(1)
					 states:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right">
</td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>Each
						  party has as one of its supporters a Member known as the Chief
						  Whip.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It does not say each coalition or anything else. It
					 says each party. It makes no reference to anything that is not a
					 party.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Citation 201(2) states:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right">
</td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>The
						  duties of the Whips are to keep their Members supplied with information
						  concerning the business of the House--</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The citation describes the role of party whips, not
					 other individuals.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will also draw to the attention of the Speaker
					 references from Marleau and Montpetit which I believe are helpful. Of course I
					 will recognize and respect how the Speaker adjudicates in the matter. However
					 the Speaker will know of the reference to the Parliament of Canada Act on page
					 30 of Marleau and Montpetit. It refers to financial benefits, which is
					 presumably an issue of interest here today. It states:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right">
</td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>With
						  regard to financial benefits, the Parliament of Canada Act provides
						  additional allowances to the Leader, the Whip and the House Leader of a party
						  that has a recognized membership--</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On page 31 it goes on to talk about financial support
					 to the caucus research units of recognized parties. It further
					 states:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right">
</td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>However, in recent practice, a procedural interpretation of the
						  definition “recognized party” has come to mean any party with 12 or more
						  Members in the House.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again the reference is to parties.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the conduct of question period, page 423 of Marleau
					 and Montpetit refers to: </p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right">
</td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>Members of a political party not officially recognized in the
						  House--</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It describes what these members would be if they
					 belonged to something other than an officially recognized political party.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is my interpretation that if there was a definition
					 of a group of people who are something other than a political party one would
					 find it on page 423 of Marleau and Montpetit. It is not there. Page 492 of
					 Marleau and Montpetit states the following:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right">
</td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>The
						  Whips of the other parties and Members without party affiliation usually rise
						  to indicate their agreement.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That means of course that the whips of the parties
					 speak for the group and those who are not members of the party must make their
					 identification individually because they are not members of the party. It
					 states on the same page:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right">
</td>
<td><small>--Members without party affiliation indicate how they wish to be
						  recorded.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is in the case of recorded divisions. Again there
					 is no mechanism for someone to speak on behalf of those who are not members of
					 a recognized political party. That is made quite clear here.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the pairing of members it is very interesting. There
					 is a well established procedure of the clerk having on his table a book
					 describing the duty of the whips of political parties with regard to
					 pairing.</p>


	<A NAME="T1545"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1545"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1550"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1540"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1545)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reference to party whips is at the bottom of page
					 492. It says whips can pair for their members. However there is no provision
					 that says a whip can speak in this form for someone who is not a member of
					 their party, coalition or other group by which they wish to be recognized
					 collectively. It refers only to parties. Anything else is deemed not to fit the
					 bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will draw to the attention of the House Bill C-28
					 which we recently passed in the House of Commons. It is a bill members will
					 recognize because it had to do with our salaries as MPs and senators. Page 4 of
					 the bill refers to party leaders with respect to salaries. It refers to the:
					 </p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right">
</td>
<td><small>--leader of a party that has a recognized membership of twelve
						  or more--</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again the reference is uniquely to a political party
					 and no other structure.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I drew to the House's attention references to Marleau
					 and Montpetit. The only item that remains, at least in my contribution, is the
					 issue of the bylaws of the Board of Internal Economy. The Board of Internal
					 Economy is free to change its bylaws just as the House is free to change its
					 laws. However until it has done so it is bound to interpret the laws under
					 which we currently operate and nothing else. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bylaw 302 defines a party as one which has been
					 recognized by the House and has a membership of 12 or more persons elected to
					 the House. Bylaw 302(6) refers to House officers of a recognized party and
					 describes some of their functions and so on. Again the reference is to a
					 political party.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, it is not for me to say whether
					 independent members should belong to one political party versus another in the
					 House. That is none of my business. We all recognize that. It is a decision
					 which members will make in their consciences and which we will respect.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a partisan way I could say it would be wrong either
					 way because I do not agree with it politically. However that is immaterial for
					 the purpose of what we have here. If members decide to join another party and
					 indicate they have done so, I for one would accept it, as I am sure would all
					 my colleagues. What other choice would we have? It would not be our business
					 beyond that. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However that has not even been advocated or brought to
					 the attention of the Speaker. No one today so far has suggested or asked that
					 independent members be recognized as members of their party. Unless that is
					 sought, asked for or presented, it is difficult for the Speaker and/or the
					 House to claim the proposition was brought forward because it was
					 not.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, I ask that you consider these arguments
					 along with several others you have heard. We will fully respect what you have
					 to say in this regard.</p>

					 NDP): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, a number of analogies and metaphors have
					 been employed today so I might best begin with a marital analogy as one who has
					 performed the odd wedding ceremony in my time. There is a question that is
					 customarily asked, and it is in fact required by law: If either of you know of
					 any reason why you should not be joined together in holy matrimony, you should
					 say so now or forever hold your peace. I am paraphrasing. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If that question were asked of the member for
					 Pictou--Antigonish--Guysborough and the member whom he still illegitimately
					 calls his whip, and I will not get into that, I do not think it would be
					 greeted with the silence with which it is normally greeted in any of the
					 ceremonies at which I have presided. The fact remains that members of the
					 so-called DRC already and still have another relationship, with the Alliance
					 Party.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They may not have a relationship with the Alliance
					 caucus, and I am sure this is a source of great weeping and gnashing of teeth
					 among members of the Alliance caucus, but the members of the DRC still have a
					 relationship with the Alliance Party.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think the House of Commons can be completely
					 isolated from what takes place outside it and from the status people enjoy
					 outside the House. The House of Commons is not a motel where we can check in
					 and pretend to be someone we are not or where we can have a relationship that
					 does not exist.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without wanting to put too fine a point on it, Mr.
					 Speaker, I think it is obligatory on your part to consider not only that
					 members of the so-called DRC still belong to another party but that this fact
					 must be taken into account when judging whether or not the DRC, which is
					 presenting itself as a parliamentary group and demanding the rights and
					 privileges of a party, should be treated as a party.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We might argue that even if members of the DRC were
					 fully divorced from their former family the so-called group would still not
					 qualify as a party unless and until its members made up their minds and joined
					 the Progressive Conservative Party. In that case we would have an entirely
					 different set of circumstances on which I am not prepared to comment at the
					 moment. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However that is not what we have before us. We have
					 before us the illegitimate proceeds of a rolling political orgy that took place
					 over the summer in which people made all kinds of relationships with each
					 other. It does not do parliament any good to have to figure this out on the
					 floor of the House of Commons.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad the member for
					 Pictou--Antigonish--Guysborough is immune from libel suits in the House of
					 Commons because he slandered me when he quoted my intervention of 1994 having
					 to do with the recognition of parties.</p>


	<A NAME="T1555"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1555"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1600"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1550"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1555)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I was talking about at that time was parties,
					 political parties like the New Democratic Party that was elected in the
					 election of 1993, nine of us, as New Democrats. We sat in the House as New
					 Democrats. We did not pretend to be someone else. We did not decide to be sort
					 of half this and half that. All we wanted at the time was procedural
					 recognition of ourselves as a party in this House, not a group, not a
					 coalition, not something else, but as the political party that we presented
					 ourselves as to the Canadian people and we wanted that recognized here. That is
					 fundamentally different than what is being requested by the member for
					 Pictou--Antigonish--Guysborough this day. It is not fair or accurate to compare
					 my argument at that time with the argument that is being made today.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier on the member for
					 Pictou--Antigonish--Guysborough, like his leader on television last night,
					 suggested that in some way or another they had already been working as a
					 coalition and had been recognized to some degree as a coalition in this House;
					 in question period and in voting. That is not true. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had a discussion yesterday and you will recall, Mr.
					 Speaker, that the reason that they are able to pretend they are a group is
					 because we had a precedent in this House wherein a previous parliament the
					 Reform Party granted certain of its questions to members of parliament who were
					 not members of its caucus, particularly the member for York South--Weston, if I
					 remember correctly. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the precedent which has permitted the
					 impression, but not the reality, of this group to my left, acting as a group
					 and claiming that some kind of precedent has been set. It is the same thing
					 with respect to the votes yesterday. If I am not mistaken, they voted
					 separately, one group after the other; first, the Progressive Conservative
					 Party and then the independents who call themselves the DRC.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this claim to be made that somehow what we are
					 debating today is whether or not to extend some sort of recognition that has
					 already been extended, is completely false. Even the fact that they are sitting
					 together is a form of parliamentary geographical coincidence. It is where
					 independents would sit.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I would certainly urge upon you
					 to in no way accept that somehow what we are doing today here is debating
					 whether or not to expand a recognition that already exists. There is no
					 recognition that already exists.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we are debating is whether or not this particular
					 self-defined group should in fact make history, and make bad history I would
					 suggest, by being recognized as a coalition that has the rights and privileges
					 of a party, because it is certainly not a party. Even if they were to claim
					 successfully the rights and privileges of a party they would still not be a
					 political party. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would have done something entirely new which I would
					 suggest, Mr. Speaker, holds a great deal of negative potential for the House of
					 Commons. I urge you to think about that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also urge you, Mr. Speaker, to think about, and this
					 is something that I know you will be thinking about in any event, whether or
					 not this is actually in the purview of the Speaker to decide. Having to do with
					 the question of whether or not they are a party and all the precedents and all
					 the argumentation cited by the government House leader, I would certainly want
					 to associate myself with them. The standing orders, Beauchesne's, the Board of
					 Internal Economy, wherever you want to look, Mr. Speaker, talk about parties,
					 not coalitions. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member referred to a variety of names that people
					 have called themselves over the years, political configurations, a union, a
					 government, et cetera. They ran on those names. They did not make them up after
					 they got here. That is different.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the Bloc members left their respective
					 political parties. Individual members of the Bloc did not maintain memberships
					 in the Liberal and Conservative parties. </p>


	<A NAME="T1600"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1600"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1605"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1555"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1600)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact is there is no such thing as a political
					 entity in any of the documentation or jurisprudence that we have before us
					 today.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, back to the point of whether or not this is
					 within your purview to decide, Mr. Speaker, I want to be consistent here
					 because I argued in 1994 that it was within the purview of the Speaker to make
					 certain decisions to protect minority parties from the herd, so to speak.
					 Having been a victim of that herd mentality, I fully appreciate and reaffirm
					 the role of the Speaker to protect minority parties from that kind of
					 situation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not regard this situation as analogous or similar.
					 We have an entirely different situation here. We do not have a minority party
					 here. We have a configuration whose legitimacy as a party is in dispute and
					 which therefore would make it the very political decision that Speaker
					 MacNaughton warned against in 1963. It would be a political decision or have
					 the nature of a political decision in a way that had the Chair decided in
					 favour of my point of order in June 1994, it would not have been, for example,
					 a political decision in that way. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I urge caution on your part, as
					 to whether or not you want to consider that this is a matter for you or a
					 matter for the House to decide.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House has not decided this because there has not
					 been any meetings. Contrary to the impression left that somehow some attempt
					 was made to resolve this matter among the parties, there was no attempt made.
					 Of course it is very difficult to make that attempt when the very act of
					 meeting itself could in fact set precedents. However, we could have had a
					 discussion in the status quo context about what might be in a new context. That
					 was not even sought.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, this new group has thrown themselves upon
					 the mercy of the Chair. I ask the Chair to consider whether or not in fact it
					 is the role of the Chair. However, Mr. Speaker, if you consider it to be the
					 role of the Chair, then I ask you to consider all of the arguments that have
					 been made here today, including mine, as to the lack of wisdom that would
					 attend any decision to recognize the so-called PC/DRC in the way that they have
					 asked.</p>

					 at least extend the hours past this sort of thing to cover the issues that are
					 more important to the nation.</p>

				  </b>

	I think it is an inappropriate question at this

					 other business, there is an extension of an hour sought, that is fine. However,
					 given the imprecision of the hon. member's proposition at this point, might I
					 suggest we try to deal with this.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we are close to the end of the argument here. I
					 do not expect to hear much more. However, I think the hon. member for Fraser
					 Valley might want to say something in light of the fact that he is part of the
					 group that may have something to contribute to the discussion.</p>

					 PC/DR): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I can hardly wait to get on to the
					 business of the day, the modernization of parliament, which is of course
					 gripping the nation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the arguments I have heard, particularly from
					 the House leader of the New Democratic Party, seem to be based on when there is
					 no good argument, resort to humour and ribald humour is even better. Perhaps
					 someone will notice and maybe the media will put a member's funny clip on the
					 news, and we will all be better off for it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other parties too seem to think this is
					 light-hearted humour and, again, perhaps some ribald humour is even better.
					 However, there are big issues here today.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remind the House that when people quote from Marleau
					 and Montpetit, Marleau and Montpetit is a collection of the record of
					 precedents in the House. It is not an instruction book on what will happen,
					 especially when there is no precedent.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We recognize that today is a precedent setting day and
					 we are not pretending it is not. To quote Marleau and Montpetit and say they
					 have not dealt with it in the past, is simply not understanding the purpose of
					 that book. The book is a collection of precedents. Today will be another one
					 either way, whatever the ruling is, it will be again another ruling of
					 precedence.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who would argue that the Speaker should not make
					 decisions on behalf of the House, every day Mr. Speaker, you are called to make
					 decisions on behalf of the House. It is precisely because the Speaker has a
					 duty to rise above the interests of political entities in the House and address
					 these parliamentary activities that we have come to appeal to you
					 today.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House leader of the government side said that we
					 have not even been asked to have been recognized as a group as a coalition. You
					 know of course that that is not true, Mr. Speaker. You know that there is a
					 letter in your possession with 20 signatures on it stating precisely that, that
					 we do wish to be recognized as a coalition, as one entity. We have chosen one
					 parliamentary leader, one House leader, a whip and so on. The members of the
					 House should know that this has taken place.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is interesting too how much time has been spent
					 today in the presentations trying to mix apples and oranges. There was all
					 kinds of talk about the Elections Act and a bit of talk about the Parliament of
					 Canada Act. However, they are mixing the two.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we talk about resources in the House, we have not
					 talked today about monetary resources. That will be something that will be
					 negotiated, if ever, with the Board of Internal Economy. It is not something
					 that is done here in the House. It is always referred to the House leaders for
					 negotiations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To follow the logic of the House leader for the
					 Canadian Alliance who said that in the British practice if a member was not
					 elected under a certain standard he or she should not get any resources under a
					 certain name, then when the Reform Party changed its name to the Alliance, the
					 members would not have had any resources. Of course that is absurd. It did not
					 happen that way.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also interesting that, whether it is legislation
					 or standing orders, when we refer to all the quotes today about parties, they
					 are all in lower case; a party, an entity. We call ourselves a coalition.
					 Others might call themselves an alliance, which is perfectly fine. I remember
					 asking for that change. I did not want it to be called a party but rather an
					 alliance because the first principle of the Canadian Alliance was to form
					 coalitions. It was in the constitution of the party.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was also interesting that a recent mail out from the
					 Canadian Alliance to all its members asked if it should consider a merger with
					 the Tories or should it consider forming a coalition in the House of Commons.
					 To argue against it today, when the Canadian Alliance was asking its own
					 members if they wanted to form a coalition, does not seem consistent.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone has tried to point out that a coalition is for
					 governments and not for opposition parties. Says who, Mr. Speaker? Coalitions
					 are put together in order to make democracies work better.</p>


	<A NAME="T1605"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1605"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1610"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1600"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1605)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When coalitions function well, do not take resources
					 away from others and just allocate the current time in the House, allocate the
					 number of questions and allocate supply days, nobody loses. It is allocated
					 based on the number of people.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not asking for funds, but it was interesting when
					 I was negotiating assets such as House of Commons questions, supply days and
					 monetary issues this spring as House leader. Every single time I insisted it be
					 done on a per capita basis and other House leaders agreed. That is the proper
					 way to do it because of course it reflects in the best way the will of the
					 Canadian people who have sent their representatives to the House of
					 Commons.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will also point out that although much fuss has been
					 made about memberships in political parties, I would like to point out the
					 example of the member for Portage--Lisgar who holds memberships in both the
					 Progressive Conservative Party of Canada and the Canadian Alliance. I assume he
					 holds two memberships because he says he does. Not only does he hold two
					 memberships, but on his website and in his public speeches he encourages all of
					 us to buy memberships in two political parties. He has chosen to sit with the
					 Canadian Alliance and I accept that. That is his decision. However he has two
					 memberships in two different political parties and encourages others to do the
					 same. Again, I have no problem with that. He chooses to sit there and that is
					 fine. We choose to sit here and put together a coalition to advance common
					 themes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been expelled from the Canadian Alliance caucus
					 which is obviously a different status than being suspended. The whip sent a
					 letter to many of us saying that he no longer represents us. We are gonzo. We
					 are out of the whole frame of reference there.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There happen to be 8 members involved in this matter,
					 but what if there were 18 or 28 members? At what stage does it become
					 significant to the House? We could argue that maybe one person does not make
					 any difference in the House but once we start getting significant numbers of
					 people, it starts to affect the status. If we push it to the extreme, the
					 Leader of the Opposition could expel everybody from his caucus and sit there
					 with 16 questions a day and hundreds of thousands of dollars in assets, saying
					 “It is all mine”. That is simply untrue.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is different, and not because it takes away from the
					 New Democratic Party. No one is suggesting that a single question be taken away
					 from the New Democratic Party. It does not affect the Bloc Quebecois, not a
					 single question, not a single supply day, not a single difference in the order
					 of speaking in the House of Commons. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, what you have before you today is a group
					 of 20 people who say it is only right. We were elected to the House of Commons
					 to represent our constituents. By the way, I was elected under policies that
					 put my constituents above even the party. The best way to do that is to form a
					 coalition with 20 like-minded people who say it is time to get on with the
					 business of the House and hold the government accountable in the best way
					 possible, in our opinion. To deny that coalition access, not to money because
					 nobody is talking about that today—others are but none of us are—but to deny us
					 access to questions, to membership on committees, to a certain number of
					 debating spots, is to say to several million people who supported these 20
					 members of parliament that we just do not rank, that we not get the same
					 ranking as any other member of parliament. That is unacceptable.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To just finish off with the language issue, the
					 government House leader said that the standing orders are silent on the word
					 coalition. When the House is saying party in those standing orders, it is
					 talking about a political entity in the House.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was first elected in 1993 and came to the House in
					 1994. The first thing we said was that we did not want to have a whip. We
					 wanted to have a caucus co-ordinator. I believe, Mr. Speaker, that you will
					 remember that. This was an attempt to try to describe the role given to that
					 position, which is to co-ordinate the activities of the group. </p>


	<A NAME="T1610"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1610"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1615"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1605"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1610)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The standing orders are completely silent on the term
					 caucus co-ordinator. It does not exist in the Parliament of Canada Act as far
					 as the extra salary to a caucus co-ordinator. It does not exist that the caucus
					 co-ordinator meets with other caucus co-ordinators. It talks about whips
					 because it is the tradition of the House to call them whips.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, you can call them whatever you want. In
					 1994 we called them caucus co-ordinators. We then changed it back after a few
					 years to whip but no one cared. The whip got the salary. The whip budget was
					 intact. The whip did the job whether called a caucus co-ordinator or a
					 whip.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we call ourselves a coalition it is because we are
					 like-minded people intent upon advancing like-minded principles in the House of
					 Commons. We want to do that because we think it is in the best interest of
					 democracy. Because it makes no difference to the other political parties that
					 will not get shortchanged, I ask you to consider it favourably and consider
					 these arguments instead of perhaps some of the humour, which I thought was less
					 than ideal but passed as argument earlier, and grant us the status as a
					 coalition of 20 here in the House of Commons.</p>

	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However I also feel that this matter is of some

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also want to say that I appreciate the co-operation

					 until today in a reasonable way. I appreciate the fact that it has taken some
					 forbearance on the part of all members to deal with the situation that the
					 House was confronted with on Monday morning at 11 o'clock.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to thank hon. members for their co-operation in
					 that regard. I assume that the arrangements currently in place will remain in

	Mr. Speaker, I move that the first report of the
					 Standing Committee on National Defence and Veterans Affairs be concurred in.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I draw attention to a number of issues that relate to
					 the government's intentions and requirements in the coming weeks.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time in this debate
					 with my colleague, the member for Saint John.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The report was originally presented to the House on
					 June 14, 2000, during the second session of the 36th Parliament. The report was
					 a major study of the procurement by national defence and it outlined many of
					 the needs of the military.</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The level of preparedness of Canada's armed forces has
					 been deteriorating continually since this government came to office.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government's only military plan is simply to hope
					 that no crisis occurs, that there is no need for the Canadian
					 Forces.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we have a crisis before us. The terrorist attacks
					 on New York City and Washington show that there is no limit to what may be made
					 a target. The target can even be in North America.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The information we have received from our security
					 intelligence services establishes clearly that terrorist cells may be found
					 even here in Canada. This has been confirmed by the leaders of other nations,
					 as it was yesterday by the king of Jordan. Our own Prime Minister did not want
					 to tell Canadians all the facts about terrorists. He did not level with
					 Canadians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead, CNN, the American network, confirms for us
					 what our agencies and services are saying in this regard.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government was informed in June that terrorists
					 would become more dangerous and more determined. There was an indication that
					 Canada was a target. Canadians want to share in the fight against terrorism. We
					 want to win this battle and we know very well that among those first called on
					 to fight the fight will be the men and women of our armed forces.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We ask them to give up their lives in a time of crisis,
					 but this government starved them when they needed new equipment, better working
					 conditions and more support.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister has been invited to Washington. He
					 follows President Chirac, Prime Minister Blair and other heads of state. Our
					 Prime Minister follows behind the parade, because Canada has failed to maintain
					 the level of its international commitments, which our allies count
					 on.</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Prime Minister goes to Washington, we know
					 what he will be asked. He will be asked to stop the movement of terrorists to
					 and from Canada. He will be asked to extradite or to deport people who are
					 wanted for crimes related to terrorism. He will be asked to curtail the flow of
					 money to terrorists or their organizations, and he will be asked to share
					 intelligence and defence capacities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Insofar as defence is concerned, the embarrassing
					 question for Canada is, what resources do we have to share?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me quote from an article by Jeffrey Simpson in the
					 <i>Globe and Mail</i> this morning entitled “Canada's help: Who are we
					 kidding?”:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>The U.S. knows the lamentable state
						  of our military and has periodically complained about it. Canada had one ship
						  in the Persian Gulf, but it has returned home. The navy has frigates, but they
						  remain without helicopters, courtesy of the Chrétien government's cancelling of
						  a contract agreed to by the Mulroney government nine years ago. Ottawa has yet
						  to issue detailed requests for proposals for these helicopters.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The article goes on:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>The army has a few special units but
						  lacks sufficient equipment and men to be effective in any dangerous operation.
						  The air force has CF-18s but lacks in-air refuelling capabilities and some

						  that the Chrétien government's support for any military fight against terrorism
						  will necessarily be limited. </small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That commentary is by an objective journalist and
					 commentator.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have no long range tanker aircraft to get our
					 fighter aircraft overseas. Our Hercules transport fleet is aging. Without
					 tankers, it will be difficult for Canadian fighter aircraft to get overseas.
					 The 1st Battalion Royal 22nd Regiment in Quebec is ready for deployment, but it
					 is not a special forces unit. It lacks transport for rapid deployment and would
					 have to go without its heavy weapons. Most of our forces are committed already
					 in peacekeeping operations around the world. Our armoured corps is outdated and
					 our tanks do not have the armour or the armament to stand up to handheld
					 weapons, the sort of weapons terrorists use.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 1994 white paper on defence called for Canada to
					 contribute a brigade size force of about 5,000 men for sustained overseas
					 operations. We are not capable of carrying out that commitment, according to
					 retired Major-General Lewis MacKenzie.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian navy is the best off of our three services
					 but it lacks modern, robust maritime helicopters, key to surface actions. It is
					 understaffed and it lacks financial resources.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are paying a price today for a lack of preparation
					 in the last nine years. The matter we are calling upon to debate, the committee
					 report we are discussing today, itemizes ways in which Canada can move forward
					 and become a respectable military force in the world again. We cannot simply
					 sit back and engage commitments unless we are prepared to accept them. We are
					 facing a commitment now and we are not in a position to do as well as Canada
					 should be doing.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to pass my debate time now to the hon.
					 member for Saint John.</p>

					 PC/DR): </b>

	Madam Speaker, I am a member of the Standing Committee
					 on National Defence and Veterans Affairs. I have had the opportunity since 1993
					 to work on defence and veterans affairs issues and to review in the last couple
					 of years in great detail the state of readiness of our armed forces.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retired generals and retired colonels came to our
					 committee and made presentations. I wish the Minister of National Defence, the
					 Minister of Finance and the Prime Minister had been there to hear what they had
					 to say about our armed forces and the needs that are not being addressed by the
					 government that should be.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am confident in my belief that our men and women in
					 uniform are without some of the essential equipment they might well require in
					 this new war against terrorism. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House will recall that since my election as an MP
					 in 1993 I have repeatedly risen on the replacement of the Sea King helicopters.
					 As everyone in the House knows, there were those who lost their lives because
					 we did not get the EH-101s to replace those Sea Kings. Members of my family
					 have said to me, “Please get out and fight for the replacement of those Sea
					 Kings”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House knows that I have remained firm in my belief
					 that the government has been more concerned with the political consequences
					 that would follow the replacement of the Sea Kings with the EH-101s and not the
					 military factors that make their replacement so essential.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many here in the House and indeed many in the other
					 place have questioned the government's lack of action in providing our armed
					 forces personnel with the best equipment possible for the tasks we assign
					 them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1999 a report by CSIS said that there were 50
					 terrorist groups in Canada and they had 350 people working with them. Instead
					 of the government doing something about it, what did it do? It laid off 750
					 CSIS employees. Instead of increasing the numbers to look after the safety of
					 Canadians, 750 employees were laid off.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our concerns are not political in nature. Rather, we
					 recognize that our men and women in uniform are not in a position to come to
					 Parliament Hill with placards when their funding is cut. We know that our men
					 and women in uniform are going to the food banks. We are aware that when they
					 came back from peacekeeping missions they were told on the airplane to take off
					 their boots because they had to pass them to the men and women who were going
					 to replace them. Imagine that here in Canada there is not enough money in the
					 budget to even give uniforms and boots to our armed forces. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A senator who went over to Kosovo said that when he saw
					 our peacekeepers he could not believe it when he looked at their uniforms. He
					 could not believe the lack of resources that they had. Our armed forces have
					 repeatedly shown their selfless desire to complete their duties without
					 hesitation. In return we must insist that the government honour its duty to
					 them by providing the tools they require.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those of us who have advocated increased spending for
					 our military have in the past been called alarmists. It has been said in the
					 House that we live in a post cold war world that does not require us to be as
					 vigilant as we once had to be. Last week tells us differently now. No one in
					 Canada could have predicted the events of last week, and no one in the U.S.A.
					 However those events have served as a vicious reminder that we can never allow
					 ourselves to lower our guard.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fiscal year 1993-94 the budget for the Department of
					 National Defence was $12 billion. That budget was stripped down to a scandalous
					 $9.4 billion by 1998. We would be wise to bear in mind and consider that it was
					 during the period of these massive cuts that our armed forces operational
					 tempo, the ratio of time spent by our Canadian forces personnel in deployed
					 missions, rose from 6% to 23%.</p>


	<A NAME="T1635"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1635"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1640"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1630"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1635)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, on the eve of the most important conflict since
					 the second world war, we are witnessing firsthand the price of those deep cuts.
					 The government has as its policy to maintain a regular force of no fewer than
					 60,000. Yet, as we stand here today, the actual number has dropped below
					 55,000. Our forces have been called to duty in almost every corner of the
					 globe, to the point where we have made unreasonable demands of our most loyal
					 citizens and their families.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of our armed forces equipment has been found to be
					 either unsafe or in need of significant repair each and every time it is to be
					 used. As hon. members are aware, we have frigates that were built in Saint
					 John, New Brunswick. We were supposed to have modified helicopters and that was
					 not done because of the cuts.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unanimous report was brought forth by our defence
					 committee with all party support. It said that we should continue, on an
					 ongoing rotational basis, the building of navy ships right here in Canada,
					 whether by MIL Davie Inc. or Saint John Shipbuilding Limited.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was down in the United States just a week before
					 that horrible attack I met with Vice-President Cheney and I raised the Jones
					 act. I want it on the record that he agreed with me it was time to address the
					 Jones act whereby we cannot bid when ships are being built in the United States
					 but they can bid on all our contracts.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should not be buying used submarines from London,
					 England, that cannot float. We then pay $800 million to make them float. We
					 should be putting our own people to work. We should be building our ships and
					 giving our navy the tools to do the job. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House will recall the disturbing reports of rusting
					 and missing parts on helicopters and aircraft like the CF-18. Lives have been
					 lost. We must make sure that no more lives are lost in Canada because our men
					 do not have modern tools to do their job.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Standing Committee on National Defence and Veterans
					 Affairs has repeatedly made all party unanimous recommendations to the
					 government in support of more funding and better equipment for our military.
					 Many of us have been encouraged to hear the Minister of Finance indicate that
					 from this day forward no expense would be spared to ensure the safety and
					 security of Canada and our people. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One might ask if we should have been more diligent in
					 the past in maintaining the funding levels at a rate where our operational
					 readiness was not a point of debate. One might also ask if we should have
					 encouraged that state of mind when approaching major equipment purchases like
					 the ongoing process to replace our Sea King helicopters. What the government is
					 proposing as replacements for those Sea King helicopters are not really
					 replacements as they cannot do the job that the Sea Kings could do. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House will know that the government's instructions
					 are that the procurement process be directed on the basis of the lowest price
					 compliant bid despite the fact that Treasury Board guidelines require such
					 programs to operate under the provisions of a best value principle.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is difficult, if not impossible, for us to predict
					 what our military needs will be in the coming months. All we know for certain
					 is that our armed forces and our country as a whole must be prepared for the
					 worst. It is no longer acceptable for us to assume that the United States will
					 protect us just as it is no longer possible for us to take comfort in the fact
					 that the cold war has ended.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sentiment I rise to express today, one of deep
					 respect for our Canadian armed forces coupled with distress at our government's
					 inaction, is one that is shared by a legion of retired military personnel who
					 have committed their years out of uniform to the protection and promotion of
					 those who remain in uniform today. Let us learn from those who have firsthand
					 experience in these matters and let us listen to them. Let us put their wise
					 counsel into practice and let us prove to the world that our armed forces are
					 indeed a force to be reckoned with.</p>


	<A NAME="T1640"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1640"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1645"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1635"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1640)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many in the world today who hate Canada
					 simply because we are a democracy and friends of the U.S. There are groups with
					 arsenals of weaponry who would do us harm solely because we value freedom,
					 liberty and human rights above all else.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing that makes their existence more
					 frightening is that we cannot say for certain where they are. The events of
					 last week have shown us that despite the best intelligence gathering available
					 these terrorist threats can strike whenever and wherever they want. Those who
					 would do our country, our continent and our friends harm should know that the
					 Canadian armed forces will respond. Those who would seek to end our way of life
					 should think twice about doing so, fearful of the protection we have afforded
					 ourselves.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reality is that the world knows that Canada's
					 military power is not what it used to be. In the time since the House last sat
					 the American ambassador himself issued a friendly but stern reminder to us that
					 we have defence related obligations to our friends and allies that cannot be
					 forgotten. We cannot take comfort in the security our relationship with the
					 U.S. provides us and then not rise to the occasion when it asks for our
					 help.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last week, in mourning the loss of the 5,000 innocent
					 victims of this tragedy, our nation showed its infinite capacity for
					 compassion. As the nations of the world prepare for a battle between the forces
					 of good and evil let us remind them why we are known for our courage. We will
					 be there to assist.</p>

	Madam Speaker, I commend my friend from Saint John for
					 her longstanding and passionate advocacy of the need for our country to place
					 much greater emphasis on our capacity to defend ourselves and advance our
					 national sovereignty. She is certainly a very principled advocate of
					 that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agreed with her remarks with the exception of her
					 comment on procurement programs such as shipbuilding for national defence. I
					 inferred from her comments that she was suggesting we ought to procure
					 equipment in Canada as a sort of industrial policy. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a concern to me because it seems that the
					 objective in providing a strong national defence and maximizing our scarce
					 resources ought to be to seek the best available equipment at the lowest
					 possible price, even if that means tendering defence procurement contracts
					 overseas.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does she think that if it costs us more to tender a
					 procurement contract for defence equipment to a domestic company that this is
					 in the best interest of advancing our capacity to defend ourselves and
					 maximizing those scarce tax dollars?</p>

					 frigates was received by Saint John, New Brunswick, and MIL Davie Inc., they
					 started to age after 10 years. We are saying one ship a year, whether it be for
					 the coast guard, the navy or whatever. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also saying that we should be bidding on the
					 contracts in the United States. The Jones act has blocked us. We were the first
					 ones to go to the U.S. when Ambassador Chrétien was there. I asked him if he
					 was dealing with the Jones act and he replied that he had never been asked.
					 When we went down this time to see the new Canadian ambassador he too said that
					 he had never been asked. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we went to see Vice-President Cheney he said he
					 was glad we had raised it because it was not right. Canada should have the
					 opportunity to bid down there, build those ships in Canada, and put our people
					 back to work. We have the most modern shipyard anywhere in the world sitting
					 idle right now because we do not have a navy shipbuilding policy, and we can
					 build ships cheaper than anyone else.</p>

	Madam Speaker, I too thank the hon. member for her
					 remarks. One of the things I would like her to address is a policy that is
					 followed by other countries. I am thinking specifically right now of Australia.
					 It does not do what this government does and say “This is the funding for this
					 year”, and then slash a billion or so out of it the following year and tell us
					 that we will just have to make do. It provides long range funding. The military
					 budget is not just a line budget that can be cut up or added to. One cannot
					 build an armed forces that way.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I used Australia as an example but many countries in
					 the world provide long term funding because they realize what a military needs.
					 It needs surety in its planning. It needs reliable funding because it does not
					 raise its own funds. It relies upon parliament. It does not do what the
					 government does here, which is to make it a political football where it slashes
					 even below its own targeted number of troops and equipment revitalization and
					 renewal.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some say the military should be taken out of the
					 political realm and given long range stable funding so it can plan its future.
					 Then when we ask the men and women of the armed forces to go and do the job
					 they have the tools because they were given the long term funding to make it
					 happen.</p>

	Madam Speaker, I will not take much time to debate this
					 report. I wish the House had not considered this report today for a number of
					 reasons. First, the report was tabled on June 12. Anyone who has read the
					 modernization committee report would know that moving concurrence in a report
					 where the government has been asked for a response and not had an opportunity

				  </b>

	Madam Speaker, if the hon. member is asking if I intend
					 to move to orders of the day, it would be pointless because by the time the
					 bells rang there would be no time to do so. If he is asking if I intend to do
					 that so the Speaker could rule on Standing Order 52, unfortunately it cannot
					 happen because the time has been used up with things that are certainly not the
					 ones I would have asked for. I believe that answers the hon. member's
					 question.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It does not take away from the legitimacy of the issue
					 I wanted to raise because it is an important one. No doubt the Speaker in time
					 will respond to it. Meanwhile I only wish to take a moment to indicate my
					 remarks to the House and to let other members respond if they wish. If not,
					 hopefully the debate will collapse and we will move to orders of the day as we
					 should have, in my opinion, half an hour ago. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just want to indicate that the government's response
					 should come within 150 days or by November 9. It would be even sooner under the
					 new rules that we could be concurring in later this day with everyone's
					 co-operation, given that it was a unanimous report.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government fully intends to table its response
					 within the time period. It would be inappropriate to concur in a report before
					 we have even responded to it. In other words there is nothing to concur in, if
					 I can put it that way to the House.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those are all the remarks I wanted to make. Hopefully
					 the House will agree now to move to orders of the day. We probably will not be
					 completing the consideration of the modernization report, but at least we could
					 start it and do the productive work we have been sent here to do by
					 Canadians.</p>

	Madam Speaker, I have a question for the government

					 the Prime Minister of Canada. If we were to have started production today, we
					 would have waited almost 30 years. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could the minister provide a legitimate reason that the
					 replacement of those Sea Kings helicopters has taken so long? Why did the
					 government spend so much money cancelling the Sea Kings that obviously were
					 part of the ongoing election campaign in 1993?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the points I want to make is the fact that the
					 government spent $500 million to simply cancel the helicopter contract. In
					 other words, it was half a billion dollars to simply cancel the contract with
					 not one helicopter being built. How does the government leader justify that
					 kind of expense?</p>

				  </b>

	Madam Speaker, I guess you are ruling that question in
					 order. The questions normally are on the speeches people have made. I do not
					 believe I have discussed the procurement for maritime helicopters.
					 Nevertheless, if it pleases the House to discuss that I am certainly pleased to
					 answer the hon. member's question.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the hon. member had the unfortunate
					 experience of being a member of the Conservative government of Brian Mulroney.
					 I really pity him for that. It is a most unfortunate thing. The Conservatives,
					 I believe, wanted to waste an amount of over $6 billion that we did not even
					 have at the time to buy helicopters that were way beyond our means. The
					 government was broke. It had $42 billion of deficit on account of it own
					 mismanagement.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday we heard the Minister of Finance inform us of
					 the historic developments of repaying this year of $17 billion of owed debt
					 accumulated by the Mulroney government of which the hon. member was a member.
					 It was a most unfortunate thing and I know the member is trying to forget
					 that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of the helicopter procurement, the House will
					 know that we have bought a number of search and rescue helicopters. The other
					 project, the maritime helicopter project, should be completed around 2005, I am
					 informed. That will be done.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, we are maintaining the helicopters that we
					 have, the Sea Kings. We know they meet the safety standards that we have. We do
					 want to replace them with helicopters that will meet our needs but they must be
					 ones that we can afford because we do not buy things for which we cannot pay
					 the way the previous government did.</p>

					 PC/DR): </b>

	Madam Speaker, I would like to run through a few
					 numbers with the government House leader. He said that the Tory-Conservative
					 program for the EH-101s was $6 billion. He will know that I was not a member of
					 that minority government and I would like to ask him a couple of questions
					 about the math on the Liberal side.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The EH-101 cancellation fees were $500 million. The Sea
					 King maintenance and upgrades to the year 2008 amounts to $600 million.
					 Canada's search helicopter program consisting of 15 helicopters is $790
					 million. The CSH long term service support over 25 years is $1.7 billion. These
					 are Liberal numbers. The maritime helicopter project consisting of 28
					 helicopters was $2.9 billion.The MHP long term service support over 25 years
					 was another $1.7 billion. The administrative cost in splitting that procurement
					 was $400 million. The total cost of Liberal programs with zero inflation was
					 $8.6 billion.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are still zero helicopters in that of course and
					 he is talking about the Conservative program for the 43 EH-101s being $6
					 billion. That is an extra $2 billion plus. That is an amazing amount of
					 money.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about the lives of the pilots? Of course we could
					 never ever put a dollar figure on that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would the government House leader somehow explain and
					 try to justify that since 1978, under the Liberal government of Trudeau,
					 cabinet acknowledged the need to replace the Sea King when in fact those
					 machines had gone into service in 1963. Even after only 15 years of service the
					 Trudeau government said there was a need to replace the Sea King. The Sea Kings
					 have outlasted Trudeau.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could the government House leader explain that for us,
					 please?</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was a member of the Royal Canadian Air Force in the
					 early 1960s, the time in which the Sea Kings were first purchased. The

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In light of recent events and not knowing what our
					 deployment requirements will be in this tragic event that has been unfolding,
					 what kind of impact will our Sea King helicopters have on our military? Will
					 the present Sea King helicopters be considered frontline serviceable? If not,
					 what does that do to our frigates, which are designed to carry frontline
					 helicopters?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will both of those units be relegated to home shore use
					 because they are not frontline capable? In other words, would we seriously send
					 into frontline duty 40 year old Sea King helicopters with our frigates? Is that
					 what we intend to do if called upon?</p>

				  </b>

	Madam Speaker, we have had a series of questions here
					 from the hon. member across the way. The savings for Canadians from the
					 combined purchase of the maritime and search and rescue helicopters is in the
					 order of $1.5 billion. That is the savings we will generate by the careful
					 management of taxpayer dollars.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of the Sea Kings and the fact that we have
					 flown those particular aircraft, it is an aircraft that is used right around
					 the world. The Sea Kings are still a viable aircraft. We are replacing them.
					 The date of replacement has been scheduled I believe for 2005. I believe that
					 target date is still expected to be met. That is still the intention of the
					 government in that regard. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was not quite sure in the way the hon. member asked
					 his question about the frigate whether he was suggesting that the ship is not
					 an ultra modern vehicle. I happen to believe that it is a worldclass ship. I
					 have been on board. I stayed for days on that ship with members of our armed
					 forces in Esquimalt and in the training areas around Nanoose. I saw myself how
					 that particular ship functions. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was not a long time ago that there were frigates.
					 The HMCS <i>Ottawa</i> is a very modern ship. I am sure the hon. member across
					 the way, who knows a lot about things military, will acknowledge that.

					 Canadian Alliance): </b>

	Madam Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to
					 rise in debate in support of this concurrence motion for the report of the
					 Standing Committee on National Defence and Veterans Affairs at this
					 particularly prescient moment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said in my remarks on the motion before the House
					 regarding the tragedy that struck the United States last week, the whole world
					 has changed dramatically, particularly the world in terms of strategic
					 considerations for free countries such as Canada, for NATO countries in
					 particular. Yet the dramatic new realities we face, particularly on the
					 strategic front, have not in any way been reflected by the
					 government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us start from first principles. The first
					 responsibility of a national and federal government is the maintenance and
					 protection of national sovereignty. It is not one among competing objectives.
					 It is not some nice to do thing that finds its way onto the list of government
					 programs. It is the first principal responsibility of a national
					 government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are dozens, probably hundreds of programs
					 administered by the federal government at taxpayers' expense where the federal
					 government has no constitutional responsibility. Yet it has neglected its
					 principal, its first, its primary responsibility year after year, and not just
					 this government but its predecessor governments going back nearly four
					 decades.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the second world war ended Canada had the third
					 largest navy in the world. The Royal Canadian Air Force was regarded as perhaps
					 the most respected military air force in the world. Our ground troops had
					 punched far beyond their weight in the ground war in Europe and in military
					 actions in the Pacific theatre in that war. We finished that terrible five year
					 conflict proud as a nation of the tremendous contribution we had made,
					 marshalling our national resources, tragically sacrificing so much Canadian
					 blood but for a noble objective.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the past 30 years, and particularly under the
					 Liberal government for the past 8 or 9 years, we have seen that proud military
					 tradition and our ability to do our moral duty eroded by indifference, eroded
					 by the wrong priorities, eroded by a federal government that does not recognize
					 the safety and security of its citizens and the protection of its national
					 sovereignty as its primary objective.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between the years 1994 and 1999 the government
					 exercised a modest expenditure restraint program. Mainly it raised revenues and
					 raised taxes to address the crushing deficit, but it did restrain program
					 spending in certain areas. Again, however, the way in which it cut reflected
					 its complete perversion of priorities because it cut defence spending by over
					 20% at a time when non-defence department program spending was cut by only
					 3%.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What this indicates is that the first primary
					 responsibility of the federal government was cut most deeply and the lower
					 priority areas which are not even contemplated in the constitution as federal
					 responsibilities were barely touched at all. This is the world turned upside
					 down in terms of public responsibilities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam Speaker, I neglected to mention that I will be
					 splitting my time.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are left in the regrettable situation whereby Canada
					 reinvests less than half among the average of NATO countries in defence
					 expenditures as a percentage of gross domestic product. Our 19 NATO allies on
					 average spend 2.1% of their gross domestic product in defence of national
					 sovereignty whereas Canada spends only 1.2% of GDP, giving us the second lowest
					 defence expenditure in NATO, ahead of only the tiny duchy of Luxembourg with a
					 military force of 800 people.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have become, notwithstanding the tremendously
					 hardworking, skilled, dedicated and patriotic people in our military force, a
					 token player at best in the military alliance in which we, as one of the
					 world's largest economies, the most prosperous nations, have a moral
					 responsibility to be a bulwark in.</p>


	<A NAME="T1705"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1705"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1710"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1700"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1705)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have the seventh largest gross domestic product in
					 the world, a great blessing for a small country, and an enormously prosperous
					 standard of living and national wealth. However, while we have the seventh
					 largest gross domestic product, we have the twenty-sixth largest defence
					 investment and we are 18th of out of the 19 NATO countries.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a complete betrayal of our national tradition
					 as a country that is willing to invest resources to at least do our share, if
					 not more than our share, to defend democracy and peace here and
					 abroad.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look at the particulars raised by some of my colleagues
					 earlier in the debate that have been discussed at the defence committee.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, according to the 1994 defence white
					 paper, we are supposed to be able to field at least a brigade of 5,500 ground
					 troops abroad at a high state of readiness in a conventional conflict. It is
					 absolutely clear that we do not have the capacity to do so right now, according
					 to every expert in our defence. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only 83 of our 120-some fighter craft CF-18s are
					 operational and virtually none of those fighter craft have modern, contemporary
					 radar and electronics equipment systems which are critical, indispensable, to
					 engaging in modern air combat.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have no lift capacity for our ground troops. Even if
					 we had 5,500 troops that we could put on the ground at a high state of
					 readiness, in the words of retired Major-General Lewis MacKenzie we would have
					 to hitch a ride and take a taxi from American aircraft in order to transport
					 our troops to a theatre of conflict.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our much celebrated frigate fleet cannot even put to
					 sea simultaneously. Often one sees those frigates tied up in Halifax or
					 Esquimalt because they do not even have a budget for fuel to operate for the
					 course of an entire month. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an embarrassment and it is a humiliation to the
					 men and women who risk their lives to defend our national
					 sovereignty.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ten years ago, we had a defence force smaller than our
					 share of 90,000 people in our military, now down to 55,000. We have essentially
					 halved our commitment. We have done this, I believe, because it reflects a
					 philosophical attitude of the Liberal government that investments in national
					 defence and protection of sovereignty are not a priority, that it is a
					 frivolous occupation of would be warmongers and that the second war was the war
					 to end all wars. That was folly between 1918 and 1939. Equally it is folly
					 today, as we have seen from last week's events.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regrettably, I heard the defence minister virtually
					 dismiss out of hand in question period the other day the notion that there
					 would be a conventional war as a result of the attack on America and the free
					 world last week. When pressed as to why he made this assumption he had no clear
					 answer.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to close by saying that we may very well,
					 as a free nation in NATO, find ourselves in the midst of not just one
					 conventional conflict but potentially serial conventional conflicts over the
					 coming years. We do not know, but it is our moral responsibility to be prepared
					 for that eventuality and to do so means that we must fundamentally reorder the
					 priorities of the federal government to at least do our share. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To do that, even to have the average military
					 expenditure amongst NATO countries would mean a $9 billion increase in our
					 defence budget. That is a huge line item, but we must begin to think about the
					 magnitude of reordering our priorities, to do our share and to do our military
					 men and women proud as well as preserving our rich tradition as a defender of
					 democracy and freedom.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This summer I had the opportunity to go on a resupply

					 could find the resources necessary to provide that equipment and so much more
					 equipment that is necessary by reallocating resources as I suggested to reflect
					 what our national priorities ought to be, particularly at this time of
					 crisis.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past our party has recommended at least an
					 immediate additional funding commitment of $1 billion to the Department of
					 National Defence in order to procure the sort of equipment to which my hon.
					 friend refers. We would find those resources for national defence and
					 additional resources on top of that by taking those dollars away from
					 frivolous, low priority programs. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are unable to provide the kind of equipment my
					 friend is talking about, yet the Minister of Industry is speculating on
					 creating a $3 billion program to subsidize access to high speed broadband
					 Internet in Canada. That is not a federal responsibility. It is a
					 responsibility of the marketplace. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or there is the Minister of Multiculturalism, who just
					 spent $4 million in tax dollars sending professional members of lobby groups
					 and friends of hers to the outrageous Durban conference in South Africa to stay
					 in four star and five star hotels at taxpayers' expense and involve themselves
					 in a disgraceful gabfest surrounded by anti-Semitism in various forms.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those are the kinds of spending priorities reflected by
					 the government. Those are dollars spent on corporate welfare: economic
					 development programs that do not work and do not create jobs, and handouts to
					 Liberal lobby groups. These are dollars that could be going to our highest
					 national priority, defence.</p>

				  </b>

	Madam Speaker, I am entering rather quickly into the
					 debate on military procurement. There is one question that arises due to the
					 circumstances of September 11, and that is with regard to the Shearwater air
					 base in my riding.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very soon a decision will be made by DND to divest
					 itself of the 1,100 acres of land on which Shearwater is located. The problem
					 is not that it is virgin land or land that cannot be used. There is an
					 extremely long runway on that air base. For years I have been trying to protect
					 that base from any kind of downloading or off-loading, because it not only
					 represents 1,200 direct jobs in my riding, it also represents a jewel in the
					 crown of the military infrastructure. It has been there for 83
					 years.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We never know what may happen down the road and heaven
					 forbid that there may be serious long term consequences as a result of the
					 tragedy on September 11. My question for the hon. member is, due to the
					 circumstances surrounding September 11, would it not be prudent for the
					 Minister of National Defence to hold off on any divestiture of land similar to
					 Shearwater until further decisions can be made? Would he not agree that would
					 be a wise move at this time?</p>

				  </b>

	Madam Speaker, I thank my hon. friend for his question.
					 I do not know the particulars surrounding the Shearwater base, but he makes a
					 reasonable point. As we are now clearly having to reassess our military
					 priorities and expenditures, I think it would be reasonable to suggest at least
					 a moratorium on further base closings. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do think, however, that where we have bases our
					 procurement policies in principle should be based on the operational needs of
					 our forces, to create maximum operational efficiency for the forces. Shearwater
					 may very well meet that criterion. I would support the hon. member in delaying
					 any closures until we can see in this new environment the need for bases of
					 that nature.</p>

					 Alliance): </b>

	Madam Speaker, I am pleased to speak to the concurrence
					 motion on the government's response to the defence committee's report. I have
					 seen a lot of government responses to committee reports and have seen several
					 reports put out by the defence committee. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have felt in the past that some of the responses were
					 weak, but frankly I have never seen a weaker response by a government to a
					 report of a committee made up of all parties in the House. I have never seen a
					 weaker response than the one we had to the procurement report. It is completely
					 unacceptable.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear that the government does not hold national
					 defence as a top priority. The Canadian forces are the largest security force
					 we have in the country. Yet we see the kind of weak response we got to the
					 committee's report on procurement. It is completely unacceptable.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we see this kind of response we know the
					 government does not believe we need a strong national defence. If it did it
					 would give a serious response to a report like this one. It can be well
					 demonstrated that the government does not place national security and defence
					 as a high priority.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can start with the commitment to the number of
					 personnel in the forces. Since the Liberal government took office the number of
					 personnel in the Canadian armed forces has dropped from 90,000 to 55,000 and is
					 still dropping. According to a report put out a few months ago by the Canadian
					 Institute of Strategic Studies the number will reach 42,000 before the
					 government can stop it. It will have gone from 90,000 down to 42,000. The
					 government is more than halving armed forces personnel. That is completely
					 unacceptable. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope and pray the government finds a way to stop this
					 rapid slide. We are losing some of our best people. This kind of drop in
					 personnel shows a lack of commitment to national defence.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is funding. Money is not everything
					 but it could certainly be spent much better. There is a great need for better
					 management and in some cases better leadership in our defence department. We
					 need these things. The money we have could be quite a bit better spent
					 .</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the contracting is suspect. Some of it, such as
					 single source contracting and that kind of thing, is completely unacceptable.
					 We are paying more than we should for equipment in some cases. We know what
					 happened with the Sea King replacements. The Liberal government cost the
					 taxpayer money by backing out of the deal put in place by the former
					 government. We cannot afford to lose that kind of money. In spite of all that,
					 the government has cut spending to national defence by 30% in real terms since
					 it took office. That is the kind of commitment the Liberals have to our
					 national security. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the top priority of the federal government?
					 What should it be? It should be the security of our nation. It should be the
					 protection of the citizens of Canada. Yet the government has cut military
					 personnel from 90,000 to 55,000 and it is still sliding. The government cut the
					 budget by 30% in real terms. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his last report the auditor general said the
					 government was $30 billion short of meeting its procurement commitments. In
					 terms of procurement it will be $30 billion short by 2012.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the government is not planning and does not put
					 a high priority on defence, it will be $30 billion short by 2012. Does that
					 sound like a government that puts a high priority on the security of the nation
					 and on national defence, the largest security force the country has? It does
					 not. That is a sad commentary.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not say this with any glee because the issue
					 should be non-partisan. It is too important to be a partisan issue. I am
					 looking to all members of the defence committee from all parties. I think
					 members will see the importance of this now that we have had this terrible act
					 of terrorism.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think members will agree to debate the issue in depth
					 and have a good discussion. Hopefully we will get a meaningful response from
					 the government on national defence. We cannot wait any more. It is too late to
					 deal with the situation in terms of immediate reaction.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I asked the minister today what Canada would be able to
					 contribute to a NATO force striking back against terrorism. That was my first
					 question and he gave no answer. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I asked the minister a second question. The minister
					 always refers to the F-18s and what we did in Kosovo. He points to this as our
					 great strength. I asked him how he would find pilots to fly the F-18s when we
					 have lost more than half our experienced pilots who flew in Kosovo.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our government has allowed it to happen. It has allowed
					 the airlines to steal our best pilots. They did not leave because of money.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did a survey in <i>Esprit de Corps</i> magazine which
					 I have not yet talked about in public. It asked why people have left the forces
					 over the last several years. They said they did not leave because of money or
					 low pay. They left because they felt the government did not believe their role
					 was an important one. They felt the government did not believe national defence
					 to be a high priority when it comes to the security of our nation. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have wonderful men and women serving in our forces.
					 They want to be recognized as playing an extremely important role. We have
					 among the best in the world. We truly do. All they want is to be recognized as
					 carrying out an important function. If the government recognized that it would
					 give them proper equipment so that when we sent them to the font lines they
					 would have the best. Right now they do not. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the government respected the work these people do it
					 would treat them well when they came back injured whether their injuries were
					 physical or psychological. Post-traumatic stress disorder has become a terrific
					 problem. We are losing a lot of our good men and women because of
					 it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A common complaint is that the government does not do
					 enough to help soldiers who come back injured. Whether it is a mental or a
					 physical injury makes no difference. It sends a message to the men and women
					 who serve that we do not care, so of course they leave.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The air force probably has the highest morale of any of
					 our three forces. Yet in spite of that they are leaving. Most of our
					 experienced pilots who could take part in an operation like Kosovo are gone.
					 The men and women who are left are extremely good but do not have the
					 experience to step in and play a meaningful role.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do members of the government think the answer will
					 be from our NATO allies and friends like the United States? What will the
					 reaction be when they ask for a serious commitment and we say we cannot give
					 them one? What do government members think the reaction will be?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An extremely important conference of NATO
					 parliamentarians will be held in Ottawa in early October. While attending these
					 conferences during the past four years I have consistently heard that Canada is
					 losing respect among our NATO allies because we can no longer meet our
					 commitments. That is a sad commentary.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is time the government took national security and
					 national defence seriously. It can start by giving a serious response to the
					 procurement report. Everyone from all parties recognizes that the response the
					 government has given is unacceptable. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I call on the government to give a serious response to
					 the procurement report as soon as possible. I believe that is what all members
					 of the House want.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said: Madam Speaker, at a time like this with the
					 tragedies in New York, Washington and near Philadelphia, I hesitate to even
					 bring forth this motion dealing with control of gophers. It seems in some ways
					 so trivial compared to the extremely serious issue of this terrorist threat. If
					 this had not been scheduled ahead of time, I would be calling on the government
					 to focus strictly on national security over these next weeks and months because
					 we do have a serious problem in that area. We have to focus the efforts of the
					 House of parliament on national security.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, private member's motions and bills are
					 scheduled well ahead of time, and this motion is important. We will see how
					 important it is when some of my colleagues speak on it. We saw this by the size
					 of some of the public meetings which were held in the provinces of Saskatchewan
					 and Alberta.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back in 1994 the government removed the effective
					 concentration of strychnine which was used in controlling gophers, or
					 Richardson's ground squirrels, from the hands of farmers and others who really
					 needed it to control this pest.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To get an idea of what this problem really entails,
					 gophers cost farmers losses of tens of millions of dollars every year at a time
					 when farmers cannot afford the losses.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A terrible drought has hit farmers from one end of the
					 country to another. Because of unfair trade practices, prices have been driven
					 down, in grains in particular. Farmers in many of the grain sectors are hanging
					 on by their fingernails. Quite frankly, the government has not taken the
					 removal of these unfair trade practices seriously. As a result, Canadian
					 farmers have been producing at a disadvantage. However, this has also caused
					 many farmers to lose their land in spite of being very good managers and good
					 farmers. We have also lost some of our best farmers, in the grain sector in
					 particular.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gophers do not only affect farmers in the area of
					 crops, they also affect farmers with livestock. Acres of pastures have been
					 destroyed. Farmers have told me that they have had large pasture areas
					 completely destroyed by gophers to a point where the cows cannot even graze.
					 Furthermore, there has been damage to livestock through broken legs. People
					 riding horses through pastures with gopher holes and the badgers that follow
					 have sustained terrible injuries.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an important issue from a dollars and cents
					 point of view. It is an important issue in terms of animal and human
					 safety.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was first elected in 1993. Since 1994 I have been
					 working on trying to get the government to restore the proper concentration of
					 strychnine and to allow farmers to mix it with their grain so that they can
					 control gophers. I have had bills and motions on this issue before the House on
					 two or three occasions. I have focused and concentrated on this. I believe that
					 was partly the reason we had a temporary registration on strychnine in a
					 controlled way in the province of Alberta this past summer. It was that
					 important that an emergency registration was put in place last summer. However,
					 farmers say that is not good enough. They need it indefinitely into the
					 future.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately the province of Saskatchewan did not
					 manage to get this until later and only in a very restricted way. Farmers from
					 Saskatchewan were looking enviously across the border into Alberta, wondering
					 why they could not have an emergency registration like the farmers in Alberta.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None of this is the solution to the problem. The
					 solution is for the government to restore into the hands of farmers and others
					 who have to control pests, like gophers, an acceptable concentration of
					 strychnine which will save farmers tens of millions of dollars.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through an order paper question back in 1995, I asked
					 for all documentation from government and to government dealing with this
					 issue. I wanted to know what led to the outlawing of this high concentration of
					 strychnine. It was shocking. I was given a one inch thick pile of
					 paper.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One would expect to have found a study which would have
					 led to the conclusion that it is dangerous for farmers to be using strychnine.
					 There was no such study. Then I thought that I would at least find that the
					 government had seen a lot of cases where pests not targeted had been affected.
					 That was not the case. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This important tool that farmer's desperately needed,
					 the absence of which cost tens of millions of dollars a year, was taken from
					 the market based on complaints from one environmental group. It was a
					 completely unreasonable lobby on the part of a small environmental group, which
					 was not even one of our major environmental groups. I was really shocked to see
					 that. I was also shocked to see that this had gone through the process of the
					 federal government even with some involvement from the provinces.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Farmers are in such need of having this product
					 restored that they are willing to go to the extent of taking a special half day
					 safety course on the use of the product. They are willing to have experts come
					 in and show them how to handle the product to ensure that only the target
					 species would be affected because this is important to them. However, the
					 government has allowed this to fall on deaf ears. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is shocking to me as well is I have asked to make
					 bills and motions votable on many occasions and not once has that been allowed.
					 It goes beyond any reason why a motion or a bill brought forth by a private
					 member for debate would not to be votable. It is long past the time in a modern
					 British style democracy when any private member motion would not be votable.
					 This has to happen. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know the government will not act on this. What does
					 it mean to the government to have a few more farmers going broke? A few tens of
					 millions of dollars a year in extra costs to farmers due to crop losses does
					 not seem to mean a lot. We have seen the government's response to the
					 agriculture crisis in the past. It does not seem to be that important, so I do
					 not expect that it will be acted on this time, although I am somewhat hopeful
					 because the province of Alberta and other provinces are now stepping in and
					 telling the federal government that we need this back on a permanent
					 basis.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I have not seen any reaction from the federal
					 government in the past, maybe the pressure from the provinces of Alberta and
					 Saskatchewan in particular will force the government to reconsider this foolish
					 move it made seven years ago and restore to farmers a concentration of
					 strychnine of 2% or higher so they can effectively control Richardson's ground
					 squirrels and gophers. I believe this is important.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, I would like to express that I have some concern
					 talking about this issue when the House should be focusing strictly and in a
					 serious way on our national security. With what happened in New York and
					 Washington and finding out that the targets were much broader than publicly
					 known, we have to focus on that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this issue is important to people in my
					 constituency and it is important to the farmers in Alberta, Saskatchewan and
					 parts of Manitoba.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is important. It is important to the farmers in
					 Alberta, Saskatchewan and in parts of Manitoba. I hope for once the government
					 will respond to what is really important to farmers. It has taken too many

					 to the Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.): </b>

	Madam Speaker, I want to point out to the hon. member
					 for Lakeland that if he is so intent on what the House should be debating he
					 certainly had the option to withdraw this motion but he has obviously chosen
					 not to do so. However, having said that, I am very happy to respond on behalf
					 of the Government of Canada. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addressing the motion before the House regarding
					 gopher control measures, I would first point out, not only for the information
					 of the member for Lakeland but all other hon. members in the House, that the
					 government has not banned the effective concentration of strychnine. The
					 concentration of strychnine found in today's ready to use products has been
					 analyzed and found to be the same or actually greater than that found
					 previously in baits prepared by mixing the liquid strychnine concentrate with
					 farm available grain. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What has changed is that since 1992 only the much safer
					 ready to use strychnine product is available. The liquid strychnine concentrate
					 for use in the formulation of strychnine baits on farms has been withdrawn from
					 the market. The use of liquid strychnine concentrate was withdrawn because the
					 number of strychnine poisonings of non-target pets and wildlife associated with
					 its use constituted a very significant risk. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to explain that the action to limit
					 the availability of liquid strychnine concentrate products undertaken by the
					 Department of Agriculture and Agri-Food, the then pesticide regulatory body,
					 was taken under the Pest Control Products Act or the PCPA as it is known. A
					 pre-market assessment of a pesticide carried out by the PCPA establishes that
					 the product has safety, merit and value, which includes determining that it is
					 effective.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Registration under the PCPA does not however guarantee
					 100% effectiveness under all conditions. For example, some organisms develop
					 resistance to certain pesticides over time where products could cease to be
					 effective if climate conditions change. Because the action limiting liquid
					 strychnine concentrate availability was authorized under the PCPA and the issue
					 of compensation is not addressed in that act, there is no existing mechanism to
					 compensate farmers for damage done to their livestock and crops as a result of
					 gophers. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However the government does recognize that gopher
					 control has been a very difficult problem for western farmers in recent years
					 and is working actively with the provinces and with producers to find a
					 solution. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it was suggested that the level of strychnine in
					 ready to use baits did not meet the guarantee of 0.4% concentration, an
					 investigation was launched by Health Canada's pest management regulatory
					 agency. The investigation involved visits to formulating plants and sampling
					 and analyses of the product. The results showed that ready to use baits did
					 meet the registered guarantee.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From 1998-99 strychnine registrants were required to
					 submit quality control results on several batches of their product to the PMRA
					 for review prior to its product being distributed into the marketplace for the
					 upcoming new season.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the strychnine present in the ready to use bait
					 has been clearly shown to be of a concentration adequate for the control of
					 gophers, it has been suggested that other factors, such as baiting procedures,
					 environmental conditions affecting the bait itself and lack of palatability,
					 might be responsible for poor performance of the ready to use strychnine
					 bait.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help address these possibilities the PMRA has taken
					 a number of steps. It upgraded the labels of all registered strychnine products
					 to provide clearer instruction on the need to carefully locate and time bait
					 placements to ensure optimum performance. These use instructions were developed
					 in consultation with the provinces. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PMRA also provided research permits to Alberta
					 agriculture and the Alberta Cattlemen's Association to research the
					 palatability of bait, the timing for bait placement and the question of whether
					 mixing bait fresh using a liquid concentrate would in fact be more effective.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The results of the trials done in 2000 have just been
					 received by the PMRA as of June 1 and they are now under review. There is not
					 yet significant evidence to suggest or require that registrants change the bait
					 of their ready to use products.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seriousness of some of the gopher problems in some
					 parts of Alberta this year has reached such proportions that the provincial
					 government has declared an emergency situation. To meet this emergency, the
					 Alberta provincial government has requested an emergency registration to allow
					 it to use the liquid strychnine concentrate for on farm formulation of bait in
					 those areas that have been identified as having a severe infestation of
					 gophers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PMRA has granted this registration for this season
					 only. This liquid concentrate will be used under a highly restricted access
					 program with the following conditions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the sale and distribution of the 2% strychnine
					 concentrate by the registrant is restricted to agricultural field men who are
					 authorized by Alberta Agriculture, Food and Rural Development for that
					 purpose.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, agricultural field men can sell this product
					 only to persons who are commercial agriculturalists. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, each agricultural field man who sells the
					 product must maintain a record of the transaction, including the name, address,
					 and signature of the purchaser, along with the quantity of product
					 purchased.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, any product sold must be mixed by or mixed
					 under the direct supervision of an agricultural field man authorized by Alberta
					 Agriculture, Food and Rural Development.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On behalf of Canadians the government has taken a
					 justifiably cautious approach to bringing back the liquid concentrate of
					 strychnine, given its very hazardous nature. Strychnine has a very high and
					 acute toxicity. It acts quickly on the central nervous system, causing frequent
					 violent convulsions which eventually lead to death through respiratory
					 failures. There is no effective antidote for this poison.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I emphasize that the original decision on strychnine
					 registration and restriction was not taken lightly. Agriculture and Agri-Food
					 Canada recognized that these changes would involve some increased cost to users
					 who previously had used their own grain for bait.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to that withdrawal an extensive two year
					 negotiation was carried out with those provinces where strychnine products are
					 largely used. Those provinces are Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba and
					 Saskatchewan. This consultation involved the western forum and the then
					 Canadian Association of Pest Control Officials.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time I would like to clarify my use of the word
					 gopher. Although it is not scientifically correct I am primarily using this
					 term to describe the Richardson's ground squirrel.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many farmers consider a gopher by any name to be a
					 pest. A gopher may eat a wide variety of grasses and broad leafed plants and
					 compete with livestock for forage. The mounds of soil they excavate from their
					 burrows can further damage crops, as well as livestock and
					 machinery.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to an increase in the gopher population over the
					 last number of years as a result of warm, dry conditions and a mild, dry
					 spring, this year the number of gophers in Alberta and Saskatchewan is very
					 high indeed. In Alberta there are 10 to 15 cases of strychnine poisonings per
					 year, according to the provincial Agri-Food Surveillance Systems Laboratory in
					 Edmonton. This number has been steadily declining over the past seven
					 years.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Saskatchewan 20 to 25 strychnine dog poisonings and
					 occasional strychnine wildlife poisonings are confirmed each year according to
					 the Western College of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Saskatchewan. I
					 emphasize that poisoning wildlife and domestic animals using bait laced with
					 strychnine is illegal not only under the Pest Control Products Act but also
					 under the cruelty to animals section of the criminal code.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada is not alone in having taken action on
					 strychnine. All above ground uses of strychnine have been prohibited in the
					 United States since 1988. It is illegal to use strychnine for pest control in
					 most European countries and its use is prohibited by the Bern convention on the
					 conservation of European wildlife and natural habitats.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian government has acted prudently in the
					 matter of restricting the availability of liquid strychnine concentrate for use
					 in the formulation of strychnine baits on farms. With the co-operation of
					 provinces it has moved to protect the health and safety of Canadians along with
					 their environment. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the effectiveness of the ready to use strychnine
					 bait came into question, the government acted quickly and responsibly and took
					 the actions I have indicated to address the concerns of farmers.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the field trials now under way demonstrate a clear
					 need in the future for the use of a liquid concentrate strychnine, the PMRA
					 will work with its provincial partners to determine how to make fresh bait
					 products available. That is the position of the Government of
					 Canada.</p>

					 NDP): </b>

	Madam Speaker, I am pleased to take part in the debate
					 on this motion which, as the previous speaker pointed out, is talking about the
					 need for higher levels of strychnine to control the gopher
					 population.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I first realized I would be speaking about this
					 matter my heart immediately went out to the most well known gopher in Canada,
					 Gainer the Gopher from Parkbeg, Saskatchewan, and his cousin, Leonard. For
					 those who are not fans of the Canadian Football League, he is probably the most
					 famous mascot in the CFL. I wondered what would happen to poor Gainer under
					 these circumstances but then the way that the Roughriders have been playing for
					 the last month he is probably thinking of taking it directly
					 himself.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The debate is about the level of strychnine and the
					 concern, as has been pointed out by previous speakers, is about a reduction in
					 the potency or percentage of strychnine in the pre-mix, whether or not the 5%
					 has gone to 2% or to 0.4% as is alleged by the member who moved the
					 motion.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We too have some environmental concerns that were
					 indicated by the government spokesperson. We are concerned about what has
					 happened to the population of swift foxes and bald eagles over the last decade
					 as well as burrowing owls which are very important in the Moose Jaw area. There
					 was a story in the local newspaper within the last month about how the number
					 of pairs of burrowing owls had declined rapidly in recent years. Dog poisonings
					 have also been mentioned. In the volume of work in this area a couple of
					 suicides were reported. All of these seem to be impacted by the use of
					 strychnine.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has been prudent in reducing the way in
					 which the bait has been used with no above ground bait stations in recent
					 years. Farmers have to put the bait in the ground at least 18 inches. They have
					 to bury the carcasses so that eagles, dogs and other animals will not be
					 contaminated and spread the problem.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no intention of minimizing the issue. I note
					 that the member from the North Battleford area is in the House. I know it is a
					 much bigger issue in that area of the province than it is in the Moose Jaw and
					 Regina area that I happen to represent. I know from reading that 100 gophers
					 will eat as much pasture in a day as sheep, and that 370 of them will eat as
					 much as a cow. I also know that predators such as badgers that go after the
					 gophers can cause severe damage to livestock.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been injuries, as the member for Lakeland
					 indicated, because of the lack of controls, but as I have tried to indicate
					 there have been some injuries as a result of overuse of strychnine in the
					 recent past.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government member indicated that the federal
					 government was working actively with the provinces and farmers to find
					 solutions. He mentioned federal labelling, research permits and made reference
					 to bait. I did not hear, however, what the government was doing about
					 developing less lethal products for the environment at large that would be more
					 effective for the problem that farmers are having with gophers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point I am trying to make is that the
					 overpopulation of gophers seems to be a cyclical thing as is the case with a
					 lot of wild animals. </p>


	<A NAME="T1755"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1755"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1800"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1750"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1755)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few years ago we had stories in Saskatchewan
					 newspapers about how gophers had virtually disappeared from our highways and
					 byways,. People were not seeing very many of them. Obviously now in some
					 sections of the province and certainly in the province of Alberta they are back
					 and they are back with a vengeance.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would have appreciated hearing whether the government
					 or the Pest Management Regulatory Agency was doing anything about developing
					 alternatives to strychnine. I note that in Saskatchewan a farmer has developed
					 an anhydrous ammonia vapour that he believes has been very effective in
					 eliminating gophers. Although it is not licensed or registered by the PMRA,
					 farmers know that anhydrous ammonia is a principal ingredient in nitrogen
					 fertilizer and it is certainly registered for use in that vein.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would be interested to know what the government is
					 doing to develop alternatives to a recognized poison such as strychnine.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a serious problem. There are rural municipalities
					 in both Saskatchewan and Alberta that have declared themselves disaster areas
					 as a result of the overpopulation at the moment. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the final analysis we have to be very cautious. We
					 have to take the precautionary principle on this so that we do no harm until we
					 ensure that we can do no harm. We should be very careful and very leery about
					 the use of this product.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remind members, in the words of David Suzuki, that
					 the human race is the most predatory animal in the history of the world. We
					 have a phobia about eliminating anything and everything that gets in our way.
					 Some day that is going to come back and cost us in a very large way.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a problem and I do not want to minimize it, but
					 I think we need to and should look at alternatives. The issue has been around
					 for 10 years. The government has absolutely failed to develop alternatives that
					 would work as a replacement for liquid strychnine.</p>

					 PC/DR): </b>

	Madam Speaker, I rise today knowing full well that the
					 private members' business item was brought forward before the events of last
					 Tuesday. I echo the comments of the member for Lakeland that this does
					 unfortunately seem somewhat insignificant in the big picture of things. However
					 business must go on in the House, it does go on in the world and it goes on in
					 the fields and the farms of western Canada. Therefore I will not be as
					 sanctimonious as some members who suggested that it should have been pulled,
					 because it should not have. It should be brought forward because it was a piece
					 of business that was meant to come forward at that time and I will speak to the
					 issue before us today, Motion No. M-13.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I talked to the member for Lakeland because the motion
					 itself is not specifically to increase the concentration of liquid strychnine
					 from a .4% concentration to a 2% or a 5% concentration. The motion suggests
					 that there should be compensation given to producers who have suffered through
					 a rather large proliferation of the rodent, the Richardson ground squirrel,
					 particularly over the last year. The motion says that because of damage done to
					 livestock and crops, farmers should be compensated. That has not been the tenet
					 of this discussion. It seems that we are going on about the concentration or
					 the use of concentrated liquid strychnine and I will speak to that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I should suggest that I would not support the
					 motion based on a compensatory package. I do not think that is where we should
					 be heading. I do appreciate where the discussion has gone with having other
					 alternatives and certainly perhaps even the reinstatement of the 2% solution so
					 to speak.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadian producers and Canadian farmers are not
					 pesticide crazy. They do not simply use pesticides on every animal that is in
					 their jurisdiction. That is not the case.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a matter of fact, Canadian producers are very
					 cautious when it comes to pest control and certainly using pesticides. We are
					 probably as good as any other jurisdiction in the world. When Canadian
					 producers come forward and suggest that there have to be other solutions, they
					 are doing so simply because they have run completely out of solutions and
					 options and would like to see something put back into place.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was mentioned earlier that since 1992 the 2%
					 solution has been reduced to .4%. It has been proven and obviously the proof is
					 in the pudding. If we went out to western Canadian farm yards, pastures and
					 fields, we would see that the pest control program is not working. It has been
					 a very dry year in western Canada and across the country and be assured that
					 there are more pests right now than there have ever been. That is why we have
					 to look at some sort of a control.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some options, but they are difficult ones. It
					 is obvious to anyone who has ever trapped a gopher that he or she can get a few
					 of them but it is very difficult to get a lot. We talked about gopher hunting.
					 That in itself does not eradicate the problem, so we have to look at other
					 options. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best option right now is the suggestion that we go
					 back to a special regulation for the PMRA. There was a special call for the use
					 of the 2% solution and it was granted for this year. An extension of that would
					 be the first step as to where we should be going.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think most urban Canadians fully appreciate
					 the concerns that producers have. It was mentioned earlier that gophers can
					 consume quite a substantial amount of product. To a farmer and a producer, that
					 is their livelihood. They put seeds in the ground and they harvest those seeds
					 in the fall. The cash they generate out of the sale of that commodity is what
					 keeps them and their families going. That is an animal that can reduce those
					 yields. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been suggested that up to $1,000 per quarter
					 section of crop could be consumed. A thousand dollars per quarter section seems
					 to be the number. It has been suggested to me by the author of the motion that
					 it is higher. It may well be. Unfortunately, I do not have those numbers. They
					 have not been forthcoming. It would nice to have the actual numbers.</p>


	<A NAME="T1800"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1800"><!-- Hour: 6--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1805"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1755"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1800)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why when it was suggested that there be a
					 compensation package, I would suggest that it is hard to compensate when you do
					 not have a real handle on what the real number is. It can vary between
					 jurisdictions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us assume it is $1,000, perhaps higher, per quarter
					 section. That is only the financial impact. There is a financial impact as well
					 on cattle producers. I do not know how many people in the House have actually
					 walked through a pasture before but I can say that when cattle do walk or run
					 through a pasture there is a terrible opportunity for them to trip, to fall or
					 to break a leg in a gopher hole. It happens on a regular basis. With the price
					 of cattle today, that poses a substantial financial impact on the
					 producer.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is going to come as a real shock. Even in the
					 urban sectors there is an impact when there are too many of these rodents in
					 the schoolyards, the soccer fields, and the baseball diamonds. They have to be
					 controlled in these environments as well. This affects the urbanites, who,
					 heaven forbid, seem to be more important at this point in time than a lot of
					 the agricultural producers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are other options. There are some interesting
					 innovations out there. I am not going to blame the government specifically, but
					 I do think it is terribly regulatory in its demeanour. The government likes to
					 regulate. Heaven forbid that someone should have the opportunity to put
					 something in place themselves without having to be told to by the government.
					 The government has decided that this should not be done for producers and
					 unless it can tell the producers what to do, then it is obviously not good for
					 them. That is a government ideological philosophy which unfortunately I do not
					 think is going to change. I wish it would in this case, but unfortunately that
					 is the way the government operates.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other options are being developed. One which I mention
					 tongue in cheek is a thing called the gophinator. It puts anhydrous ammonia in
					 the gopher hole in the ground. It has not been approved yet. I do know whether
					 some of my producers have used it, but they have some concerns about it as
					 well. I do not know if the member for Lakeland has heard about it, but it is a
					 rather interesting innovation. Producers and businesses should be looking at
					 other ways when trying to control the gopher population.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish this were a votable motion and that we could go
					 back to a simple solution with a 2% concentration. It seems that solution would
					 suffice for the time being but that is not going to be the case because the
					 government is not going to allow the motion to be votable.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that we do not get involved in a compensation
					 package and it seems that we have gone off of that. I believe that the motion
					 as it reads now will not be supported by my party. Certainly I think we could,
					 if it were changed to incorporate the concentrated strychnine. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In closing, I would just like to say that it seems to
					 be an insignificant issue. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said in my opening comments, this is the first
					 time I have had an opportunity to stand in the House since we returned, and
					 since the events of Tuesday past. On behalf of my constituents in
					 Brandon--Souris, I would like to pass on our condolences to the victims, the
					 families, the firefighters, the rescue workers, and all of the people not only
					 in the United States but in the free world who have been affected so severely
					 by the events of last Tuesday. Please accept those comments from the
					 Progressive Conservative/Democratic Representative Coalition.</p>

	Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to discuss the motion
					 brought forward by my colleague from Lakeland.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of verbiage has gone on about should we
					 compensate, should we not compensate, what the levels should be and so on. The
					 bottom line for producers is that we do not have anything that will do the job
					 properly. There is culpability with the federal government and provincial
					 governments as well. Some of their departments recommended doing away with
					 strychnine in the way it used to be handled and maybe that was not all
					 wrong.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The end result is that the gopher populations have had
					 eight or nine years of absolutely free run. There was some discussion as to the
					 amount of damage that could be caused and a figure of $1,000 for a quarter
					 section was bandied about. The damage is actually more in the neighbourhood of
					 $16,000 on a quarter section, or $100 an acre.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we talk of forage crops and so on, an average
					 infestation of gophers costs around $120 per acre. Those 120 hungry little guys
					 can do away with almost a tonne of good forage a year. Right now that forage is
					 worth $100 a tonne. That puts the damage across that field at $16,000. No
					 farmer or rancher can afford that type of a hit. No one has that type of
					 infestation on a long term basis to that degree. There are some isolated
					 quarters in my riding that are that bad, but they are not in forage; they are
					 in a pasture type of thing. People are usually able to pasture 50 or 60 cows in
					 that application. This year they could not put any on it. Because of the
					 drought and so on and the gopher problem which compounded that, it was useless
					 ground.The taxes are still due on that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a lot of discussion on the type of bait that
					 was taken away, the strychnine and so on. There were reasons for doing that.
					 The non-target species was a big thing. There are some products that have been
					 mentioned, and I will get into that later, which do not target the non-target
					 species.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A big problem was found with the old strychnine, or the
					 new stuff that was brought out--it was called new but it was reintroduced. It
					 was weaker, but there was a shelf life to it that nobody even considered. A lot
					 of the baits that had been out there in the last little while were five and six
					 years old and the grain product that was mixed with it had gone mouldy. These
					 little guys are persnickety eaters. No animal in the wild that has a choice
					 between lush forage and mouldy grain is going to eat the mouldy grain. They
					 bury it in the dirt regardless of how the bait is placed. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Farmers and ranchers in my part of the country and
					 across Canada are stewards of the land. They were environmentalists long before
					 the term was even known. They do not hurt their own land. They know they need
					 that productivity year after year. The very conception that they do not know
					 how to mix the bait or do not know how to handle it is ridiculous.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My grandmother mixed bait for years. She died at 96
					 years of age. The strychnine did not get her; it was a lot of other things, but
					 at 96 I guess she had a pretty full life. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem with the baits as we know them is their
					 availability. There is never enough when we need them. There is a very small
					 window of opportunity to place those baits. Gophers hibernate again during the
					 summer. The gophers we see on the surface are the young that come out and roam
					 around and the odd female, but the males tend to hibernate for the summer.
					 There is no opportunity to get them at all. An average female will live to be
					 four years of age and an average male will easily live a year. They are pretty
					 tough on their males.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On an average piece of ground with average growth
					 rates, they will have a litter of five or six young in a season. On good forage
					 with good feed they will double that. There will be twice that many. In a lush
					 situation there will be nine or ten little guys running around. Again that ups
					 their amount of consumption.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has become a huge problem in the eight or nine years
					 that we have had no proper poisons available to keep the problem down. They
					 have had free run. That is where the government's culpability comes in and we
					 are asking for compensation, and I think rightly so. It should be added to the
					 crop insurance lists that cover wildlife damage, ducks, geese, deer, elk and
					 other types of wildlife that were covered for a time. Some provinces still have
					 it, some do not. In Saskatchewan it has been really short and hard to get but
					 we need this type of coverage added. The crop insurance program is a joint
					 federal-provincial application. Somebody puts in the money, somebody
					 administers it and they are always arguing over who does what and the farmers
					 end up on the short end of the stick.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the counties in Alberta applied for emergency
					 registration. They knew that the only thing they could do quickly in the short
					 term was go back to what had worked before and that is strychnine. They were
					 granted the opportunity to get the 2% strychnine that is fresh, comes in a
					 little bottle and is worth about $8. When that is mixed up, the amount that
					 each farmer is allowed to use in my area ends up to be about a 20 litre pail.
					 </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the time it is mixed up it has cost the farmer about
					 $150. If there is a major infestation, the pail of bait that the farmer is
					 allowed to get will do between five and ten acres, depending on the infestation
					 of gophers. It ends up costing roughly $15 an acre to do that. If a farmer has
					 a problem on 1,000 acres, he or she would be looking at a $15,000 investment,
					 plus the time to do it. In a lot of instances it is just not feasible to do
					 that along with all the other chores that are required.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was mentioned earlier that we need to look for other
					 solutions. One solution that has been developed comes from my riding. Maze
					 Innovation from Unity, Saskatchewan has invented what is called the gophinator.
					 It has all the CSA and ULC stamps and all that good stuff to apply an anhydrous
					 ammonia, which is basically a fertilizer, into the gopher holes and it gases
					 them. There are a lot of pluses to that application. For starters, it is much
					 more humane than strychnine, which should speak well to everyone. It does not
					 target the non-target species. It only goes after the gopher in the hole. There
					 is nothing left on the surface for the hawks, eagles or coyotes to drag away.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we talk about other animals, we did a short study
					 this summer. We had a meeting sponsored by Senator Herb Sparrow, from North
					 Battleford. Herb is actually a recognized environmental conservationist farmer.
					 He has actually won an award to that end, and good for Herb. He sponsored a
					 meeting that over 300 farmers, ranchers, municipal people and others attended
					 this summer. He had a lot of quick facts that he put together, including the
					 fact that 123 gophers per acre will eat up a tonne of feed, which equates to
					 $15,000 to $16,000 a quarter in damage. He talked about the size of the litter,
					 the lifespan and so on. The body weight of a gopher will double over the summer
					 as it gets ready for the winter hibernation.They take in a lot of feed because
					 they are hyper little guys. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we talk about non-target species, such as foxes,
					 coyotes, eagles, owls, hawks, and so on, he actually did some research on those
					 species. A fox or coyote would have to eat 40 to 50 strychnine poisoned gophers
					 at one sitting in order to have enough poison to do damage to that fox or
					 coyote. Well they are hungry but they will not eat 40 to 50 gophers at one
					 sitting. There is not a hope. They could not wash it down for starters.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we start talking about hawks, eagles, owls or
					 whatever, depending on the size of the bird, we are talking about five, ten or
					 even fifteen gophers that these birds would have to eat in order to be damaged.
					 That puts into question the whole idea of a non-target species, other than
					 someone deliberately targeting coyotes with a deer carcass or something, which
					 is a criminal offence.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is we have to come up with a different way
					 of doing it. I know the Maze boys have developed the gophinator. It works like
					 a darn. We can target the animal in its lair. It can be done while they are
					 hibernating. It does not have to be done during these small windows of
					 opportunity as with the strychnine targets. It can be done at any time, even in
					 the fall when they are hibernating. We can plug off one end of the hole and put
					 the hose in at the other end, tapping the dirt in and giving them a shot of
					 anhydrous and the job is done. There is no need to come back for carcasses. It
					 is finished and very clean. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other plus is that this can be used under barns
					 while there are animals in there; pigs, chickens, turkeys, cattle or whatever.
					 Dairy barns and so on tend to get rat infested and anyone with those types of
					 barns will say that it is a problem. They cannot set out bait because the
					 animals in the barn would be attracted to the bait. So this type of application
					 works extremely well.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are always worried about our kids and contamination
					 from pesticides, insecticides and so on in parks and school yards. Again, it is
					 the ideal answer.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have pointed out all these pluses over the years to
					 Health Canada, Agriculture Canada and so on. In fact, the Maze boys finally got
					 off their combines on August 19 of this year and came to Ottawa. They arranged
					 a meeting with Health Canada to find out what the problem was. There were a lot
					 of hoops and hurdles. The pest management control agency wants the testing done
					 on anhydrous ammonia to say that it is okay to put it in the ground and then it
					 will give it a pest control number but the cost of that is $150,000. What an
					 absolutely ridiculous and horrendous cost for a product that has already been
					 accepted for use in the ground. If I go out and fertilize my pasture with the
					 shanks, rip up the ground and put the anhydrous in that kills the gophers, that
					 is okay, but if I use their machinery, which is CSA, ULC and all that approved,
					 I cannot do it. Can anyone explain the logic in that to me. It does not make
					 any sense to any of us out there. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are applications and alternatives out there, but
					 it is up to the government to get off its collective duff and make these things
					 available to people. We are saying that there is culpability and that there
					 should be compensation worked into the crop insurance program in the short
					 term, and in the very short term we should look at registering this Maze
					 Innovation gophinator.</p>

					 Alliance): </b>

	Madam Speaker, I very much appreciate the intervention
					 of the member for Battlefords--Lloydminster. He brought out a great deal of
					 good information on this subject. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do appreciate as well the member from Brandon
					 pointing out that the motion is about compensating farmers through the crop
					 insurance program for damage done to crops, including pastures, as a result of
					 them not having available the tools to control the Richardson's ground
					 squirrel, or gopher as it is commonly known by farmers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is what the motion actually is. The intent of the
					 motion or obvious solution that I was hoping the government would see is not to
					 have to compensate but rather to restore an effective control
					 product.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can see the headline in tomorrow's paper: government
					 will discontinue the registration of automobiles. I expect it will be there.
					 The government will justify that by the same logic that has led it to
					 discontinue the registration of an effective concentration of strychnine and by
					 the same logic that led it to forcing people to register their firearms and to
					 taking away many firearms whether or not people were using them properly and
					 safely.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the information I received in regard to my question
					 on the order paper in about 1995, there was all the correspondence. I asked in
					 that question specifically for all the correspondence to the government during
					 the process that led it to make the decision to ban the effective concentration
					 of strychnine and for the correspondence from government, so it was
					 correspondence both ways. In that correspondence, as I said, there was precious
					 little basis for the discontinuance of this registration. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a government in which the Parliamentary
					 Secretary to the Minister of Health said in his presentation that non-target
					 species are hit. I think he said there were about 25 dogs in Saskatchewan and
					 maybe 15 in Alberta that were hit.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of the information I received, first of all
					 the numbers are even much lower than that, but what it actually said was that
					 those were intentional poisonings. In the logic of the government, it has
					 removed the effective strength strychnine, a move that costs farmers tens of
					 millions of dollars a year, because of the abuse of a few law breakers who
					 chose to use this strychnine to poison their neighbour's dogs. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is what the correspondence showed. The
					 parliamentary secretary referred to that. Why not deal with criminals firmly
					 for this kind of illegal activity? It is the same kind of logic the government
					 used in taking firearms away from firearm owners and in registering firearms.
					 Because a few people used these weapons illegally, they were taken away from
					 everybody no matter how much they were needed as a tool, and when it comes to
					 farmers, to control gophers, among other things. The logic was to just take it
					 away from everybody or to force registration, which is extremely expensive and
					 does not help solve the problem.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest that it is that same logic, if the
					 government wants to extend it, that will lead to that headline tomorrow that
					 will say the government will discontinue the registration of automobiles
					 because some people use them in an illegal fashion.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the same logic and I believe it is flawed logic
					 in all cases. I hope it will not get to the extent that we will see that
					 headline in the paper tomorrow. It is a flawed approach and it is
					 unacceptable.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has taken away this effective
					 concentration and, on the other hand, has done what the member for
					 Battlefords--Lloydminster said: it has not allowed farmers to use their own
					 innovative solutions that do not include the use of strychnine. I am suggesting
					 that they should have the effective use of strychnine returned and that farmers
					 should be allowed to use their creative devices. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member of the New Democratic Party suggested that
					 the government should develop an effective alternate poison. That is nonsense.
					 Farmers have developed effective alternate ways of controlling
					 gophers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us have the government quickly deal with the
					 registration of those products. Let us allow this problem to be dealt with
					 effectively and have the appropriate strength of strychnine returned. If the
					 government refuses to do that, by gosh then it should carry through on my
					 motion and compensate farmers for the tens of millions of dollars in losses
					 every year.</p>

					 PC/DR): </b>

	Madam Speaker, I am pleased to rise today on a question
					 I raised on April 25 regarding the issue of softwood lumber in which I asked
					 the Minister for International Trade if he would immediately arrange a meeting
					 of all the parties involved in the softwood lumber dispute. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since that time I am pleased to report that the
					 minister has had several meetings with members of the industry. He brought them
					 all together in a very effective way. The right strategy is in place to bring
					 all parties and all stakeholders together to deal with the American's approach
					 to the softwood lumber issue. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right now, as we speak, the department is hosting
					 meetings among the province, industry representatives and the federal
					 government with American state and trade officials in Toronto to deal with this
					 issue.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to raise another set of meetings that were held
					 in Washington about two weeks ago between the right hon. member for Calgary
					 Centre, some other MPs, several trade officials of the United States and the
					 vice-president of the United States. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At these meetings all individuals said they were
					 totally committed to a long term solution. They did not want any more of these
					 five year deals that were repetitive. Every five years they have to go through
					 the awful process of the court system and the political system. They want a
					 solution.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the earlier meetings in Washington we pointed out
					 that the new premier of British Columbia, Gordon Campbell, had said in his
					 election policy that they would move toward a more market driven pricing
					 strategy. This was the first time they had heard of it and it seemed to raise
					 their interest. They were attracted to this proposal.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The right hon. member called the premier of British
					 Columbia and had the information faxed to him in Washington. Then he presented
					 the actual documents to the vice-president of the United States. These
					 documents state that British Columbia is proposing to move toward a more market
					 driven approach to lumber pricing. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vice-president was very pleased to see that and
					 felt it was a very positive move toward a long term resolution to the ongoing
					 softwood lumber problem.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year alone in British Columbia it is estimated
					 that it will cost industry over $1 billion. Officials feel that a strategy such
					 as has been proposed by British Columbia will remove the tools that the U.S.
					 industry uses to put its politicians in a corner to force trade actions against
					 the Canadian softwood lumber industry.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in Canada know that this is a totally U.S. political
					 football that is kicked around every five years. The industry takes advantage
					 of any argument it can come up with and gets its politicians to raise this
					 question. It pushes them to bring in countervail charges and
					 anti-dumping.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If British Columbia is able to follow through with its
					 proposed policy of moving toward a more market driven pricing schedule for its
					 lumber and if Premier Campbell is able to achieve his goal as stated in his
					 policy papers in the election, would the parliamentary secretary agree with
					 U.S. officials that this would help resolve this problem once and for
					 all?</p>

	Madam Speaker, I acknowledge the member's persistence
					 in calling for wide consultation. He made that point repeatedly in the House
					 and the minister certainly agreed with him. As he has noted, those
					 consultations took place from coast to coast to coast with industry and all
					 provinces.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague from Cumberland--Colchester speaks about a
					 long term solution that is wanted both in Canada and the United States. That is
					 certainly the case in the House and in our country, as he well
					 knows.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long term solution is free trade on softwood
					 lumber. That is what both the United States and Canada purport their goals to
					 be in trade. We are simply calling for the same kind of free trade in softwood
					 lumber that we have in many other commodities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague asked a question about certain statements
					 of the premier of British Columbia. I guess time will tell and we will see what
					 the premier does, but it is of interest to this government what the practices
					 are in the various lumber producing provinces, B.C. being one of the most
					 important of those.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will have to watch and see what is done, but I want
					 to emphasize very carefully that we feel that once again Canada's case can be
					 proven and will be proven at the WTO. We do not subsidize unfairly in softwood
					 lumber. That case has been tested before several times. We have always won the
					 case and we will win it again this time. I think my colleague has raised some
					 important issues that certainly bear scrutiny.</p>
