	moved that Bill C-264,
					 an act to amend the Marriage (Prohibited Degrees) Act (marriage between persons
					 of the same sex), be read the second time and referred to a
					 committee.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said: Mr. Speaker, today is an historic day for the
					 gay and lesbian community in Canada. It is the first time in Canadian history
					 that legislation is being debated that would allow gay or lesbian couples to
					 legally marry in Canada. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to begin my comments this morning by thanking
					 some of my colleagues in the House for supporting this landmark bill. I want to
					 first thank my colleague, the member of parliament for Vancouver East, for
					 seconding the bill and for her long history of support for equality for gay and
					 lesbian people throughout Canada. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also want to thank those members of the Liberal Party
					 who supported the bill: the member for Toronto Centre--Rosedale, the member for
					 St. Paul's and others. I hear some Liberal backbenchers heckling and indicating
					 they do not support the bill. I would ask that they at least show respect for
					 their own colleagues and for other members of the House. They may not accept
					 equality but surely they can accept the right of members of the House to debate
					 this important issue in an atmosphere of civility and dignity.</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to thank the members of the Bloc
					 Quebecois who supported this important bill and especially the member for
					 Hochelaga--Maisonneuve, who cannot participate in the debate this morning but
					 who has, for a long time, been promoting justice and equality for gay and
					 lesbian communities in Canada. I also thank the member for Joliette, who will
					 participate in the debate and support the bill. </p>

	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to extend my appreciation to the
					 member for Kings--Hants from the Progressive Conservative Democratic Coalition
					 for his support for the principle of this important legislation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear that the Canadian public is well ahead of
					 political leaders and of the government when it comes to this important issue
					 of the basic right of equality of gay and lesbian people who choose to marry to
					 be able to do so. The most recent public opinion poll showed that something
					 like two-thirds of Canadians across Canada in every region of Canada were
					 prepared to accept this equality. We are not talking about any kind of special
					 rights or privileges. What we are talking about are equal rights, equal rights
					 that are guaranteed to gay and lesbian people under section 15 of the charter
					 of rights and freedoms.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under section 15 of our charter, which came into force
					 in April 1985, all Canadians are equal. With respect to gay and lesbian people,
					 the Supreme Court of Canada has ruled that gay and lesbian people are included
					 under section 15 when they are involved in committed and loving
					 relationships.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have certainly made significant progress on the
					 journey toward full equality both federally and at the provincial and
					 territorial level. Last year landmark legislation was passed in the House of
					 Commons, Bill C-23, legislation that extended a whole range of rights and
					 responsibilities to gay and lesbian people and couples.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However Bill C-23 fell short in the critical area of
					 recognition of the right to marry. In one of the final days of debate on the
					 bill, the Liberal Minister of Justice introduced an amendment that shamefully
					 explicitly excluded affirmation of the right of gay and lesbian people to
					 marry.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am confident the courts will ultimately rule that
					 equality means equality and that we as gay and lesbian people should be
					 entitled to the equal right to marriage. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also want to acknowledge the important work EGALE has
					 done on the issue of equality for gays and lesbians and on many other issues.
					 EGALE is a national organization that speaks out on behalf of gay, lesbian,
					 bisexual and transgendered people across the country. It has been tireless in
					 its advocacy of equality and I salute the members of EGALE for continuing to
					 work hard on this issue.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many individuals, couples and organizations across the
					 land have supported the right to full equality. I am proud as a New Democrat
					 that my party is the only national party with a clear policy that calls for
					 recognition of equality for gay and lesbian people in marriage and in all other
					 areas of society. I speak today on behalf of the members of my caucus and the
					 leader of my party, the member for Halifax, who has also, from the very
					 beginning of her career and days in politics, been a tireless advocate for
					 equality for gay and lesbian people.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of churches and religious leaders have also
					 been in the forefront of this struggle. I particularly want to acknowledge the
					 work done by Rev. Brent Hawkes of the Metropolitan Community Church who has
					 been promoting equality for many years. On January 14, 2001, Rev. Brent Hawkes,
					 the pastor of the Metropolitan Community Church in Toronto, celebrated the
					 marriage between Kevin Bourassa and Joe Varnell, as well as the marriage of
					 Elaine Vautour and Anne Vautour.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Rev. Brent Hawkes said:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>We look forward to the day, when

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill itself is a very short bill. It is entitled
					 the Marriage Capacity Act and states that “a marriage between two persons is
					 not invalid by reason only that they are of the same sex”.</p>


	<A NAME="T1110"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1110"><!-- Hour: 11--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1115"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1105"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1110)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would note parenthetically that obviously all of the
					 existing barriers to marriage, for example, barriers to marriage between
					 relatives, or between brothers and sisters, remain in the existing legislation
					 under the Marriage (Prohibited Degrees) Act. Nothing changes that at all. Those
					 barriers remain.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This would simply remove the common law barrier to same
					 sex marriage. I would like to emphasize that this barrier goes back to a
					 decision in the British courts from 1886 in a case called Hyde v Hyde. Those
					 were the days when marriage had a very different meaning. In fact those were
					 the days in which within the institution of marriage rape was legal and
					 violence was legal. A husband was allowed to beat his wife as long as the stick
					 that he used was no wider than the width of his thumb. Certainly a precedent
					 dating back to those days and that recognition of marriage is not one which
					 should be used to deny equality to gay and lesbian people today. It should
					 certainly not be used in that way.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed there are challenges to that. As I said, there
					 is no statutory bar at the federal level. It is strictly judge made law and in
					 Quebec, Ontario and British Columbia there are currently cases proceeding in
					 the courts to challenge that legal barrier. </p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Quebec, a gay couple launched a court challenge, and
					 we hope the two partners will win their case. </p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Ontario the city of Toronto is supporting that legal
					 challenge and in British Columbia the former attorney general, Andrew Petter,
					 had the courage to speak out in support of the legal challenge as
					 well.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been one ruling to date specifically on these
					 challenges. It came in a British Columbia court decision by Mr. Justice Ian
					 Pitfield, and I must say that many of us were astonished at that decision
					 because it flies in the face of not only justice and reason but fairness. He
					 found that the constitution of Canada itself, in his words, expressed an
					 intention that discrimination would be permitted. This is an extraordinary
					 ruling and one that I am confident will be overturned by the courts when it
					 goes to the British Columbia Court of Appeal and ultimately to the Supreme
					 Court of Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill would change the law to allow those gay and
					 lesbian people who choose to marry to do so. It would not in any way affect
					 religious marriage and it is important to underline that. It is strictly about
					 civil marriage. Those faiths that are prepared to celebrate and affirm the
					 marriages of gay and lesbian couples within their faith community would be
					 permitted to do so. Those not prepared to do so would not in any way be
					 required or forced to do so. Just as, for example, within some faiths there are
					 barriers to interfaith marriages today that are not legally challenged in any
					 way so too would that discretion still be there for religions not prepared to
					 recognize the equality of their gay and lesbian parishioners.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I might be asked, what difference does marriage make
					 and why do gay and lesbian people want the right, the choice, the option of
					 marriage? I think it is important to recognize that marriage is the most
					 prominent way today in which two persons' romantic love and commitment to each
					 other are recognized and affirmed. Excluding gay and lesbian people from the
					 institution of marriage sends a clear message that our relationships, the
					 relationships of same sex couples, are somehow not as worthy of recognition and
					 affirmation. On the other hand, including same sex marriages in civil marriage
					 would send a positive message to all Canadians, one that says that regardless
					 of whether someone loves a man or a woman that love will be valued, honoured,
					 affirmed and treated with equal dignity and respect.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I often have the privilege of speaking in schools in my
					 constituency and elsewhere. Kids like to talk about the lives of members of
					 parliament and they ask what kind of life I have, what the challenges are, what
					 I like about the job and what is difficult about the job. Sometimes kids will
					 ask if I am married. I tell them I am not married, that I have a partner whose
					 name is Max, we have been together for seven years and love one another very
					 much, we want to spend the rest of our lives together and that relationship is
					 very important to us and is the most important relationship in my life. Those
					 kids will often ask why I cannot get married or why I do not get married or if
					 I do not want to marry him. I tell them I do want to and I would like to have
					 that choice, but I do not have it because the laws of this country do not allow
					 me, as a gay man, that choice.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How would giving me and my partner Max that choice in
					 any way weaken heterosexual marriage? How would it in any way weaken the
					 strength, the love, the commitment of heterosexual partnerships? It would not
					 change that at all. Surely heterosexual marriage is not so fragile that
					 allowing gay and lesbian people to marry would cause it to come tumbling down
					 like a house of cards. Surely in this time of such pain, in the aftermath of
					 the horrors of September 11, any steps that we can take as a society to
					 strengthen the affirmation of love in our society in a positive way is
					 something we should be encouraging.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marriage is about love and commitment. It is true that
					 some gay and lesbian couples would not want to get married if that choice were
					 available, just as some heterosexual couples choose to live common law, but
					 surely we should recognize the right of choice. Canada would not be the first
					 country to do so. The Netherlands moved earlier this year to fully recognize
					 marriage for gay and lesbian couples.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am confident that it will happen in Canada as well,
					 but why should gay and lesbian people be forced through the courts? Why should
					 we be wasting taxpayers' money to fight for this small but important step on
					 the road to full equality?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes it is said that we cannot allow gay and
					 lesbian people to marry because marriage is about children and procreation. The
					 best answer to that came in a very eloquent editorial in the <i>Globe and
					 Mail</i> just this month. It said:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>The issue of children is a red
						  herring; many couples who are married do not procreate, many couples procreate
						  outside marriage and many gay couples raise children, adopted or conceived with
						  the egg or sperm of one partner. Expanding the tent would enable loving gays in
						  committed relationships to agree to the solemn obligations of the marriage
						  contract. And what are we talking of, if not respect for family
						  values?</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is what I want to appeal to today in closing,
					 those traditional family values. We as gay and lesbian people are families
					 also. The bill would allow the full and equal recognition of our families. I
					 call on all members of the House to support this important
					 legislation.</p>

					 Secretary to the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada,
					 Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, Bill C-264 proposes certain amendments to
					 the Marriage Act to allow legal marriage for same sex couples. I will begin by
					 commending the member for Burnaby--Douglas in as strong and sincere terms as I
					 can for his tireless and principled work over many years for the equality of
					 gay and lesbian Canadians. All members of the House and all Canadians should
					 feel proud of his achievements and his determination.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the outset I emphasize that the Government of Canada
					 takes seriously its obligations to ensure equal treatment of all its citizens
					 including gay and lesbian Canadians. It is because of this constitutional
					 obligation that the government moved last year to enact the Modernization of
					 Benefits and Obligations Act which provides equal treatment for common law same
					 sex partners by extending the same benefits and obligations under federal law
					 that are granted to common law opposite sex partners.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am proud to say that not only does the Modernization
					 of Benefits and Obligations Act fully comply with our constitutional
					 obligations. It goes further than any other jurisdiction in Canada in ensuring
					 equal treatment for gay and lesbian Canadians. I am also proud to say that
					 Canada is in the forefront of the world in ensuring that gay and lesbian
					 couples are treated under the federal law with dignity and respect.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-264 proposes to fundamentally alter the legal
					 concept of marriage by legislatively overriding the common law and civil law
					 rule on legal capacity that a marriage is “the union of one man and one woman
					 to the exclusion of all others”. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada is unique in the world for many reasons, not the
					 least of which is the fact that our laws are based on two of the great legal
					 traditions, the common law and the civil law. In both these traditions there is
					 a clarity as to the legal meaning of the term marriage which can be traced back
					 into history. Because of this Canada is not alone in its understanding of the
					 legal concept of marriage.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;European countries that have provided a registration
					 system similar to marriage have deliberately chosen to maintain a clear
					 distinction in law between registration and marriage. In terms of the approach
					 taken by the House last year, a review of other countries shows that few have
					 enacted legislation designed to extend benefits and obligations to same sex
					 couples on the same basis as to opposite sex couples.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As mentioned previously, the Modernization of Benefits
					 and Obligations Act extends equal treatment to common law same sex couples and
					 common law opposite sex couples with respect to federal benefits and
					 obligations. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The act was a comprehensive piece of legislation. It
					 amended 68 federal statutes falling within the mandate of some 23 federal
					 departments and agencies. Some of the major federal statutes of general
					 application that were modernized by the act include the Canadian pension plan,
					 the Old Age Security Act, the Income Tax Act and the criminal code. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Modernization of Benefits and Obligations Act
					 provides a responsible and balanced approach to extending equal treatment to
					 same sex couples and ensuring that same sex couples receive the same benefits
					 and obligations under the law as opposite sex couples.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will turn for a moment to some of the legal
					 difficulties with the bill before us today. Because provincial and territorial
					 laws are based on the same concepts of marriage that are reflected in federal
					 law, Bill C-264 would affect hundreds of laws from coast to coast. Other legal
					 rules about capacity to marry that are currently in the common law are based on
					 the opposite sex nature of marriage. These rules have been developed over many
					 years and would require radical and even legislative change to fit same sex
					 couples. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, opposite sex couples can be granted an
					 annulment under the common law for lack of consummation. Adultery is grounds
					 for divorce. Incest in the criminal code is based on an opposite sex model. All
					 these would need to be fundamentally altered to fit same sex
					 relationships.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Various court challenges address a number of issues
					 including constitutional jurisdiction with respect to altering the definition
					 of marriage. The hon. member for Burnaby--Douglas has mentioned the B.C. case
					 which is working its way to the British Columbia Court of Appeal. As such it
					 would be premature to act at this time before we receive guidance from the
					 courts on this point. Once we have received guidance from the courts parliament
					 can decide to act if it is necessary and appropriate at that time.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to Bill C-264, legally there is an
					 additional problem. The bill proposes to simply change the title of the current
					 act and add one clause. However the whole statute is based on opposite sex
					 relationships and represents the entire set of limitations on who can legally
					 marry whom. If the bill were to proceed without the appropriate adjustments it
					 would effectively create a new discrimination.</p>


	<A NAME="T1120"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1120"><!-- Hour: 11--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1125"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1115"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1120)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government believes strongly in ensuring equal
					 treatment and legal recognition for people in both same sex unions and opposite
					 sex relationships. Recognizing the commitment of spouses and common law
					 partners, including those in same sex unions, is an important and worthy goal
					 and one that is strongly supported by a majority of Canadians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Modernization of Benefits and Obligations Act
					 achieves this objective. For these reasons the Minister of Justice cannot
					 support Bill C-264.</p>

				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, we are here to address Bill C-264, an act
					 to amend the Marriage (Prohibited Degrees) Act, whose purpose is to enable
					 marriage between persons of the same sex.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill as proposed would add the following text to
					 the Marriage (Prohibited Degrees) Act of Canada. It would add subclause
					 4.1:</p>


	<p>

<tr valign="top">

</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will be opposing the bill on two grounds. First, it
					 is not necessary to modify the Marriage (Prohibited Degrees) Act of Canada to
					 permit same sex marriage. Second, marriage is principally a provincial and not
					 a federal concern.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be noted that the Marriage (Prohibited Degrees)
					 Act does not deal in any way with same sex marriage and/or the broader
					 definition of marriage itself. The Marriage (Prohibited Degrees) Act of Canada,
					 an act respecting the laws prohibiting marriages between related persons,
					 states:</p>


	<p>

</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment by the member for Burnaby--Douglas would
					 add the following text:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>4.1 A marriage between two persons is
						  not invalid by reason only that they are of the same sex.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member's amendment is totally and wholly
					 unnecessary. At no point does the current act prohibit same sex unions. It only
					 mentions the types of marriage which are not legally valid. Same sex unions do
					 not appear on that list. It is based solely on common law consanguinity
					 concerns. These exist purely for the purpose of minimizing the chance of
					 genetic problems in the offspring of a marriage. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;History has taught us that siblings should not marry.
					 It has also taught us that parents should not marry their children. These are
					 the types of relationships prohibited in the Marriage (Prohibited Degrees) Act.
					 These prohibitions are based on genetics. Given that same sex couples cannot
					 reproduce, the Marriage (Prohibited Degrees) Act does not address them in any
					 way whatsoever.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time it must be noted that the act does not
					 discriminate on the basis of race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion,
					 sex, age, mental disability or physical disability.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given that the act does not affect same sex couples and
					 that no one has suggested it discriminates on the grounds covered in section 15
					 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, the proposed amendment is
					 wholly unnecessary.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason for opposing the amendment is that
					 marriage is principally a provincial and not a federal concern. In the EGALE
					 case, Mr. Justice Pitfield of the British Columbia Supreme Court wrote at
					 paragraph 122 that same sex relationships were:</p>

</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B.C.'s marriage act relies on common law to define
					 “qualification of persons about to marry”. The relevant portion of the act, in
					 chapter 282, reads:</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ability to amend the B.C. marriage act lies only
					 with the provincial government of British Columbia. The previous NDP government
					 chose not to make those amendments. It had nine years in absolute power with a
					 majority government in the provincial legislature and it chose not to do
					 so.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two of British Columbia's former premiers, Mr. Glen
					 Clark and Mr. Ujjal Dosanjh, happen to live in the same community as the member
					 for Burnaby--Douglas who is sponsoring the legislation. Had he really wanted to
					 amend B.C.'s marriage act the member would have taken up his cause with either
					 of the two former premiers. They live in his riding. They are members of his
					 party. They led a government of his own party and he presumably knows them on a
					 first name basis. One of them, if not both of them, are constituents of his and
					 vice versa. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member had a golden opportunity to raise the issue
					 with a sympathetic provincial government that had the jurisdiction to make the
					 changes he seeks. He missed his chance to do so.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I respectfully submit that the legislation fails on the
					 two grounds I have mentioned in my speech. If the hon. member really wanted to
					 impact on whether people of the same sex have the right to unify in the
					 institution of marriage, he should have taken his fight to the appropriate
					 legislature. That would have been the provincial legislature and not the
					 federal one. Frankly I am surprised that a lawyer does not know the
					 difference.</p>

					 BQ): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I would like to congratulate the member
					 for Burnaby--Douglas for his initiative in presenting his bill to allow
					 marriage between persons of the same sex. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion, it is high time we put an end to this
					 anomaly, this discrimination which spoils the reputation of Canada and that of
					 Quebec by expressing our collective will to fight against discriminations of
					 all sorts. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Supreme Court of Canada, the Canadian
					 Charter of Rights and Freedoms already recognizes the equality of gays and
					 lesbians. Therefore, how can we explain that the legislator refuses to grant
					 same sex couples the right to marry legally? We are talking here about civil
					 weddings of course, and I think the member explained that quite clearly in his
					 presentation. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, passage of Bill C-23 repealed almost all
					 explicit references to the gender of partners in federal statutes. As far as we
					 know, there are only four acts left where partners in a couple are specifically
					 defined as heterosexual: the Divorce Act, the Canada Evidence Act, the Criminal
					 Code and the Canada Shipping Act. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the member is asking for would require very little
					 effort on the part of the legislators. A few amendments would suffice to put an
					 end to this incredible discrimination. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I listened to representatives of the Liberal Party and
					 the Canadian Alliance mention various legislative objections to passing this
					 bill. I do not think that is what is at issue.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a certain number of amendments to legislation must
					 be made in order to meet the bill's objectives, we will make them but I think
					 the crux of the matter is whether or not Canadian parliamentarians are prepared
					 to remove this obstacle, this discrimination, in order to allow same sex
					 couples to be married in a civil ceremony.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion, the legal arguments should naturally be
					 consistent with our vision of respect for the freedoms and equality of all
					 citizens of Canada and Quebec.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is really at issue here is our concept of
					 citizenship. Is every member of society, regardless of religion, political
					 beliefs, sex or sexual orientation entitled to the same treatment, rights and
					 obligations? This is where we must respond in the affirmative by making civil
					 marriage open to same sex couples.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am referring here to a dissenting opinion by Justice
					 L'Heureux-Dubé, who said in a ruling concerning a civil marriage
					 case:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>Given the marginalized position of
						  homosexuals in society, the metamessage that flows almost inevitably from
						  excluding same-sex couples from such an important social
						  institution--</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is referring here to civil marriage.</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right">
</td>
<td><small>--is
						  essentially that society considers such relationships to be less worthy of
						  respect, concern and consideration than relationships involving members of the
						  opposite sex.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I share this view entirely. In response to this comment
					 by Justice L'Heureux-Dubé, it seems to me that we must make it very clear that
					 citizenship as we understand it in Canada entitles one to the same rights,
					 obligations and institutions, including civil marriage.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I mentioned earlier, I think it is time to end this
					 discriminatory situation, which reflects poorly on Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, there is nothing preventing same sex couples
					 from living together. This, I think, is what many of them decide to do, as do
					 many heterosexual couples now.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However that is not the issue. It has to do with
					 whether or not they will be given access to the institution of marriage if they
					 so wish. Some people decide that they do want to marry. I do not see why the
					 fact that they are a same sex couple should prevent them from being able to
					 marry if they choose it freely. Marriage would provide them with some
					 additional protection under certain statutes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More fundamental, in the context of a relationship
					 between two persons, the decision to marry can improve the quality of the

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give a personal example. I lived common law with
					 my wife for several years. There came a time when we decided to marry. We felt
					 that marriage would strengthen our commitment to each other. It meant something
					 more than being in a common law relationship. This was our perception of the
					 situation as a couple. There was no institution preventing us from having a
					 civil wedding, and that is what we did in the end. This year we celebrated our
					 10th wedding anniversary.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I see it, the situation is the same for same sex
					 couples. They must have the right, if they so choose, to marry if they think
					 that it will improve the quality of their relationship. Once again, I repeat
					 that it is up to the couple to decide. Granting gays and lesbians access to
					 civil marriage reflects what society believes. Clearly, the law is totally
					 outdated on this score.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a Canada-wide poll conducted in June by Léger
					 Marketing, Canadians were asked if they believed homosexuals had the same
					 rights as other Canadians: 75.7% answered yes. Thus, more than three-quarters
					 of Canadians believe that homosexuals deserve to have all of the rights
					 available in our society.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As concerns civil marriage more specifically, 65.4% of
					 people said they agreed that same sex couples should be able to marry under our
					 laws.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a personal level, this is a commitment or a position
					 I have had for over 15 years at least. As for unions, as the secretary general
					 of the Confédération des syndicats nationaux since the early 1990s, I fought
					 for the removal from collective agreements of all existing discrimination with
					 regard to same sex couples. We worked hard at that, which led to passage of
					 legislation on this subject by the National Assembly. I think we have to follow
					 that logic through to its conclusion and give same sex couples access to the
					 institution of civil marriage. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the election campaign I also made a commitment
					 to ensure that gays and lesbians had access to all the civil rights in Canada,
					 including the right to get married. In my case, this is tied in with this
					 notion of citizenship, which I find extremely important. I share the opinion of
					 the hon. member for 
					 Burnaby--Douglas that,
					 following the events of September 11, Canada must become even more exemplary
					 with regard to the defence of rights and freedoms. What we are doing here is,
					 first and foremost, fighting for rights and freedoms.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will conclude by saying that two of my three children
					 are still rather young and I do not know yet what sexual orientation they will
					 choose. No matter what their choice will be I hope they will not become social
					 outcasts and will have access to the same rights as all the citizens of
					 Canada.</p>

					 PC/DR): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I would like to say a few words on Bill
					 C-264. The bill would make two changes in the current Marriage (Prohibited
					 Degrees) Act. The first would be to change the title of the act to the marriage
					 capacity act. The second of course would add section 4.1, which would
					 state:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>A marriage between two persons is not
						  invalid by reason only that they are of the same sex.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the outset, I want to say I cannot support the bill.
					 Obviously, as the title of the act being amended indicates, there are
					 prohibitions on who can marry. Close blood relatives, for instance, are
					 forbidden to marry because of possible birth defects to any children arising
					 out of the marriage. Brothers and sisters may not marry. A divorced person may
					 remarry but not to a child of the previous marriage. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marriage is considered to be an activity for mature
					 individuals, given the rights and responsibilities that go along with that.
					 Therefore, in this country we do not permit children to marry each other or an
					 adult to marry a child. Both parties to a marriage must be of an age and of an
					 intelligence to understand the serious nature of the institution into which
					 they are entering.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot stress enough the word institution.
					 Institutions are a deep rooted part of our culture and are something that
					 should not be lightly tampered with and should not likely be changed.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our society, as we are all very much aware, has evolved
					 and these days common law heterosexual or opposite sex couples have the same
					 rights and obligations to property as do married couples. The House, as we are
					 all very much aware as well, recently passed a law extending certain rights
					 with regard to pensions and what have we to common law, homosexual or same
					 sexual couples. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, at the same time it should be pointed out that
					 the House went out of its way to insert a clause in that legislation
					 reasserting that while being a couple was one thing being a married couple was
					 entirely different. That clause went out of the way to state that a marriage
					 was a union between a man and a woman only. That must be maintained.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. member's proposed title change takes the
					 emphasis off who may not marry and replaces it with an emphasis on who may
					 marry. I do not support the new emphasis because I see it as eroding a basic
					 concept of our law, namely that marriage is restricted to opposite sex couples
					 only.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to make it perfectly clear that heterosexual
					 people have to be tolerant of other ways of life. However, I would submit that
					 it is time for homosexual people to be tolerant of the heterosexual way of life
					 as well, which is that marriage is the union of one man and one woman. That is
					 very clear in the legislation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, the new section 4.1 says that being a same
					 sex couple should not preclude the union being regarded as a marriage. That is
					 diametrically opposed, as I said a moment ago, to the clause that was inserted
					 in the bill, which restricted marriage to opposite sex couples only.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other factor here of course for many of us is that
					 a marriage, whether performed by a judge or a clergy person, is deemed to be
					 more than just a sexual union between a man and a woman. A marriage is one of
					 the basic building blocks of our society. It is one of the basic building
					 blocks of a family. It is therefore also a spiritual union between a man and a
					 women, a union uniquely designed for the conception and nurturing of
					 children.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is not to say, of course, that all married people
					 have children, they do not. However, the potential is there and the institution
					 lends itself very well to that potential should it ever become a
					 reality.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A family, of course, is under pressure from many
					 different directions in this fast-paced secular world in which we live. In all
					 conscience I cannot support motions or bills which would put additional
					 pressure on the institution of marriage, as marriage is one of the central
					 pillars of family life.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, let me be clear. I do not support discrimination
					 against same sex couples, however, they do not fit the recognized definition of
					 a marriage because marriage is union of two people of opposite
					 sexes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to quote what I recently read in the
					 Australian Melbourne <i>Herald Sun</i>. The Australian prime minister, John
					 Howard, said that the reality of homosexual liaisons did not mean that same sex
					 couples should be granted the right to marriage. He went on to say that the
					 institution of marriage should be protected.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said that the continuity of our society depended on
					 there being a margin around things like that, around marriage. He added that
					 many people, he being one, saw marriage as one of the bedrock institutions of
					 our society.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Vatican recently stated that the impact on the
					 family needed to be one of the prime considerations in all political action.
					 There is not a major religion on the face of the globe that does not value the
					 role of family in our society today. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have made no secret of my personal belief that the
					 family is central to the well-being of our society. I also feel that one of the
					 central pillars underpinning the family is marriage and marriage, by definition
					 and by law, is the union of a man and a woman. Because of that, I cannot
					 support the hon. member's bill.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I will be splitting my time with the
					 member for Vancouver East.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was just over a year and a half ago that we
					 celebrated in my riding the passage of the historic Bill C-23. It was an
					 amazing step in terms of the equality of our gay and lesbian couples, in terms
					 of their common law relationships and being treated the same as heterosexual
					 couples.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important now that the member for
					 Burnaby--Douglas has brought to the House the final step in achieving ultimate
					 equality for these couples. It is clear that couples who would like to
					 formalize their relationship would like the state and their religious faith to
					 recognize that commitment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our country will only ever be as strong as the
					 individual family units that have decided that they will look after one
					 another. It is extraordinarily important that these units are recognized and
					 have the full right of other couples. To have any less a relationship speaks
					 against the diversity that we welcome in this country. We must move beyond
					 tolerance and into the respect and the true equality that is beyond the kind of
					 discrimination that prevents these couples from marriage.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are times for parliament to lead and this is one
					 of them. To be spend time and money in the courts when the Canadian public is
					 way ahead of us on this is a shame. It is truly an important time and it is
					 disappointing that the bill is non-votable because some of the small concerns
					 around the bill could have been very easily sorted out in committee.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important that we move forward in addressing this
					 discrimination. I, together with the member for 
					 Toronto
						Centre--Rosedale, support the member for Burnaby--Douglas, EGALE
					 and all the people who have worked so hard to achieve this final step in true
					 equality for all Canadians.</p>

					 NDP): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for
					 Burnaby--Douglas for bringing forward this issue. It is an historic day because
					 we are debating in the House of Commons the issue of same sex marriage.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recognize the outstanding, tireless and very
					 passionate efforts of my colleague from Burnaby--Douglas. He has been an
					 advocate for all human rights as well as equality for gays and lesbians in
					 Canada and around the world for many years. His work in bringing this issue
					 forward today so we can debate the bill and hopefully move forward is something
					 that is very important.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I listened carefully to the debate in the House. It was
					 disturbing to hear some of the members who spoke in opposition to the bill
					 because the reasons and excuses they came up with were simply indefensible. At
					 the end of the day it comes down to this: we either have equality in the
					 country or we do not. We cannot have half equality. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-23 was a good piece of legislation in as far as
					 it went. It did not really deal with the issue of equality in terms of
					 marriage. Therefore I feel very strongly about the importance of the bill. We
					 heard arguments that too many laws would have to be changed and that somehow we
					 could not do anything because Canada was based on common law. These were all
					 weak excuses that really did not deal with the fundamental issue before us:
					 equality for gays and lesbians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was involved with Bruce Eriksen for 24 years in a
					 common law relationship. During the course of that relationship I never opposed
					 or denied the right of heterosexual couples to have the choice to marry. I am
					 now involved in a same sex relationship. I do not deny or oppose anyone's
					 choice either to be involved in a common law relationship or a relationship
					 that is affirmed by marriage. That is really what the debate is about today.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must be careful that we do not go down the road of
					 hypocrisy. We heard members say that they do not support discrimination against
					 gays and lesbians. If that is correct we must be true to what the charter says.
					 One of the unfortunate things is that so much legislation comes about because
					 of litigation, forcing people through the courts. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be preferable if parliament, as the federal
					 body in the country that has the leadership and mandate to deal with issues
					 like this, would send a clear signal that equality includes the right of gays
					 and lesbians to marry if they so choose.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope there are other members of the House who will
					 put aside their prejudice and discrimination and will recognize that if they
					 support the charter and equality then they will support the bill. They will
					 make sure people are not forced into incredible litigation when it is an issue
					 that should be decided by the House of Commons.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I commend the member for St. John's East
					 on his speech because he captured the feelings of many of us who are opposed to
					 the legislation perfectly. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to correct an impression conveyed by some
					 of those supporting the legislation. It is true that the majority of Canadians
					 support equal benefits to dependent couples, be they dependent couples in a
					 same sex, heterosexual or family relationship. However the majority of
					 Canadians do not support the idea of same sex marriage and there are some very
					 good reasons for this. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I really do not like to be tarred with the brush of
					 being discriminatory because I do not agree with the bill. I believe that we
					 must provide equality to all Canadians in dependent relationships. The concept
					 of marriage goes back several thousand years and it is intimately connected
					 with religion, not just Christianity but other religions. The religious
					 institution of marriage preceded the civil institution of marriage. We do a
					 great disrespect to religion when civil society takes what was originally a
					 religious concept and turn it to its own ends.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even as a civil institution, I have difficulty with the
					 idea of marriage as a same sex relationship because it could affect the rights
					 of children. I believe that when all things are absolutely even we should
					 regard children as being better off with a heterosexual parental relationship
					 rather than a same sex parental relationship. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not to say that we cannot have same sex parents
					 who are very good just as we can have heterosexual parents who are very bad.
					 The natural order of things is that we would assume until there is real proof
					 to the contrary that children are better off, all other things being equal,
					 with heterosexual parents. Until we can prove otherwise we have to allow for
					 the rights of children before the rights of adults.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is all I have to say on the subject. I believe
					 that the member who introduced the bill believes in what he is intending. I
					 took very much to heart his idea of the romantic concept of the same sex
					 relationship, but in the end we have to set aside our desires for absolute
					 equality as adults and defer to the absolute rights of children.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, there are two points that I would like to

					 be leading the courts and not the other way around and that parliament should
					 not wait until it gets direction from the courts. I agree wholeheartedly.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since I was elected in 1993 the House of Commons has
					 dealt with this issue on a number of occasions. I remember the first time when
					 the member for Hochelaga--Maisonneuve brought in a motion to bring in benefits
					 for same sex partners. I recall that only 10 Liberals voted for it at that
					 time. We have spoken many times on what Canadian society wants when it comes to
					 the sanctity of marriage. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been stated that this in no way demeans
					 heterosexual marriage. I contend that it does. Not long ago the House of
					 Commons asked me to fill out a form indicating who I would like to have as my
					 travelling partner because it pays for a travelling partner. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is demeaning to my wife to whom I have been
					 married for 40 years. She has never worked in an employed position so she has
					 been dependent on me not only for income but for providing for the family and
					 for providing for our retirement. She has worked very hard. I would venture to
					 say, though not being paid, she has probably worked harder than I have. She is
					 a wonderful mother and grandmother and now she is reduced to being a travelling
					 partner. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legislation does have an effect and I resent that.
					 She is my wife, my dearly beloved, and I hope that we have another 20 or 30
					 years together as is the habit in our family. </p>

	Mr. Speaker, I will start with the comment by the
					 member for Elk Island who spoke about his relationship with his wife of over 40
					 years. He felt somehow that relationship was being demeaned by the fact that he
					 designated her as his travelling companion. Let us be clear about why the House
					 of Commons moved in that important area. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would have loved it if the spouses, companions and
					 partners of those of us who are gay and lesbian in the House were recognized
					 equally. It is precisely because the House was not prepared to extend full and
					 open recognition to our partners that we must designate a traveller. Why should
					 my partner not be treated equally with respect to the rights to travel as the
					 wife of the member for Elk Island? Why should it be any different at
					 all?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to the Liberal member who spoke just
					 before the member for Elk Island, he suggested that the right of a child to be
					 raised in a nurturing and loving environment was the most important issue. He
					 said very clearly that gay and lesbian families were not in a position to do
					 that as effectively as heterosexual families. That is simply false. A number of
					 studies have indicated that children raised in loving gay or lesbian families
					 are well adjusted. In fact those families are just as strong, nurturing and
					 loving as heterosexual families.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is insulting to gay and lesbian families and
					 partners who are raising children to suggest that they are not just as able to
					 raise kids in loving environments as heterosexual families.</p>

						  If we could have married years ago, we would have. We have always supported and
						  relied on each other. When one of us is down, the other is always there to
						  bring him back up. Years ago, we exchanged rings as a symbol of our love and
						  commitment and have never taken them off, except on one occasion when we
						  exchanged our initial set of rings for a new set. Being able to legally marry
						  now would simply allow us to gain legal recognition of the reality of our
						  relationship. Denying us the right to marry sends a message that our
						  relationship is less deserving of recognition just because we are gay. I
						  believe that Lloyd and I deserve to be able to legally marry, as heterosexual
						  couples do, and to be recognized as a family unit. </small></td>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said: Mr. Speaker, I would like to inform the Chair
					 that I will be sharing my time with my colleague from Mercier.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are at war. That is our reality. In light of this
					 situation, many things are going on at the present time. A military campaign is
					 under way. It is very important--urgent even--to think of what will happen
					 after the retaliation. We need to ask ourselves not only what must be done now,
					 but also what must be done in the future. As well, we need to ask ourselves why
					 the events of September 11 occurred. What is the root of this evil?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to understand that many things have changed
					 since September 11. People's mentalities have changed as well, I believe. We
					 have realized that the world is far smaller than we thought. I have often
					 discussed globalization and the distribution of the world's wealth. Where
					 terrorism is concerned, I believe it is essential to ask ourselves whether
					 there is a link between it and poverty. Most analysts, I believe, will confirm
					 that there certainly is. It is not the entire explanation, but there is
					 certainly a connection. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When some peoples are unable to provide for their basic
					 needs, when they do not have a life allowing them to attain their full
					 potential and when they do not have access to security but at the same time
					 witness the wealth of northern countries, this can bring about jealousy, hatred
					 and interrogations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I was an Afghan today and I saw what is going on in
					 northern countries, it is likely that, like people do in those countries, I
					 would ask myself why I do not have access to the same kind of liberty, the same
					 kind of life. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, when we look at the precarious situation
					 which prevails in several countries around the world, it would be normal to
					 feel compassion. Compassion is this very human feeling which makes us realize
					 that living conditions in those countries make no sense. I ask those who are
					 against such questioning to rise. I believe it makes no sense.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since September 11, we can no longer base our
					 reflection solely on compassion. It may be sad to say, but if we look at the
					 issue in an egoistic way, we realized on September 11 that the misfortune of
					 others could also have an impact on us. As Nelson Mandela said, “Security for a
					 few is insecurity for all”. There were many people who believed, before
					 September 11, that the poverty of others was the problem of others. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can no longer think that way today. I believe the
					 events of September 11 have contributed to promote globalization, eliminate
					 distances in our world and make us realize that we truly live in a global
					 village and that more than never before the problems of other countries are our
					 own problems. Those events will at least have done one thing, that is to
					 question the whole process of international co-operation, all the co-operation
					 northern countries lend the rest of the world.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why we believe that poverty, misery and anger
					 are certainly a good breeding ground for future terrorists. This is why we
					 think it is necessary not only to reflect on Canada's aid to other countries
					 but also to ask ourselves whether Canada is really doing its share to deal with
					 the current crisis. Of course, I am still speaking in the context of
					 international co-operation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a major crisis, at present. The bombings and
					 the military intervention have parallel consequences in that they create
					 thousands of refugees for whom food and shelter will become even more of a
					 problem as winter rolls in. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is essential to examine this issue and to find
					 solutions. And if we want to talk about a new regime to replace the Taliban
					 regime, then we must also consider the economic and geopolitical aspects for
					 that entire region. When talking about reconstruction, we must keep that in
					 mind. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why the Bloc Quebecois is proposing this
					 votable motion today, which reads as follows:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>That this House call upon the
						  government to review its international aid policy with a view to substantially
						  increasing the funds available for Canadian humanitarian aid, particularly in
						  the context of the military interventions in Afghanistan, and to increasing the
						  level of its aid for development to 0.7% of GDP, as recommended by the United
						  Nations. </small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was agreed in 1969 that all countries would put 0.7%
					 of their GDP into international aid. This target was set by an independent
					 commission working under the aegis of the World Bank. The mandate of the
					 commission was to analyse the effects of 20 years of international aid and the
					 various possible perspectives. It was chaired by Lester B. Pearson, who was
					 then Canada's ambassador to the United Nations. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since then, if we look at the situation compared to
					 this international aid objective, we see that Canada ranks 17 out of 22
					 donating countries. It is no secret to anyone here that Canada has always
					 boasted about being a very compassionate country. Everyone recognizes the work
					 of peacekeepers. Canadians and Quebecers are proud of this reputation. They are
					 proud of these peaceful international missions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, words have to be matched by deeds. With Canada
					 ranking 17, we should ask ourselves some questions, particularly since other
					 countries have reached this objective of 0.7% of GDP.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have here figures that show that Luxembourg has
					 reached this objective of 0.7%. Norway has even exceeded it, since it is at
					 0.8% of its GDP. Sweden is at 0.81%. The Netherlands are at 0.82%, while
					 Denmark is at 1.06%. This is definitely not an objective that is impossible to
					 achieve, since countries smaller than Canada have reached these
					 percentages.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this is not the only thing that must be done. I
					 believe we also have to do some serious thinking. It should have occurred
					 before September 11, but now that everyone feels more involved, all of us on
					 this planet must stop and ask ourselves how we can turn international aid into
					 something effective, something that will have a positive impact. Will this be
					 achieved merely by increasing financial assistance? I do not think so.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe there are other solutions. We should consider
					 forgiving the debt of third world countries, for instance. There is also the
					 type of aid to be provided. Is the aid provided through CIDA effective? Are we
					 investing enough money in education? Should we invest more in basic
					 needs?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a long way to go. I do not think that a day
					 like today will solve all the problems, but the Bloc Quebecois should be
					 commended for raising this issue. I hope that greater priority will be given to
					 it. Many questions have to be asked, and much needs to be done, and it is from
					 this perspective that we presented this motion today.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise on the motion
					 that the Bloc has brought forward. While in principle I agree with many of the
					 sentiments my colleague from the Bloc has talked about, especially in regard to
					 coming up with innovative ideas to aid the developing world with our assistance
					 dollars, I would like to ask him a question, especially in light of the fact
					 that the Bloc is calling for 0.7% of the GDP as a target for international

					 true, but in actual dollar values he should recognize that we are actually 8th
					 in the world in comparison to the other countries. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am interested in knowing from my colleague from the
					 Bloc whether he is asking that this money go through the CIDA budget. This is
					 most important since CIDA is the primary agency for international development.
					 Does he think that this money, this increase that the Bloc has put forward,
					 should be directed through CIDA and that CIDA would be the recipient of the
					 majority of this increase? In light of the fact that most of us do have some
					 problems with CIDA, I would like to hear his thoughts on what he feels is the
					 most effective way to do this. </p>

				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, my colleague is asking a question I
					 touched on briefly in my remarks. The motion before us suggests a certain goal,
					 but it does not spell out the exact means to reach that goal. I have been
					 talking about various options. Other issues should be raised, like the access
					 to markets in the north by developing countries.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mike Moore, from the WTO, says that the opening up of
					 the markets on countries in the north could generate three times more wealth
					 than does the current international assistance. This is what I want to warn the
					 hon. members about today. There are many options. Should all the money be
					 channeled through CIDA? That is not what we are suggesting today.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this money goes to NGOs that accomplish useful,
					 efficient and relevant work in the field, I have no problem if the money is not
					 channeled through CIDA. If CIDA can demonstrate with openness that its actions
					 are efficient too, we do no mind if the money goes through this agency or not.
					 Efficiency is what counts. I do not think today is the time to deal with the
					 fine details of our assistance. We should discuss a financial goal that is,
					 ultimately, our responsibility.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why this motion mentions the level of 0.7% of
					 GDP. If tomorrow or in his next budget, the Minister of Finance increases
					 considerably the level of our assistance, it would be relevant, in my opinion,
					 if the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade examined
					 the most efficient means to make this assistance more profitable. I think this
					 is the best way to go.</p>

</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very proud to speak to this motion today, since
					 there is a story behind this goal set by the United Nations in 1990.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, for those listening, “0.7% of GDP” is not 1%; it
					 means seven-tenths of one percent. And the GDP is an accepted manner of
					 measuring wealth.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This goal was adopted by the United Nations in 1990.
					 Canada should have special feelings when it comes to this figure, because the
					 man who signed the United Nations report in 1969 that recommended this goal for
					 the first time was known by many people in this chamber. It was Lester B.
					 Pearson, who was Canada's ambassador to the UN at the time.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to the serious international situation back
					 then, and in response to what he considered as the failure of developmental
					 aid, Pearson recommended this goal and hoped it would be reached by 1975. It
					 was only in 1990--when it was proposed by a developing country,
					 incidentally--that the United Nations finally voted to set it as a goal for all
					 countries.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is interesting for Quebecers and Canadians to know
					 is that, in 1990 when it was adopted, Canada contributed 0.48%. It was close to
					 seven-tenths. It was 4.8 tenths of one per cent.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, since Canada now gives 0.25%, it now
					 gives half, proportionally, of what it gave in 1990 towards the goal set in
					 1969 by Lester B. Pearson. This is unacceptable. We have said it again and
					 again. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As my young and brilliant colleague from
					 Lac-Saint-Jean--Saguenay was saying, this goal is seen in a completely new
					 perspective since these attacks that disrupted the whole world. I am talking of
					 course of the September 11 attacks in New York, in Washington and elsewhere.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The events of September 11 were very instructive for
					 everybody. The terrorists are not poor people but they feed on the
					 international situation and, moreover, they already have imitators amongst the
					 young people in Arab and Muslim countries, and in many other very poor
					 countries, who have no hope and who live in desperate conditions. I think of
					 Colombia for example, where chaos has almost become a way of life. And what
					 about Palestine? </p>


	<A NAME="T1220"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1220"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1225"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1215"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1220)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;September 11 was quite instructive. The international
					 aid, which will have to take many different forms, will have to reach at least
					 this goal because the present challenge deals less with unfairness and more
					 with fairness. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be people to say that it is a huge amount
					 but compared to the poverty in which many people are living, it is far from
					 being too large. It is interesting to note in passing that it is mainly in
					 small countries that the 0.7% goal has not only been reached but exceeded.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Denmark, which is a rich small country, with a
					 population of about 5 million people share 1.06% of its wealth. The Netherlands
					 have a population of about 15 million and share some 0.82% of their wealth.
					 Sweden and Norway share 0.8%. Those are small rich countries that have realized
					 that they cannot be satisfied with being happy and part of the richest
					 countries if they are alone at the top. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;September 11 showed us that there is no longer any
					 country, no matter how large, strong and rich--and I am thinking of the United
					 States and of the European countries--that can hope to ensure its own security
					 without being at all concerned about the rest of the world. Mrs. Fréchette,
					 Kofi Annan's assistant and UN deputy secretary general, who was here and who I
					 had the privilege to teach as a young teacher at College Basile Moreau, said
					 that if we wanted to counter the violence, intolerance and fanaticism of
					 terrorists and protect the values that are dear to us, including freedom,
					 tolerance, justice and equality, we had to do a better job at reducing economic
					 disparities between the rich and the poor.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We could also quote numerous World Bank reports,
					 including the 2000-01 report, which says “Poor people live without fundamental
					 freedoms of action and choice that the better-off take for granted. They often
					 lack adequate food and shelter, education and health, deprivations that keep
					 them from leading the kind of life that everyone values. They also face extreme
					 vulnerability to ill health, economic dislocation, and natural disasters”.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be noted that, in countries like ours, less
					 than one--these are statistics--or let us say rather that one out of 100
					 children dies before the age of five. In poorer countries, one out of five
					 children die before the age of five. Ninety-five per cent of the 160,000 people
					 who contract AIDS daily come from poor countries. AIDS has become a disease of
					 the poor. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada must make a commitment to meet that 0.7% target
					 proposed by Pearson in 1969 and set in 1990. The question is not to determine
					 whether or not CIDA is the main vehicle or whether or not CIDA has faults. What
					 is important is to have the political will to meet that target, and I say it is
					 a minimum.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the Quebec summit, the Prime Minister even said that
					 we needed to do that but we need to do it as soon as possible, not in 10 years.
					 Now we must decide how it should be done. It can certainly be done through
					 multilateral means. In 1990 the rule was that 20% had to go through large
					 international institutions such as the World Bank. We could go back to
					 that.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The important thing is to really start working toward
					 helping restore equity. Yes, we must have open borders but it will not be
					 enough if that only allows rich people in those countries to get even richer.
					 The work to be done is enormous. </p>

	Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time with my
					 colleague, the member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce--Lachine, the Parliamentary
					 Secretary to the Minister for International Cooperation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pre-eminently privileged to speak on behalf of the
					 Government of Canada and state that we support the motion. I am confident that
					 I reflect to the House similar sentiments from my constituents, the people of
					 Winnipeg North--St. Paul, and other fellow Canadians nationwide because support
					 for international development activities is at the core of Canadian humanity.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am speaking today on behalf the Minister for
					 International Cooperation who would have been here were she not in the midst of
					 the UNESCO meetings in Paris exploring avenues on how to improve access to
					 education for all boys and girls in developing countries.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last week the minister co-chaired the World Coalition
					 for Africa meeting in Botswana which focused on organizing support for the
					 development and reduction of poverty, notably on the role of the private sector
					 in the recovery and progress of the African economies so necessary in achieving
					 these goals. Poverty reduction and sustainable development are key global
					 challenges.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion before us calls upon the government to
					 review its international aid policy. In fact the minister and her department,
					 CIDA, are already engaged in a process of reviewing our program to bolster the
					 effectiveness of Canada's aid to developing countries and to make Canada's
					 development co-operation program more effective in building a better quality of
					 life for some of the poorest and most marginalized people in the
					 world.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister and her officials visited 10 Canadian
					 cities and heard from over 1,000 organizations and individuals. Many excellent
					 suggestions emerged from these extensive community consultations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, that there was a need for more public awareness
					 of the role and importance of international development co-operation and of
					 Canada's international aid program. The debate we are having today in the House
					 should help in this regard. It reminds us that the international aid program is
					 firmly rooted in our sense of social justice and humanity. It reminds us that
					 it is inherently good; good for strengthening democracy and socialist ability
					 for promoting peace. It reminds us that Canadian interests are also served by
					 measures that serve our global interdependence. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, we also heard from consultation participants
					 the call for funding increases that would put Canada on track toward the 0.7%
					 target, 0.7% of the gross domestic product, as raised in the motion before
					 us.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me assure colleagues and all Canadians that the
					 government remains fully committed to working toward this objective as our
					 fiscal position permits. The 2000 budget provided an additional $435 million to
					 official development assistance and, in the last Speech from the Throne, we
					 committed to further increases.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, we also heard the need for better co-ordination
					 of development initiatives across the international community of donors and
					 recipients and for better ways to co-operate with our partners so that we are
					 not duplicating the efforts of others.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our support for the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan
					 is one good example. Our strategic response has taken into account the
					 priorities expressed by our partners on the ground. We can take pride that
					 Canada was one of the first countries to respond to the UN appeal for
					 assistance to meet the plight of Afghan refugees, committing a total of $16
					 million in humanitarian assistance in the past month alone.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through CIDA, the Government of Canada has provided in
					 the last decade almost $160 million to help alleviate the suffering of refugees
					 and internally displaced persons affected by two decades of conflict and three
					 years of devastating drought in that part of the world. Our current support is
					 directed to various UN agencies and humanitarian organizations that are working
					 to provide the basic necessities of life, food, shelter and health care, to the
					 Afghan refugees and others who are victims of this crisis. The funds are also
					 being used to help support various peace building initiatives in the region. We
					 are conscious of the impact of the situation across south and central Asia and
					 are particularly mindful of the pressure on Pakistan which is providing safe
					 haven for millions of Afghan refugees.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government acted to relieve some of the burden on
					 Pakistan by converting up to $447 million of its debt owed to CIDA. This means
					 that instead of making debt payments, Pakistan will be able to put the money
					 into education and other social programs.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has recently focused on four key social
					 development priorities: health and nutrition, basic education, HIV and AIDS,
					 and child protection. These are strategic investments and by nature investing
					 in the future.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Children as beneficiaries have a right to know, to
					 think, to aspire and to hope. Minimum levels of education and health are
					 crucial to sustainable development. We believe that education, among other
					 things, is the development of ideals. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good social policy begets good economic policy,
					 especially in today's globalized economy. Smaller nations need assistance so
					 they may develop the skills required to take part in multilateral trade
					 agreements and benefit from them. In turn they develop strong and stable
					 democracies. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last week in Shanghai, China, on the occasion of the
					 meeting of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation, APEC group, Canada announced
					 that it would earmark $9 million toward helping to improve the growth prospects
					 of developing economies in southeast Asia and to help build the capacity of
					 developing countries to integrate into the global economy and thereby help
					 generate wealth for the social well-being of their people.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, a recent Nobel prize
					 recipient, said that the best hope for least developed countries and, indeed,
					 for the developing world in general, lies in a new round of global,
					 multilateral trade negotiations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May it please the House to know that the APEC economies
					 during their recently concluded ministerial and leaders meetings in Shanghai
					 unanimously echoed the same sentiment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our international aid policy is an integral part of our
					 foreign policy objectives as set out in the document “Canada in the World”. We
					 shall conquer the great enemies of poverty and neglect in our own Canadian way
					 that has defined the greatness of Canada. We will provide measures to a
					 stricken people in the midst of a stricken nation in peace or in war. We will
					 continue to wave the bountiful flag of Canada so that the gates of opportunity
					 and peace shall be open to all peoples of the world.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We support the motion.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I listened with interest to the speech
					 made by my colleague, and I have a short question to ask him.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1990-91, Canada's contribution to international aid
					 was 0.48%. When the Liberals took power, it dropped to 0.41%, which is 0.5%
					 less. Now it is down to 0.25%.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member could make the best speeches in the world
					 but does he not agree that the federal government has a lot of catching up to
					 do and very quickly? We all know that international aid is used only to face up
					 to urgent situations as there is now in Afghanistan. It is also a tool for the
					 redistribution of wealth. I believe in this matter we were caught in the act,
					 and this goes for all G-7 countries, Canada in particular, of contributing
					 insufficiently--I would even say almost nominally--to the point where we are
					 unable to correct the situation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the member not agree that since a new budget will
					 be presented in a month this would be a good time to make a major effort in
					 this regard? We will have to meet obligations in defence but will we also
					 fulfill our obligations in international assistance?</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we would like to impress upon the opposition is

	Mr. Speaker, as the Parliamentary Secretary to the
					 Minister for International Cooperation, I would like to take the opportunity
					 the hon. member for Lac-Saint-Jean—Saguenay is giving the government to show
					 its commitment to international aid, especially for refugees and displaced
					 people in Afghanistan.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For several weeks emergency humanitarian aid has been
					 getting all the attention, and rightly so. Humanitarian aid is a fundamental
					 way to meet the immediate needs of men, women and children who are suddenly the
					 victims of terrible conflicts or natural disasters. I will deal with this in a
					 moment, but I want to stress that our international aid program is far from
					 limited to just immediate needs.</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada's international assistance program is part of a
					 larger picture with universal long term goals. Just over a year ago, the Prime
					 Minister and leaders from around the world, from rich countries and poor
					 countries, gathered at the UN for the millennium summit. There they committed
					 to reaching a number of goals which we now call the millennium development
					 goals. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These goals are: to eradicate extreme poverty and
					 hunger; to achieve universal primary education; to promote gender equality and
					 empower women; to reduce child mortality; to improve maternal health; to combat
					 HIV, AIDS, malaria and other diseases; to ensure environmental sustainability;
					 and, finally, to develop a global partner for development.</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reaching those goals is of the outmost importance for
					 the future of all the peoples of the world, including Canadians. Prosperity,
					 security and stability on our planet not only depend on our collective success
					 as a community of nations but also on our individual will as a country.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why the Canadian International Development
					 Agency, CIDA, continues to carry out its mandate of support for sustainable
					 development in the fight against poverty. This is why our international aid
					 program is one of the priorities of the Prime Minister and his
					 government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last week the Minister for International Cooperation
					 was in Botswana as joint chair of the Global Coalition for Africa. With her
					 colleagues from Africa and other industrialized countries, she discussed means
					 to support the new African initiative.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This initiative, which is without precedent, was
					 launched by leaders of Africa in order to give the whole African continent the
					 chance to get out of poverty and achieve the objectives of development for the
					 millennium. We will play a leading role in the development of the answer the
					 G-8 countries will give to the new African initiative next year when Canada
					 hosts the G-8 summit at Kananaskis in Alberta.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Minister for International Cooperation is unable
					 to take part in this debate it is because at this very moment she is at UNESCO
					 headquarters promoting “Education for all” which, as members will have noted,
					 is one of the millennium development objectives. As a matter of fact, access to
					 education is far from being universal.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder if we are aware of the fact that 113 million
					 boys and girls, but mostly girls, do not have access to the most elementary
					 education. This is 20 times the number of Canadian children. Those children are
					 doomed to illiteracy, disease and utter poverty.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know that prosperity in Canada is based upon
					 universal and free access to education, without distinction of gender, ethnic
					 origin or any other factor. We all know that if Canadians live peacefully
					 together and with their neighbours, it is because we have an educated
					 population, which is a critical foundation of the democratic institutions we
					 are so proud of.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for International Cooperation and her
					 department, CIDA, are multiplying their efforts to contribute to education for
					 all on a global scale. Incidentally, in the year 2005 the Canadian contribution
					 to basic education will have quadrupled, for a total investment of $555 million
					 over five years.</p>

	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now let me turn to Canada's support for the people of
					 Afghanistan. Canada was one of the first countries to respond to the initial
					 appeal by the United Nations. We have provided our assistance strategically and
					 in close consultation with our people in the field and with major humanitarian
					 organizations such as the Red Cross, the World Food Program and the UN high
					 commissioner for refugees.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to the crisis of the past few weeks, CIDA
					 has given $16 million, and I do mean given; the money has already been
					 allocated. I am proud to say that when this government makes an announcement
					 for international aid, the money is on its way. Canada has delivered in the
					 short term.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past and in the future, Canada has and will
					 continue to deliver in the long term as well. Over the past decade, long before
					 the events of September 11, we were already working side by side with the
					 people of Afghanistan, helping them in the wake of twenty years of conflict and
					 three years of a devastating drought. Providing basic health care and
					 preventative nutrition, supporting teachers in makeshift schools, demining
					 roads, villages and fields and sowing the seeds of peace, we have truly been
					 supporting ordinary people doing extraordinary things to survive and give their
					 communities a sense of hope.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are already considering the next steps, including
					 peace building activities because fostering opportunities for dialogue,
					 understanding and reconciliation are the foundations of stable societies. We
					 are also looking ahead to the kind of longer term support we will be able to
					 offer to the people of Afghanistan in the event of their choosing a
					 representative, internationally recognized government dedicated to lifting that
					 country out of poverty.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the words of World Bank president James
					 Wolfensohn:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">

						  the world community...is that of fighting poverty and promoting inclusion
						  worldwide. This is even more imperative now, when we know that because of the
						  terrorist attacks, growth in developing countries will falter, pushing millions
						  more into poverty and causing tens of thousands of children to die from
						  malnutrition, disease and deprivation.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why the government is pleased to support this
					 motion. The motion is consistent with the government's ongoing commitment to
					 international assistance. It is consistent with the government's increase of
					 $435 million over three years that the last federal budget provided for the
					 international assistance envelope. It is also consistent with our commitment to
					 work in a responsible fashion toward increasing official development assistance
					 to 0.7% of our gross national product as our fiscal situation
					 permits.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, the government supports the motion. As I just
					 stated, it is consistent with the actions of the government over the last
					 couple of years to increase the official international assistance envelope. It
					 is consistent with the throne speech of this year where the government
					 committed to increasing international assistance and the envelope for
					 that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to commend the member from the opposition for
					 this motion because it is consistent with the government's policy. We have done
					 a lot in terms of international development and we have a lot more to do. That
					 is why the government has already made the commitment to increase our official
					 international assistance.</p>

					 Canadian Alliance): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise to speak on the
					 motion brought forward by the Bloc about international aid. International aid
					 is an important part of Canada's contribution to the international community.
					 The Bloc motion asks for an increase in CIDA's, or international development,
					 aid to respond to the immediate humanitarian crisis and, in particular, for a
					 more effective response to the crisis in Afghanistan.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Alliance fully supports this portion of
					 the Bloc motion. The official opposition has long been calling for more aid for
					 the innocent people of Afghanistan. Unfortunately Canada's contribution to this
					 effort has been disgracefully small. We must be thoughtful about finding
					 solutions for this complicated humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bombing campaign is in its fourth week and the
					 minister for international development, as has been alluded to by the
					 parliamentary secretary on many occasions, has travelled to Africa and Europe,
					 but has not found time to go to Pakistan to figure out the solution to the
					 refugee problem. The former minister of foreign affairs has already done this
					 with Oxfam. I have also learned that CIDA still has only three field offices in
					 Pakistan.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc motion also calls for an increase in the
					 international aid budget from .25% to 0.7% of the GDP as recommended by the
					 United Nations. Let us be realistic. I have listened to my colleagues from the
					 Bloc and to the replies given by the government. What I have found is an
					 absolutely vague concept. They both agree to 0.7% as recommended by the United
					 Nations but apparently there is absolutely no plan.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government agrees and very nicely says that it is
					 committed to this goal when it has the resources. Whether it will be in 10 or
					 15 years, as the Bloc just asked, we do not know. It is nice for the government
					 to say that it likes this target, that the target has been there for many years
					 and that it will probably be there for many more but there is absolutely no
					 plan on how the money will be raised or when it will be available.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc is requesting immediate funds in the next
					 budget as there are major important issues facing the country, national
					 security being number one. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This would amount to an increase of 280% or
					 approximately $4 billion. The nation is currently in a state of war and we have
					 a primary responsibility to enhance the national security for Canadians, not to
					 mention the ensuring physical responsibility.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Alliance is calling for a balanced budget and will
					 not accept another deficit. Even the Canadian Council for International
					 Cooperation, a respected group of NGOs that understands international
					 development, is only asking for an increase of .25% to .35% over four years.
					 That is the plan.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must be thoughtful and recognize that any increase
					 would need to coincide with fundamental CIDA re-prioritization of its reform.
					 Why do I talk about CIDA? Because all the money will be channelled through
					 CIDA. We need therefore to re-tool CIDA for effective humanitarian assistance
					 and development aid for the benefit of the poor countries of the
					 world.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This development aid should promote sound investment
					 plans, good governance and adherence to the rules of law. We have come full
					 circle from the 1970s when there was government to government aid, then from
					 the 1980s when aid had been given through the NGOs for more effective
					 accountability. Now we look for other means.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me point at this time to a study by the Australian
					 government on globalization that provides very interesting data on how much
					 world poverty has been reduced. According to this study, up to 1.2 billion of
					 the developing world's 4.8 billion people still live in extreme poverty, but
					 the proportion of world population living in poverty has been steadily
					 declining. Since 1980, the absolute number of poor people has stopped rising
					 and appears to have fallen in recent years, despite strong population growth in
					 poor countries. If the proportion living in poverty had not fallen since 1987,
					 a further 215 million people would be living in extreme poverty
					 today.</p>


	<A NAME="T1300"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1300"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1305"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1255"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1300)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The very poorest countries now represent less than 8%
					 of the world's population, compared with just over 45% in 1970. That is quite
					 amazing. In countries that have embraced the opportunities created by global
					 economic integration, strong economic growth has been the result, which of
					 course decreases poverty.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, most progress has taken place in developing
					 countries that have refined their policies, institutions and infrastructure and
					 opened the doors to create investment. During the 1990s their growth in GDP per
					 person was 5% a year compared with 2% for rich countries. This is
					 amazing.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact is that globalization is leading to an
					 economic boom or what economists call convergent growth, where the growth in
					 developing countries that have embraced globalization is fast enough to narrow
					 the gap with the leading economies. If we want to find an innovative solution
					 for the international development corporation, I suggest that it would be
					 crucial for us to recreate CIDA, with sound private investment policies being
					 the key to its development purposes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To do this, we need to be thoughtful about re-mandating
					 CIDA, not throwing more money to an institution that is having marginal
					 success. The mandate of CIDA must be fundamentally reformed. First, CIDA must
					 function effectively as a conventional humanitarian relief agency, working with
					 international and non-governmental organizations to deliver immediate
					 assistance. Let me acknowledge the excellent work NGOs are doing in addressing
					 the immediate humanitarian and social problems arising in the short term. I am
					 of course talking about the AIDS issue and food shortages and, in the case of
					 Afghanistan, the victims of the brutal regime and war.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sadly, much of CIDA's social engineering priorities are
					 preventing the agency from delivering effective and functional aid. Even the
					 Minister for International Cooperation has admitted that CIDA has only a 20%
					 success rate with its functions. This must change.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The October 2000 report of the auditor general was
					 critical of CIDA's bureaucratic programs. He reported that CIDA did not comply
					 with treasury board contracting policy or the government's contracting
					 relations. He went on to state: </p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>The terms and conditions for grants
						  and contributions related to the Geographic programs are very general and
						  provide no direction on how and when to use contribution agreements...CIDA's
						  use of contribution agreements to select executing agencies often varied from
						  its stated internal policies or practices.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is of considerable concern since the geographic
					 programs, which include Africa, constitute about 40% of CIDA's total
					 budget.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only effective solution before us to increase the
					 private capital flow to the developing world is through a continuous promotion
					 of globalization at this particular juncture. That is why I have been vocal for
					 the opening of new development around the world trade negotiations next month
					 in Qatar.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Alliance feels it is Canada's
					 responsibility to support international development and we agree with this
					 concept, but we think it is irresponsible at this stage to call for a 0.7%
					 increase when there is a need for expenditure in other areas at this given
					 time. We feel this is a vague goal with no precise, laid out timelines or
					 anything so it is difficult for us to support.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the hon. member aware of this and is he supportive

					 $700 million that it represents? Is the hon. member supportive of Canada

					 million a year, it is forgiven if it uses that money for social development

				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, yes, I am very well aware of that. What I
					 find funny about this is that this was in response to a humanitarian crisis
					 that was taking place. While the member very proudly talks about the Pakistan
					 issue, it just happened and was a reflection of the Afghanistan issue. It was
					 not a well thought out or well laid out plan. Of course maybe she is also aware
					 that under the IMF there are certain conditions that countries have to meet for
					 debt forgiveness. The conditions are laid out. The responsibility under those
					 conditions has been thrown onto the governments that need to pay these debts.
					 They have to come up and show responsibility. We cannot write blank
					 cheques.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, yes, I am supportive of the programs that
					 the IMF has come out with and that have laid down quite clearly the conditions.
					 I must tell my colleague from the other side that there are very few countries
					 that at this point have actually met those conditions, because they have to go
					 through a structural change. The idea behind the structural change is that they
					 take the responsibility for their nation of governing.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that in the past government to government aid
					 has been very ineffective, especially in those countries, so we need to be very
					 careful when we are throwing this money around. In reference to Pakistan, which
					 I did not say, that is not a long thought out plan. That has just happened
					 because of the Afghanistan war. We have been calling for a comprehensive
					 package and that is one step forward in going in that direction.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I have two questions for my colleague, the

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I am convinced he will support this issue just
					 like Mike Moore did. The WTO official said “If only northern countries would
					 open up their commercial borders, they would generate increased wealth in the
					 southern countries.” </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the member agree with that? Also, does he not
					 agree that this could distribute wealth more evenly but also concentrate it
					 further?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, is my colleague aware of the fact that other
					 countries like Denmark and the Netherlands have reached the 0.7% objective? In
					 Denmark alone, international aid stands at 1.06% of GDP, whereas in Canada it
					 is 0.25%. Is this not reason enough for the member to support the
					 motion?</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<A NAME="Int-61095"></A><a HREF="#Int-61097"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-61093"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Deepak Obhrai:
				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I was with my colleague in Brussels for
					 the least developed poor countries conference and both of us heard quite
					 clearly the call of the developing countries for more access to being part of
					 the world trade system. I have alluded to that in my speech. That is one of the
					 most important routes to the long term sustainability of development in those
					 countries. Yes, in the long term I think that is what has been proven to take
					 so many people out of poverty, as the report in Australia has indicated. I
					 agree very much that this would be the key route for this issue. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the member says that it would be more
					 concentrated, I think he means that it would not trickle down to the general
					 populace. In my opinion the more we open the free trade market the more equal a
					 distribution of money will take place because at the end of the day the money
					 will not fall into the hands of the government or into the areas where it is
					 misused but will hopefully trickle down to where it can be distributed among
					 more regions of the populace, as has been proven in China and in
					 India.</p>

	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to congratulate the members of the Bloc
					 Quebecois for bringing forward this important motion.</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;September 11 was a day of unbelievable tragedy and
					 anguish as we saw over 6,000 people die in the crimes against humanity involved
					 in the terrorist attacks on New York, on Washington and in Pennsylvania. We in
					 the New Democratic Party continue to mourn the tragic loss of those victims, to
					 pay tribute to the people involved in the rescue effort and of course to do
					 everything we can to bring to justice the perpetrators of these crimes against
					 humanity.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As well, September 11 was a day on which 30,000
					 children around this planet died of preventable disease and hunger. UNICEF has
					 reminded us that each and every day on this planet 30,000 children are dying of
					 preventable disease and hunger, on September 11, on September 12, on September
					 13 and on every single day since then. There is no CNN, no publicity, but there
					 is death, despair, famine and hopelessness. Five thousand children died in Iraq
					 last month because of the impact of sanctions on that country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today we, along with the Bloc Quebecois, are calling
					 upon the government to increase significantly the level of Canada's commitment
					 to international aid. Certainly when we look at the current levels of aid,
					 Canada's performance has been nothing short of shameful. Not that many years
					 ago when the Liberals first took office in 1993, Canada was number 5 or 6 among
					 the 22 nations of the OECD. By 1999, after years of savage cuts by the
					 Liberals, we had dropped to number 12. Last year we were number 17 out of 22
					 countries in the OECD.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Roy Culpeper, the president of the North-South
					 Institute, said very clearly just this month in a document he submitted to the
					 Standing Committee on Finance for the prebudget consultations:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right">
</td>
<td><small>Mr.
						  Chairman, I will reiterate my remarks to (the Minister for International
						  Cooperation) at her consultations last week on CIDA's new directions. I said to
						  her that Canada should be ashamed of this abysmal performance. Certainly, if
						  they were still alive and with us today, prime ministers Pearson and Trudeau
						  would both be astonished and terribly disappointed at the state of
						  affairs.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our commitment as Canadians should be to meet the
					 target of 0.7% for the ODA/GNP ratio, which was established, by the way, by
					 Prime Minister Pearson. In order to meet that we should be working to get to
					 the halfway mark of 0.35% within the next five years. The parliamentary
					 secretary has said that they are increasing the level of aid and there will be
					 more coming, but the fact of the matter is that the Canadian Council for
					 International Cooperation has made it very clear that if we are to meet that
					 target of 0.35%, which is after all only halfway to the goal we have committed
					 ourselves to, it will require an annual increase of $400 million in each of the
					 next five years.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is what we are calling for as a minimum in order
					 to get us on the road to meeting those commitments. Other countries can and
					 have done far better, as others have pointed out. The Scandinavian countries,
					 for example, Sweden, Norway and Denmark along with the Netherlands, have all
					 consistently exceeded the UN target of 0.7% of GNP: Sweden at 0.7%, Norway at
					 0.91%, Denmark at 1% and the Netherlands at 0.8%.</p>


	<A NAME="T1315"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1315"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1320"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1310"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1315)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until recently we were actually falling further and
					 further behind every year. If it was imperative that we increase our aid before
					 September 11, it is even more so today. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As has been pointed out by the World Bank recently, we
					 risk a dramatic increase in the level of poverty in the wake of the September
					 11 terrorist attacks on the United States. These terrorist attacks will hurt
					 economic growth in developing countries worldwide this year and next year. As
					 many as 10 million more people will be condemned to live in poverty next year.
					 It will hamper the fight against childhood diseases and malnutrition. This is
					 all in a preliminary economic assessment that was released by the World Bank on
					 October 1 this year. Even before September 11 the bank had predicted an
					 economic slowdown, that growth in developing countries would fall as a result
					 of slowdowns in the United States, Japan and Europe.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know of course that the impact of September 11 on
					 wealthier countries means that there will be a decline in their level of
					 spending as well. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The worst hit area will be Africa where, in addition to
					 the possible increases in poverty of two to three million people as a result of
					 lower growth and incomes, a further two million people may be condemned to live
					 on below a dollar a day due to the effects of falling commodity prices. The 300
					 million poor people in sub-Saharan Africa are particularly vulnerable because
					 most countries there have absolutely no safety nets whatsoever. Poor households
					 certainly do not have any savings to cushion bad times. Half the additional
					 child deaths worldwide are likely to be in Africa. That is the area which has
					 already been hardest hit by the epidemic of HIV-AIDS.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, in the aftermath of September 11 we must do far,
					 far more. Gerry Barr on behalf of the Canadian Council for International
					 Co-operation pointed out just this week that it is imperative that there be a
					 significant increase in Canadian aid spending following the events of September
					 11. He points out that the shock waves of September 11 are likely to devastate
					 the global south. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foreign direct investment is down and is likely to go
					 even lower. Export commodity prices, on which the economies of many developing
					 countries depend, are anticipated to fall further. Recession in the markets of
					 the developed world, including in Canada, means fewer sales for the developing
					 world and declining revenues for them as well.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also very concerned that with the focus in the
					 budget on security measures, international aid and other anti-poverty measures
					 not be squeezed out as a result. We do not want to see Canada's aid spending
					 become yet another casualty of the war on terrorism.</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be a shame to see the Canadian aid budget fall
					 victim to the war on terrorism. War, conflicts and emergency situations are
					 threats to global security.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The end of hostilities must lead to the first steps
					 towards peace. Peace will only be possible through development, the even
					 distribution of resources and social agreements which, beyond the military
					 action, allow the people to establish security for all those who live on this
					 planet. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to mention the constant efforts of the
					 member for Lac-Saint-Jean—Saguenay, who has worked relentlessly in favour of
					 more justice, more fairness and a better distribution of wealth between rich
					 countries and poor countries. Since the beginning, he has spoken about the
					 terrible impact of co-operative globalization. I want to thank him for his work
					 on this important issue, which led to this motion by the Bloc Quebecois.
					 </p>


	<A NAME="T1320"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1320"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1325"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1315"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1320)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion of my friends in the Bloc also speaks about
					 the importance of increasing the level of Canada's humanitarian aid in
					 Afghanistan. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation in Afghanistan is absolutely devastating.
					 It is a humanitarian crisis. Already more than 20 years of war have devastated
					 Afghanistan, destroyed its economy and displaced huge numbers of civilians,
					 including children. Already before September 11 Afghanistan was facing its most
					 severe drought in years. The situation is only going to continue to
					 deteriorate. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aid delivery is hampered due to this terrible political
					 situation and, I might add, due to the bombing by the United States. We have
					 seen that a number of bombs have already hit Red Cross warehouses. We have seen
					 that too many innocent civilians are dying as a result of the bombing campaign.
					 In a country which is already facing massive challenges of de-mining, one of
					 the countries that already has more mines than anywhere else in the world, we
					 have seen that shamefully, the United States is continuing to use cluster bombs
					 in its bombing campaign.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Six million people are dependent on food and emergency
					 aid already in Afghanistan. Chronic instability and conflict have already
					 displaced much of the population. They are fleeing the terror of the Taliban
					 regime but they are also fleeing from the bombing. With winter months
					 approaching, children in particular are going to be susceptible to the harsh
					 climate without the necessary provisions for warmth. This five million or six
					 million people is the equivalent of the entire population of Alberta,
					 Saskatchewan and Manitoba that are fleeing as refugees. As Nadine Grant, the
					 director of programs for Save the Children Canada, said recently, “The crisis
					 looming in Afghanistan has the potential to become the worst humanitarian
					 situation in the world”. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Afghan people are already suffering the devastating
					 effects of a three year drought. The emergency crisis for Afghani children is
					 overwhelming. Three million Afghanis are already dependent on NGOs for food. It
					 is estimated that an additional three million people will also need food
					 assistance this winter. Two hundred and fifty-seven children out of every one
					 thousand die before their fifth birthday. It is one of the worst levels of
					 infant mortality in the world. There are currently 900,000 internally displaced
					 people living in Afghanistan. There are approximately 50,000 children working
					 in Kabul to support their families. In the north, as I mentioned earlier, there
					 has been near total crop failure in 1999 and 2000. An estimated 10 million live
					 mines are still buried in Afghanistan, placing children in most
					 danger.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We join today in pleading with our government to do far
					 more than it has already done to respond to this humanitarian crisis in
					 Afghanistan. So far, Canada's contribution has been approximately $16 million
					 Canadian. Norway, a country of under five million people, has contributed over
					 $80 million. Sweden has contributed over $60 million. The Netherlands has
					 contributed over $50 million. We as Canadians can and should do far
					 more.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also important that we recognize that in tackling
					 global poverty it is not good enough simply to increase levels of aid. We have
					 also to do far more to cancel the debts of the poorest countries of the world.
					 In fact, the proposal of the Canadian Ecumenical Jubilee Initiative to have the
					 debt of the world's poorest countries cancelled has been one of the most
					 important priorities for some time. Canada has not done nearly enough in this
					 regard. We cancelled the debt of some of the poorest countries but we have not
					 gone far enough.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This debt is a crushing burden on developing countries.
					 It is the most obvious expression of their poverty. The indebtedness of the
					 south condemns millions of people to lives of destitution. In fact the debt
					 load of the heavily indebted poor countries is such that they have to use their
					 meagre financial resources to make payments on their debts and they can no
					 longer spend that money to meet the basic needs of their
					 populations.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We join in calling for the objective of CIDA to be not
					 just poverty reduction, but poverty eradication. It would not take a lot. In
					 fact it has been estimated by the UN secretary general that some $40 billion
					 worldwide would be what it would take to meet the needs of the world's poorest
					 citizens. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debt reduction and opening up the markets of developed
					 countries to the products of the poorest countries is also essential,
					 particularly agricultural products, textiles and clothing. These are the
					 products that they depend upon for their survival, their economic
					 self-sufficiency. Too often our doors are slammed shut. We could get rid of
					 these tariff barriers at a minimal cost to Canadians but this would mean a huge
					 difference in the lives of the poorest around this planet.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to take a moment as well, because the WTO
					 meeting in Doha is coming up, to appeal to our government to recognize that we
					 have to be doing a lot more within the context of the trade agenda to respond
					 to global poverty. Structural adjustment programs which have been forced on
					 developing countries by the World Bank, the IMF and other international
					 financial institutions has simply increased the gap between rich and poor in
					 those countries. It has added to the level of poverty in those countries.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The WTO agenda and the agenda of the FTAA would
					 exacerbate poverty and would drive more peasants and small farmers off their
					 land. They simply cannot compete against the heavily subsidized agricultural
					 products which are flooding their countries from wealthy countries like the
					 United States and elsewhere. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to put poverty and its elimination front and
					 centre on the global trade agenda. That means also that we have to look at the
					 impact of TRIPS agreements. These are the agreements that give huge powers to
					 multinational pharmaceutical companies. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would hope that the Bloc, in addition to calling for
					 an increase in the level of aid, would recognize that we have to stop pandering
					 to the multinational pharmaceutical companies which are holding the poorest of
					 the poor up to ransom for their patent rights. In South Africa, Brazil, India
					 and elsewhere these pharmaceutical companies are demanding that they have the
					 right to protect their patents even if it means additional tens of thousands of
					 millions of lives lost in the fight against HIV-AIDS, malaria and other
					 preventable diseases. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada should be playing a far more active role in
					 speaking out against the current TRIPS agreement. Instead, the Minister for
					 International Trade says that he supports that agreement. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many areas in which the battle against
					 poverty can be fought. It can be fought within the context of trade deals and
					 not moving ahead on a new round for the WTO. Developing countries have said
					 they want to deal with some outstanding implementation issues of the existing
					 WTO before we even consider moving ahead on new deals. It means challenging
					 corporate powers within existing trade deals such as the powers given under
					 chapter 11 of NAFTA which the government seems to want to extend throughout the
					 hemisphere in the FTAA.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nelson Mandela has said that security for a few is
					 insecurity for all. Today, on behalf of my colleagues in the New Democratic
					 Party, we want to support this motion. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We appeal to the government to significantly increase
					 levels of aid to work toward meeting that target of 0.7% of GDP, to meeting the
					 interim target of 0.35% within the next three to five years, making far more
					 aid available immediately to meet the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan,
					 ending the destructive and illegal U.S. led bombing campaign in Afghanistan,
					 and forgiving the debts of the poorest countries and restructuring global
					 trading schemes to ensure that they put people, the environment and tackling
					 poverty against corporate profit.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I was listening intently to the speech of
					 the hon. member who started by alluding to the unprecedented tragedy in New
					 York. Of course we lament the loss of innocent lives which will forever remain
					 silent. That silence can never be broken. We lament the absence of smiles in
					 the families of the bereaved, smiles we know will take a long time to come
					 back. Yet at the end the member spoke about ending the war against
					 terrorism.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tool we have chosen to go after terrorists in that
					 part of the world is a coalition of nations. If the member could suggest
					 another avenue other than a military approach at this time, let him say it. The
					 terrorists will not surrender. They will not come out and say here we are, put
					 us in jail, execute us. We must make a distinction. We must pursue the
					 terrorists even if it means using military might because in the end it will
					 mean peace, security and stability in that part of the world.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the issue of the negotiations at Doha, may it please
					 the House to know that I have just returned from the meeting of APEC, the Asia
					 Pacific Economic Cooperation group of countries, in Shanghai. We announced
					 there that Canada has donated $9 million to help developing countries
					 participate meaningfully so they will know their rights as they negotiate their
					 agenda at the Doha conference. It has been agreed by all APEC economies that
					 the agenda will be on growth and development. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to international aid and debt relief, the
					 promotion of fairer trade in the world would be an additional pillar to help
					 sustainable development in developing countries.</p>

				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, my hon. colleague, the Secretary of State
					 for Asia-Pacific, has raised two important questions. He asked what the
					 alternative is to fighting against terrorism in the aftermath of September
					 11.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course every member of the House agrees that those
					 responsible for these crimes against humanity must be brought to justice.
					 However it was the parents of a young man killed in one of the World Trade
					 Centre towers who asked how on earth we would bring about justice by killing
					 more innocent victims in Afghanistan. They asked how many more innocent people
					 must die before we recognize that the U.S. led military strike is a disastrous
					 failure.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bombs are hitting hospitals. Bombs are hitting Red
					 Cross warehouses. Bombs are hitting villages and killing many more innocent
					 victims including children. How is this bringing the perpetrators of those
					 terrible terrorist attacks to justice? It is not. It is creating more innocent
					 victims.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Humanitarian agencies and the global community have
					 called for at least a pause in the bombing to enable us to get desperately
					 needed humanitarian supplies into Afghanistan. The United States has refused.
					 It has said the bombing must go ahead. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have seen this movie before. We have seen it in
					 Iraq. The U.S. was to go after Iraq and Saddam Hussein. Ten years later Saddam
					 Hussein is still very much in power in that repressive regime. What about the
					 people of Iraq? What about the innocent children of Iraq who are the victims of
					 the inhumane and genocidal sanctions? How many hundreds of thousands of people
					 must die? How many more innocent civilians in Afghanistan must die in this
					 misguided, destructive and illegal war?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member asks what the alternatives are. The
					 alternatives are to work within the framework of the United Nations to
					 establish an international tribunal similar to the tribunals established for
					 Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia. Evidence must be placed before the
					 independent tribunal for those responsible to be brought to justice. If it is
					 necessary to have a focused enforcement action under the framework of the
					 United Nations to bring them to justice, so be it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely we must recognize that the approach taken so far
					 is neither bringing the terrorists to justice nor sparing more innocent
					 lives.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will say a word regarding the second part of my hon.
					 friend's question. He asks about Doha, Qatar and the WTO agenda. He suggests
					 Canada is promoting a development agenda and that it is prepared to listen to
					 the poorest countries. The leaders of those countries said in their declaration
					 in Zanzibar earlier this year that they do not want a new round of the WTO.
					 They said they want to deal with a number of outstanding critical problems
					 under the existing provisions of the WTO. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First and foremost among these is the issue of access
					 to pharmaceutical drugs under the TRIPS agreement. The leaders of these
					 countries want to see significant changes to that. The Canadian government has
					 refused to accept any changes at all.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a lot of work to do to transform the existing
					 inequitable terms of trade into fair trade. Rather than proceeding with a new
					 round on investment, procurement and other areas, let us listen to the poorest
					 countries in the world. Let us take steps to redistribute wealth and power from
					 the wealthy to the poorest as the Bloc Quebecois motion is
					 proposing.</p>

					 PC/DR): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin by raising two
					 points. First, I want to inform the Chair that I will share my time with my
					 colleague from Fundy—Royal and, second, I want to point out the quality of the
					 motion by my Bloc colleague from Lac-Saint-Jean—Saguenay.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to say from the outset that over the last few
					 weeks, since September 11, we have talked a lot about the military aspect and
					 the military involvement. I will not refer to the pills, but we did talk a lot
					 about arms.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, the Bloc's motion proposes fresh approach to the
					 problem that arose on September 11. It takes on a human aspect. It is in
					 reference to that that I would like to commend my Bloc Quebecois colleague.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not the first time we have a debate in the
					 House on international aid or on increasing the level of humanitarian aid.
					 During the 1993 election campaign, it will be remembered, the red book stated
					 that if the government party were elected, it would accept to increase
					 international aid to bring it up to the level recommended by the United
					 Nations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members in the House will not be surprised that this
					 did not happen. There were other elections, other speeches from the throne, and
					 the government kept saying that it would increase international aid. If we look
					 at two other examples, besides the 1993 elections, the 1999 throne speech said
					 that the government was committed to increasing the level of foreign aid,
					 developing new innovative policies, improving the lot of the poorest countries
					 and enhancing the standard of life of their citizens. Perhaps this was not
					 clear enough.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the following elections, the House was reconvened
					 on January 30, 2001. About 10 months ago the government committed once again to
					 increase the level of foreign aid and to use these new investments to reduce
					 the poverty level and encourage the development of democracy. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was the third time that the governing party talked
					 about this: in the 1993 red book and in two speeches of the throne. I hope this
					 bodes well. On average, the government introduces a bill three times before it
					 gets passed. It has said three times that it would increase humanitarian aid. I
					 remember that, when the bill on young offenders or other bills were introduced,
					 the first time this did not work, the government withdrew them. The second
					 time, it said the time was right. There were elections, the House was prorogued
					 and a new session was started. After the elections, it introduced the bill once
					 again. Is this a lack of vision? Perhaps. I hope that, after talking at least
					 three times about increasing international aid, the government will now do it.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That said, it must be understood that it is a huge jump
					 from 0.25% to 0.7%. As most of my colleagues on this side of the floor have
					 said, however, we do have to start looking for the light at the end of the
					 tunnel, start looking at an increase. My colleague from the NDP has referred to
					 a middle of the road solution, of 0.35%, 0.40% or 0.46%. That is where we were
					 in 1992. With all the talk of battling the deficit, we need to realize that the
					 humanitarian aid program has been slashed more than all other items in the
					 government's budget. Canada sees itself as a figurehead on the international
					 level, but it is not even preaching by example. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today's motion proposes a new aspect to this, to ensure
					 that, on the eve of a budget which is coming within a few weeks—and it is
					 important to point that out, as has been said—the House and the government must
					 make an official commitment to step up international aid. One of the effects of
					 this, just between ourselves, moreover, would be to enhance our credibility
					 with other countries. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As several of my colleagues have pointed out, Canada is
					 lagging behind the other OECD countries. Every year, the gap increases. When we
					 realize that we are lagging behind the other OECD countries as far as
					 international aid is concerned, we have to accept that there is a very clear
					 consequence to this. Canada has lost some of its clout on the international
					 scene. If it really wants to resume its place in the international community,
					 as a leader for peace, sustainable development and assistance to the most
					 disadvantaged countries and to those faced with problems, whether natural
					 disasters or other problems, then we have to put our money where our mouth is.
					 Humanitarian aid is very important. </p>


	<A NAME="T1340"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1340"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1345"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1335"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1340)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faced with deficit problems, most countries have cut
					 their budgets. But Canada has made the deepest cuts of all G-7 countries in
					 humanitarian aid. Yes, other countries made cuts, because there were problems.
					 Unfortunately, although I hope I am wrong, this government will probably
					 experience its first recession. I am anxious to see how it will handle it, but
					 I think it will shoot itself in the foot. After enjoying a fairly prosperous
					 stretch in the years since 1993, it will have to face the music, although, of
					 course, it is not music we would wish on it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House should know that countries such as Denmark
					 are contributing 1.06%; the Netherlands, 0.82%; Sweden, 0.81%, and so
					 on.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are therefore examples. The surprising thing is
					 that these countries are not seeking to be leaders on the military or
					 peacekeeping scene. They are countries which have decided to contribute in
					 proportion to their collective wealth.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We want to be a leader everywhere but a look at our
					 humanitarian aid figures shows that we are lagging behind other countries.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foreign aid contributes to stability. Coupled with debt
					 forgiveness and liberalization of trade, it can significantly reduce poverty in
					 developing countries, paving the way as it does for sustained economic
					 development.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is more, if countries are able to crawl out from
					 under an unbelievable level of poverty and infant mortality, there are strong
					 chances that civil wars can be averted or brought to an end. There are strong
					 chances that these countries will really become democratic allies
					 internationally.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We urge the government to get with it, to support these
					 initiatives. As I said, the Prime Minister openly recommended at the G-8 in
					 Japan that industrialized countries collectively increase their foreign aid
					 contributions by 10%. We have yet to see this here.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We therefore hope that in the upcoming budget the
					 motion by the Bloc Quebecois member will have an impact, that people will
					 listen. If we are contributing hundreds of millions of dollars toward the fight
					 against terrorism in Afghanistan, we should be able to take a look at the more
					 global issue of humanitarian aid and ensure that Canada's contribution is
					 officially increased.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I wish to say that the internationalism
					 and compassion that characterized the Pearson government are a distant memory.
					 We are accustomed to governments of all stripes providing more support for
					 international development.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the government will adopt this philosophy and
					 take the action sought by the motion.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have an opportunity to
					 take the floor today in support of the Bloc motion brought forth in the
					 aftermath of September 11 and related to the ongoing war effort against the
					 Taliban regime in Afghanistan.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I send a very clear message to our military personnel
					 that parliament supports the valuable role Canadian soldiers are playing in the
					 conflict against the draconian Taliban regime. We owe our military personnel a
					 huge debt of gratitude. The heinous crime which took place on September 11,
					 complete with its disrespect for human life and high degree of premeditation,
					 cannot go unchecked. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Humanitarian agencies are also gearing up for a crisis
					 of immense proportions that is unfolding along the borders of Afghanistan. As
					 of July 1, 2000, before the tragedy of September 11, Afghanis were the largest
					 single refugee population in the world of concern to the UN high commission for
					 refugees. They comprised approximately 30% of the global refugee population. In
					 the wake of the military strikes that began after October 7, worst case
					 scenarios suggest that between 5 million and 7.5 million people may flee that
					 country and set up camps along the borders.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mark Leger, an editorialist in Saint John, New

						  crisis. The families of the U.S. victims have been the recipients of incredible
						  generosity.</small></td>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should be very grateful for the generous spirit we
					 have had with respect to looking after our American cousins in that regard. He
					 continued:</p>

</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the aftermath of September 11 our focus has been on
					 the American victims for very understandable reasons. We feel a very genuine
					 kinship with the Americans because they are our closest friends. Our economies
					 are intertwined. We travel there. We work there and families quite often
					 intermarry. Afghanistan is an alien place for most of us. It is rugged and
					 impoverished. We do not feel the same natural connectedness we have with the
					 Americans. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Afghanistan has endured a 22 year long civil war. It
					 has recorded record drought and famine during the last four years. Most of us
					 on this continent have been oblivious of that fact. After September 11 many
					 people probably opened up their atlas just to find out exactly where
					 Afghanistan was located and its proximity in terms of its borders and
					 neighbours.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Insufficient humanitarian aid is being given to Afghani
					 refugees along the borders and to suffering Afghanis still inside the country.
					 Thousands upon thousands of individuals will lose their lives from cold and
					 starvation. We have a moral obligation to assist and to ensure we do not read
					 in the history books that we allowed hundreds of thousands of individuals to
					 die in the midst of this conflict through no fault of their own.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Humanitarian aid is needed to provide stability in
					 Afghanistan. It is necessary to demonstrate that this conflict is against the
					 Taliban regime and not against the Afghani people. If we let people starve or
					 freeze to death, the Afghani people will not understand that our problem is
					 with the Taliban and not with them.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada has a vital role to play in the humanitarian
					 coalition just as it occupies a key place in the military coalition. We must
					 ensure that we reflect the same sentiments expressed by Prime Minister Blair
					 with respect to our role in the humanitarian reaction as well.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where is our Canadian leadership on this pressing
					 matter? At its worst it has been mute; at its best it has been feeble. I
					 challenge the government and our Prime Minister to step up to the plate and
					 lead by example. They should show the world the best of our Canadian
					 humanitarian tradition and reputation. Canada and the Liberal government could
					 do more by leading by example.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1993, under a Progressive Conservative government,
					 Canada could boast of the highest level of international aid among G-7
					 countries as a percentage of its GDP.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, after seven years of Liberal government, Canada
					 ranks last.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other governments in the west had to deal with the same
					 deficit problems as Canada in the early 1990s. They also had to make cuts. Of
					 all G-7 countries, Canada has reduced the most its international aid, unloading
					 its deficit problem on the back of the poorest countries in the
					 world.</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada must provide foreign aid, which is a necessary
					 component to any foreign policy, if it wishes to be a participant in the global

					 trade liberalization can have a real impact on poverty reduction in the third
					 world.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Humanitarian aid encourages sustained economic
					 development and helps countries realize the objective of becoming economically
					 self-sufficient in their own right. It introduces Canada to millions of
					 potential future consumers of Canadian products and helps us merge our
					 economies.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foreign aid can be provided in a myriad of ways. I have
					 spoken out before in support of debt forgiveness programs like Jubilee 2000.
					 Debt forgiveness is a great idea. It removes pressures from governments and
					 allows them to invest in people and stop paying interest on debt that we know
					 they will never have the capacity to pay back.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it increases its aid, as the motion calls for today,
					 Canada should look at other ways to better and more effectively take part in
					 these programs. For example, Canada should and must tie debt forgiveness to
					 countries that spend more on education and health programs than they would on
					 issues such as defence.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same way in which Canada aids Afghanistan, we
					 must ensure that we learn from mistakes that we have made in the past with
					 respect to foreign aid.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;International efforts to prepare for the post-Taliban
					 Afghanistan are necessary. Once the battle is won against the Taliban, we need
					 a long term plan and commitment in the same sentiment that we had with respect
					 to the Marshall plan and as we had in the aftermath of World War II.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada and its allies have a responsibility to ensure
					 that the U.S. led Afghan campaign does not decimate a population already
					 tortured by decades of war, poverty and misery. If we are to avert the
					 entrenchment of hate against the west, which could remain in perpetuity, we
					 must have a solid commitment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Western nations, including Canada, need to ensure that
					 refugee camps are adequately supported but these must be seen as temporary
					 solutions. The long term objective must be to return these refugees back to
					 their homes. This long term assistance, as we all know, will be expensive but
					 we need to continue our help long after the conflict ends and the headlines run
					 out. There must be sustained financial and political assistance. This includes
					 help with developing infrastructure, education and fighting against
					 diseases.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has never been a more important time to increase
					 our aid contribution. Canada can afford it given its projected surplus for this
					 year. More than that, boosting aid in this time of global upheaval and war will
					 send a very clear signal that when we talk about the long term need to address
					 the poverty that breeds helplessness, anger and sometimes even terrorism, we
					 mean it. That is why the Progressive Conservative/DR coalition is pleased to
					 support the initiative brought forth by the member for
					 Lac-Saint-Jean--Saguenay.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, the 1991 Broadcasting Act will be reviewed

					 radios that can disqualify Canadians when they become international stars. We
					 have no incentives for local programming that would build bridges between

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have the CRTC denying access to French language

					 Any review of the Broadcasting Act without a serious examination of the CRTC
					 will be ignoring the elephant in the living room.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the CRTC was created in 1968 only 13% of Canadian
					 households had cable. Even the writers of Buck Rogers could not have dreamed up
					 the satellites and Internet we use in the 21st century. I am concerned with the
					 committee decision to have minimal time for the CRTC cross-media ownership and
					 resulting convergence issues. The review may be like doing carpentry while

					 almost 50% in the past few years. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year the foundation is launching its national
					 awareness campaign “Every baby deserves a kiss--Let's kiss SIDS goodbye”.
					 During this month hundreds of volunteers will be selling chocolate lips to help

	Mr. Speaker, since 1861, the Institut Nazareth et
					 Louis-Braille has helped blind youth. The first French language establishment
					 of its kind in North America, today the Institut Nazareth et Louis-Braille has
					 the greatest concentration of specialized resources for the visually impaired
					 and the blind in Quebec.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a great need for this kind of organization. I
					 have a three year old child whose vision was just reassessed from low vision to
					 blind. My family therefore needs the services of such an organization. The
					 Institut Nazareth et Louis-Braille is celebrating its 140th anniversary this
					 year. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This organization has helped others for 140 years with
					 rehabilitation services and other state of the art services, and now it is our
					 turn to help it with our support. We must, like the institute, react with
					 respect, courtesy and fairness toward our visually impaired and blind brothers,
					 sisters, parents and children.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Quebecois commends the Institut Nazareth et
					 Louis-Braille for its remarkable work.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I would like to remind the House and all

					 Month.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Celiac disease is a condition in which the absorptive
					 surface of the small intestine is damaged by a substance called gluten. This
					 results in an inability of the body to absorb the nutrients necessary for
					 growth and good health. According to current research statistics, close to one
					 person in 200 may be affected by celiac disease, although most of them are not
					 aware of it. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Celiac Association is a national
					 organization dedicated to providing services and support to persons with this
					 disease.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I invite everyone to join with me in congratulating the
					 many volunteers of the Canadian Celiac Association. </p>

	Mr. Speaker, it is time that the government took a
					 serious look at some type of North American trade perimeter. North American
					 internal security is threatened and more resources are required at the border.
					 We could supply those resources for security if we were not doing double duty
					 at the border checking both security and trade. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is time to ask why a container that is checked and
					 sealed in Halifax, Vancouver, New York City or Mexico City needs to be stopped
					 and checked again when it crosses the border regardless of its destination. The
					 dollars freed up by this so-called trade perimeter could then be concentrated
					 on protecting the security of the individual partners and not curtailing
					 trade.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not expect the government to show leadership on
					 this issue until Canadian public opinion forces it to do so. However it is past
					 time that the positive and the negative aspects of such an idea were debated

	Mr. Speaker, the pine beetle infestation in British

					 industry, which provides thousands of jobs and produces billions of tax revenue
					 for the federal coffers. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The federal Liberals have known about this problem for

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a recent publication entitled “The State of Canada's
					 Forests” Natural Resources Canada devotes a precious three sentences to the
					 pine beetle disaster out of 112 pages, and even then grossly underestimates the
					 magnitude of the problem.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today I again call on the federal Liberals to drop

	Mr. Speaker, I rise on a question of privilege to
					 charge the Minister of Transport with contempt. The minister has brought the
					 authority and dignity of the House into question and has breached the new
					 procedure that was established by the adoption of the first report of the
					 modernization committee. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Thursday, October 25, while the House was in
					 session, the minister held a press conference to announce a $75 million bailout
					 for Canada 3000. While this brand of disrespect is not uncommon for the Liberal
					 government, I believe that this is the first time that such an act has occurred
					 since the adoption of the first report of the modernization committee. At page
					 4 of that report the committee states:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>Concerns have been expressed that
						  government announcements, regarding legislation or policies, are increasingly
						  made outside the House of Commons. While this is by no means a recent
						  phenomenon, it continues to be a source of concern. The Committee is
						  recommending two initiatives to address it.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small> First, it is important that more
						  ministerial statements and announcements be made in the House of Commons. In
						  particular, topical developments, or foreseeable policy decisions, should be
						  made first—or, at least, concurrently—in the chamber. Ministers, and their
						  departments, need to be encouraged to make use of the forum provided by the
						  House of Commons. Not only will this enhance the pre-eminence of Parliament,
						  but it will also reiterate the legislative underpinning for governmental
						  decisions.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The committee recommended that the government make
					 greater use of ministerial statements in the Chamber and that the House leaders
					 be advised in advance of these statements.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was not advised of this announcement. When I stood in
					 the House on Thursday and asked the Thursday question, the government House
					 leader had the opportunity right there and then, but failed to do
					 so.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no reason why the Minister of Transport could
					 not have advised the opposition and there were no procedural difficulties
					 preventing the Minister of Transport from making his announcement in the House.
					 I am certain that all parties would have extended every courtesy to the
					 minister if he had chosen to respect the House and make his announcement
					 here.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to know that the House adjourned early
					 on that day for lack of business. It adjourned early last Monday and Friday and
					 it adjourned early on Friday, October 19, and on Monday, October 22, so wherein
					 lies the problem with debating these issues on the floor of the House? A $75
					 million bailout is no small change. Where does the minister think the authority
					 to spend the $75 million comes from?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government and its departments are continuously
					 making a habit of mocking the parliamentary system in this manner. We have had
					 the deliberate leaking to the media of contents of Bill C-15 and, more
					 recently, of the anti-terrorism bill, Bill C-36.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the reasons the modernization committee felt it
					 necessary to address the issue was that in the last two parliaments the
					 government got away with mocking the legislative process at every turn,
					 belittling the role of members of parliament. I will cite a few of the more
					 serious examples.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Thursday, October 23, 1997, the government announced
					 that provincial and federal governments had constituted a nominating committee
					 to nominate candidates for the new Canada pension plan investment board. The
					 nominating committee was provided for under subclause 10(2) of Bill C-2. The
					 House had not yet adopted Bill C-2.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On January 21, 1998, the minister responsible for the
					 wheat board met in Regina to discuss the rules for the election of directors to
					 the Canadian Wheat Board's board of directors, as proposed in Bill C-4, an act
					 to amend the Canadian Wheat Board Act. Substantial amendments to Bill C-4
					 tabled at report stage by opposition members were scheduled for debate in the
					 House. While the House debated how many directors should be farmer elected
					 versus being government appointees, the minister was holding meetings as though
					 the bill was already law.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Canadian millennium scholarship fund was being
					 established, a published article in the Toronto <i>Star</i> announced that Yves
					 Landry had been named as the head of the Canada Millennium Scholarship
					 Foundation. Mr. Landry was quoted as saying “I am only one member of the board
					 and my job is to be a facilitator”. There was no legislation before the House
					 setting up the foundation, nor had the budget announcement allocating $2.5
					 billion in revenue to the foundation been adopted.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for International Trade announced on March
					 30, 1998, the establishment of a Canada-China interparliamentary group. At that
					 time, the House had not set up a Canada-China interparliamentary
					 group.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the date of the last budget that was delivered
					 in the House, so long ago we have probably forgotten, was announced by the
					 Prime Minister outside the House.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each disrespectful act we allow to stand unchallenged
					 becomes a precedent that serves afterwards to justify more acts of disrespect.
					 The modernization committee recognized this and felt it necessary to make a
					 statement.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The adoption of this report outlined what standard the
					 House expected from ministers in this regard.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On page 119 of Erskine May there is a reference
					 regarding a select committee that was appointed to inquire into the conduct and
					 activities of members and to consider whether any such conduct or activities
					 amounted to a contempt of the House and whether any such activities
					 were:</p>

						  entitled to expect from its Members.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister cannot claim ignorance because the House
					 pronounced itself on this issue through the adoption of the modernization
					 committee report. When the Minister of Transport made his announcement outside
					 the House on Thursday, October 25 while there was still an opportunity to make
					 it inside, his conduct was clearly inconsistent with the standards the House
					 was entitled to expect from him. As a consequence the minister is in contempt
					 of the House.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other related parliamentary tradition that the
					 government likes to forget about is the issue of and respect for the doctrine
					 of ministerial responsibility.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of Transport and the rest of his
					 colleagues, and particularly the Minister of Justice, should review the
					 definition of ministerial responsibility from page 63 of the 22nd edition of
					 Erskine May. It states:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

<td width="30" align="right">
</td>
<td><small>—ministers have a duty to Parliament to account, and be held to

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where can we find the truthful and accurate information
					 regarding the decision to hand out $75 million to Canada 3000? Not in
					 <i>Hansard</i> of Thursday, October 25. Where it was found was in the <i>Globe
					 and Mail</i> of October 26.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am beginning to think that being held in contempt in
					 the House is of little concern to the government. Let us look at the example of
					 the Minister of Justice who was held in contempt for leaking to the media the
					 contents of Bill C-15.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I appeared before the Standing Committee on
					 Procedure and House Affairs to review another charge of contempt involving the
					 minister, I pointed out that we no longer respect, to the same degree as in the
					 past, the principle that ministers have a duty to parliament to account and to
					 be held to account for the policies, decisions and actions of their
					 departments.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cited the example from 1976 involving the Hon. André
					 Ouellet, the then minister of consumer and corporate affairs. Mr. Ouellet made
					 a comment on the acquittal by Mr. Justice Mackay of the sugar companies accused
					 of forming cartels and combines. As a result, Mr. Justice Mackay cited him for
					 contempt of court. He was found guilty of the charge and resigned his cabinet
					 post over the incident.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A charge of contempt by the House should be considered
					 just as serious, if not more serious, as a contempt charge in a court.
					 Unfortunately the Minister of Justice chose not to take responsibility in the
					 time honoured tradition of ministerial accountability, as did Mr.
					 Ouellet.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Getting back to this case, I will conclude my remarks
					 by saying that had I had an opportunity to respond to this announcement by the
					 Minister of Transport I might have asked the minister why he can justify giving
					 Canada 3000 $75 million but cannot spend one dime on the softwood lumber
					 industry that lost millions of dollars over a trade dispute with the United
					 States. Thousands of people are out of work as a result and thousands more are
					 expected to lose their jobs.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, what about the farmers who suffered through this
					 summer's drought?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are some of the questions we might have asked if
					 the minister had given us an opportunity, but we did not. The minister might
					 want to talk about timing, about how the House was not sitting. It was not
					 sitting because the government chose not to have it sitting. It adjourned
					 early. We have adjourned early too many days over the last little
					 while.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly I saw the minister on television that night
					 at 7 p.m. The House adjourned early,and I cannot remember if it was 3 p.m. or 4
					 p.m., but surely he must have made the decision earlier in the day. He could
					 have spoken to the government House leader and made sure it was put on the
					 agenda so that we could have done it in the House and it could have been done
					 properly.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, if you find that we have a case of
					 privilege, I am prepared to move the proper motion.</p>

					 Transport, Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I did have the opportunity on Friday to
					 discuss the matter with my colleague from the Alliance Party. I am grateful
					 that he raised it today because I could not state the reply on Friday. I will
					 describe the actions taken on Thursday and then deal with the substance of his
					 point.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, everyone knows that since September 11 issues
					 dealing with airlines are ones that are breaking fast. The problems are
					 occurring rather rapidly and therefore require rapid response. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. member talks about not being available to make
					 a ministerial statement at the appropriate time. I am sure he would have given
					 unanimous consent to revert to statements by ministers on Thursday afternoon
					 had he known. He questioned the integrity of my colleague the House leader for
					 not having informed him during the usual Thursday question that he knew this
					 was coming.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague the House leader did not know the
					 statement was being issued because the final decision on the matter was only
					 taken at 5.30 that day. We felt it was absolutely appropriate to call a press
					 conference at 7 o'clock. The news media was not happy. I was not happy and the
					 hon. member was not happy. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the earliest opportunity there was final cabinet
					 approval for the compensation package for Canada 3000. We called the press
					 conference so that shareholders, employees and passengers of Canada 3000 would
					 all know what the rules were before the opening of the stock market on the next
					 business day.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been in the House off and on for quite a while,
					 like the hon. member. We were here in the early 1970s when ministers made
					 routine statements and were questioned by the opposition. That is something I
					 have always been in favour of. It is certainly something I would never be
					 opposed to. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was a member of the procedural committee in 1982-83
					 that brought forward a lot of the reforms of today including the period of
					 questions and comments after debate. That was done to involve members in
					 debate. We do not want to hear only from members with set questions and set
					 answers. We want to encourage the thrust and parry of debate.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My hon. colleague laments the fact that he never had
					 the chance to have this debated on Thursday. He says he would have raised a
					 number of questions. He went on a few minutes ago to tell the House what the
					 questions were with respect to softwood lumber. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not raise the question on Friday morning. He did
					 not raise the question this afternoon in question period. He instead chose to
					 make a procedural point for partisan gain. I am very sorry about that. I have
					 great respect for the House leader of the Alliance Party and cannot believe he
					 is resorting to these kinds of tactics. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will use the example of the hon. André Ouellet. We
					 were both in the House when this happened in 1975 or 1976 regarding the sugar
					 case. It had nothing whatsoever to do with statements by ministers. The hon.
					 member should not impugn motives by raising that particularly serious case in
					 this context.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure the hon. member knows this full well. Far be
					 it from me to cast aspersions or impugn motives by saying he wants to use the
					 debate for a spurious question of privilege that is not a question of
					 privilege. It is a point of debate that he should have raised on Thursday or
					 Friday in question period or today in question period. He chose not to do so.
					 He was silent today in question period.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will quote from Beauchesne's fifth edition, section
					 264 which states:</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I have a brief comment on this point. I
					 commend not only the person who raised the question of privilege but also the
					 minister for coming here and defending himself, which is somewhat unusual.
					 Normally defending the indefensible is left to the government House
					 leader.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point is well taken and I hope it would be with the
					 Chair. Particularly seeing as we have had the report of the modernization
					 committee, every opportunity should be taken by the government to follow those
					 recommendations and use the House to make announcements. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I regret that the Minister of Transport is one of the
					 first to get caught up on this because I will vouch for the fact that he was a
					 member of the Lefebvre special committee on standing orders and procedure in
					 1982-83. I served with him on that House of Commons committee. I believe him
					 when he says he would like to see this kind of procedure used more often. I
					 would encourage him to do so and then we could use him as an example of how
					 other ministers ought to behave.</p>

				  </b>

	The Chair has heard the arguments advanced by all hon.
					 members on this point. The Chair has had occasion to rule previously on items
					 of this kind. The hon. member for Pictou--Antigonish--Guysborough has raised
					 these kinds of matters when ministers have made statements outside the House
					 that he wishes had been made in the House.</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that many members from both sides of the House
					 are always making the same suggestion to the Chair, that is to do something
					 about this situation which they think is terrible. </p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am somewhat constrained because, as the minister has
					 pointed out, there has been a string of decisions on this matter that it is not
					 for the Chair to intervene and not a breach of the privileges of the House for
					 ministers to make statements concerning government policy outside the House.
					 That position has been maintained for a very long time.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. House leader of the official opposition in his
					 very capable argument suggested that the report of the committee on
					 modernization recently adopted by the House had somehow changed that.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I recognize that there are words in the report
					 that would be of solace to any member making the argument he was advancing, I
					 question whether the report has changed the situation such that failure to make
					 a statement in the House has become a question of breach of privileges of the
					 House. This after all is a very grave matter and one which has to be treated
					 with the utmost seriousness.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recognize there is some frustration that the report
					 has perhaps not been followed in its spirit and intent. Hon. members in making
					 their question of privilege today have drawn that to the attention of the
					 government House leader who, I have no doubt, will probably be reading the
					 arguments over again for several nights running with great interest given his
					 concern to see that the modernization report is implemented. I believe he was a
					 member of the committee that helped come up with the recommendations so I know
					 his interest in it will be substantial.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find there is no question of privilege here but I
					 have one other matter that I want to draw the attention of hon. members while I
					 am on my feet. I would remind all hon. members that apart from the one hour
					 notice requirement for questions of privilege there are other rules governing
					 notice of intention to raise a question of privilege.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>House of Commons Procedure and Practice</i>, the

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that, in this motion, the member is referring
					 to a general international assistance policy and is asking us to reflect on the
					 current urgent situation, namely the drama taking place right now in
					 Afghanistan and Pakistan where millions of people are seeking refuge to escape
					 the Taliban regime or to escape air strikes by the Americans and the British.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everybody will agree the government has moved to
					 somewhat improve aid to these people. However, the announcement of a further
					 $16 million to help close to 5 million people in Afghanistan as winter is fast
					 approaching—a prospect we all dread—is far from enough. For the time being we
					 can only hope that very soon the government will face up to its responsibility
					 and commit further money to deal with the emergency situation in
					 Afghanistan.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to point out that although the situation
					 in Afghanistan is the most highly publicized these days, it is far from being
					 the only emergency situation across the world. For the past three years,
					 Central America has been experiencing a severe drought and thousands, if not
					 hundreds of thousands of people, especially children, are at risk. Over the
					 next few weeks casualties could be in the hundreds of thousands. The Canadian
					 government should be able to intervene there too. As we know, some areas in
					 Africa are also experiencing emergency situations. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We focused on Afghanistan because the situation there
					 is well known to Canadians and Quebecers, but I believe that what we are after
					 is an overall policy. We must get back to acceptable levels of aid in keeping
					 with Canada's status within the international community. As the foreign affairs
					 minister said “when you are a member of the G-8, you cannot excuse yourself
					 when it is time to pay the bill”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same can be said of our military commitment, and
					 our commitment to humanitarian and international aid. Our wealth allows us to
					 do a lot more than what we are doing currently and also to intervene for the
					 long term.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly, we must respond to emergency situations.
					 However, it must be recognized that it is only through structural changes that
					 we will be able to change the current rules, a system that breeds poverty,
					 disparities not only between countries, between areas in the world, but also
					 within our own societies.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an old Chinese proverb that I like to quote,
					 which states “If you give a man a fish, he will have a single meal. If you
					 teach him how to fish, he will eat all his life”. Our approach to this
					 situation should be along those lines. We need to have an international aid
					 program that allows all developing countries, particularly those that have more
					 problems dealing with the new economic realities of the world, to set up
					 measures and programs, especially the needed training programs to pull
					 themselves out of their predicament, out of poverty. There must be forms of aid
					 that strengthen communities and provide them with the means to
					 develop.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to this, Canada is not fulfilling its
					 responsibilities, as I mentioned at the beginning of my speech. When you think
					 about a goal of 0.7%—a goalset by a former Prime Minister of Canada, Lester B.
					 Pearson, incidentally—we are nowhere near reaching this goal proposed by the
					 United Nations.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, our international aid is at its lowest level
					 in 30 years. We are at a mere 0.25% of our GDP, which places us 17th out of the
					 22 countries of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, or
					 the OECD. In 1999, we ranked 12th. Only one year later, we fell five places. In
					 1995, we ranked 6th. Canada's position within the international community when
					 it comes to international aid has dropped noticeably and
					 consistently.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada does not compare well to countries that are much
					 smaller than us, but that are similar in economic terms: Denmark gives 1.06% of
					 its GDP, thereby exceeding the United Nations' requirements; the Netherlands
					 are at 0.82%; Sweden, 0.81%; Norway, 0.8%; and Luxembourg, 0.7%.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How is it that Canada, which prides itself on being a
					 generous country and on being a good influence for peace in the world, is not
					 included in this list of countries? As far as I can tell, it is a case of
					 saying one thing, but doing another.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These efforts are extremely important. I am making my
					 comments in the context of globalization and economic integration. From a
					 political perspective, we should all agree that we must eradicate poverty in
					 our societies, but also around the world, because poverty, inequalities and
					 injustices are a fertile ground for terrorism. This is not to say that it is
					 the only cause. As we know, there is far right terrorism in the United States,
					 but it is clear that inequalities and injustices are the conditions that
					 generate despair and actions such as the ones we witnessed on September
					 11.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are to fight terrorism effectively and
					 intelligently, we do need a targeted military response but, above all, we need
					 an action plan by the international community for economic and social
					 development, and to fight poverty. Canada should be a leader in the development
					 of such a plan, but this is not the case right now. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I mentioned earlier, globalization and economic
					 integration generate inequalities. It is true that free trade and the opening
					 up of markets generate wealth, as we have seen over the past 30 or 40
					 years.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the early seventies, world wealth and income have
					 tripled. We do support the opening up of markets and the rules that were set,
					 particularly through GATT, now the WTO, because they have generated wealth. The
					 world has never been richer than it is now. But the redistribution of this
					 wealth is more uneven than it was 20 or 30 years ago. It is not due to an
					 economical or physical factor. It is wrong to say that poverty is caused by
					 rarity. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just provided an example. When world wealth triples,
					 we should not look for rarity to explain the growing inequalities between
					 countries, between regions and even within our societies. Rather, we should
					 look for social or political phenomena. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the early eighties, since the Reagan era, there
					 has been a lack of will to set up plans to fight poverty, both in our societies
					 and at the international level. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do need free trade to generate wealth, but we also
					 need measures to redistribute this wealth, so that it can provide levers to all
					 the countries in the world for their economic and social development, and this
					 is possible.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will use Europe as an example. Even though most
					 European countries are developed countries, they do not all have the same level
					 of development, and in particular, they did not have it in the past. We need
					 only think about Portugal, Spain or Greece 30 years ago, or even Ireland 10 or
					 15 years ago. These countries were clearly lagging behind the average European
					 countries.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the context of political construction, European
					 construction, Europeans set up regional and structural development funds that
					 are now producing results. </p>


	<A NAME="T1530"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1530"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1535"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1525"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1530)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we visit Portugal, Spain, Greece or Ireland, we
					 realize that we are really in developed societies, which was not necessarily
					 the case about 30 years ago. Thus, it is possible, if there is a political
					 will, to eradicate poverty. Clearly, this will not happen overnight, but
					 considering what was done in the past, which was giving up, it seems to me that
					 this is not the right attitude and that we must instead move
					 forward.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I take this opportunity to disagree with the image of
					 the proverbial pie often used for domestic poverty problems as well as
					 international poverty problems. People say “Before we can redistributing the
					 pie, there has to be one in the first place”. We will make the pie as big as
					 possible with free trade and we will then redistribute it among all the
					 partners. If we really want to make the pie as big as possible, we must at the
					 same time redistribute the wealth. Everybody has to be able to get his or her
					 share of the pie. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This two-stage image of the pie being created and then
					 served up is a false one. This is not the economic reality of things. The
					 economic reality is that we are part of a system where, to produce, one must be
					 able to sell. Taken on a national or global scale, this means that it is in our
					 interest, the interest of developed economies, that there be purchasing power
					 in southern hemisphere countries and that it be as widespread as possible. That
					 is the logic of co-operation, which should accompany the current logic of
					 globalization.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have already explained, there are no physical
					 barriers to this. This poverty is not an inevitability of nature. It is truly
					 the product of social and political phenomena.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this context, I therefore think it extremely
					 important that we rectify this state of affairs, that we once again have an aid
					 program worthy of the name and that it have the necessary funding for these
					 countries--I mentioned this earlier--because this is a well understood logic of
					 what is known as globalization, but also for us right now. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remind the House that 36,000 Canadian jobs depend on
					 development aid. Of every dollar spent on aid, over 70 cents comes back to
					 Canada. So, basically, when $1 billion is spent, $70 million comes back to
					 Canada. In Canada, there are 50 universities and 60 colleges, including the
					 college in Lanaudière, which benefit from aid program related contracts. Two
					 thousand Canadian companies benefiting from aid related contracts are gaining
					 prominence in certain markets and making enviable inroads
					 internationally.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion we are moving therefore responds in a timely
					 manner to a need which is critical and shared, I think, by all Canadians and
					 Quebecers. In the medium and long term, it is the only logical approach if we
					 are to avoid situations such as those we have witnessed in the last decade or
					 so, from the slaughter in Rwanda to the events of September 11, or what went on
					 in the former Soviet Bloc countries. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, this international aid program should be
					 part of a comprehensive set of measures to rectify the situation. Earlier, the
					 member for Lac-Saint-Jean--Saguenay reminded the House of what the Tobin tax
					 could do to civilize speculative transactions and create international
					 development funds, and to bring about respect for fundamental
					 rights.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have initiated this debate in the House and we will
					 keep it alive in the context of the Costa Rica free trade agreement. The
					 Canadian government made no move to take the social, democratic and
					 environmental dimensions into consideration in the bilateral trade agreements
					 it signed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say again that Canadians and Quebecers would never
					 have accepted to sign a free trade agreement with Pinochet's Chile. We now have
					 a trade agreement with Chile; we should also have included clauses concerning
					 fundamental rights such as human, labour and environmental rights.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also believe that measures could be taken immediately
					 to show that Canada is going in another direction. For example trade sanctions
					 on Iraq could be eliminated for things that have nothing to do with military
					 equipment or that cannot be used for a military build-up. As we know, over the
					 last 10 years thousands of children died in Iraq because of those sanctions and
					 Saddam Hussein is still in power.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More globally, I am calling for the restructuring of
					 international institutions and the means at their disposition. It is obvious
					 that the challenge we are facing is similar to the one that existed during the
					 great depression of the thirties.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Roosevelt launched his new deal, maintaining free
					 enterprise while creating a series of institutions favouring a more
					 equalitarian and national redistribution of wealth, recognizing among other
					 things union rights, that lead to the situation we now know. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With globalization and the integration of economies, we
					 have to recreate this new deal but this time on an international
					 basis.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the debate, the issues raised by the motion
					 that our colleague from Lac-Saint-Jean—Saguenay tabled in the House. If hon.
					 members agree with me on the importance of the challenges we face, they should
					 at least adopt this motion unanimously.</p>

					 (Kamouraska--Rivière-du-Loup--Témiscouata--Les Basques, BQ):
				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the hon. member for
					 Joliette on his speech. I found it very well presented, particularly his
					 comparison between the programs developed to cope with the depression in the
					 thirties and the situation we are experiencing today. I believe this is an
					 interesting comparison.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last week I took part in a discussion with some one
					 hundred students at the Cégep de la Pocatière. With me were church
					 representatives, a sociologist and a teacher, an Arab originally from Morocco.
					 The students were particularly interested in two things.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They asked many questions about the effectiveness of
					 the strikes but also had many queries about short and long term international
					 aid. They asked whether we were indeed playing our part correctly. I think the
					 Bloc Quebecois motion of today responds to this in part.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask my colleague from Joliette whether
					 what we have been seeing in terms of international aid since 1993-94 is not the
					 application of the very same principle the Liberal government has applied
					 within Canada?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were many cuts to be made and they were made in
					 the sectors where people are perhaps the least organized, the least capable of
					 defending themselves, the least anxious to assert themselves, for instance the
					 unemployed, who do not necessarily have big organizations to defend
					 them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as international aid is concerned, hon. members
					 will recall that funding was cut to COSI, a Quebec agency consolidating all
					 NGOs involved in international co-operation. Its funding was cut so much that
					 it was less able to assume its mandate of organization and thus the public felt
					 less inclined to invest.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it not in fact this principle that has led us to the
					 conclusion that Canada is absolutely not pulling its weight as far as
					 international aid is concerned? Unfortunately, other countries are doing the
					 same, which is what has led to the terrorism we have unfortunately experienced,
					 particularly on September 11.</p>

				  </b>

	I thank the member for his question, which I find
					 extremely relevant. What he is referring to is in fact a real danger.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do think that the Liberal government, and, I must
					 say, the previous Progressive Conservative government, have both attacked
					 social programs, which meet the needs of the most disadvantaged, the less
					 organized people in our society. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is rather surprising to see that, when governments
					 want to restore fiscal health, an objective we agree with, it is always easier
					 to cut employment insurance than it is to cut other programs. However, when the
					 money is there, the Minister of Finance suddenly announces that he now has some
					 fiscal flexibility and that he will put all the funds into the military and
					 security when, in theory at least because that is what they told us, we never
					 had the means to help the unemployed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the situation is the same on the international
					 level.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nowadays, some regions of the world are totally
					 disorganized and are unable to have an impact at the international level. Just
					 think of Africa. Even private investors have lost interest in a good portion of
					 Africa. It is not a question of exploitation. Those regions do not even have
					 the privilege—I am being ironic here—of being exploited by multinationals
					 anymore. The multinationals ignore them and the international community ignores
					 them. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is something dangerous in the current policies.
					 Very sincerely, I wonder if we are not actually developing, through bilateral
					 free trade agreement programs with South American countries, for example, trade
					 agreements with countries that show some potential for us and letting other
					 countries down.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is in that sense that I feel the negotiation of a
					 free trade area of the Americas, well understood, multilateral and with a
					 concern for rights, is a much more interesting way to go than bilateral
					 agreements.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we could find at the end of the day is that Canada
					 has bilateral agreements with a number of economically promising countries,
					 like Costa Rica, but has let down other countries that seemed to be too hard
					 hit to be worth salvaging. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does Bolivia, for example, show some potential for
					 Canada? I think that on a short term, the answer is no. Under a multilateraI
					 agreement, Bolivia would be included.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What concerns me now is that parts of the world are
					 left out and are no longer of economic interest for the great powers,
					 particularly the United States. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that context, I feel we should give a very clear
					 indication that, as Canadians and as Quebecers, we are concerned about the
					 whole world and that we will commit resources at the level expected of us. The
					 0.7% of Canadian GDP is what we are being asked to contribute in international
					 aid, and we will be able to reach that level within a few years. </p>

	Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the motion de Bloc Quebecois
					 has presented today. During this last month, we have had numerous debates on
					 security, the economy and immigration.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we did not discuss international aid much. So,
					 it is very important that we have this debate today. </p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have always believed we must be a nation that
					 measures our strength by the mouths we feed and the environment we protect. I
					 have always believed that has been the value system of our country. It has been
					 the value system of Prime Minister Pearson, Prime Minister Trudeau, Prime
					 Minister Turner, the right hon. member for Calgary Centre and the present Prime
					 Minister. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also excited today because the Parliamentary
					 Secretary for the Minister for International Cooperation, who is here in the
					 House, has stated that the government will be supporting the motion. This is
					 more than a signal. It is a commitment to act immediately and deal not only
					 with reviewing our international aid policy programs but to immediately inject
					 some serious resources into the department if we are going to continue being a
					 nation that measures our strength by the mouths we feed and the environment we
					 protect.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On September 18, I believe it was, at the Canadian Club
					 in Toronto, the United States ambassador to Canada gave his first public
					 address after September 11. He opened his remarks by saying that on September
					 11 and 12 the United States had to reach out to leaders of many countries
					 around the world in order to put together a coalition to deal with the
					 terrorist actions that took place in the United States. He said that the United
					 States did not have to reach out to Canada because the Prime Minister called
					 him directly within minutes of the planes crashing into the World Trade Center.
					 He said that the Prime Minister told him “We will be with you. Whatever you
					 need we're there”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was sort of amazed because I never saw that statement
					 of the ambassador of the United States reported in any of the print media.
					 Obviously I saw that speech on television. I was amazed because I had seen so
					 much media coverage saying that the government did not really get into the play
					 right away, that it really did not step up to the plate and support our
					 neighbours to the south yet here was the United States ambassador saying that
					 the U.S. did not call Canada, that the Prime Minister called him within
					 minutes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From there the government went on to deal with many
					 different issues, such as national defence, immigration, RCMP, CSIS, et cetera.
					 While that was going on, an article appeared in the <i>Globe and Mail</i> about
					 three weeks ago by Margaret Wente. She said that the security files, the border
					 issues and the immigration problems were being dealt with but that we had
					 better start dealing with the human deficit. She said that we had better start
					 dealing in parallel with what must be done to deal with the human suffering
					 going on in Afghanistan.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today we have a motion from the Bloc that deals
					 specifically with that and I celebrate it. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is difficult for us who live with a very special
					 standard of living in Canada and an almost cocoon-like existence in Ottawa to
					 feel or imagine the pain of what is going on right now in Pakistan and
					 Afghanistan. I have to believe that anyone who watched television last night
					 and saw the children who were bombed inadvertently and the children out in the
					 Afghanistan desert waiting for yellow bags to drop out of the clouds so they
					 would have something to eat, would have to ask what we are doing as a
					 nation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I realize that within hours $500 million, which was
					 development money to Pakistan, was forgiven. I realize that we have given
					 approximately $160 million additional dollars to Afghanistan through various
					 agencies, such as the United Nations, the Red Cross and other agencies working
					 there, but I know every member in the House believes we must do more and we
					 must do it immediately.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are a nation that has been blessed with incredible
					 amounts of resources in terms of food supplies. If there were ever a time for
					 the great asset of agriculture and the food supply we have in Canada to be put
					 into action and provide international aid, it was at this moment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appeal to my colleagues and officials that in the
					 next few days we think outside the box. Let us figure out a way to take
					 advantage of that strength. Let us work on making sure that Canada's history of
					 being there and of reaching out to people in need continues. Let us use food
					 and water as our instruments of peace, especially for the young
					 people.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is something else we can do. Last week a number
					 of us had an opportunity to be present at a meeting that took place on the
					 Senate side of this parliament. It was a meeting hosted by one of our senators
					 for an organization called Olympic Aid. This organization was set up back in
					 1994 when Olympic Aid lent support to the war victims in the former olympic
					 city of Sarajevo. Olympic Aid has gone on subsequently and worked in many
					 different wartorn countries.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guest speaker was the chairman of Olympic Aid,
					 Johann Koss, a former gold medal olympic athlete himself, who donated his prize
					 money from his olympic experience and challenged Norway and other countries.
					 They have raised millions of dollars. For those who were not present at the
					 meeting, coaches from all over the world go into wartorn countries, work with
					 young kids and teach them how to play because they believe that every child has
					 the right to play. While these young children are being distracted by war and
					 every other difficulty, Olympic Aid coaches take a holistic approach through
					 sport.</p>


	<A NAME="T1555"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1555"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1600"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1550"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1555)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coaches teach them lifestyle. They talk to the
					 children about peace and working with each other. I would ask the Parliamentary
					 Secretary to the Minister for International Cooperation to please appeal to the
					 minister that we as a nation get behind Olympic Aid. There is no one in the
					 House who would not support a child's right to play.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where better to have Canada's presence, through sport
					 and through coaches teaching and bringing hope to young people, than in a
					 wartorn country like Afghanistan? So often we do not think of that type of
					 action being really important but the record will show that from Sarajevo on,
					 wherever Olympic Aid went and worked with young children in wartorn zones the
					 reactions and the hopes of those young people has created a lasting impact.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that as a country we can make a very special
					 contribution in that area, on top of our food and water and on top of all the
					 other infrastructure and support systems that CIDA brings to Afghanistan and
					 Pakistan. </p>

	Mr. Speaker, I listened with great interest to my
					 colleague's speech, and I would like to ask him the following
					 question.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the weekend, I read that, according to the UN's
					 estimates, close to 7.5 million people will need humanitarian aid in
					 Afghanistan. The United States decided to give $320 million, Europe, a little
					 more than 300 million euros, and Canada announced that it would contribute $16
					 million, when we have billions of dollars in surpluses.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I think about the employment insurance fund, which
					 the government appropriated and which amounts to more than $30 billion, I would
					 like to ask my colleague how he can imagine all that. This is all very well, he
					 made a very positive speech, and I thank him for it, but is he ready to make a
					 commitment in the House that will force the government, in this budget or the
					 next, to invest 0.7% of GDP, which is the level needed? That is the meaning of
					 the proposal. Is he ready to spend that money in a reasonable period of time so
					 that we can know how much time it will take for us to reach the minimum that is
					 supposed to go to international aid?</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I do not know today what the exact number

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am absolutely confident that when the budget comes in
					 December, which is too long for me as I feel we should move on this file
					 immediately, there will be resources there for international
					 co-operation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada cannot become a nation that measures its

	Mr. Speaker, it is good to hear such comments but, as I
					 said earlier, we need more than words on the part of the government, we need
					 action.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allow me to read the text of the motion once again so

					 and vital:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>That this House calls upon the
						  Parliament to review its international aid policy with a view to substantially
						  increasing the funds available to Canadian humanitarian aid, particularly in
						  the context of the military interventions in Afghanistan, and to increasing the
						  level of its aid for development to 0.7 % of GDP, as recommenced by the United
						  Nations. </small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also wish to quote paragraph 1 of the Vienna
					 declaration and program of action on the occasion of the World Conference on
					 Human Rights of 1993:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>Human rights and fundamental freedoms
						  are the birthright of all human beings; their promotion and protection are the
						  first responsibility of Governments.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been several years since the protection and
					 promotion of fundamental needs of human beings were reaffirmed as the
					 responsibility of governments but unfortunately the government has done very
					 little in this regard. This is unacceptable.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea of allocating 0.7% of GDP to international aid
					 was first raised in 1969. However, this principle was adopted by the General
					 Assembly of the United Nations only in 1990. At that time, Canada voted in
					 favour of this principle. Since then, our country's contribution, far from
					 reaching this objective, has been reduced, from 0.48% in 1990 to 0.25% today.
					 This is totally unacceptable. It is therefore easy to conclude that there is a
					 wide gap between the government's intentions and its actions. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is all the more shocking when we remember that the
					 Prime Minister himself said in this House, on April 30, 2001, that our aid to
					 developing countries would continue to rise. What actually did happen? The
					 opposite, as we have just seen. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister also said that Canada as a country
					 is among the best positioned to make rich countries aware of the needs of
					 poorer countries. When will Canada itself become more aware?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a real concern in the country about the
					 situation of refugees. The situation of the Afghan refugees is really tragic
					 and something has to be done immediately. Military support is not enough in the
					 current context. We have to ensure that innocent people are not paying for what
					 their government has been doing, particularly because of the events that unite
					 us in this fight against terrorism. This is in essence what Kofi Annan said in
					 his September 27 press conference at the UN headquarters. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The United Nations takes the issue very seriously and
					 we should do the same. We have a responsibility to help the UN, as we promised
					 to do more than 10 years ago. We have to keep our engagement to offer
					 humanitarian aid of 0.7% of GDP. What more evidence do we need?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The United Nations should lead the diplomatic,
					 political and, above all, humanitarian actions since it is in a better position
					 to evaluate the consequences of this crisis and not only the military actions.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what is this crisis all about? There is a
					 continuous influx of Afghan refugees in the neighbouring countries, in the wake
					 of the military strikes. Over 2,000 Afghan refugees gathered at the Iranian
					 border in the last couple of days, for a total of 4,000 refugees in this camp
					 alone. The United Nations high commission for refugees is concerned for their
					 security.</p>


	<A NAME="T1605"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1605"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1610"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1600"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1605)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The high commission also fears that the Taliban will
					 recruit within refugee camps. There are also grounds to believe that over
					 300,000 refugees are massing at the Pakistan border to escape the bombings,
					 adding to the numbers already there.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is worthy of note that, even before the military
					 strikes, the Afghans were the largest refugee group in the world, surpassing by
					 far those from Iraq, Burundi or Sierra Leone. The Afghan people are therefore
					 in urgent need of our assistance, because the situation is only getting
					 worse.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are we to do? This is what the Bloc Quebecois is
					 proposing. In the absence of any clear federal policy on bilateral development
					 assistance provided directly to foreign governments, it would be appropriate to
					 put in place a specific plan aimed at attaining the objective of 0.7% of GDP,
					 the target set by the UN.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, such a bilateral policy would ensure that funds
					 are not misappropriated by regimes in which corruption is systematic.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, in the short term, we propose the injection of
					 an additional $3 billion into international humanitarian aid. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, it is urgent to provide a positive response to
					 the request for monetary aid from United Nations secretary general Kofi Annan,
					 for $US 585 million to deal with the Afghan crisis. It is unacceptable that
					 Canada has so far contributed only $16 million for all humanitarian
					 organizations. Let us keep in mind that this is the $16 million that had
					 already been announced, not an additional $16 million. It is still the same
					 amount. This is totally unacceptable.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifth, in the long term, the Bloc Quebecois believes
					 that the root causes of the scourge of terrorism must be eliminated: poverty,
					 despair and war. These are the real issues behind any conflict that leaves
					 countless innocent victims in its wake. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sixth, we must review our military objectives because
					 destroying the organization of Osama bin Laden will merely eliminate the threat
					 it represents. It will not eliminate terrorism, which will exist for as long as
					 abject poverty continues to exist.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seventh, the Bloc Quebecois is of the opinion that the
					 federal government must review its foreign policy, which emphasizes the
					 commercial aspect of international relations. One must realize that human
					 rights also need to be taken into consideration.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Quebecois demands that the federal government
					 attain the 0.7% of GDP objective, as recommended by the Association québécoise
					 des organismes de coopération internationale, the Canadian Council for
					 International Cooperation and the North-South Institute. These are all
					 organizations which can see the results of this crisis and bear witness to it.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I mentioned at the beginning of my speech,
					 governments are mainly responsible for protecting the rights and freedoms of
					 any human being. Canada, which boasts about being a rich and privileged country
					 always willing to help poorer countries, has a duty and an obligation to take
					 concrete financial measures in this regard. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Quebecois proposes concrete and feasible
					 solutions. Now it is up to the federal government to take action to honour the
					 commitment it made 10 years ago to Quebecers, to Canadians and above all to
					 Afghan refugees. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long ago, during the debate on Bill C-36, I said
					 that I hoped the funds allocated for the fight against terrorism would not be
					 used only for sanctions but also to fight poverty, which would help solve the
					 terrorism problem. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today we have an opportunity to pursue this discussion
					 and to see to it that our words are supported by concrete actions. Bombs are
					 not enough to curb terrorism. We also need to provide support to the innocent
					 population and to take concrete steps within the country. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Quebecois proposes short and long term
					 solutions. Let us not kid ourselves, terrorism will continue to have a hold on
					 disadvantaged nations as long as the root causes of this scourge exist and
					 these nations remain without a voice to express their feeling of helplessness.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is incumbent upon us to give them the tools they
					 need to advance toward democracy, and that is what the Bloc Quebecois is
					 proposing. </p>

	Mr. Speaker, I would like to add a comment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course everybody is in favour of mother and apple
					 pie. Today we are talking about Afghanistan but there are more than 40 million
					 refugees on the planet, of which 2 or 3 million were Afghans. Those 40 million
					 refugees represent more than the population of Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As other countries do, the Canadian government sets
					 aside part of its budget for humanitarian aid and assistance to developing
					 countries. I wonder if we are not trying to outdo the others when we say That
					 country gives that much, so Canada should give this much and that other country
					 gives that much more, so Canada should give this much more. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should we not seek a global solution? Should it not be
					 everyone's responsibility to participate in humanitarian aid and not only a
					 Canadian responsibility? The Americans are giving but are they doing so because
					 of the war to improve their image? Maybe we should discuss that. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder if our way of helping developing countries is
					 appropriate. Maybe we should be contemplating another type of formula.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the figures, there are more than 500
					 million wealthy individuals on earth but 5 billion people are living below the
					 poverty line. Wealth is being created but not shared. Instead of always asking
					 countries to contribute according to their GDP, what other solution could we
					 come up with? </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asking countries to do their share is still appropriate
					 but maybe we should consider another way of going about it. </p>

					 BQ): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I am happy to add my voice to those of my
					 colleagues calling upon the government to review its international aid policy
					 with a view to substantially increasing the funds available for Canadian
					 humanitarian aid, particularly in the context of the military interventions in
					 Afghanistan, and to increasing the level of its aid for development to 0.7% of
					 GDP, as recommended by the United Nations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are at least two reasons for increasing the
					 assistance to developing countries. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first one is essentially ethical in nature. Canada
					 is a rich country enjoying a certain measure of comfort and economic security
					 which make developing countries envious. We in the western world are considered
					 as privileged, rich people. The tragic events of September 11 have severely
					 affected our economy and are forcing us to review our forecasts. But that is
					 nothing compared to the situation that poor countries are faced
					 with.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does that mean that Canada must review the part of its
					 budget concerning international assistance in order to increase it? Most
					 agencies working in this area agree with us that Canada must do so.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in the Bloc Quebecois believe that Canada has not
					 lived up to its humanitarian responsibilities. It appears this government is
					 not responding adequately to expressed needs.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proportionally Canada ranks 18 out of 22 donor
					 countries for international aid. We are among the least generous countries in
					 the world. That was enough for the head of Rights and Democracy, Mr. Allmand,
					 to urge the Canadian government to increase its foreign aid budget.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us take a closer look. Recently the United Nations
					 asked for $900 million Canadian to help some 7 million Afghans whose survival
					 depends on international aid. So far just over 11% has been collected. Since
					 September 11, Canada's share has reached $16 million. We must do
					 more.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last decade, Canada has contributed $150
					 million in aid to Afghan refugees and Afghanistan. In view of the prosperity
					 Canada has known over the past eight years, this is not enough, not to mention
					 unacceptable.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, other countries are showing us the
					 way. In 1995, Canada ranked sixth in terms of international aid. However, last
					 year the British government increased its aid by 35%. This increase was 22% in
					 Belgium and Sweden, and 10% in the Netherlands. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to media reports, even if our 2001-02
					 humanitarian aid budget were increased by $45 million over last year to $2.6
					 billion, we would still be investing 20% less than 10 years ago when the
					 Liberals came to power. This is unacceptable.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our participation has greatly deteriorated. We are
					 lagging far behind, especially in view of the many years of prosperity we have
					 experienced. The government might want to argue that since 1990 its efforts
					 have been hampered by the need to make substantial budget cuts. However the
					 Prime Minister himself acknowledged that Canada should do better in the future,
					 but nothing concrete has been announced yet in this regard.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course the Minister for International Cooperation is
					 reviewing Canada's processes with a view to providing more effective
					 international assistance. But that does not change the facts. The government is
					 miles away from the target set by the UN, which is a contribution of 0.7% of

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning the events of September 11, Canada wishes to
					 maintain its influence in the international arena. The Minister of External
					 Affairs himself came to this conclusion. So, what is the government waiting
					 for?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This minister admitted that Canada has a good
					 reputation but that it cannot live up to its reputation. We all know that.
					 Within the context of any realistic foreign policy, it is crucial to look at
					 the gap that is growing between rich and poor in the world.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us not forget the facts: in 1993, the Liberals
					 promised to contribute no less that 0.7% of Canada's GDP to international
					 assistance. Seven years later, this same Liberal government is devoting only
					 one-quarter of one per cent of the GDP to international assistance. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The need to increase this assistance is very real and
					 urgent. In a few weeks, Ottawa will host an important meeting of the World Bank
					 and the International Monetary Fund. The events of September 11 and their
					 impact, particularly on the poor, will be at the heart of the discussions. The
					 reduction of the debt of disadvantaged countries will surely be a focus of
					 attention.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is high time that the government re-evaluated the
					 situation. It has enough flexibility to increase its aid program. We have the
					 necessary resources, since the surplus forecast for the end of the year is over
					 $10 billion. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But most of all, we have to increase international aid
					 because many people are condemning the growing gap between the rich and the
					 poor. We have to send a clear message. When we talk about fighting poverty, we
					 can walk the talk. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to act right now. Afghan women and
					 children have been suffering the horrors of war for much too long and the
					 bombing their country has faced since the beginning of the allied retaliation
					 is putting them into a very difficult situation. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allow me to come back for a moment to the reform of the
					 Canadian International Development Agency. The planned reform is well accepted
					 by the non- governmental organizations specializing in international
					 co-operation but there are still some reservations. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Council for International Cooperation,
					 which represents more than a 100 non-governmental organizations, does not
					 support the action recommended by CIDA, which would rather fully subscribe to
					 the World Bank global approach. In fact, the council is concerned that this
					 could lead to a reduction in the level of aid given to the most disadvantaged
					 populations, thus diminishing the importance of Canada as a donor. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadian international co-operation organizations have
					 expressed some reservations and are concerned about some major issues in the
					 proposed reform:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>CIDA would redefine its mission to
						  include Canada's strategic interests...by extrapolating trade
						  interests.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;History tends to show that trade interests and human
					 rights do not go together well.</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>Furthermore, the marginalization of
						  civil society organizations, which have largely contributed to democratic
						  development and the solidarity—</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These organizations would simply implement policies set
					 by governments.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund see
					 the integration of poor countries into the market system as the remedy for the
					 planet's ills. By contrast, many stakeholders in international solidarity do
					 not share this vision. The Women's Network, among others, claims that the World
					 Bank and the International Monetary Fund are responsible for the continuing
					 poverty and its increase in the world.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In closing, the effect of increasing poverty is that
					 the production of wealth is up against its opposite, the factors of
					 destruction. Among these factors is terrorism driven by revolutionary ambitions
					 of changing the system. What can we do? Fight at all costs the profitability of
					 terrorism, which would have the effect of relegating world security and peace
					 to a position of secondary importance.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should Canada not re-evaluate its way of doing things
					 in matters of foreign policy?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly, the world has changed. Canada is not the only
					 country that must change its foreign policy. The cold war has just ended. From
					 now on, the only thing that matters is trade. The agreements signed in China
					 are an example of this. We only take care of the trade aspect, without going
					 beyond it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps we should also talk of the human rights before
					 making the decision to trade with another country. We could re-evaluate our
					 approach and consider another foreign policy instead of insisting on signing a
					 trade agreement and forgetting everything else. If we can make money with a
					 country, we go ahead and trade with it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should we not consider something else? I give human
					 rights as an example because there could be something other than trade. I would
					 like to hear what my colleague has to say about this.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his comment and for

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with him completely that it is vital that
					 foreign policy be reviewed and that there must be a greater focus on human
					 rights. Everything would seem to be inter dependant.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We see this in CIDA's new reform. With all due respect
					 for the minister, who is making a great effort, CIDA's policy must not be
					 strictly trade oriented. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This opening across borders must not be allowed to fall
					 into the hands of the large multinationals, which is what seems to be happening
					 right now. We see this in the G-7 countries. In addition, there are
					 non-government bodies infiltrating the policies of these countries. These are
					 huge multinationals, which are taking over and having a very destructive effect
					 on all the people of the world.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some direction is vital. We must pay more attention to
					 the gap between the rich and the poor and not neglect developing countries,
					 which can be used by the large multinationals in trading activities which
					 ignore human rights.</p>

					 themselves. This is an example that everyone knows.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we have to admit that the bottom line is that
					 the international humanitarian aid effort by a number of countries has not
					 amounted to much. This does not go back five or ten years, but a hundred years.

	Mr. Speaker, I would like to inform you that I will be
					 sharing my time with the member for 
					 Ottawa--Orléans.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best guarantee of a good quality of life is
					 democracy, as the ravages of current wars demonstrate. What Afghanistan needs,
					 more than short term humanitarian assistance, is a government that will respect
					 human rights and treat women as equals, so that children will grow up happy and
					 healthy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is easy for our friends opposite to ask for, and
					 expect, the moon. They know they will never form a majority. The Bloc is asking
					 for a substantial increase in the funds allocated for Canada's humanitarian
					 assistance, particularly in the context of the military intervention in
					 Afghanistan.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Governing is about planning. I believe Canada has an
					 excellent track record in the world. Our country provides assistance through
					 CIDA, the Canadian International Development Agency. This organization is very
					 active and generous with its aid because it is what must be done in terms of
					 ethics, justice and human solidarity.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CIDA's approach is careful, which is good. CIDA's
					 mandate is to support developing countries in reducing poverty and contribute
					 to a safer world, one that is fairer and more prosperous.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we know, this mandate was the result of broad
					 consultations in 1995. In 1996, CIDA approved a policy on the reduction of
					 poverty aimed at encouraging countries to work on their self-determination
					 rather than dependency.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question today is this: should we link our foreign
					 aid to our country's long term interests while acknowledging that extreme
					 poverty must be eliminated?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For some years now there has been debate on the
					 question of whether CIDA should concentrate on a limited number of countries.
					 We are all aware of foreign policy pressures and pressure from the opposition
					 for us to distribute our resources widely. The discussion is open. What
					 countries take priority? Today we are told it is Afghanistan.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we as a government must ask ourselves this and
					 seek to find an answer, saying that what must be done is to target our
					 international aid so that it will be more efficient and effective.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not an easy answer to come up with. In the case
					 of Afghanistan, CIDA has provided $150 million over the past 10 years to help
					 lessen the suffering of refugees and internally displaced persons . These
					 people have been hard hit by 20 years of conflict and 3 years of drought, which
					 have devastated their country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a Canadian, I find it extremely painful to see the
					 extent to which the people of that country are downtrodden and
					 destitute.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It took the events of September 11 and the destruction
					 of the twin WTC towers to focus world attention on Afghanistan. Why is that?
					 Because terrorists can hide out there, with the complicity of the reigning
					 Taliban regime.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we have discovered in Afghanistan since the
					 cameras of the entire world have been focussed on it, is that there is a reign
					 of terror. Women have no rights. They can be beaten or stoned and their
					 suffering is immense. A large percentage of the population is illiterate. I
					 think that must suit the Taliban, as it makes it easier to control the
					 population.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada provides Afghanistan with an average of $12
					 million yearly. These funds go to support numerous NGOs and UN agencies. The
					 breakdown is as follows: CARE, $3 million; World Food Program, $1.7 million;
					 International Committee of the Red Cross, the UN Office for the Coordination of
					 Humanitarian Affairs, and so on. We have a whole list. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister responsible for CIDA recently announced a
					 further contribution of $10 million to help deal with the immediate needs of
					 Afghan refugees and displaced populations in the area. This brings to $16
					 million Canada's contribution for Afghan refugees since September 11,
					 2001.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to learn that Canada spends about $21
					 million a year in Pakistan and that the objective of the program continues to
					 be the reduction of poverty. For example, we give $12 million through a
					 governance program to promote democracy at the local level and to increase
					 public participation in local affairs. The emphasis is on women's
					 participation. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Humanitarian aid is much more likely to succeed in poor
					 countries if women are involved. CIDA deserves praise for having been doing so
					 for a number of years. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us not forget that Canada's wealth is not
					 unlimited. Let us also not forget our own children. Poverty exists in our
					 country too. There are children who go to school on an empty stomach. It was
					 found that serving breakfast in some schools increased attendance by 30%.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here poverty is more hidden but nevertheless very real.
					 In Laval, on l'île Jésus, which is located in the riding of Laval East, there
					 is a volunteer centre with a very long list of families that need
					 food.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am thinking of one of my constituents, Louise
					 Beauchamp, the director of the St-Claude soup kitchen in Laval-des-Rapides. She
					 knows about the plight of some residents of Laval.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Saint-François, which is located in my riding, many
					 seniors would not eat regularly if it were not for the visits of volunteers
					 from the meal on wheels program.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, it is true that our government is
					 committed to investing more resources to strengthen democracies, justice and
					 social stability in the world. We also want to reduce poverty and eliminate the
					 debt of poor countries.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, we proposed a moratorium on the repayment
					 of the debt of 11 of the 17 most indebted poor countries to allow them to
					 invest in critical areas for their people.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not true that we are not taking action. We are.
					 We are doing our best and we must prepare to help the Afghan people give
					 themselves a government that will be representative of the population once the
					 war is over.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said at the beginning that democracy is the best
					 option for people. Again, Afghanistan needs a government that will respect
					 human rights and treat women as equal persons.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, this is a very serious issue. According to

					 not say affected by events because it is certainly not just the war; people in
					 that country were in terrible poverty even before the war began.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If all of a sudden the federal government came up with

					 unable to use a lot of that money very effectively in Afghanistan because of
					 the war that is going on there? At this point we can help somewhat with refugee
					 camps in Pakistan. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the UN has asked for $900 million and other
					 countries will be contributing. A lot of the money the Bloc is asking for
					 obviously could not possibly be used in Afghanistan right now. The 0.7% target
					 that it has suggested is really an arbitrary figure. It is a UN figure but it

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had the pleasure of acting as parliamentary secretary
					 to the Minister for International Cooperation for two years, between 1999 and
					 2001. I witnessed the fact that the minister is dedicated to helping those in
					 need and wanted to increase humanitarian assistance. Formerly, CIDA's
					 assistance was mostly focused on building infrastructure, such as bridges and
					 dams. More and more now, it is directed toward humanitarian
					 assistance.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year the Minister for International Cooperation
					 announced that her department and the Canadian International Development Agency
					 would strive to direct their programs toward the four priority areas of social
					 development: health and nutrition, basic education, the fight against HIV and
					 AIDS, and child protection. I would like to congratulate the minister for this
					 new direction.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to support the member for 
					 Lac-Saint-Jean--Saguenay
					 in our common objectives for international co-operation. Through our Prime
					 Minister, Canada has committed to fulfilling the development objectives for the
					 millennium.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These objectives include access to education for all
					 boys and girls around the world, reducing the number of children who die of
					 preventable diseases, promoting gender equality and eliminating extreme poverty
					 and hunger.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians are concerned about what is happening to
					 children on the planet. What is being done, or rather what is not being done
					 now to protect these children will have a catastrophic effect on their lives
					 and a severe effect on our own future.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian International Development Agency, CIDA,
					 takes these concerns very seriously. It has developed an action plan for
					 children, children who require special protection, children who are often
					 exploited, abused and discriminated against. Its plan is aimed at all boys and
					 girls growing up in the poorest countries of the world and who are directly
					 threatened by the most serious dangers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this plan of action, CIDA is launching a new and
					 better approach, which places Canada on the frontline of world action for the
					 protection of children. The agency does not limit itself to answering the needs
					 of children who are usually forgotten, it also wants to ensure that the rights
					 of those children are recognized and respected. Respect for the rights of
					 children is the key to a real and sustainable change in the life of those
					 children and communities. This is positive action for development, an good way
					 to eliminate the root causes of poverty and exclusion.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Children who have to work and who are affected by war
					 are those who benefit from the initiatives of CIDA for children protection.
					 Those initiatives are a complement to the agency's efforts for all children in
					 other areas, namely in health and nutrition, basic education, the fight against
					 HIV and AIDS. CIDA has committed $122 million for the protection of children
					 under a five year action plan. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the world summit for children, which was held in
					 1990, Canada has taken the lead of the children protection movement.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also played a key role in the development of
					 international agreements on the rights of children, whether it is for children
					 forced to work, sexually abused children or children forced to become soldiers.
					 When the government hosted the international conference on children affected by
					 war last autumn in Winnipeg, we pioneered by inviting children to play an
					 active part in the debates and decisions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has also obtained the support of the
					 retired Lieutenant General Roméo Dallaire as a special adviser to the Minister
					 for International Cooperation on the issue of children affected by war. The
					 practical experience of the general will be most useful to CIDA, in terms of
					 its program and will allow us to bring this question to the attention of the
					 public.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the House now debating our overall program of
					 humanitarian and development assistance for countries less privileged than
					 ours, including Afghanistan and other countries in southern and central Asia,
					 we must ensure that the emphasis remains on children.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The future of societies torn apart by war lies in the
					 ability of communities and parents to pass on to their children values such as
					 peace, tolerance and respect for others, even if these children have often
					 witnessed horrific acts. The success of these societies will have an impact on
					 our own safety and stability. These people deserve our support and our
					 assistance.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada should be able to provide greater support for
					 this sort of initiative. This is why we will be supporting the motion before us
					 today.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have witnessed some truly heart-rending events,

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately the events now unfolding in Afghanistan
					 are shocking. They bring tears to the eyes. We see children in distress,
					 children dying of hunger.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appreciate the fact that our children are sending us

	Mr. Speaker, I thank you for the opportunity to take
					 part in this debate. I believe it is appropriate at this time to remind the
					 House of the content of the motion moved by the Bloc Quebecois and which seems
					 to be well received by the majority of government members. I believe the mere
					 fact of reading it might convince people like the member for Laval-Est, who did
					 not seemed to be swayed by our arguments. The motion reads as
					 follows:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

						  government to review its international aid policy with a view to substantially
						  increasing the funds available for Canadian humanitarian aid, particularly in

						  Nations.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the beginning of the day we have seen that the
					 government supports this proposal. I believe it is important for this debate to
					 take place today. It is equally important to have firm support. This motion is
					 votable. In this regard, the Bloc Quebecois played its part well in ensuring
					 that the House would vote on this issue. We tried to get the government to hold
					 a vote on our military involvement but we failed so far. However on the issue
					 of international aid there will be a vote. We will be able to see where people
					 hang their hat. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the Canadian government must make amends in
					 this matter. According to an OECD report, Canada ranks 17th out of 22 OECD
					 countries contributing to international aid. We only contribute 0.25% of our
					 GDP to international aid whereas Denmark's share is over 1%, the Netherlands,
					 0.82%, Sweden, 0.80%, Norway, 0.80%. A lot of smaller countries invest much
					 more in this area than Canada. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that international aid does not only mean aid
					 for refugees and emergency assistance. It also means aid for developing
					 countries so that they too can create wealth and give a future to their youth.
					 Very often it can be an important tool for preventing situations like the
					 terrorist attacks we witnessed recently. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot say for sure that if humanitarian aid had
					 been higher those attacks could have been prevented. However it can be said
					 that when wealth is distributed more adequately, situations like those
					 terrorist attacks can be prevented. Humanitarian aid can help educate people,
					 give them some hope, a chance to have a future. Then they are less receptive to
					 desperate arguments like those expounded by people working for terrorist
					 groups. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position of the Bloc Quebecois in the present
					 debate is also the position of Canadian non-governmental organizations such as
					 the Association québécoise des organismes de coopération internationale, the
					 Canadian Council for International Cooperation and The North-South Institute.
					 These three associations represent many NGOs and wholeheartedly request that we
					 re-establish the 0.7% objective as soon as possible, just like the Bloc
					 Quebecois is requesting. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1993 the Government of Canada's contributions to
					 international aid have dropped considerably. I think we can draw a parallel
					 with this and how we treat the poorest and less organized in our
					 society.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1993 we have also witnessed significant cuts in
					 employment insurance. We have done the same thing when it comes to
					 international assistance. These are two spheres where people are less organized
					 and less able to defend themselves. Some years ago funding for ACOCI, an
					 organization that raised public awareness about international assistance, was
					 cut. Because of these budget cuts people may have become less aware of this
					 reality in the end. Today that decision has come back to haunt us. We must
					 consider the situation and take real action.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Wednesday of last week I spoke with a 100 or so
					 students from the Cegep de La Pocatière. There was also a representative from
					 the diocese, a sociologist, a professor from an Arab state and a professor of
					 political science. The questions these young people asked made quite an impact
					 on us. They were concerned about the real effectiveness of the military strikes
					 and their effect on civilian populations but also by the whole issue of
					 international assistance.</p>


	<A NAME="T1705"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1705"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1710"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1700"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1705)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right now, when we are asked whether it makes sense to
					 drop humanitarian assistance over mine fields, we have to say that some
					 blunders in the system should be avoided. At least we can make up for this with
					 medium and long term international assistance by substantially increasing our
					 budget.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of Finance has said that he will table a
					 budget by early December. While he tells us that security requirements are very
					 important, he should at the same time seriously consider a significant increase
					 in our humanitarian assistance budget.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our assistance budget stands at 0.25% of the GDP. If we
					 are to send a clear message, it is very important that we set a goal of 0.7% of
					 the GDP and that, as early as December, we say that, over the coming year, we
					 will do something significant and increase substantially our budget so that
					 this will be felt in our various assistance programs. A new attitude is needed
					 from the Canadian government. That way, we will really fulfill our role and we
					 will be in a position to take to task other G-7 countries, which may be the
					 ones not fulfilling their role in this matter.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right now there are very important problems. We have
					 heard what the hon. member for Trois-Rivières had to say. Children are dying.
					 They will not make it through the winter. Our short term assistance should be
					 increased but so should our long term assistance too.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will have all the time to discuss the most efficient
					 ways to bring our assistance to those in need. What kind of organization should
					 in be charge? Is CIDA as efficient as it should be? Should we be developing
					 different forms of assistance? These are questions we should ask but those in
					 charge should have adequate means to reach the goals our society has set for
					 itself.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those actions have not been adopted just out of
					 charity. The member for Joliette spoke earlier of the distribution of wealth in
					 our society. I think it is a splendid and very significant picture. After the
					 Great Depression of the thirties in the United States there was the new deal.
					 It was found that social programs could be created in order to establish a
					 safety net and to ensure that those who were the most affected during a
					 recession or economic slowdown would be protected. These programs were
					 efficient. In the following decades they allowed us to avoid overly negative
					 impacts, rough economic situations and slowdowns. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the international level, we have to ask the same
					 question. We have to adopt as quickly as possible solutions that will give hope
					 to people in order for those who are in complete deprivation to make it out. At
					 the same time we probably should continue to search for a way to eradicate
					 terrorism through all the means of action possible.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, to avoid the development of terrorism,
					 we have to intervene to eliminate at the source the conditions on which it
					 relies: ignorance, illiteracy, destitution, under development. If we eliminate
					 all these conditions and gradually succeed in improving the situation there
					 will be fewer extreme events such as the one we unfortunately witnessed on
					 September 11. This situation did not begin on that day, but is rather the
					 result of an anger which, albeit unacceptable, could be explained globally by
					 an unfair distribution of wealth. We could play an important role to correct
					 it. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In closing, we need a global strategy to act on every
					 aspect of terrorism. One of the ways in which we can play our role as a rich
					 country, is to commit important additional funds.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what the Bloc is calling for today. I hope that
					 tomorrow, when we vote, this motion will draw a large consensus which will
					 translate into important new funds in the next budget in early December. That
					 is when we will see if the government has really understood our
					 message.</p>

					 BQ): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to take part in this
					 debate because last Friday I experienced a particular situation in my
					 riding.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had the pleasure of meeting with four students from
					 the Les Pionniers high school. Two are first year students and the other two
					 are enrolled in the IEP, the International Education Program. Their names are
					 Cynthia Lacourcière, Kate Denis, Mathilde Bélanger and Mathieu Hubert, the
					 latter being the president of his class. They were accompanied by Mr. Gérard
					 Garceau, with the campus ministry.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They wanted me to know that 450 students had gathered
					 on Wednesday, October 24, and marched in the streets around the school to
					 demonstrate under the theme “Let's Cultivate Peace”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That meeting was not only very moving but also very
					 instructive for me. All the more so since first year students wrote some 160
					 letters, half of them addressed to your humble servant, the member for
					 Trois-Rivières, and the other half addressed to my colleague for Saint-Maurice
					 and Prime Minister of Canada. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These letters show that not only are those students
					 very much aware of and sensitive to the situation, but they are also, like the
					 rest of the people in Quebec and around the world, traumatized and concerned,
					 particularly by Canada's participation in the war. That is especially obvious
					 in the letters addressed to the Prime Minister. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key themes are “no to war”, “no to armament”, “no
					 to vengeance”, “no to violence”, and “yes to peace and humanitarian aid”, as
					 can be seen in the letters I will quote in the time I have
					 available.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While all of course focus on the same themes, they are
					 all different at the same time.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will start with this one, a poem in which the student
					 expresses an opinion.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<blockquote>
		
<p>Over there in Afghanistan, the sky lowers
							 darkly.<br>
		

	Bombs rain down on the houses.<br>
		

	Scarcely a breath of wind<br>
		

	Stirs the smoke that billows through the smoldering
							 streets.<br>
		

	The Americans smolder still with hatred<br>
		

	While people are dying,<br>
		

	Even children, innocent children.<br>
		

	They cannot go to bed and dream sweet dreams,<br>
		

	Dreams that the winds of hope may be blowing when
							 they awake.<br>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It goes without saying that I am truly happy to read

					 remind us, by the candor of their authors, that children hit it right on the
					 head. I believe these letters speak for themselves. I was really impressed by

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think this sums up quite well what the government,

					 sensitivity.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latest polls show it: the concerns of Quebecers are
					 quite different from those of the rest of Canada. Again that shows that a
					 sovereign Quebec would have a different voice in the community of nations at
					 the United Nations and humanity would benefit from it.</p>

					 (Etobicoke--Lakeshore, Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I am splitting my time with the member for
					 
					 Leeds--Grenville.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to join in the debate on the motion put
					 forward by the Bloc Quebecois calling upon the federal government to “review
					 its international aid policy with a view to substantially increasing the funds
					 available for Canadian humanitarian aid, particularly in light of military
					 intervention in Afghanistan” and to raise the level of ODA to 0.7% as
					 recommended by the United Nations. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me begin by noting that my colleagues on this side
					 of the House support the motion. The events of September 11 have made it
					 crystal clear that Canada and the developed world have an obligation to assist
					 those nations whose populations continue to live in abject poverty. Poverty and
					 its consequences are threats to the stability and the security of nations and
					 to those who are directly impacted by it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Prime Minister, the Minister of National
					 Defence, the Minister of Foreign Affairs and many of the representatives on
					 this side of the House have stated, we will use not only diplomatic and other
					 means but also humanitarian assistance in the fight against international
					 terrorism. It is ever more important to strengthen our resolve to promote
					 sustainable development in every corner of the developing world.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must help developing countries to provide their
					 populations with access to education and health care, promote and protect
					 rights of children and women, fight HIV-AIDS and eradicate malnutrition, and we
					 must help and encourage them to develop practices of good governance and
					 capacity building which are so necessary for building peaceful and stable
					 democratic societies.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The impoverishment of peoples affects us all. Troubling
					 social realities in one country today can become a challenge for all of us
					 tomorrow. CIDA cannot afford to renege on commitments that Canada has made at
					 UN conferences and in international agreements aimed at addressing issues in
					 international development. This is even more relevant and true in time of
					 crisis and war, as in the case of Afghanistan.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to comment briefly on CIDA's assistance to
					 Afghanistan and on development assistance in the context of
					 HIV-AIDS.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For over 30 years Canada has been working with its
					 international partners and civil society to provide assistance to peoples of
					 the developing world. In recent years, deficit management and fiscal restraints
					 have reduced Canada's ODA envelope, making it impossible to reach the UN target
					 of 0.7% of GDP.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the member of parliament for 
					 Etobicoke--Lakeshore, I,
					 with so many others who work with me in the Canadian Association of
					 Parliamentarians on Population and Development, together with all of our NGO
					 colleagues, have been pressing for Canada to reach that 0.7% of GDP.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, CIDA and the Government of Canada are taking
					 steps to turn around this trend and to focus development aid in times of
					 limited resources on urgent areas. In the last federal budget, ODA funding
					 increased to the tune of $435 million over three years, providing a clear
					 signal of a return to long term growth in a generous, measured way. The Prime
					 Minister is determined to work with other countries in the G-8 to see poverty
					 reduction and development issues addressed at the next G-8 summit here in
					 Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CIDA has implemented its “Social Development
					 Priorities: A Framework for Action”, which aims to strengthen resources devoted
					 to basic education, health and nutrition, HIV-AIDS and child protection. The
					 agency's cross-Canada consultations to review the government's international
					 aid policy and to strengthen aid effectiveness are testament to the
					 government's commitment to move the development assistance agenda forward.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation in Afghanistan is one of urgency. We know
					 that the country was in need of international assistance prior to the military
					 interventions. Afghanistan is one of the world's poorest countries, which has
					 been devastated by drought and civil war.</p>


	<A NAME="T1725"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1725"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1730"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1720"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1725)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The UNHCR and the international Red Cross have warned
					 us that ,in light of the present crisis in Afghanistan, they are facing one of
					 the largest humanitarian crises. Thousands of Afghanis are internally displaced
					 and are refugees. They are in need of the basic necessities of life. The people
					 of Afghanistan do not have the protection of a government. They are in this
					 situation due to no fault of their own.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased that Canada is one of the nations at the
					 forefront providing humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan. Over the past 10
					 years CIDA provided close to $160 million which has helped to provide food and
					 shelter for Afghanis, remove deadly landmines, fight the spread of disease and
					 educate children, especially girls. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada has contributed $16 million to the current
					 humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan. With this funding, we are helping to
					 provide food, basic health care, adequate shelter and safe water. CIDA is
					 working in partnership with the world food program and through Canadian NGOs,
					 such as the Canadian Foodgrains Bank, CARE Canada and the Aga Khan Foundation
					 Canada, to ensure that humanitarian assistance reaches the Afghani
					 people.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It boggles the mind to listen to members of one
					 opposition party talk about waste in CIDA and question the need for CIDA's
					 intervention. Everyone would agree that development assistance helps countries
					 on the road to self-sufficiency and economic prosperity. It is important that
					 any type of foreign aid must be sustainable or else it becomes ineffective over
					 time. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can ensure that the quality of aid is effective over
					 time by setting benchmarks and targets that would help to determine progress
					 and improve conditions. We must put strategies in place that would encourage
					 countries to meet the needs of their citizens.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Economic prosperity cannot be achieved among developing
					 countries unless there are strong social policies in place. These policies must
					 address the root causes of poverty and the systemic reasons that thwart
					 development. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Encouraging developing countries to meet their own
					 social priorities is most desirable in providing development assistance.
					 Forgiving the debt of heavily indebted poor countries is a positive step in
					 this direction. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remind members that the Government of Canada was
					 first among the G-8 partners to commit $40 million to the heavily indebted poor
					 countries trust fund in 1999 and has followed through in the 2000 budget with
					 an additional $175 million. As of January 1, 2001 Canada has stopped collecting
					 debt payments from heavily indebted poor countries. They were able to use debt
					 relief savings productively and were developing poverty reduction strategies.
					 This is the way we have to go. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me also remind the House that there is a great
					 emergency on our hands that cannot be ignored. That emergency is the spread of
					 HIV-AIDS. The Government of Canada, through CIDA, has been responding to the
					 HIV-AIDS pandemic which threatens to thwart the economic development of
					 developing countries. Fighting HIV-AIDS is one of CIDA's key development
					 priorities. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last June the United Nations drew our attention to the
					 problem facing the world when it convened a special session on HIV-AIDS and our
					 Prime Minister and members of the G-8 addressed the matter in Genoa. AIDS is
					 wiping out decades of hard won development gains. Thousands of children are
					 being orphaned, threatening the economic survival of nations and communities.
					 The spread of HIV-AIDS is undermining investments in education and human
					 resource development.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada is working hard in the fight against HIV-AIDS.
					 The federal government is quadrupling development assistance funding for
					 HIV-AIDS through CIDA's HIV-AIDS action plan. We are at a turning point in the
					 fight against this terrible disease. Now is the time for a substantive and
					 renewed commitment from the entire global community and Canada must be there.
					 Canada is moving forward in its aggressive efforts to address this pandemic
					 through international co-operation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We therefore support today's motion because, while
					 Canadians can be proud of their country's support for sustainable development,
					 poverty reduction and education of children, it is clear that we can do
					 more.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our communities expect us to do more. Our communities
					 expect us to reach 0.7% of GDP. I support the motion at this time and ask
					 colleagues from all sides of the House to focus on our responsibility to the
					 rest of the world. As Canadians, we are expected to stand up and be
					 counted.</p>

					 to the Prime Minister, Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I find myself in a rather unusual
					 situation as a politician because I can actually speak with some knowledge on
					 this issue.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I congratulate the House for entertaining this motion
					 because we have had approximately 45 to 50 hours of debate in the House dealing
					 specifically with the coalition initiative against terrorism. That is an
					 important item that needs to be discussed. However today's motion brings a
					 semblance of balance to the debate.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If our actions are targeted toward the terrorists, it
					 is incumbent on the partners in the coalition to make sure that they are there
					 on the ground to make sure the civilians in those countries understand not only
					 by language but by action that this is what we intend to do.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I congratulate my colleague from
					 Lac-Saint-Jean--Saguenay for sponsoring this motion. I am comforted that
					 someone at that tender age takes this issue seriously because it is an
					 extremely serious issue. Global poverty is something that we must come to grips
					 with sooner or later. The sooner we do it, the easier the solution will be on
					 everybody.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason I prefaced my comments by saying I thought I
					 could speak to this issue is that I was a teacher in my former life and spent a
					 number of years overseas on international projects that CIDA funded. I will
					 target my remarks to those experiences because I get concerned when I hear
					 criticisms about Canada's international development aid policy. I believe that
					 with the experiences I have had I have a right to address some of those
					 misconceptions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I spent two years on a project in Ethiopia in the
					 1980s. To bring credibility to my argument, the Liberals were not in power at
					 the time. The development staff on the ground and the embassy personnel were of
					 the highest quality in terms of making sure that Canadian taxpayer money was
					 spent efficiently and in a manner consistent with the objectives and the values
					 underscored in CIDA's documents. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the issues that we focus on in international aid
					 as Canadians is the notion of women and development. We have learned that if we
					 are to get at the root causes of poverty, treating the causes as opposed to the
					 symptoms, we must ensure that the women in the country are engaged in any
					 solution that is being proposed. That is an oversimplification, but money spent
					 to increase the capacity of women in countries is money that manifests itself
					 in a higher standard of living for children. Canada makes sure that the
					 projects it undertakes address the issue of women and development. I encourage
					 the government to continue to make that important intervention.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the things that struck me in Ethiopia was that a
					 lot of the aid was very politicized. Ethiopia is a strategically located
					 country. Over the years it was important to this country or that country and a
					 lot of money went to Ethiopia. I saw $80,000 tractors at the side of the road
					 because there was no gasoline. One of the things that Canadian aid focuses on
					 is sustainability. We have to be able to sustain development otherwise when the
					 aid runs out the project runs out.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the most successful projects I saw was a German
					 one. It developed a very simple prototype for an ox pulled cart based on the
					 rear wheel assembly of a Volkswagen bug because there were thousands of these
					 cars littering the landscape. These were built by the Cubans, interestingly
					 enough. There were no spare parts and no gasoline to run these cars. Sometimes
					 low technology must be used that matches the technology of the country.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I leave Africa, one of the proudest moments I
					 had was when I went to one of the water wells and saw it identified as a
					 Canadian project. Another aspect of Canadian development aid relating to the
					 root causes of health is clean water. </p>


	<A NAME="T1735"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1735"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1740"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1730"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1735)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every Canadian can be extremely proud of the fact that
					 we have drilled literally thousands of wells and maintained and trained local
					 personnel to maintain clean water supplies so that the children who drink the
					 water are getting clean water and are not getting viruses and other things from
					 their water which in most cases would end up killing them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I then spent three years on a CIDA project in Hungary.
					 This was a different situation because one of the things that happened in that
					 country after the fall of the communist economic system was that lawyers
					 previously employed by the state were essentially told to hang out a shingle
					 and make a living. The Canadian government, through CIDA, got involved in
					 training lawyers, and one might ask what would be the reason for that? The
					 reason quite simply was that if we were to open up eastern Europe as a
					 potential market for Canadian companies, then we needed a system and a legal
					 framework there that would minimize risk to Canadian companies.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I started working on that project I thought it was
					 a tremendously useful strategy that the Canadian government had undertaken.
					 Someone mentioned earlier a simple phrase that rings true: the Canadian
					 development assistance strategy is one where we would rather teach someone to
					 fish as opposed to giving them a fish. As for people who try to suggest in my
					 presence that Canadian foreign aid is just buckets of cash being thrown around
					 with no accountability, I can tell members that those people have had no
					 experience with foreign aid projects, because the accountability measures and
					 processes that are in place are extremely tough. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We focus on prevention. We focus on capacity building.
					 We focus on making sure that women are included in these development projects
					 because that speaks to their sustainability. We are very concerned when looking
					 at the root causes of poverty. One of the issues that Ethiopia faced was that
					 with such dire poverty any cooking going on was being done through cutting down
					 trees for fuel. The deforestation of the area around the city when the big
					 rains would come in August was causing tremendous problems with what arid or
					 tillable land was left. It was Canadian engineers who went over and started
					 setting up systems of pumps for irrigation and workings and having agricultural
					 workers out in the field talking to people about the importance of not engaging
					 in that kind of activity.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a final point I would also like to say that in my
					 personal experience one of the other advantages to international assistance is
					 that the people who are engaged in it learn just as much as the people at the
					 other end. One of the things that Canada has been criticized for is that we are
					 kind of an island within ourselves and it is very difficult for Canadians to
					 travel. International assistance experiences for students, exchange programs
					 between various universities and faculty exchange programs which CIDA funds are
					 extremely beneficial, not only to the country we are working with but also to
					 the Canadians who participate in these projects.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will conclude with that point, but to underscore it I
					 want to say that Canadians can be extremely proud, not only of the people we
					 have employed in our international development agencies but also of the
					 direction, the scale and scope of these projects. I absolutely agree with the
					 motion from the Bloc. It is very timely. It is a matter of ramping up to that
					 figure, which is also contingent on the growth of the economy. That is one of
					 the downsides to using GDP as a measure, but I think there is a definite
					 payback for engaging in these types of activities. I would suggest that in
					 terms of getting a bang for our buck, Canada is one of the leading countries in
					 making sure that the money is spent both efficiently and effectively. We can
					 all be very proud of that.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I hope the member is not suggesting that
					 we as Canadians are not proud of the efforts of our international development
					 agencies. It is contingent upon all of us to take steps forward on this
					 file.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of my speech was primarily aimed at some of
					 the people who today tried to criticize the policies of Canada as somehow being
					 spendthrift, out of control and a waste of money. That is not the case at all.
					 If the hon. member is suggesting that we need to increase our efforts in this
					 area, I agree. However I would also suggest to him that that has to be a
					 non-partisan effort. Anybody who feels that way has to work together to try to
					 accomplish that. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can see from today's debate that sometimes we are up
					 against some pretty harsh critics. Sometimes we are up against people who have
					 convinced themselves that international development aid is what we want and we
					 kick the crumbs to some other country. I would suggest that there are
					 tremendous opportunities. A rising tide tends to lift all vessels. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know from the past speeches of the hon. member and
					 his gestures in the House that he feels very strongly about this issue. I look
					 forward to working with him to move this item forward.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I wish to commend the hon. young member for
					 Lac-Saint-Jean--Saguenay who proposed this motion. I have known him for five
					 years and I think this is very representative of the work he has been doing so
					 far. This hon. member speaks with generosity and always for the people in his
					 riding. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also appreciated the approach of our colleague from
					 Trois-Rivières, who presented here in parliament the thoughts of students, of
					 young people about this whole issue as well as the questions they are asking
					 themselves.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few weeks ago I was invited by a secondary 5 class
					 and an Amnesty International group at a high school. Young people are very
					 concerned about the current crisis. Everyone is concerned, including young
					 people. They are very interested in this issue and they are very worried. The
					 comments made by the hon. member for Lac-Saint-Jean--Saguenay accurately
					 reflect the feelings of the members of his generation. I continued my
					 consultation with teachers and many other people. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This morning, the results of a poll--I will not go into
					 the details--indicated that Quebecers see the Afghan conflict from a slightly
					 different perspective than other Canadians do. I am not surprised. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me be clear. We supported a response, a reaction by
					 the Americans, under the aegis of the UN, to punish those responsible for the
					 September 11 attacks and their accomplices. I think we should be clear on
					 this.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this brings us to the source of the problem. In my
					 opinion, the growing gap between poor and rich countries is at the root of this
					 problem. We must be careful not to let the current conflict degenerate and
					 become a terrible ordeal for civilians, not only in Afghanistan, but also
					 elsewhere in the region, and even at home. A victim, whether in the United
					 States or in Afghanistan, is a victim nonetheless. We must never forget that.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason I reread the motion earlier is precisely
					 because it puts us in the context of the current crisis. Let us not forget it.
					 Of course the pre-September 11 humanitarian assistance is an altogether
					 different issue but there are people and NGOs who are meeting. They were even
					 consulted by the minister. They told her as recently as September 6, before the
					 attacks, that they wondered about the international humanitarian assistance
					 provided by the Canadian government. They felt that the aid provided was
					 increasingly governed by a commercial or economical framework or vision.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to Afghanistan for example, this country
					 has been suffering the horrors of wars for at least 20 years. People do not
					 know where to go so they keep moving. Even before September 11 this country had
					 the greatest numbers of refugees of all, with over 2.5 million people
					 displaced. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since September 11 at least 500,000 more people have
					 been internally displaced or have fled to neighbouring countries to be safe.
					 They have to protect themselves not only from the Taliban but also from the
					 bombings. More and more misfires are reported. A victim, whether in Afghanistan
					 or anywhere else in the world, remains a victim. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was sitting in my office this afternoon getting ready
					 for my speech when I overheard some MPs talking. I do not want to tell you who
					 they were but I can tell you that what they said worried me somewhat. Members
					 from the other side were saying that we could perhaps question the
					 international and humanitarian aid to which Canada currently contributes. As if
					 it were very significant. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the problems is that Canada's international
					 assistance is dwindling. At 0.25%, it is far from the 0.7% target. It is
					 actually less than half what former Canadian Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson
					 had proposed for all countries. At the time, OECD countries had agreed to move
					 in that direction but since the Liberals took office, we have been moving in
					 the opposite direction, with declining assistance. Some members are wondering
					 if we should continue in that direction while others suggest it is not
					 worthwhile. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am in favour of the most urgent humanitarian aid. Let
					 us take for example a person whose life is in danger, whose health is
					 threatened or who is hungry. Maslow taught us that when primary needs are not
					 satisfied is not the time to consider development projects. How can a person
					 think of development projects when his life or the lives of his children or his
					 neighbours are in danger? </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since I am a member of the Standing Committee on Human
					 Rights, I would like to read once again a few sections of the charter of human
					 rights that was adopted by the UN more than 50 years ago. It is not asking too
					 much to read this again.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 1 says, and I quote:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small> All human beings are born free and
						  equal in dignity and rights.They are endowed with reason and conscience and
						  should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must ask ourselves whether there is still a spirit
					 of brotherhood in this conflict. There are 30 articles in the charter. For
					 example, Article 3 states:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>Everyone has the right to
						  life--</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is essential when we are threatened with death by
					 bombs or by people pursuing us. I go on:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>--liberty and security of
						  person.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 13 says: </p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small> Everyone has the right to freedom of
						  movement and residence within the borders of each state.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When people are forced to flee their residences, I do
					 not think they do it freely. They do it to save their lives. When people cross
					 borders they do it because they are threatened. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 14 says this:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>Everyone has the right to seek and to
						  enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a right. People are given that right, but they
					 also need food and medical care. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 22 says this:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>Everyone, as a member of society, has
						  the right to social security and is entitled to realization, through national
						  effort and international co-operation and in accordance with the organization
						  and resources of each State, of the economic, social and cultural rights
						  indispensable for his dignity and the free development of his
						  personality.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An underdeveloped country may not have the same ability
					 to provide foreign aid as another country. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 25 says this:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>Everyone has the right to a standard
						  of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family,
						  including food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social
						  services, and the right to security in the event of unemployment, sickness,
						  disability...or other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his
						  control.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wanted to remind members of that. Human rights are
					 fundamental but too often we have a tendency to forget that. We can ask
					 ourselves why. Yes, bilateral aid from Canada or any other country must be
					 conditional on respect for human rights. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the meaning of the motion and it is in this
					 context that the member for 
					 Lac-Saint-Jean--Saguenay
					 is presenting the motion. International aid would be sent out through the UN,
					 the international organizations of the UN, the UN High Commission for Refugees
					 and international agencies accredited by the UN, therefore, we could help the
					 countries within an independent framework. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the weekend I discussed the issue with many people
					 of all ages in my riding. This is what I came out with. Why would Canada not
					 contribute as much to humanitarian aid, and we are talking about 0.7%, as it
					 contributes to the military for participation in the offensive? We do not
					 disagree with offensive action but we should always give as much to build and
					 to save lives as we give to destroy a country. </p>

					 Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I will take only two or three moments. It
					 might seem a bit out of the ordinary for a minister to rise during questions
					 and comments. Usually a minister rises for a speech or to state a government
					 position. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it is certainly not the case today. I do not intend
					 to state any policy but I do wish to take part in this exchange with
					 colleagues, and I do so with pleasure.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I listened to speeches in the House from my seat and a
					 bit earlier today from my office. On the whole, I commend all members in the
					 House for the excellent quality of their speeches today. I did not agree with
					 all that was said but I think most of the debate was very interesting.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without criticizing other debates, I must say that
					 today's debate was more interesting and probably less partisan than some other
					 opposition day debate, if I may say so.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where I am perhaps less in agreement with the member
					 who just spoke is with the comparison he made at the end of his speech. He
					 tried somewhat to make a comparison between the need for a state to protect its
					 citizens and, of course, the duty of a state to contribute to foreign
					 aid.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is like comparing apples with oranges and it is
					 impossible to do so in all cases. I believe we have a duty as a society to
					 protect citizens against terrorist acts and to take every action possible. I
					 want to dissociate all this from our contribution to international development
					 aid.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was also a minister of International cooperation, a
					 role that I loved. I travelled to 25 or 30 African countries and to many South
					 American countries. I spent quite some time in Haiti. Our country has done a
					 lot in several parts of the world.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find it rather interesting to note that today in
					 China, generally speaking, people know two things about Canada: they know of
					 Dr. Bethune and of CIDA. Those are the two things the Chinese know about
					 Canada. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CIDA, or ACDI as it is known in French, is well known
					 but it is the English acronym that is known in China, since of course when a
					 foreign language is spoken in China usually it is not French but
					 English.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would not likeCanadians in general think we have the
					 right to draw a comparison between our duty to protect our citizens, which is
					 our collective duty, and the duty to invest in development aid.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will conclude by dissociating myself from
					 those--which was not the case of the last speech, of course, nor the case of
					 the last few speeches I heard--who think, wrongly, that we do not have the duty
					 to offer a helping hand to other human beings who need us. We have such a duty.
					 I do not know if that can be considered generosity. It is a duty for all of us.
					 I think it is also our duty, as members of parliament, to make the population
					 aware of this duty.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wanted to share those feelings with my
					 colleagues.</p>


	<A NAME="Int-61482"></A><a HREF="#Int-61484"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-61480"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Antoine Dubé:
				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, concerning the last words of the
					 government House leader, I think that he was absolutely right when he said that
					 it was a matter of rights. Rights, duties and responsibilities go hand in hand.
					 That is why I was drawingattention to some clauses in the United Nations
					 charter of rights. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I want simply to reply by saying that, when I
					 made the comparison I was merely referring to what I and most of the members
					 were hearing when we went back to our ridings on the weekends. It was the
					 conclusion that I drew from what these people told me during the weekend when
					 they said that we have to give as much importance to humanitarian aid as to the
					 means necessary to ensure the security of Canadians and Quebecers. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, what should be considered now is the
					 possibility of making a financial contribution together with sending a military
					 force to punish the suspected terrorists. I think we have to put the matter
					 back into its context. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very happy the government House leader, now that
					 he is aware of the issue, has thought it was sufficiently important to
					 intervene personally in the debate, which is not his custom. I want to thank
					 him for that and it bodes very well for tomorrow evening's vote. I hope he will
					 persuade all the other hon. members who are a little less aware of the issue to
					 vote in favour of the motion of the hon. member for Lac-Saint-Jean--Saguenay.

	Mr. Speaker, it is very important for me to participate
					 in today's debate on the motion put forward by my colleague, the hon. member
					 for Lac-Saint-Jean—Saguenay. The motion reads as follows:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>That this House calls upon the
						  government to review its international aid policy with a view to substantially
						  increasing the funds available for Canadian humanitarian aid, particularly in

						  level of its aid for development to 0.7% of GDP, as recommended by the United
						  Nations.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a remark made earlier this afternoon, a member
					 seemed to wonder where this famous 0.7% came from. Why do we use that number?
					 Why was it included in the motion?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This figure was set by the United Nations. My colleague
					 for 
					 Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière reminded us that this
					 discussion began in 1959. Lester B. Pearson, who was then our ambassador to the
					 United Nations, made this suggestion to the organization. The idea made its way
					 through all sorts of obstacles, it was discussed, and all kinds of calculations
					 were made. In 1975, there was a new attempt to implement the 1959 decision.
					 Ultimately, the final decision was made in the 1990s, so that rich countries
					 could contribute to the development of mainly third world countries.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important that we get involved in development
					 because, collectively, we are responsible for what is happening out there. We
					 would all like wealth to be shared better. We all realize that we were lucky to
					 be born in a country that has never been affected by famine, war, despair and
					 all the terrible things that have been happening elsewhere.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our involvement is also important because aid to
					 developing countries is crucial. This contribution is an integral part of our
					 openness to the world and it is an extremely effective tool against
					 poverty.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terrorists have reasons to do what they do. We speak of
					 the U.S. response to what we could perhaps call another kind of response. For
					 some, what happened on September 11 was a response to what they were living, to
					 what they were unsatisfied with, to the reason they were not happy. So this is
					 a response to a response to a response. When will this ever end?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My young colleague proposed an extremely important
					 motion. Another speaker reminded us earlier that several countries are still
					 far from making the contribution asked by the UN. As far as I know, it seems
					 from the documents I read that only five countries have so far accepted to make
					 that contribution, that is, Denmark, the Netherlands, Sweden, Norway and
					 Luxembourg.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None of these countries are part of the G-7. Thus, none
					 of them are among the main industrialized countries.</p>


	<A NAME="T1805"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1805"><!-- Hour: 6--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1810"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1800"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1805)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet, they have managed to give between 0.7%, for
					 Luxembourg, and 1.06%, for Denmark. If we are aware of the fact that it is
					 important to share that wealth, if we want to put an end to starvation, to
					 extreme poverty and to violence, it is probably a good idea to try, as quickly
					 as possible, to fulfill this commitment that was made many years ago.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the refugee situation in Afghanistan,
					 somebody else was saying that there was short term action being taken. Of
					 course, Afghanistan is a major concern at the present time, but we also have to
					 think about the long term. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many countries where action is required:
					 Palestine, Sudan, other countries in Africa and South America, but what
					 concerns us most at present is the situation in Afghanistan. We were upset to
					 learn that there have been mistakes, that eight children were killed Saturday
					 night. I do not think anybody is rejoicing over that. However, this does not
					 stop us from considering that the response was legitimate. But now, we have to
					 ask ourselves what we can do to help these people. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have read articles of European magazines such as
					 <i>Le Nouvel Observateur</i>, <i>Le Point</i> or <i>l'Express</i>. NGOs are
					 very unhappy about the fact that the United States has engaged in military
					 action and humanitarian action at the same time. Those are two major operations
					 that are normally separate, not as much in time since aid must be forwarded to
					 people anyway, but more from the point of view of natural helpers. NGOs are the
					 ones that normally provide humanitarian aid.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the war ended tomorrow, we would still need to give
					 humanitarian aid to Afghanistan, which has been at war for 22 years and has
					 gone through a three year drought. When a drought lasts for three years, it is
					 not easy to grow anything. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During a program I was listening to recently, it was
					 mentioned that NGOs, having been unable to enter Afghanistan as easily as
					 before, could not bring the necessary seeds for next year's harvest. Because of
					 that, the situation in Afghanistan will get even worse.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be understood that humanitarian aid in
					 Afghanistan is vitally important at this time and that it will remain so in the
					 future. According to the United Nations' estimates, seven million people will
					 need aid, which is about one third of the country's population. The country
					 will need to be rebuilt. Different kinds of support will have to be put in
					 place. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will have to rebuild what the bombs will have
					 demolished. We will have to remove all mines in that country. Apparently, this
					 will take the whole next century.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What seems more important to me is what a former
					 president of Médecins sans frontières said, and I quote:</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I invite Canada to play a leadership role in this field
					 so that we can offer our aid, give food, not any food but food that conforms to
					 these people's eating habits. What the people of Afghanistan now need is wheat,
					 oil and sugar, and not biscuits, peanut butter or jam.</p>

					 Canadian Alliance): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the indulgence of members of
					 the House in allowing me to say a few things before the debate wraps
					 up.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the Canadian Alliance are concerned about
					 the situation in Afghanistan. The situation there is as dire as it is in many
					 countries around the world. We have seen people in many countries torn apart by
					 war, famine and poverty. There are many situations that are completely
					 untenable. There will always be a need for humanitarian aid. That is a sad
					 fact. We will always have, I am sorry to say, famine, poverty and those kinds
					 of things in the world. There will always be a need for humanitarian aid. There
					 is no question about it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where would we get a figure like 0.7% of GDP? Where
					 does that number come from? It seems it was drawn out of thin air. What is the
					 basis for that number? In Canada's case this would mean an increase in foreign
					 aid of $5 billion a year. That is a tremendous amount of money. It comes at a
					 time when we already have big demands for new spending to strengthen our
					 military, hire more people to screen our borders and hire more people at CSIS.
					 All these are demands on the treasury. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The UN has asked for $584 million U.S. or about $900
					 million Canadian to help with the problems in Afghanistan. It is pretty clear
					 that other countries would be expected to contribute. The money is not all for
					 Afghanistan, obviously. However even if we had all that money we could not help
					 Afghanistan right now because the country is torn apart by war.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We could help some of the people who make it to
					 Pakistan. Maybe we could help in the northern part of Afghanistan. There are
					 refugee camps on the border with Turkmenistan and other places. The situation
					 in those places is not good. In one refugee camp last year I read that when it
					 turned cold it dropped to 25° below zero and 150 people froze to
					 death.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no question that we can help, but we could not
					 possibly spend all that money right now in Afghanistan. The country is so
					 ripped apart by war that we would not be able to help a lot of the people
					 behind enemy lines. There is no way we can help all those people,
					 unfortunately.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will wrap up by asking my colleague one final
					 question. Canada imposes tariffs on textiles and food to less developed
					 countries like Afghanistan. Does my colleague think that is an appropriate
					 policy given the level of poverty that countries like Afghanistan and others
					 face?</p>

				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I think it is important for my colleague
					 from Medicine Hat to know that the task of finding out how to help developing
					 countries was given to a fully independent committee established in 1959 under
					 the aegis of the World bank.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Experts were asked to study how much money was needed,
					 for how many years, and what would be the end results if <i>x</i> amount of
					 money was given over a period of 20 years. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Around 1990 they concluded that if we gave 0.7% of our
					 GDP, we could provide enough help to developing countries break free from
					 chronic poverty. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fighting against poverty is a way of working against
					 terrorism. When we ask the Canadian government to increase its participation,
					 we are saying “Give us an idea of the time needed to reach the 0.7% level. We
					 are not expecting that all the billions of dollars will suddenly flow into
					 Afghanistan. The needs are so great all over the world that we will have to
					 ensure a fair distribution of these amounts according to the best of our
					 knowledge”.</p>
