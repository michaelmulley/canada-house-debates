<P>
	Motion No. 1 will be debated and voted on separately. Motion 
No. 2 proposes to delete certain lines from the bill, but since the 
committee's minutes of proceedings indicate that these lines 
were deleted at the committee stage, Motion No. 2 is therefore 
redundant and will not be selected.

	<B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Motion No. 1</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-48, in new clause 6(<I>a</I>), be amended by deleting the words 
``integrated management and''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, in setting the major goal for the new 
Department of Natural Resources, I would like to commend the 
minister for having made a change in committee following 
second reading debate in this House.
<P>
	At that time the many goals of this bill included sustainable 
development but it came further down in a long list. Therefore it 
was almost interpreted as being an added on consideration of a 
low priority and prompted interventions to the effect that 
sustainable development ought to be the top priority of the 
newly established Department of Natural Resources.
<P>
	Considering what has happened in the fisheries and 
considering the debates and the controversies in forestry, and 
considering the overall commitment by this government to the 
concept of sustainable development as announced and defined 
in 1987 by Madam Brundtland in the report entitled ``Our 
Common Future'', it would only stand to reason that sustainable 
development be given priority in the function and goals of the 
minister of this new department.
<P>
	I am very pleased to congratulate the minister for having 
made this change in committee and having brought sustainable 
development into a place that corresponds to its importance for 
the future activity of this department.
<P>
	I have to draw attention to the clause as presently drawn in the 
bill. It contains two concepts. It gives the natural resources 
minister responsibility with respect to integrated management 
of Canada's natural resources and sustainable development. In 
other words, it does two things in the manner that it is drafted 
now. It puts sustainable development in a secondary position to 
integrated management. Integrated management in the clause as 
it stands now, the goal as now defined, is first. It is followed by a 
subsequent secondary consideration in the way it could be 
interpreted in a court or by a judge or anyone who reads the bill, 
from the deputy minister to you name it, as a consideration that 
comes after integrated management.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8016"> 8016 </A></B>
<P>
	I submit respectfully this sequence is to be examined and 
possibly reversed. I appeal to the minister to give this her closest 
positive consideration.
<P>
<B>(1110) </B>
<P>
	The second point that has to be made in this connection is that 
these two concepts, integrated management and sustainable 
development, could at times come in conflict and could not be 
neutrally supported.
<P>
	Third, in the bill sustainable development, if it is not clearly 
defined, is clearly understood by way of the definition given in 
the Brundtland report and virtually universally accepted. 
Therefore we have as the major goal for the department a 
concept that is well defined, sustainable development. However, 
we cannot say the same for integrated management.
<P>
	A situation could arise in forestry, in fisheries or in any other 
natural resource tomorrow, in 10 years or in 100 years whereby 
pursuing the principles of integrated management as it is 
proposed now would not be in the interest of sustainable 
development.
<P>
	When there is such a conflict which of these two concepts will 
the minister of the day choose? Therefore to remove this 
ambivalence, to remove this dichotomy, to remove this 
uncertainty I am submitting by way of this motion an 
amendment to the particular portion of the bill whereby the 
Minister of Natural Resources has as a main responsibility the 
implementation of the principle of sustainable development and 
the clarification of other considerations related to management. 
I think it will make the task of the minister of the day clearer, 
politically saleable and also less in conflict with other 
considerations.
<P>
	We have had too many experiences in recent years with 
natural resources where there was a visible conflict between a 
natural resource, concepts of management and sustainable 
development. It is time to cut this umbilical cord and give very 
clear direction to the department in charge of such an important 
natural resource for the long term.
<P>
	We have sufficient examples that have already brought about 
the adoption of long term considerations on the part of this 
government, and I am glad to see the minister of fisheries in the 
Chamber who has done so already on a number of occasions, and 
very courageously so.
<P>
	To support my argument I bring into the House the red book 
and the fact that one of the main chapters in the red book is 
devoted to the concept of sustainable development and not to 
integrated management. Sustainable development is one of the 
pillars of the policies of this government. It was our 
commitment during the election and today it is our commitment 
as well.
<P>
	It would be a great pity if in launching the new Department of 
Natural Resources this commitment would be somehow derailed 
by considerations of integrated management of which we do not 
know the  definition and of which there is no definition in the 
bill. It could be the detracting factor in the long term interest of 
natural resources which this department is expected to protect 
and enhance.
<P>
	This is my argument and I rest my case.
<P>
<B>(1115 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we are debating 
something which is a little more fundamental than semantic.
<P>
	The basic premise expressed in this amendment is that sound 
management practices and sustainable development are 
mutually exclusive. This I cannot accept, nor can my party. If we 
remove the two offending words, integrated management, what 
we will be suggesting to the department is that the traditional 
and honourable concept of multiple use of resources is to be 
thrown out the window.
<P>
	I maintain that all that will be left is the equally undefined 
concept of sustainable development. Sustainable development 
is in the eye of the beholder. Surely if it is to be sustainable it 
must be properly managed. On that basis and that basis alone the 
Reform Party will oppose this amendment.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Natural Resources, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have listened with interest this morning to 
the discussion of my hon. friends and particularly to the 
comments made by the hon. member for Davenport.
<P>
	Let me say that I appreciate the interest and time he has taken 
in relation to Bill C-48 which creates the new Department of 
Natural Resources. I want to point out that I have listened very 
seriously and have taken very seriously his concerns in relation 
to this government's commitment to sustainable development. 
Because I take that commitment very seriously, I instructed my 
officials to reorder clause 6 of Bill C-48 in such a way that our 
commitment to sustainable development became clause 6(a).
<P>
	This morning the hon. member for Davenport indicated he 
would like further amendments to clause 6(a) of Bill C-48. 
Again I think my hon. friend raises some very important 
considerations for all of us. If it is appropriate at this point I 
would like to proceed with moving an amendment. I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Motion No. 1 be amended by adding:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>; and</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(b) by adding immediately after the word ``resources'' the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
``and the integrated management thereof;''.
<P>
	Clause 6(a) would indicate that the minister shall have regard 
to sustainable development and to the integrated management 
thereof. Let me explain why I am proposing such an amendment. 
It is because I think the paramount consideration and concept is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8017"> 8017 </A></B>
<P>
obviously that of sustainable  development and therefore 
sustainable development should have pride of place in clause 
6(a).
<P>
	My commitment as minister is to the sustainable development 
of Canada's natural resources, but integrated resource 
management is the means by which we deliver on that 
commitment. It is the how of the implementation of the concept 
of sustainable development.
<P>
	My opinion is it is important not only to include the 
commitment to sustainable development, but also to indicate 
how in the resource sector we achieve and deliver on that 
commitment. We do it through integrated resource management, 
the integration of the values of economic, social and 
environmental considerations. Therefore I have proposed the 
amendment as outlined.
<P>
<B>(1120 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Is there any further debate 
on the amendment by the hon. minister? If not, I will just take a 
few moments to consult with the table and then we will proceed. 
Debate is on the amendment of the Minister of Natural 
Resources.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, 
Lib.):</B> Just a few short comments, Mr. Speaker. I rise in my place 
to support the amendment to the amendment proposed by the 
Minister of Natural Resources.
<P>
	In the 15 years I have had the pleasure of knowing the hon. 
member for Davenport he has consistently displayed and 
exhibited in his participation in public life an absolutely 
unyielding and uncompromising commitment to the principle of 
sustainable development. To borrow a phrase from Jeffrey 
Archer it is no exaggeration to say if it can be said of anyone 
among us in this place he is the first among equals on the 
question of sustainable development. That is without question. 
It is also true for those of us who have been here for some time if 
there has been one who has enlightened and educated us and 
painfully and patiently explained the value of this principle over 
the years, it is indeed the member for Davenport.
<P>
	I am not surprised to see that the member wants to give the 
Minister of Natural Resources, as the minister would want, the 
greatest possible obligation and commitment first and foremost 
to the principle of sustainable development. All else must flow 
from that. I said I have known the member for 15 years. I have 
known the Minister for Natural Resources for a year. In my 
judgment, after sitting with her in council for a year, the 
minister shares the great commitment of the member for 
Davenport to sustainable development.
<P>
	In the amendment moved by the minister and which I was 
proud to second, the minister has reflected the kinds of 
standards and principles the hon. member for Davenport has 
always exhibited in this place. The hon. member is a 
fair-minded and principled man. I hope he will find the 
amendment acceptable. I hope we can proceed with this 
amendment with all reasonable and proper haste.
<P>
<B>(1125 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The question is on the 
amendment to Motion No. 1. Is it the pleasure of the House to 
adopt the amendment?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	(Amendment agreed to.)
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The question is on Motion 
No. 1, as amended. Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the 
motion as amended?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	(Motion as amended agreed to.)
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia-Matane, BQ) </B>moves:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Motion No. 3</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-48, in clause 7, be amended by replacing lines 27 to 35, on page 
3, with the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``7. The Minister shall cause to be laid before each House of Parliament, not later 
than the fifth sitting day of that House after January 31 next following the end of 
each fiscal year, a report showing the operations of the Department of Natural 
Resources for that fiscal year.''</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I and my colleagues from the Bloc 
Quebecois find it easy to speak to Bill C-48, an act to establish 
the Department of Natural Resources, because we, as a 
sovereignist party, were elected by Quebecers to defend the 
interests of Quebec and to initiate dialogue with the rest of 
Canada.
<P>
	The purpose of the amendment we are now proposing is to 
ensure that we will have all the information necessary at the 
right time, in order to better defend the interests of the Quebec 
taxpayers who elected us. Before we become autonomous, I 
must ask and ensure that this government respect Quebec's 
jurisdiction and that there be no reduction in our existing 
authority through unilateral action by the federal government.
<P>
	The purpose of this amendment is to eliminate unjustifiable 
delays. We are bound to defend Quebec's exclusive jurisdiction 
with respect to natural resources. However, in order to fulfil our 
mandate, we need all the information available. We would be 
remiss not to ask for this information, and we would not be 
serving those who elected us if we remained silent before this 
bill, which does not set out any specific date for the tabling of its 
annual report and which therefore leaves the administration 
with full latitude in this regard.
<P>
<B>(1130) </B>
<P>
	In Quebec, the electorate's choice in the last federal election 
could not have been clearer. For the first time in our history, a 
sovereignist party formed the official opposition in this House. 
In addition, we were elected with the mandate to monitor as 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8018"> 8018 </A></B>
<P>
closely as possible the administration of the public interest. This 
means that Quebecers are calling for more autonomy, more 
sovereignty, more independence and, above all, greater 
transparency. They are demanding that our governments  be 
increasingly transparent and that nothing be hidden from the 
taxpayers. This is the object of our amendment.
<P>
	An end must be put to the proliferation of structures, to 
duplication and especially to cover-ups. Can it be held that the 
taxpayers or their representatives, which we are, have all the 
facts in hand before it is too late?
<P>
	Unless complete information is provided by a given date, how 
do you expect us, elected representatives, to serve the people 
adequately? Our proposal has no other purpose but to serve the 
people adequately. We cannot allow this department not to be 
accountable to the people of Quebec and Canada. Quebecers and 
Canadians alike have had it; they are fed up with paying twice 
for the exact same services, services that cost $3 billion in 
Quebec alone. Imagine what this amounts to Canada-wide.
<P>
	The requirement to table an annual report by a certain day will 
ensure that the effects of duplication cannot be concealed from 
the taxpayers and enable us to react much more quickly. We, 
Quebecers, would be much better off financially if we gained 
independence and had only one level of government. In the 
meantime, it is our duty to make sure that we get our money's 
worth. Rest assured that we will carry out our duty and demand 
that this government be as transparent as can be.
<P>
	If public funds were managed better, we could do more for 
rural regions where unemployment has taken on nearly 
catastrophic proportions as well as develop our natural 
resources better. We could take care of our own business much 
more efficiently. Never will this government accept any real 
decentralization of its powers. It is therefore imperative that it 
be forced to report on scheduled dates.
<P>
	I would just like to remind this House that the Department of 
Natural Resources has, in actual fact, been in operation since the 
summer of 1993. The provinces were not consulted beforehand.
<P>
	I will also remind you that, under the existing Constitution, 
natural resources are an exclusive provincial jurisdiction. Could 
at least the Constitution that governs this country be abide by, so 
that we can serve our taxpayers better? No, this government 
would rather continue its flag fight. It will do its best to conceal 
as much of the facts as possible. So, the requirement for tabling 
an annual report by a certain day will give us a better chance of 
getting at least a minimum of information. This is an absolute 
necessity in a democracy to account to those who have elected 
you.
<P>
	This government prefers to make its presence felt wherever it 
can, at any cost, while we are unable to react because more often 
than not, we do not have the information required to react at the 
right time.
<P>
<B>(1135) </B>
<P>
	As the Auditor General of Canada pointed out in his 1992 
report on page 342 about the Department of Natural Resources: 
``Prudence in administration requires that outcomes and results 
be scrutinized in the context of their costs to determine whether 
Parliament and taxpayers are receiving what was paid for''.
<P>
	Once it is passed, Bill C-48 would invest the minister 
responsible with the powers, duties and functions now assigned 
to the Minister of Forestry and the Minister of Energy, Mines 
and Resources. The structure being established is therefore 
quite significant.
<P>
	Our amendment, which is aimed at creating more openness 
and requiring this new or modified structure to table regularly 
scheduled reports, is totally justified in our opinion. The current 
government is hiding behind the principle of good government 
management established by the former government in 1993 as it 
sets out to create an independent Department of Natural 
Resources. The federal government is hiding behind the 
principle of good government management as it is about to 
interfere in another area of provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	The requirement to table the annual report by a certain date 
will probably bring our worst fears to light. It will become 
impossible to hide reality. This requirement will confirm that 
there is indeed encroachment and duplication and that taxpayers 
do not really receive what they pay for.
<P>
	This government is hiding behind the principle of good 
government management to create another area of dual 
jurisdiction. The first amendment we want to see adopted-and 
I hope we will have the full and total support of this House and 
the government-reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Minister shall cause to be laid before each House of Parliament, not later 
than the fifth sitting day of that House after January 31 next following the end of 
each fiscal year, a report showing the operations of the Department of Natural 
Resources for that fiscal year.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Knowing how slow government administration usually is, we 
cannot leave it up to the minister to table this report before each 
House of Parliament as he or she sees fit, as soon as practicable 
after the report is prepared.
<P>
	What does ``as soon as practicable'' mean? What does it mean 
to the government machinery? Let me tell you, Mr. Speaker. It 
means absolutely nothing. I will give you an example: I asked 
the Minister of Natural Resources for a report she had asked 
experts to write about the Eastern Quebec Development Plan, 
which should have been renewed months ago. The minister has 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8019"> 8019 </A></B>
<P>
had this report for a long time. Although I have asked for it 
nearly every day, I still have not received it. That is government 
machinery for you.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I would just like to 
remind hon. members that those who speak on these motions 
have 10 minutes. For this reason, I would ask the member for 
Matapédia-Matane to kindly conclude in a minute or two, 
because he has already gone beyond the 10 minutes allowed. The 
hon. member for Matapédia-Matane.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Canuel:</B> Mr. Speaker, I shall conclude. When there is no 
precise date, we notice that it takes a very long time to get 
information.
<P>
<B>(1140) </B>
<P>
	By setting a precise date, our amendment would enable us to 
have more information and thus report back to our constituents 
and to taxpayers, who are entitled to this information. We want 
that information and that is the purpose of our amendment.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have listened with 
considerable impatience while the hon. member for 
Matapédia-Matane weakened the case for his eminently 
sensible amendment with a lot of separatist cant and whining 
provincialism. Surely we can debate matters of this nature 
without constantly getting off track and riding that horse into the 
sunset.
<P>
	With respect to the merits of his amendment and without any 
special reference to Quebec, I agree it is not good enough that 
information be provided piecemeal by the departments to 
members of Parliament. There should be an annual report.
<P>
	The suggestion in the hon. member's amendment that this be 
in a fixed timeframe is also excellent and the Reform Party 
supports this. We are aware that there will be costs involved but 
it is important that the principle of accountability to Parliament 
be maintained.
<P>
	However, I hope that future Parliaments will not be satisfied 
with reports of the nature that I have seen from previous years 
where we are given a bunch of pretty pictures and platitudes. I 
would like to see some meat in these reports.
<P>
	However, with that caveat, the hon. member's amendment is a 
good one and we will support it.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernard Deshaies (Abitibi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to add a few comments to the speech made by my colleague 
from the Bloc Quebecois. The hon. member referred to a 
quantitative report, that is a document which would contain 
sufficient data to inform every Canadian.
<P>
	I also want to say that this report should also be more 
qualitative, or more specific. In the past, as the Reform Party 
member just pointed out, a very thick document would often be 
released but would not include truly relevant information on the 
appropriateness and the efficiency of the department's 
operations.
<P>
	Through clause 7 of this bill, the government indicates that it 
might be sufficient for a minister to table Part III of the 
Estimates, to demonstrate the good work of the department for 
which he or she is responsible. This is not good enough and that 
is why, through its motion, the Bloc Quebecois is asking that 
that clause 7 be amended to require that an annual report 
showing the department's operations be laid before the House.
<P>
	That department must have a specific mandate as well as 
defined objectives; it must demonstrate its usefulness and show 
that the budget allocated to it was well spent. Many Quebecers 
and Canadians question the role of various departments.
<P>
	Indeed, the role of too many departments is being questioned 
and, at a time when the Minister of Finance wants to cut $9 
billion from the federal budget to make ends meet, one cannot 
help but think that other departments, not the Department of 
Human Resources Development but others like the Department 
of Natural Resources, should do their part and at the very least 
justify their expenditures.
<P>
	Quebecers and Canadians have a right to ask if the budget of 
that department was really spent on valuable projects, and they 
have a right to demand that the minister make sure the money 
goes to the right place; after all, it is his duty to do so.
<P>
	The public also has the right to know if the programs which 
the Department of Natural Resources wants to develop, and 
which are the very reason for such spending, are useful and 
efficient. Consequently, we could obtain from that department, 
every year, a report on its programs and objectives, on the way it 
has tried to achieve these objectives, as well as on the money 
spent on each project. It will be possible to determine whether 
the department provides a worthwhile service to the people of 
Canada and Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1145) </B>
<P>
	At the present time, the advisability of cutting certain social 
programs is a frequent topic of debate, and such discussions are 
entirely appropriate, considering what we want government to 
do. In the end, however, perhaps a cost-benefit analysis of each 
program, and not only of the Department of Natural Resources, 
should be done for the benefit of the public.
<P>
	I think it is appropriate to require that in Section 7 of the bill, 
to minister produce, in future, an annual report to inform both 
Houses whether his department did what it set out to achieve and 
whether its budget takes into account the interests of all 
Quebecers and Canadians.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8020"> 8020 </A></B>
<P>
	There are people, including other members, who may see this 
as an additional expense. I do not agree. I think that a report on 
operations fills a need. In most cases, this kind of report is 
already produced for departmental use, in other words, senior 
executives review their programs and make recommendations 
for improvements. The same report could be made available to 
us, which means we would no longer have to wait for months to 
get information on a particular subject or project, as the hon. 
member just said.
<P>
	Releasing this departmental review to Parliament would 
enhance the quality of management in the department and 
increase much needed transparency in government. I realize that 
such action may take some political courage on the part of the 
minister, but citizens have a right to demand this kind of 
forthrightness of their minister, especially considering the 
national debt and our annual deficit.
<P>
	In concluding, I want all members of this House to realize that 
we do not necessarily want a detailed and wide-ranging report, 
because the departmental reports we get at our offices are often 
terribly discouraging for the person who has to read them. All 
we want is a report that gives us some insight into the 
government's activities and a chance to evaluate its 
performance. I think that any department that has done a good 
job of identifying its objectives and managing its current 
programs has no reason to be ashamed of publishing this 
information and should even be proud to do so.
<P>
	It is therefore entirely appropriate to amend this clause, and I 
hope that the majority in this House will agree.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Thalheimer (Timmins-Chapleau, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise to speak to the motion of the hon. 
member. He seeks to make it mandatory that the minister 
provide the reports.
<P>
	I submit that the answer is clearly there. In conjunction with 
the budget speech normally delivered in February each year, the 
President of the Treasury Board tables on behalf of the 
Department of Natural Resources part III of the estimates which 
reports on the operations of the preceding fiscal year and the 
current fiscal year and as well includes proposals for the 
upcoming fiscal year. Therefore the intent of this amendment is 
already being met by those provisions. However, flexibility is 
needed as to when the report is delivered to Parliament so as to 
conform to the budget process.
<P>
	We may ask why the obligation to table an annual report is not 
contained in this bill. Section 153 of the Financial 
Administration Act was amended on May 1, 1991 to permit 
statutory reports to be discontinued by order in council when 
they contained the same or less information as the estimates 
frompublic accounts. This provides a streamlined reporting to 
Parliament while ensuring no less information. 
<P>
	The cost savings as a result of this continuation of 23 statutory 
reports is estimated to be in the neighbourhood of $500,000 
annually. Is the tabling of an annual state of forests no longer 
obligatory? The obligation to table this report in Parliament has 
been removed. This does not preclude the minister from tabling 
a report in Parliament. In addition the report could be required 
by regulation of the governor in council. The clause as written 
provides greater flexibility for parliamentarians to request 
changes to reports and timing of these reports.
<P>
<B>(1150) </B>
<P>
	The CFS has indicated that it may be more useful to see and 
measure progress on forest management and other forest related 
issues if such reports are every two or three years. If 
circumstances require, shorter time frames for reporting to 
Parliament on specific aspects of natural resources could be 
identified.
<P>
	Changing a regulation is less cumbersome and consuming 
than changing the act.

<BLOCKQUOTE>(<I>c</I>) with the agreement of the concerned province, may make grants and

	<B>Mr. Deshaies: </B>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to seek my 
colleagues' support to amend two clauses of Bill C-48, which, I 
believe, distort the very nature of this department by not 
explicitly recognizing the overriding authority of the provinces 
over natural resources.
<P>
	First, clause 27.(2) is theoretically aimed at allowing the 
Minister of Natural Resources not to seek the approval of the 
Governor in Council when entering into contracts or 
agreements. This change is said to be in the interest of 
streamlining public service operations. Keeping in mind this 
laudable intention, let us look at the effects of the following few 
words included in clause 27.(2), page 9, line 13:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-government of any province or with any person for forest protection and 
management or forest utilization-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The words ``or any person'' cannot be legitimately included 
since only the provinces have the authority, the right to define 
their own forest policy.
<P>
<B>(1155) </B>
<P>
	Therefore, even though the legitimacy of the Canadian 
Minister of Natural Resources is very much in doubt, it is still 
important to correct those clauses having an impact on the 
provinces' authority in matters of exclusive jurisdiction. Under 
subsection 92(<I>a</I>) of the Constitution Act, 1982, natural 
resources are described as exclusive provincial jurisdiction, in 
particular with regards to development, conservation, and 
management of non-renewable and forestry resources, 
including laws in relation to the rate of primary production 
therefrom.
<P>
	These few words open a wide door to interference by the 
federal government in the area of forestry which could be 
perceived by provincial governments as contrary to their 
policies or discriminatory towards some provinces.
<P>
	The issue is not the value of the federal involvement, the point 
is to make sure that the federal government remains within its 
areas of jurisdiction. The federal Minister of Natural Resources 
must consult and obtain the consensus of all provinces before 
promoting a so-called national policy. For example, Quebec 
never signed the National Forest Strategy, therefore, the federal  
government cannot, unilaterally, intervene on its territory with 
policies, however well intentioned, actions or agreements not 
endorsed by Quebec.
<P>
	Quebec has its own forest management strategy, like many 
other provinces. Trying to harmonize the different policies is the 
responsibility of the provinces themselves. Any interference on 
the part of the federal government, if it is not the result of a 
unanimous request from all provinces can only be a source of 
duplication and waste.
<P>
	The people of Canada, like the people of Quebec, should not 
have to pay twice because of the squabbling between the two 
levels of government since the rules are clear: natural resources 
belong to the provinces.
<P>
	The provinces have precedence in the area of natural 
resources, yet, it is quite clear that the words ``any person'' put 
the provinces on the same level as any given person selected by 
the minister. It is obvious, therefore, that such equality between 
a person and a province cannot stand: these words must be 
deleted.
<P>
	To continue with this same motion, I now move on to the 
explanatory notes on clause 35, section 6, which state that the 
new section 6(<I>a</I>) provides clarification by allowing the Minister 
of Natural Resources to conduct or co-operate with persons 
conducting applied and basic research programs instead of only 
conducting such programs.
<P>
	The word ``co-operate'' seems quite appropriate in a piece of 
legislation requiring the federal government to co-operate with 
the provinces in areas of provincial jurisdiction. It seems quite 
appropriate that this clause should reflect this willingness to 
cooperate by incorporating the proposed amendment, which 
merely states that, at the provinces' request, the minister may 
recommend, promote or co-ordinate a Canada-wide policy or 
any basic research program needed.
<P>
	These few added words clearly show who should give 
directions and identify needs so that the federal government can 
be instrumental in helping the provinces in these fields instead 
of taking the lead.
<P>
	This clause should clearly reflect the federal government's 
willingness to co-operate by recognizing the provinces' 
supremacy in identifying their needs, the openness to receive 
provincial requests as an established fact, as well as the 
minister's ability to honour these requests in the provinces' 
interest depending on available resources.
<P>
	I do not want to elaborate needlessly on this amendment, but 
the federal government's willingness to co-operate should 
allow it to accept this amendment. I do not want the amendment 
to be redundant either.
<P>
	On the last point, namely clause 35, lines 21 to 39, I want to 
talk about something that reflects very well Canada's 
constitutional problems. Clause 35.7(<I>2</I>) proposes that in 
carrying out 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8022"> 8022 </A></B>
<P>
any plans coming under the Department of Natural Resources, 
the minister may-repeat, ``may'':
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(<I>a</I>) cooperate with the provinces and with municipalities;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(<I>b</I>) enter into agreements with any person or body, including the government 
of any province or any department, branch or agency of such a government, 
respecting the carrying out of those plans; and</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1200) </B>
<P>
	And third:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(<I>c</I>)make grants and contributions and, with the approval of the Governor in 
Council, provide other forms of financial assistance.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I think that these three proposals contain the seeds of 
federal-provincial disagreements on many issues.
<P>
	First, the federal government, through its Department of 
Natural Resources should, and not just may, co-operate with the 
provinces. The federal government has no legitimate authority 
over the provinces' natural resources. If it absolutely wants to 
be involved in provincial fields, it should do so with their 
consent and for the greater good of all, of course. However, 
where their resources are concerned, the provinces would 
certainly want to discuss what is good for themselves in order to 
have the program that suits them.
<P>
	Second, the federal government must not conclude any 
agreement to implement federal programs with anyone in the 
provinces unless the provinces are informed and have agreed. 
Provincial consent must be required for any private agreement 
to take effect. It is hard to imagine anyone changing a province's 
natural resource management policy without the province's 
consent.
<P>
	So, any agreement between an individual or group and the 
federal government can only be made with the agreement of the 
province concerned. Again, why duplicate and risk wasting 
money, despite good intentions?
<P>
	Third, in the same vein, if the federal government, through a 
joint policy, wants to promote a particular sector or project, it 
should do so with the consent of the province concerned, so that 
the federal government can make the grant or contribution.
<P>
	Nothing in clause 35 says or indicates that the provinces have 
priority when natural resources are involved. As the Official 
Opposition in this House, we can only call attention to this fact, 
which is not something the provinces are demanding but a basic 
agreement of this Canadian federation. Under these 
circumstances, how could we not insist that many federal bills 
or laws lack legitimacy?
<P>
	Several federalist members point out that the federal 
government must do this or that for the general welfare, without 
hurting the provinces. These members may be in good faith, but 
imagine what the federal government would say if provincial 
legislators intervened in federal programs and set conditions for 
them. The federal government would be the first to talk about 
interference and want to put them in their place.
<P>
	The Canadian system defines the roles of each level of 
government and changing them requires reopening the 
Constitution and new negotiations. That may not be a bad idea. 
The Canadian Constitution needs many adjustments. Quebec's 
idea of ``opting out'', that is, the provinces' ability to withdraw 
from a federal program with full financial compensation, is one 
that could meet its particular needs and show the ability of this 
federal system to adjust.
<P>
	For these reasons, we believe that putting our terminology in 
clause 35 7(2) would much better reflect the provinces' needs 
and the federal government should consider it an improvement 
and support it. I think that my motion as a whole justifies the 
necessary amendments to the clauses previously mentioned and 
Bill C-48 would correspond more closely to the reality of 
Canada as a result.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Serré (Timiskaming-French River, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to participate in the debate on Bill C-48 
and on the amendment tabled by the hon. member for Abitibi.
<P>
	For one year now, I have been hearing Bloc Quebecois 
members talk about duplication, overlapping, waste and the 
need to make cuts. I find it very disappointing, and also very 
prejudicial to Canada, to see Bloc members use any bill to try to 
promote their only objective, namely the separation of Quebec, 
instead of dealing with the real issues and improve the situation 
of Quebecers.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Bill C-48 amalgamates two previous departments, the 
Department of Energy, Mines and Resources and Forestry 
Canada. This is a logical and practical step that demonstrates the 
government's commitment to Canada's resource industry and to 
good government.
<P>
	I understand that the amalgamation of these two departments 
has already saved some $16 million, c'est ça couper dans le gras, 
messieurs les députés.
<P>
	In the debate on Bill C-48 it is essential that we keep in mind 
the vital contribution that the energy, mining and forest sectors 
make to Canada's economic health and to the high standard of 
living that Canadians have come to enjoy. Together, these 
industries represented $86.2 billion or 13.4 per cent of Canada's 
GDP in 1993.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8023"> 8023 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	Canada's advantage in international trade is tied almost 
exclusively to natural resource based goods. These three sectors 
provide jobs for 700,000 Canadians and sustain the economies 
of almost 500 communities across the country. In many regions 
of Canada, natural resource industries are not only the principal 
vehicle for economic development, they are the only vehicle for 
highly skilled jobs.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Energy, mining and forestry are high-technology industries 
which are essential to Canada's prosperity in the future. If only 
we can have an adequate policy developed and implemented by a 
single department, these industries will keep contributing to job 
creation and economic recovery for a long time to come.
<P>
	Bill C-48 sets out the minister's duty to promote sustainable 
development regarding energy, mineral and forest resources in 
Canada. This means that the economic, social and 
environmental objectives of the government will have to be 
taken into account in every decision related to the development, 
the management and the use of resources.
<P>
	In its quest for sustainable development, the new department 
will rely, among other things, on the work done in these 
scientific sectors. The Canadian Forestry Service, the 
Geological Survey of Canada, the Canada Centre for Mineral 
and Energy Technology, and Geomatics Canada will remain 
dynamic activity centres in the field of science and technology.
<P>
	Bill C-48 officializes the grouping of two statutes of the 
Parliament of Canada which exist, under one form or another, 
since many years. Consequently, that legislation does not in any 
way increase the power of the government of Canada. The 
duties, the authority and the functions of the Minister of Natural 
Resources will only apply to those areas that come under the 
jurisdiction of Parliament.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This new department will continue to work in partnership 
with the provinces to make our natural resource sectors both 
sustainable and competitive.
<P>
	There are many examples of such partnerships. For instance, 
the Canadian Council of Forest Ministers has recently agreed on 
a framework for future co-operation in the areas of science and 
technology, international and trade issues, regional 
development, aboriginal forestry and national co-ordination.
<P>
	In the mining sector, the Whitehorse mining initiative 
represents a valuable partnership that unites the efforts of 
federal and provincial governments, industry, labour, aboriginal 
people and environmental groups. In fact, for Canada's mining 
and mineral sector, the Whitehorse mining initiative 
demonstrates the commitment by all the stakeholders to 
co-operation and dialogue to improve the future prospect of 
mining for the country.
<P>
	On this point, I am proud to note that on September 13, 1994 
the Whitehorse mining initiative leadership council accord was 
signed in Victoria, British Columbia. This accord sets out 
principles and goals designed to assist all stakeholders in their 
efforts to ensure a prosperous mining industry that is committed 
to sustainable development.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Another of the department's agencies, the Canada Centre for 
Mineral and Energy Technology, has set up a successful 
partnership. In an editorial published on November 7, the 
newspaper <I>The Northern Miner</I> reported that co-operation 
projects undertaken by this agency positively contributes to our 
economic growth and job creation in Canada.
<P>
	Also, partnerships between federal and provincial 
governments in the goematics area allow Canada to help other 
countries. For example, last month, the Minister of Foreign 
Affairs announced new initiatives to help the Ukraine.
<P>
	Among these initiatives was a $2.3 million contract awarded 
to an Alberta company for the second stage of an important land 
registration project in the region of Kossiv, in the Ukraine. 
Following this project, private interests in this country are 
expected to be able to purchase land. This project is the result of 
close co-operation between the industry, the Alberta 
government and Natural Resources Canada.
<P>
<B>(1210 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In closing, Bill C-48 demonstrates the government's 
commitment to good government. It is a bill that emphasizes 
progress toward sustainable development of Canada's energy, 
mineral and forest resources. In addition, Bill C-48 emphasizes 
co-operation, la coopération entre les provinces, which own the 
natural resources, on le reconnaît, so Canadians can move 
together into the next century and beyond.
<P>
	I urge all members to defeat these amendments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> A point of order, Mr. Speaker. The hon. 
member for Abitibi seemed to be addressing portions of

<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The debate is on Motions

them in the interest of time. Is my assumption correct?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Yes, when we get to the 
votes, as I understand, Motion No. 5 will be voted on separately. 
The vote on Motion No. 4 will be applied to Motion No. 6. There 
will be two votes. I hope that is of assistance to the member and 
others.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am sorry to hold up 
the business of the House with my questions, but it is nice to 
know where one is going.
<P>
	With respect to Motion No. 4, the principle that the federal 
government does not interfere in matters under provincial 
jurisdiction without first gaining the co-operation of the 
provinces is a well-established Canadian custom.
<P>
	I do not see any harm in spelling this out by insisting on the 
word ``shall'' in paragraph (1)(a). It appears to belabour the 
obvious but since the motion will be voted on with Motion No. 6, 
in order to support Motion No. 6, I will support Motion No. 4.
<P>
	Motion No. 6 is an amendment that would restrain the federal 
government from entering into forest protection and 
management agreements with private entities. I hope the object 
of this amendment, although the mover did not spell it out, 
would be to restrain federal porkbarrelling. Certainly it will 
have that effect if passed. Therefore we support the motion.
<P>
	The object of Motion No. 5 seems to be to prevent the federal 
government from acting on purely technical matters without a 
unanimous request by the provinces. In a federal state this is 
absurd. The 10 provinces of Canada can never agree on 
anything. We are not talking about policy. We are talking about 
simple technical decisions.
<P>
	An excellent case can be made for reduced federal 
government in technical activities under provincial jurisdiction 
but this is a matter of policy. It requires no changes to the act. It 
only requires a change to the government.
<P>
	Therefore I will have to oppose Motion No. 5 because it is so 
couched that it would hamstring or put into a straitjacket the 
functioning of this department.
<P>
<B>(1215) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia-Matane, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I wish to commend the hon. member for Abitibi on presenting 
these amendments.
<P>
	Earlier, in this House the Bloc was accused of playing 
politics. I do not think standing on our rights is playing politics. 
I do not think talking about Quebec's history is playing politics. 
To support my case, I would refer hon. members to a federalist 
and a Liberal to boot, but a great man just the same: Jean Lesage. 
In 1960, Mr. Lesage said that resource development was 
exclusively a matter of  provincial jurisdiction and that it was 
part of the rights and priority requirements of the provinces, 
which were in a better position than the federal government to 
take effective and lasting action. That was Jean Lesage, who sat 
in this very House.
<P>
	He also said that one of the fundamental rules of our 
federalism should be that Parliament's exceptional powers 
should be just that and not be used to encroach on areas that were 
normally the responsibility of the provinces. Some people might 
say, sure, but what about the development plan for Eastern 
Quebec? Is that not a valid exception? They are right, but it 
should remain an exception, as Mr. Lesage said.
<P>
	I could also quote what was said by two of his predecessors. 
Daniel Johnson senior, certainly more of a nationalist than his 
namesake, referred to exclusive jurisdiction over the 
exploration, conservation and development of natural 
resources. I could also quote what was said by Jean-Jacques 
Bertrand. In any case, what we in Quebec want, and I hope the 
other provinces do as well, is to prevent the federal government 
from dealing directly with individuals, because when I read the 
bill, it says the federal government would be able to deal with 
the provinces or with persons. I think eventually, this would 
mean not duplication but three levels of intervention, not all of 
which would be governmental, since it would be possible to deal 
directly with individuals, over the heads of the provincial 
governments, and we object to that.
<P>
	When it talks about co-operation, the federal government 
should say to the provinces: What are your demands? What do 
you want? In that case, the lines would be clearly drawn. 
Co-operation would be on a fair and equitable basis, which is 
what we want, and that is also the purpose of the amendments we 
proposed. I hope that everyone in this House will realize that 
this is not just for Quebec and that these amendments are useful 
for Manitoba, Ontario and all the other provinces, and I would 
ask both sides of the House for their support in adopting these 
amendments.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="DEPARTMENTOFCANADIANHERITAGEACT">DEPARTMENT OF CANADIAN HERITAGE ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed from November 16, consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-53, an act to establish the Department of 
Canadian Heritage and to amend and repeal certain other acts, be 
read a second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise today to speak to Bill C-53, an Act to establish 
the Department of Canadian Heritage.
<P>
	It is a very interesting bill, except it comes at a time when the 
Minister of Finance has just realized, a year too late, that 
Canada's economic situation is unbearable, at a time when the 
Minister of Finance has just declared we should cut 
expenditures and at a time when interest on the debt has 
exceeded the GDP.
<P>
	This is the moment when the Liberal government chooses to 
establish the Department of Canadian Heritage and increase 
duplication and overlap, thus increasing expenses. Indeed, the 
Liberal government stubbornly insists on making unilateral 
moves in the cultural area in Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>
<P>
	This has been going on far too long. Enough with the 
unilateral approach of the federal government. There is a reality 
here, there is a francophone nation in Canada, with its own 
cultural values and its own language, a nation that has been 
claiming its own rights for too long.
<P>
	This House must remember all the representations Quebec 
has made over the last thirty years in the cultural sector. Since 
1966, all of Quebec's premiers have asked that the cultural 
policy and related budgets be repatriated to Quebec. All were 
unanimous in stating that the social, economic and cultural 
development of the Quebec people should be under Quebec's 
jurisdiction.
<P>
	Should I go over it again? In 1966, Mr. Johnson demanded 
decision-making authority in the area of cultural development. 
In 1969, Mr. Bertrand claimed that cultural affairs were under 
Quebec jurisdiction. In 1971, Mr. Bourassa asked for a review of 
constitutional powers in the area of culture. In 1973, he 
requested a transfer of cultural policies and budgets. In 1975, 
Quebec asked for exclusive law-making rights. In 1978, Quebec 
requested the opening of negotiations between Ottawa and 
Quebec. In 1985, Quebec was still raising the need for a 
constitutional agreement. In 1991, the Bélanger-Campeau 
Commission stressed the need to give Quebec exclusive 
jurisdiction and responsibility over its social, economic and 
cultural development, as well as over linguistic matters.
<P>
	Successive federal governments systematically ignored those 
requests. The present government is no different. Incapable of 
recognizing Quebec's distinctiveness, it tends to oppose its 
development.
<P>
	In 1994, the federal government introduced a bill, the sole 
objective of which was to deny the distinctiveness of our 
society. Yet, our society is distinct! The government is rejecting 
a series of claims.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8026"> 8026 </A></B>
<P>
	Liberal members must lift the veil covering our cultural 
reality. The bill mentions the Canadian identity, something 
based on the primary characteristics of Canada: bilingualism 
and multiculturalism.
<P>
	First of all, we have to wonder whether there is a Canadian 
culture. Is there really such a thing? I ask you! Such a definition 
of Canadian culture negates the existence of the other culture, 
the Quebec culture.
<P>
	Instead, the Liberal government should be working at 
balancing the CBC's budgets. To share the budgets fairly 
between the French and the English networks, fifty-fifty, is a 
must derived from bilingualism. Before we can believe in the 
subject-matter of this bill and in its implementation, there is 
still a long way to go.
<P>
	The sharing of responsibilities between the Minister of 
Industry and the Minister of Canadian Heritage is simply 
incoherent, a fact we have been witness to in this very House. 
Both ministers have authority in the same areas, but have 
different visions. Moreover, there is no consultation whatsoever 
between the two of them. We were given the opportunity to come 
to that conclusion on several occasions, particularly with 
respect to the information highway advisory committee.
<P>
	The Liberal government must get its priorities straight; the 
interests of the industry and those of a people, a language, a 
culture, are not the same and cannot be dealt with from the same 
perspective.
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
	It is inhuman to keep writers, creators, performers waiting for 
over six years for a reform of copyright and intellectual 
property. It is crazy to want to turn these creations into an 
industrial market. I say an industrial market, because the 
Minister of Industry prefers the American copyright system to 
our copyright and neighbouring rights system; there is no clear 
choice yet, even though the Minister of Canadian Heritage must 
favour the latter since it is the only one which recognizes 
creators' efforts and highlights culture.
<P>
	All these considerations and a lot of others, which could be 
debated for months and months, make it only more apparent that 
the bill, as tabled, does not give the Department of Canadian 
Heritage the mandate it should have. Given this fact, the Bloc 
Quebecois supports the motion that Bill C-53, an act to establish 
the Department of Canadian Heritage and to amend and repeal 
certain other acts, be not now read a second time but that the 
order be discharged, the bill withdrawn and the subject-matter 
thereof referred to the Standing Committee on Canadian 
Heritage.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to 
rise today and share with the members of this House my views 
on Bill C-53, an act to establish the Department of Canadian 
Heritage.
<P>
	It is my firm belief that the passage of this bill is essential to 
the promotion of Canadian identity and the development of our 
country. The Department of Canadian Heritage has been 
working for over a year now in a variety of areas important to all 
Canadians. It has pursued its mandate with confidence and 
success, in all its areas of activity. The bill, which officially 
establishes the Department of Canadian Heritage, is a 
housekeeping measure.
<P>
	The department works in several areas of responsibility that 
are not just important, but vital to Canadian identity. Whether it 
be in cultural development, the arts, official languages, 
multiculturalism, conservation of cultural property, national 
parks, national historic sites, or amateur sport, the Department 
of Canadian Heritage is called upon to play an essential role in 
the life of all Canadians, in all regions of the country.
<P>
	The Department of Canadian Heritage develops policies and 
manages programs the objectives of which include promoting a 
greater understanding of our diversity, encouraging the 
participation of all citizens in the life of our society and 
ensuring an increased awareness of our abundant cultural and, of 
course, natural resources.
<P>
	The department is of major importance to Canadians. We can 
all identify the various ways in which this department has an 
impact on us. All its policies and programs have a bearing on our 
daily life and our identity as Canadians. For example, the 
multicultural make-up of Canada is one of the most enthralling 
features of our society and it reflects the fundamental values of 
this country.
<P>
	This diversity that characterizes the Canadian society is 
valuable and we have every right to be proud of it. Several 
countries are attempting to bring closer together population 
groups of different ethnic, cultural, linguistic and racial 
backgrounds and turn to Canada to look at the Canadian model.
<P>
	We have built a country in which French and 
English-speaking minority communities can develop and make 
a full contribution to the economic, social and cultural life of the 
society. Linguistic duality is part and parcel of what constitutes 
the very essence of Canada's identity. This duality is deeply 
rooted in the very nature of our country. A Canada whose values 
would not recognize the importance of our two official 
languages would be unthinkable. With its official languages 
programs, the Department of Canadian Heritage gives 
Canadians the opportunity to appreciate this rich legacy and to 
benefit from it to the fullest.
<P>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
	Protection, conservation and development of our natural sites 
and national historic sites are closely linked to our national 
identity. Parks Canada, which is under the jurisdiction of the 
Department of Canadian Heritage, plays a prominent role in that 
regard. Our 36 national parks and 750 historic sites as well as 
our heritage canals and marine conservation areas are precious 
national treasures that all Canadians can appreciate. These 
illustrate the sort of cultural and natural heritage that we can all 
enjoy.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8027"> 8027 </A></B>
<P>
	Parks Canada's heritage conservation work is recognized 
world-wide. Parks Canada is leading the way in terms of 
protecting commemorative and economic unity by complying 
with international conventions.
<P>
	Obviously, the policies and programs of the Department of 
Canadian Heritage are powerful tools for promoting Canadian 
values and they incorporate responsibilities that make Canada a 
unique place to be.
<P>
	The contribution of the Department of Canadian Heritage is 
essential to the development of our country and the survival of 
Canadian values.
<P>
	I urge all the hon. members to support this bill, to allow the 
department to pursue its mission and promote Canadian identity, 
so that Canada can continue to develop in the era of 
globalization we are now entering.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
speak on this bill. I note that recent disclosures indicate that the 
Liberals plan to spend $24 million of taxpayers' money to 
establish a Canadian race relations foundation in Toronto.
<P>
	Not only will this entail an immediate cost to the Canadian 
taxpayers, but it will entail an ongoing cost. This is just the 
latest example of the absurdity of government funded 
multiculturalism.
<P>
	Hospital beds are being closed in this country. Social policy 
review is under way right now. All kinds of government services 
are being eliminated or reduced to the taxpayers. In the same 
breath we have this government telling us that it is going to 
spend $24 million to establish the Canadian race relations 
foundation in Toronto.
<P>
	Does the Liberal government really believe that Canadians 
agree with the expenditure of this kind of money for this 
purpose? Does the Canadian government really believe that the 
taxpayers of this country would ever agree to support such an 
expenditure? If the taxpayers could check off on their income 
tax returns whether or not they agree to having a portion of their 
contributions going toward this expenditure, how many 
Canadians would actually tick off the box and say: ``Yes, send 
my money to pay for this new $24 million race relations 
foundation in Toronto''.
<P>
	This is another example of how badly out of step this 
government is with the Canadian people and how badly it has its 
priorities organized.
<P>
	We are in a deep fiscal crisis in this country. The Canadian 
taxpayers know that and the government knows that. We see 
evidence of that every day. In the face of that, because we have 
this philosophical conviction on the part of the Liberal 
government that these things must be funded, they are being 
funded to the exclusion of other programs.
<P>
	In concluding my short remarks, I must say that this 
government once again demonstrates and makes it very clear to 
all members of this House and to the Canadian people that this 
entire rationale for the heritage ministry is undermined by the 
very actions that this government is engaged in even as we 
speak.
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Eleni Bakopanos (Saint-Denis, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
gives me great pleasure to take part in today's debate and to 
support the bill introduced by my colleague to establish the 
Department of Canadian Heritage.
<P>
	First of all, I want to specify that the purpose of this bill is 
essentially to grant official status to an organizational structure 
created over a year ago and to provide legal means to transfer 
employees to this new department.
<P>
	I really believe that each and every member of the House of 
Commons should realize like me that the time has come to 
straighten out the status of these departmental employees in 
order to give them a sense of belonging.
<P>
	This government firmly believes in transparency, justice and 
full participation of all Canadian citizens in our society. This 
government also believes that multicultural communities play a 
crucial role by contributing to the economic, social and cultural 
wealth of our country. The concept of Canadian identity is at the 
centre of all the responsibilities and duties of the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage.
<P>
	This is why heritage must first and foremost demonstrate the 
relationship between members of a community, as well as its 
distinct characteristics and its milieu.
<P>
	Consequently, the range of responsibilities and activities 
assigned to the Minister of Canadian Heritage under this bill is 
justified. The Department of Canadian Heritage is active in 
three main areas that have a common objective. First, there is 
the management of the natural and physical heritage comprising 
our national parks and our historic monuments and canals. 
Second, the management of programs which protect our official 
languages, promote amateur sport and ensure other cultural 
contributions that can make our society better. Finally, the 
management of cultural development in  Canada and of means 
of communication that are essential not only to preserve our 
uniqueness but also as a powerful instrument of economic 
development.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8028"> 8028 </A></B>
<P>
	Such are the functions of this department and what our 
national heritage is all about. Now I would like to examine in 
more detail certain aspects of each of these three main areas.
<P>
	Our heritage is first of all a collection of sites full of history, 
which include 36 magnificent national parks, 750 historic sites 
and nine canals located throughout Canada. This is a significant 
economic sector generating annual revenue of more than one 
billion dollars, including $275 million come from foreign 
visitors, and employing approximately 30,000 Canadians.
<P>
	A single figure speaks to the popularity of these sites with 
Canadians and foreigners: in 1992, some 27 million people 
visited our national parks and historic sites. Therefore, this 
sector is at the heart of our tourism industry and makes the envy 
of the international community, since we are at the forefront of 
what can be called ecotourism.
<P>
	The multicultural policy is for all Canadians; it is based on the 
principle that social change is needed to overcome difficulties 
and that society as a whole must assume responsibility for it. 
The diversity of the Canadian people must be recognized and 
appreciated not only by the government but also by the 
institutions, including the media, the health and education 
communities and the private sector.
<P>
	Therefore, the federal government's responsibilities in this 
area relate to human rights, equality, equity and access. They are 
aimed at eliminating discrimination and building a 
multicultural Canada that is vibrant and harmonious.
<P>
	As far as culture is concerned, the notions of culture and 
identity must be considered in the light of the new realities of 
our world if we want to have a broader and more relevant 
conception of Canada's cultural life.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	Above all, culture is a window on the world. It is not the 
business of the happy few, to use a popular expression. It 
encompasses all the characteristics that are representative of a 
community or even a country. Culture is an integral part of our 
social fabric and our identity.
<P>
	So, without culture, we have no identity. It must be 
emphasized that culture is not an abstract concept but a vital 
bond that joins us together. Canada's cultural policy was built on 
that premise.
<P>
	I will use the economic argument by reminding you that, in 
1991-92 the total contribution made by the cultural sector to the 
GDP was $22 billion or 3.7 per cent of the GDP. Moreover, this 
sector employs close to 500,000 Canadians. Therefore, it is 
fitting that the government should pay close attention to it.
<P>
	I would go as far as to say that it is more important than ever 
that the government intervene judiciously in  this sector, again 
for economic and cultural reasons. At a time when borders are 
becoming less clearly defined and it is imperative to protect our 
identity, the concept of a national cultural policy takes on a 
whole new meaning.
<P>
	After all, let us ask the question in plain words: what is the 
purpose of this government's cultural policy? It is not to impose 
actual choices to Canadians but to ensure that quality Canadian 
cultural products are available on our own market. That is why 
we must provide to our creative artists a favourable environment 
for the production of their works, and safeguard our Canadian 
culture and truly Canadian cultural industries.
<P>
	In summary, I have to say that I understand the logic behind 
the establishment of this department. It groups together the 
components of the Canadian identity and by the same token 
gives Canada a vision of its future identity.
<P>
	It is with pleasure that I support Bill C-53.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I already 
had the opportunity to speak on the amendment by my colleague 
from Rimouski concerning this bill.
<P>
	Today, I would like to expand on what I have already said and 
also remind the hon. members of the context under which I am 
examining this bill.
<P>
	First of all, the bill proposes that the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage be responsible, among other things, for cultural 
heritage and cultural industries, including performing arts, 
visual and audio-visual arts, publishing, sound recording, film, 
video and literature.
<P>
	Having said that, we must realize that the powers given to the 
minister extend to all matters not assigned by Parliament to 
other departments, and I am referring here to clause 4.(1) of the 
bill.
<P>
	The last time, this had led me to conclude that, for all intents 
and purposes, this bill gives the minister of Heritage the power 
to talk about heritage, but no regulating power, no intervening 
power, no real power whatsoever to ensure the protection of 
Quebec and Canada's values at whatever level. However, in the 
last minutes, I have been listening to my colleagues claiming 
that this bill will have many benefits for the heritage issue.
<P>
	Today, I would like to give you a concrete, specific example 
which illustrates that this bill does not address in any way the 
potential threats to our heritage. This example came to me after 
reading a recent article written by Mr. Henri Lamoureux in <I>Le 
Devoir</I>, entitled ``Indecent Proposals for Artists'':
<P>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
	``Indecent Proposals for Artists''. ``The HRD minister's plan 
stems from a desire to make the poor foot the bill for extravagant 
government spending''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8029"> 8029 </A></B>
<P>
	By the way, Mr. Lamoureux is an author, a member of the 
board of UNEQ and a member of the Quebec social 
development council. He teaches at the school of social work 
of the Université de Montréal. He also sits on the federal 
sectoral council for culture.
<P>
	You see, Mr. Speaker, now is the time to cultivate, to build 
tomorrow's heritage. But the minister of Canadian Heritage 
leaves a number of matters in the hands of his colleagues, the 
minister of Human Resources Development in particular, the net 
result being that culture and Canadian talent are in jeopardy.
<P>
	Author Henri Lamoureux says that the social security reform 
proposal put forth by the Chrétien government may well affect 
creative artists at many levels. If it were to be implemented as is, 
it would make life quite unbearable for a number of us.
<P>
	Let us try and set this in context. Creative artists are 
professionals with self-employed worker status. Bear in mind 
also that some are free lances who lend their services to 
producers for a fee. Take authors for example. In their trade, 
they have to sign contracts whereby they assign part of their 
royalties in exchange for a cut on the sales of their books. The 
sad reality is that most of them live in conditions that border on 
poverty and must rely on some other generally insecure and 
low-paid job to survive, perform their art and build our future 
heritage.
<P>
	Allow me to complete this picture by adding that in many 
cases, more often than not, they have to go on welfare, but this is 
not of their own free choice.
<P>
	So, how can the heritage minister ignore this reality? Why 
does he not have a word with his colleague, the HRD minister?
<P>
	Allow me again to quote Mr. Lamoureux, who said this: ``For 
example, how can we reconcile the need to be available for work 
with the requirements of the novel- or poetry-writing process? 
How can we allow artists to use the resources allocated to job 
training, when we know that artists will train while practising 
their art, generally among peers?''
<P>
	Allow me, Mr. Speaker, to remind the heritage minister of 
some realities he seems to be unfamiliar with. You see, reading, 
writing, observing, realizing are research activities which to a 
writer are practical, professional and learning experiences.
<P>
	The actress learning a role she hopes to play some day, 
familiarizing herself with an author, paying for dancing or 
singing lessons, learning while practising her art, is working on 
her art. To engage in these activities, artists must learn how to 
negotiate contracts, how to sell their products or services, even 
how to use computers. Artists must be versatile.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, allow me again to quote Mr. Lamoureux for the 
benefit of the heritage minister: ``The Liberal government's 
narrow economic and strict industrial vision of job training 
suggests that we as artists can expect little from this 
government''.
<P>
	That is not all, as the heritage minister should note. As far as 
their access to social programs is concerned, artists are in dire 
straits. For instance, a writer who accepts small jobs in order to 
practice her art will see her eventual UI benefits reduced in 
proportion to her spouse's salary. This is a totally unacceptable 
form of supervision not only for artists but for everyone. We 
know that, unfortunately, this measure would affect mostly 
women.
<P>
	Again, Mr. Speaker, I would like to quote Mr. Lamoureux for 
the benefit of the heritage minister:
<P>
<B>(1255) </B>
<P>
	``As for artists collecting UI benefits, how will the 
government manage the requirement to register for job training 
or retraining programs that the minister wants to impose on 
those who get so few contracts that they are condemned to 
precarious employment? Will a famous author who takes three, 
four or five years to write a novel be penalized because he takes 
short-term jobs to pay the rent, thus frequently having to rely on 
social security?''
<P>
	He goes on to say: ``The real motivation behind the proposed 
reform is to make the poorest pay for government 
extravagance''.
<P>
	My colleague from Rimouski questioned the heritage 
minister's ability to play tough with the industry minister. Now 
we have to add the human resources development minister. With 
the bill before us, we really do not have to wonder any more: the 
game is becoming quite illegal. Again, I quote Mr. Lamoureux:
<P>
	``It is not right. No more so than Jean Chrétien's 
contemptuous mantra that individual dignity is wholly 
dependent on work, taken to mean some stable, paid, taxable 
activity''.
<P>
	I would really like to appeal to the Prime Minister himself to 
support his heritage minister and revise this bill, but I fear that I 
would be wasting my time.
<P>
	In conclusion, I could not do better than to quote Mr. 
Lamoureux again: ``Needless to say, in this field as in others, 
Quebec artists will massively side with their national 
government in Quebec City''.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am happy to have the 
opportunity to speak on second reading of Bill C-53, an act to 
put into law the organization of the Department of Canadian 
Heritage.
<P>
	This bill, as previous members have stated, includes 
responsibilities in the areas of cultural development, 
multiculturalism, official languages, heritage conservation, 
national parks, national historic sites and amateur sport.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8030"> 8030 </A></B>
<P>
	I would like to address from this responsibility of the 
department two areas that are particularly sensitive in my riding 
of Broadview-Greenwood, which is downtown Toronto. The 
first has to do with cultural industries.
<P>
	I have in my riding close to 14 motion picture sound stages. 
This is where Canadians are busy working sometimes two and 
three shifts a day manufacturing motion pictures mostly for 
export, and not just the North American markets. As of just 
recently, as you know, Mr. Speaker, ``Degrassi Junior High'' can 
be watched in China. When you are in your hotel room you can 
use your channel server. There are not very many channels in 
Beijing. When a group of us went there a few months ago, we 
noticed that Degrassi was being aired in China.
<P>
	I want to talk about this industry because I think there is a 
great misunderstanding in the minds of Canadians about the 
value that the motion picture industry brings to the economy of 
Canada. Quite often Canadians will only focus on that part of the 
industry that they tend to see in lights. They tend to see the 
actors and actresses, the Academy Awards and the long 
limousines. Yet there is very little time and energy spent on 
appreciating what goes into making up that great industry which 
is so much a part of our culture.
<P>
	We are talking about cameramen and women, set designers, 
costume designers, costume makers, lens grinders, carpenters.
<P>
<B>(1300) </B>
<P>
	These are craftsmen recognized right now as being the best in 
the world. The Canadian motion picture factories are recognized 
by the Germans, by the Americans as being an elite 
manufacturing force. It has taken many years to build that 
industry in this country. It has been this department of heritage 
that has really traditionally provided a lot of the seed money that 
went into supporting the artists and the craftsmen and women 
who go together and who today have made a world class 
industry.
<P>
	I think it is important for all members of this House to realize 
that when we are speaking to the importance of this bill we never 
forget that the motion picture industries, the cultural industries, 
are a tremendous economic impact in a positive way to our GNP. 
The fact that this bill is going to make this department of 
heritage much more efficient is a credit to this government 
because with such limited fiscal resources these days we have to 
make sure that we do not do anything to diminish the support for 
this industry which is integral to the job creation commitment 
we made in the red book during the last election.
<P>
	The second part of my remarks, Mr. Speaker, is something 
that is a little closer to your heart and it has to do with amateur 
hockey. I believe that Canadians need a wake up call when it 
comes to amateur hockey. It is not just hockey, it is amateur 
sport generally. Too often in the past amateur sport has been 
taken for granted in this country and once again we are facing a 
crisis with sport  in this country. As most Canadians can see 
right now we are going to have our first ever Grey Cup final as a 
Canadian and American event. We have watched the demise of 
the Canadian Football League.
<P>
	I know that is professional but the reason I think it is 
important is that the underpinnings of whatever sport we have in 
this country at the amateur level must be sustained because 
ultimately if our amateur level is in good shape then that will 
have a profound impact on the professional experience that 
happens in our country with whatever particular sport it is.
<P>
	I would like to spend a minute or two on amateur hockey. 
More than ever at this moment in our history Canadians have to 
rally around hockey in our country because we have actually no 
set of books on what is going on in hockey. We do not know the 
number of jobs involved in Canadian hockey at the amateur 
level. We have no complete analysis of this. We have no idea in 
terms of what is happening in terms of exports related to the 
hockey industry.
<P>
	As you know, Mr. Speaker, we are in danger right now of 
losing hockey as one of our prime movers and as one of our 
prime galvanizers. Let us take for example the teams in Atlantic 
Canada, in Prince Edward Island and Cape Breton and there is 
also a team in New Brunswick. I think those teams are 
vulnerable and I think we stand a very good chance of losing 
them. I link the relevance of that to amateur sport because once 
again I think that we as Canadians have to make sure that we do 
not do anything in this country to diminish our commitment to 
amateur sport in general.
<P>
	Sometimes when we get involved in sport or cultural 
industries we enjoy them so much that we do not focus on the 
economic side of it. I believe we have always taken these 
industries for granted. If we are not very careful we are going to 
be in danger of losing these industries and the next thing you 
know, Mr. Speaker, you are going to see hockey not being run 
out of Canada, but out of New York.
<P>
<B>(1305 ) </B>
<P>
	I think one way we can ensure that industry along with all the 
other cultural industries that are part and parcel of this bill is for 
Canadians to look at them not just in terms of our Canadian 
identity, not just in terms of holding this country together, but 
also looking at them in terms of the economic impact they have 
in making sure we have a very vibrant economy for Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Glen McKinnon (Brandon-Souris, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate this opportunity. I agree with the 
comments of the previous speaker from 
Broadview-Greenwood that hockey does need some 
fortification. As a former principal of a high 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8031"> 8031 </A></B>
<P>
school in which hockey has just become an athletic sport in rural 
Manitoba, I subscribe very much to that enterprise.
<P>
	It gives me a great deal of pleasure to join the debate and 
speak in support of Bill C-53, an act to establish the Department 
of Canadian Heritage. Passage of this bill will enable the 
department to continue to successfully pursue its mandate.
<P>
	Bill C-53 is a part of a greater reorganization of government 
that will provide streamlining of services and will allow for a 
more efficient organizational structure which will prove of 
greater benefit to the Canadian taxpayer.
<P>
	Although this department has its origins in the steps taken by 
the previous government in 1993, the current government has 
improved on these changes which are reflected in the 
accomplishments the department has achieved in one full year.
<P>
	The Department of Canadian Heritage reflects the sweep of 
the new department's mandate, a mandate that includes 
responsibilities in the areas of cultural development, 
multiculturalism and official languages, heritage conservation, 
national parks, national historic sites and amateur sports. In 
these areas the department has a common objective of 
promoting Canadian identity.
<P>
	The Department of Canadian Heritage is the chief custodian 
of our natural parks, parks preserves, national historic sites, 
heritage railway sites, historic railway sites, historic canals, 
marine conservation areas, heritage rivers, federal heritage 
buildings and of course historical markers.
<P>
	These national symbols contribute to our national identity in 
many ways. They depict a diversity of cultures and natural 
environments. They are national symbols and yet they can be 
located in virtually any part of this country, urban, rural and 
remote. They are tangible links to our illustrious past and help 
us to understand where we as a people have come from.
<P>
	The traditions of Parks Canada began in 1885 and are now 
embraced by the Department of Canadian Heritage. These 
traditions will continue to protect, preserve and promote these 
natural parks and sites which are important to Canadians.
<P>
	Another key aspect to Canada's parks and historic sites is the 
importance to the Canadian economy. National parks and 
national historic sites generate annual revenue in excess of $1 
billion, including some $275 million from foreign tourists, and 
provide jobs for some 30,000 Canadians, both men and women.
<P>
	Heritage tourism in Canada is also a major job creation 
activity. Taking national parks and historic sites as an example, 
it is estimated that for every person year of employment 
generated as a result of Parks Canada expenditures, between 2.5 
in the Atlantic regions and 12.5 in the Alberta region person 
years are supported as a result of investment by partners in 
sectors directly or indirectly linked to tourism.
<P>
	A large portion of these jobs are generated in economically 
less advantaged areas of the country.
<P>
<B>(1310) </B>
<P>
	The Department of Canadian Heritage recognizes the cultural 
diversity of Canada through its multiculturalism policy. I have 
heard the members opposite denigrate the efforts of the 
multiculturalism sector of the Department of Canadian 
Heritage.
<P>
	The sector works in partnership with Canadian institutions, 
ethnocultural communities, individuals, immigrant serving 
agencies and other organizations to eliminate racism and 
promote integration of ethnocultural minorities in Canadian 
society.
<P>
	Certain members opposite would have us believe that 
multiculturalism is multimillion dollar boondoggle. However, I 
would point out that on a per capita basis multiculturalism 
grants cost each Canadians less than $1. The multiculturalism 
program has the aim of promoting equal opportunity for all 
Canadians to participate in the social, cultural, economic and 
political life of this country.
<P>
	It would be foolish to get rid of multiculturalism on the 
mistaken notion that it exists to finance ethnic folk dances. The 
aim of multiculturalism is to help immigrants fit into Canadian 
society.
<P>
	I might also point out to the members opposite that they say 
the multiculturalism model does not work. I would like them to 
become aware and consult with those Canadians who are 
grateful for the multiculturalism policy and its benefits.
<P>
	The Department of Canadian Heritage not only recognizes the 
Canadian diversity among Canadians but also our linguistic 
duality. Canada's two official languages are intrinsically linked 
to Canadian identity and culture.
<P>
	Canada's linguistic landscape is dominated by our two 
official languages, as English or French is spoken by 98.6 per 
cent of the Canadian population.
<P>
	The Department of Canadian Heritage is committed to 
supporting the development and enhancing the vitality of 
linguistic minority communities in all sectors and encouraging 
Canadians to learn their second official language.
<P>
	The Department of Canadian Heritage, with its official 
languages policies, provides funding for second language 
instruction for all provinces and territories. The French 
immersion experience constitutes the most studied phenomenon 
in the recent history of education in Canada and it is the 
consensus of experts that it is an excellent method to learn a 
second language.
<P>
	Another facet that fosters the Canadian identity is the amateur 
sports component of which I spoke briefly a moment ago, which 
is also a valued component of Canadian heritage. Games and 
<P>

<B><A NAME="8032"> 8032 </A></B>
<P>
related events like the Canada Games and the 15th 
Commonwealth Games held this summer in Victoria are a 
fundamental vehicle for  fostering and illustrating important 
Canadian values such as the pursuit of excellence and cultural 
diversity.
<P>
	Finally, the Department of Canadian Heritage has focused its 
efforts on the management of cultural development in Canada. 
The Department of Canadian Heritage nurtures and supports 
culture. It does so because it not only enriches our lives, it also 
improves the economic well-being of Canadians.
<P>
	Despite what other members would have us believe, culture 
adds richness to our lives, giving people a way to express 
creativity and at the same time creates jobs and wealth. Bringing 
the cultural functions together in a single department will enable 
the Government of Canada to take more concrete action, making 
it possible to defend the interests of cultural minorities across 
this country.
<P>
	In addition, the department is responsible for providing 
funding and encouraging cultural agencies that have a national 
mandate such as the CBC, the National Arts Centre, the Canada 
Council, Telefilm Canada and the National Film Board.
<P>
	Clearly the mission of the Department of Canadian Heritage 
is closely linked to the major issues facing Canada today. It is 
more important than ever to start thinking of the importance of 
Canada's cultural complexity as an asset at a time when 
economies are opening up in different countries and around the 
world. That is why I strongly urge the quick passage of this bill.

	<B>Mr. John Maloney (Erie, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, does a civilized 
society allow people who commit criminal acts to be exonerated 
if they are so intoxicated of their own volition as to not be able to 
form the intent to commit the crime? I think not.
<P>
	After reading the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in 
the Henri Daviault case I find that I must agree with the 
dissenting view. Although I can understand the legal arguments 
put forward by the six Supreme Court justices I do not accept 
them. I believe there is a point where common sense must be 
used instead of common law of this nature.
<P>
	It has been suggested this defence would be so rare that 
corrective measures would be unnecessary. In the two months 
since the decision there have been four successful uses of the 
drunkenness defence. The dike is about to open.
<P>
	The point is simple. Individuals are accountable for their 
conduct notwithstanding their intoxication. The message must 
be loud and clear: Drunkenness is not a defence. I ask the 
Minister of Justice to promptly legislate this common sense rule 
for the integrity of our justice system and for the good of 
Canada.

have been called spectacular, 3TC well illustrates the research 
work done by brand-name drug companies.
<P>
	This result could not have been achieved without the 
protection provided by the Drug Patent Act, which encourages 
multimillion-dollar investments in this field in order to increase 
the potential of biomedical research. Nevertheless, prudence is

commemorate Trough Day, this auspicious day when 52 
members mostly from the Liberal caucus have achieved that 
noble milestone of having served for six years. Today they are 
about to reap the rewards of that remarkable achievement.
<P>
	I must say that these Liberal MPs must be breathing a huge 
sigh of relief. Their red book promises seem to jeopardize their 
pensions, but the Prime Minister being the good guy that he is 
has come through for them. His inaction on MP pensions has 
guaranteed that the trough is in fine working order in spite of the 
red book rhetoric.
<P>
	Oh what a happy day for all the newest members of the 
pension payoff as they witness the old trough filled to the brim 
with hard earned taxpayers' dollars.
<P>
	A word of warning to our gleeful colleagues though. These 
pensions are not regarded as a sacred trust by either the 
Reformers or the taxpayers. We will use whatever legal means 
are available to dismantle the trough and end this shameful 
abuse of taxpayers' money just as soon as we are sworn in as

	<B>Ms. Albina Guarnieri (Mississauga East, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on Sunday, November 20, Canadians all over the 
country celebrated National Child Day. The Government of 
Canada designated this special day to pay tribute to children and 
everything they offer us today and in the future.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	November 20 also marks the adoption, by the UN General 
Assembly, of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. That 
convention is important because it deals with every aspect of the 
life of children and youth. It recognizes that, to reach his full 
potential, a child needs to grow in a climate of happiness, love 
and understanding. In short, the convention provides a 
framework to value and respect children and youth as 
full-fledged human beings.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I call on members of this House to join in the celebration of 
children and to think about some of the more pressing issues still 
facing children and youth in Canada. By working together we 
will realize the full potential of the convention on the rights of 
the child.

Mr. Speaker, today we have heard the need for stricter gun 
control from representatives of the Coalition for Gun Control 
and women's groups. I congratulate these groups for pointing 
out how controlling the legal acquisition of firearms is an 
important issue for women.
<P>
	According to Statistics Canada a woman is shot to death every 
five days in our country. Guns are the weapon of choice by 
husbands who kill their wives. Indeed, almost half of the women 
killed by their partners are shot and 78 per cent of the guns used 
are legally owned.
<P>

toward reducing the number of women killed by their partners.

	<B>Ms. Hedy Fry (Vancouver Centre, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is

Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Awareness month.
<P>
	Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in 
Canada today. More than 80,000 Canadians will die this year 
from heart attacks and strokes.
<P>
	CPR, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, is a simple life saving 
skill learned in less than four hours, yet less than 3 per cent of 
Canadians know how to perform it. The Heart and Stroke 
Foundation of Canada in co-operation with the Canadian Red 
Cross Society, St. John Ambulance, the Canadian Ski Patrol, the 
Royal Life Saving Society of Canada and the Advanced 
Coronary Treatment Foundation encourage all Canadians to 
take the time to learn CPR.
<P>
	CPR efforts complement cardiovascular disease strategies 
implemented under the Canadian heart health initiative. These

The Prime Minister said: ``I could have visited much larger 
countries, but I am a Liberal and I do not want to always side 
with the big ones. I like being with those who experience real 
difficulties''.
<P>
	What a nice attitude on the part of the Prime Minister towards 
a country whose population is three times that of Canada. His 
paternalistic feelings towards such small countries are quite 
something, especially when it comes to raising the issue of 
human rights. The Prime Minister expresses his democratic 
convictions much more timidly when he is with the biggies.
<P>

fraternize with several heads of state who systematically violate 
human rights, thus showing very little consideration for the

prevent a strong willed child from touching a hot stove or to 
keep a young person from a life of crime. Real consequence is 
missing from the Young Offenders Act.
<P>
	Canadians want changes to the Young Offenders Act calling 
for greater deterrentce and accountability of the offender and 
greater protection for the rights of the victim. One petition 
printed one day just over one month ago in the Vancouver 
<I>Province</I> resulted in over 13,000 letters and faxes sent into my 
office from across B.C. They were from concerned citizens who 
chose not to just read about but act upon their concerns for our 
youth.

	I am pleased as their representative that the minister has 
agreed to accept their many testimonials, letters and petitions in 
a presentation in the House lobby today.

<P>
	Bill C-41 clearly states that acts of hate shall be considered 
for additional punishment over and above the original crime that 
has been committed. In other words if the intent of assaulting an 
individual is not only to inflict pain but to intimidate others, 
then two crimes have been committed, one of violence and one 
of hate.

they led a successful campaign mobilizing public opinion 
against this ill-conceived project.

formation of methyl mercury which in turn poisons the fish and 
those who eat them.

Walsh, director of adult education at the Portneuf school board, 
one of the 52 organizations wishing to benefit from the Youth 
Service program, to ask him not to sign any agreement with 
Ottawa. This request by the Quebec deputy minister is 
disquieting because it will prevent young Quebecers from 
getting an important part of the budget of $15 million.

	<B>Ms. Bonnie Brown (Oakville-Milton, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Canadians love success stories, especially about themselves. 
That is why everybody is talking about the Prime Minister's 
trade mission to Asia. One hundred and forty political leaders 
and 350 executives created the impressive Team Canada. They 
signed almost $10 billion in contracts in China and Indonesia.
<P>
	New contracts lead to new jobs and help us in our task of 
getting Canadians back to work. But this mission achieved 
something even more impressive. It re-established an 
atmosphere of co-operation in federal-provincial relations. It 
showed Canadians that the premiers and the Prime Minister can 
work together. It showed them that federalism does work.
<P>
	Nothing succeeds like success. I for one am hopeful that this 
new sense of co-operation is the basis for future success stories 
and that Team Canada carries on.

	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister in his Liberal red ink book had 
promised to reform the MPs pension fund. While in opposition 
the Prime Minister was concerned that this issue was of such 
importance he wanted to recall Parliament to end double dipping 
and establish an age requirement with respect to the collection 
of pensions.
<P>
	Today 46 more Liberal trough feeders are joining the crew. 
The golden pension for these 46 will cost Canadian taxpayers 
almost $1 million when they leave Parliament.
<P>
	The government had to borrow $158 million to top up the 
pension plan in 1992. The Prime Minister should end this lunacy 
and live up to his promises of past and present. Regardless of 
what his 46 new trough feeders think, he should make any new 
pension reform retroactive to election day, October 25, 1993.

	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, Liberal members have decided to resurrect the 
third option favoured by the Trudeau government to reduce U.S. 
influence on the Canadian economy. The majority report's 
recommendation to make the Asia-Pacific region Canada's 
export market par excellence is the one that will be debated and 
that has been submitted to the government.
<P>
	People will start wondering why the government did not 
concentrate on developing our trade relations with the United 
States now that NAFTA has been ratified.
<P>
	My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Does he 
endorse the misgivings of his members who see trade relations 
with the United States as a problem rather than a benefit, and 
should we see this as lingering Liberal opposition to the free 
trade agreement?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, certainly not. However, everyone realizes that the 
Pacific is becoming increasingly important. At the APEC 
Conference held in Jakarta, where the United States and Canada 
were represented, everyone was in favour of free trade in that 
area, because that is where the world's population and economic 
growth are concentrated. And that is why Canada wants to 
participate. In fact, the Americans do as well. This will not 
affect our trade relations with the United States. There are 
considerable opportunities there for Canadians and Canadian 
industry. I think this was a joint decision by all Canadians, since 
nine Premiers representing three political parties were there, 
and they all agreed with our decision to take advantage of 
expanding markets in the Pacific to create jobs in Canada.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister knows perfectly well that 80 
per cent of Canadian exports, and a little more last month, go to 
the United States, while the figure for Asia is about 7 or 8 per 
cent.
<P>
	That being the case, I would ask him whether he endorses the 
suggestion made by members of the committee who, now that 
NAFTA has been ratified, recommend eliminating trade 
commissioner posts in the United States and Mexico.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on the contrary, we signed NAFTA, and I have had 
discussions with, for instance, the President of Chile and the 
President of Mexico, and in those discussions we supported the 
inclusion of Chile in NAFTA, because we believe it is important 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8037"> 8037 </A></B>
<P>
to have more than just three countries in this association, and we 
will definitely talk about this at the summit next month in 
Miami.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, we do not need good intentions. We need concrete 
action on government policies. I would ask the Prime Minister 
whether he does not consider it essential to maintain the network 
of Canadian trade commissioners in the United States in order to 
support the efforts of Canadian businesses, especially SMEs 
that want to take advantage of new markets that have opened up 
as a result of NAFTA.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Department of Foreign Affairs and International 
Trade is always looking at our country's needs everwhere in the 
world. Of course with the restriction that every department is 
facing at this time there is a review of all the posts that are open. 
We will keep those that are absolutely needed in accordance 
with the amount of money we can spend.
<P>
	There is no such proposition whereby we want to reduce the 
level of trade with the United States. At the same time we want 
to increase trade with the Pacific rim. Our economy will benefit 
through good trade relations with the United States and better 
relations than now with the Pacific where the growth and 
potential is at this time.

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, last 
Friday in Washington, the Grand Chief of the Grand Council of 
the Crees, Matthew Coon Come, continued his systematic 
campaign to denigrate Quebec in the United States, accusing 
Quebec of racism towards the Crees. In the same speech, he 
referred to the James Bay Agreement as an instrument for 
oppression and dispossession.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister    dissocate himself from Mr. Coo 
Come's  untruthful remarks? Does he intend to instruct the 
Canadian embassy in Washington to intervene and set the record 
straight concerning the Crees' situation in Northern Quebec?
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I did not read this speech by the chief of the Crees of 
New Quebec. I believe that it is not the government's role to go 
and make speeches whenever someone says something we do 
not quite agree with.
<P>
	This Cree chief makes speeches; he has opinions and he 
expresses them. This does not mean that we must agree with 
him. In a country where freedom of speech exists, all citizens 
are entitled to express their own point of view. When someone 
says things with which the Bloc Quebecois does not agree, it can 
respond. It has the right to do so. If the Liberals do not agree, 
they can do the same.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
noticed that the Prime Minister neither completely agreed nor 
completely disagreed with Mr. Coon Come. It would be 
interesting if he could tell us what he agrees with.
<P>
	Would the Prime Minister not agree that instead of hunting 
separatists, his ambassador in Washington should spend more 
time putting the facts straight, since the Cree defamation 
campaign is bad not only for the image of Quebec in the U.S., 
but also for the image of Canada as a whole?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I was saying earlier that there is freedom of speech in 
Canada as well as in the United States. No one, anywhere, is 
supposed to have his or her speeches cleared by the ambassador. 
People make speeches and if the hon. member does not agree 
with them, he can answer them. The audience of the Cree grand 
chief is known. The hon. member can write and put the facts 
straight.
<P>
	I know that Crees in Canada have many long-held grievances. 
I was Minister of Indian Affairs and I know that the citizens of 
the First Nations have been complaining for a long time. They 
did not always get justice, and they have reason to complain.
<P>
	As for his choice of words, when I was minister, I was the 
target of some inflated vocabulary but I am not the one to 
rescind their freedom of expression.

	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
today is the biggest day on the government's parliamentary 
calendar trough day, when over 50 MPs qualify for lifetime gold 
plated pensions, well over 80 per cent paid for by the taxpayers 
of Canada.
<P>
	For over one year the Prime Minister has promised to allow 
MPs to opt out of these obscene pensions and to make private 
arrangements on the same basis as other Canadians.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister agree that MPs pensions should be 
brought in line with private sector standards or not?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we said clearly in the red book that we would deal with 
some problems regarding pensions of members of Parliament. 
We talked about double dipping and the situation that prevails 
when some retire very early in life and get a very big pension.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8038"> 8038 </A></B>
<P>
	These two problems are mentioned in the red book and will be 
corrected when the President of the Treasury Board will 
introduce legislation within a month or two in this House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Prime Minister mentions correcting the age  problem. It has 
been suggested that the government may raise the age of 
eligibility for the MP pension to 55. On this basis alone, the MP 
pension would still be more generous than 99.9 per cent of all 
private sector plans.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister admit that such tinkering is totally 
inadequate to deal with the problem?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have always defended the compensation that 
members of Parliament receive.
<P>
	I understand the Reform Party believes that they are overpaid. 
I do not understand why. They look at themselves and they think 
they are overpaid.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, if 
the Prime Minister's salary were tied to the financial 
performance of the Government of Canada, he would be 
overpaid by about half a billion dollars a year.
<P>
	In recent years both the Alberta and Prince Edward Island 
governments have made significant reforms to their pensions, 
reforms that affected past members already benefiting from the 
excesses they had voted themselves.
<P>
<B>(1425 ) </B>
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister commit in principle to applying any 
reform to MP pensions to past MPs as well as to sitting MPs?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> I have to 
smile, Mr. Speaker, because some of these members were 
grandstanding when they offered to cut their pay by 10 per cent. 
Now they say that they have not received any credit for that so 
they will stop. I think they are just grandstanding again. The 
people of Canada understand that that party has been a complete 
failure since the election.

	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ): </B>Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs.
<P>
	Last week, the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs stated 
that, with only minor modifications, the facilities at Kingston 
would be able to accommodate all Canadian Forces officer 
cadets as early as next year. For this reason, he dismissed the 
proposal for a gradual transition that the mayor of Saint-Jean 
had made and that was perfectly acceptable to the Quebec 
government.
<P>
	Can the minister tell us if there is any truth to the rumour that 
the government plans to build additional facilities next year to 
accommodate some 700 officer cadets to meet the requirements 
resulting from the closing of the military college in Saint-Jean?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy 
Council for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
and Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): 
</B>Mr. Speaker, the government of Quebec keeps playing with the 
lives of members of the community in Saint-Jean and with those 
of the teachers.
<P>
	We have an agreement in hand, an agreement signed by both 
levels of government, ensuring that the college in Saint-Jean 
can survive, while the community continues to prosper. There 
are no hidden costs. All costs are in the open and there are 
substantial savings to be made by concentrating our military 
college operations in Kingston. The situation remains 
unchanged. All I am asking from the Quebec government is that 
it honour its signature on this document, which constitutes an 
agreement in due form between the governments of Quebec and 
Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ): </B>Mr. Speaker, if I 
interpret correctly what the minister said, additional facilities 
will indeed be built next year. That is what I understood.
<P>
	Does the minister recognize that, in spite of the major outlay 
of capital forecast by the government to increase the 
accommodation capacity of the college in Kingston, existing 
facilities will definitely not meet the needs during the transition 
period, while the officer cadets population is brought down from 
1,200 to 900, this being the opinion of the commanding officer 
of the Collège militaire royal de Saint-Jean himself, Colonel 
Parisien?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, all of the 
financial facts dealing with the closure of the two colleges were 
tabled at the standing committee some months ago. They were 
not challenged by members of the opposition. They were not 
challenged by other members of the public.
<P>
	There were expenditures that were authorized by the previous 
government to begin construction in 1995. These had nothing 
whatsoever to do with the consolidation of the colleges into 
Kingston but had to do with the need for ongoing repairs and 
new facilities that would have been required in any event.
<P>
	With respect to some allegations that we will have to build a 
dormitory, that is entirely false because there are enough 
dormitory beds available at CFB Kingston to accommodate the 
overflow until we get to a steady state of about 700 to 800 
cadets, which will be within three or four years.

	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, for almost three weeks now three Indian bands have 
illegally blocked the road to the Apex ski resort near Penticton, 
British Columbia. Two hundred and fifty people have been 
denied their right to work. The owners of the resort are facing 
financial ruin and the 300 homeowners in the Apex area are 
subjected to daily harassment.
<P>
	Feelings in the non-native and the native communities are 
running high and the battle lines are being drawn in a dispute 
that I fear is headed for violence. Yet the minister of Indian 
affairs has refused to act.
<P>
	Will the minister live up to his constitutional responsibilities 
and take immediate action to end this dispute peacefully?
<P>
<B>(1430 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as the hon. member stated 
this has been going on for about three weeks. The deputy 
minister, John Walsh, who is also my nephew by marriage, by 
Ojibway custom, has been meeting with senior officials of the 
band. Some proposals have been put forward. I am not at liberty 
to state what they are. I do not think negotiations are going well 
and the province of B.C. is bringing injunctive action this 
morning.
<P>
	I do not know the results of the injunctive action. My hon. 
friend and I will probably hear at the same time and we will 
know the results of the injunction later today.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, as I mentioned, this situation is reaching 
near-boiling point and something is going to happen unless the 
minister takes immediate action.
<P>
	This dispute over the Apex resort is only a symptom of a 
deeper long-standing problem. This year federal government 
funding to the Penticton Indian Band is more than $2.5 million. 
In spite of denials by the band, some of this money is being spent 
to pay those manning the illegal blockades $10 an hour. 
Meanwhile the 250 employees at the resort are paying a terrible 
price and some have to draw UI at the taxpayers' expense.
<P>
	Will the minister of Indian affairs immediately suspend all 
funding transfers to the Penticton Indian Band, as he did 
recently with the Lower Similkameen Band election dispute, 
until the illegal roadblocks are removed and the band sits down 
at the bargaining table?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, there is a man in my friend's 
riding named Tom Landecker. He wrote a letter. I adopt the 
method he is proposing. He uses the ski area. He says: ``Every 
time I do so I am reminded of the 100-year history of the 
relations between our two communities, a history littered with 
broken promises and missed opportunities''.
<P>
	At the end of it he says: ``The only resolution to this situation 
is through mediation of the provincial government''. I think it is 
appropriate and is something that is being done. If it breaks 
down then there is the recourse to the court, which is happening 
as we speak.

misconduct during the Canadian Airborne Regiment's

	However I am concerned that he seems determined to delay 
this inquiry for several months. Such a delay will inevitably

<P>
	It is imperative that all of us ensure that justice be done and 
the judicial proceedings involved with the court martials be

	<B>Mr. Gary Pillitteri (Niagara Falls, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Justice.
<P>
	The provincial government announced new measures which 
would crack down on under age strippers by fining club owners 
and having their licences suspended if they continue with their 
hiring practices.
<P>
	In keeping with the Liberal red book promise of stricter 
penalties against youth exploitation, can the minister tell us 
what he plans to do?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, like all Canadians I 
was appalled to learn that adolescent or juvenile girls might be 
exploited in these strip clubs. It has to stop. All levels of 
government have to collaborate in making it stop.
<P>
	As the hon. member knows, there are provisions in the 
Criminal Code which make it criminal conduct to present an 
obscene performance. The participation of a juvenile girl in 
such a show might itself be sufficient to render that performance 
obscene.
<P>
	I would hope that those sections already in the criminal law 
would be enforced vigilantly by the province through 
prosecutions.
<P>
	As the hon. member pointed out there are also provincial steps 
that can be taken in relation to licensing. Last, there are 
municipal zoning that steps can be taken. Working together all 
levels of government must bring an end to this deplorable 
practice.

	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the minister of immigration.
<P>
	Despite the minister's call for a judicial inquiry into the 
performance of vice-chair of the Immigration Refugee Board, 
Michael, Schelew, it looks as though it might not get off the 
ground. After the announcement of the inquiry Schelew said he 
would not co-operate.
<P>
	Given that Schelew thinks he is above the law, will the 
minister of immigration admit that the best way to deal with Mr. 
Schelew is not send a pretty please invitation to a judicial 
inquiry but send him a pink slip and immediately demand his 
permanent resignation from the board, like he did with his other 
friend, Inderjit Singh Bal?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on Friday we made public the 
fact that I had recommended under section 63(1) of the 
Immigration Act that we move to a judicial inquiry because 
enough questions had been raised about the response by the 
deputy chair and the initial report by the chair.
<P>
	The matter is now in the hands of my colleague the Minister of 
Justice. The terms of reference and the judge will be appointed 
by him. No one is above the law. We are following the law and 
we expect everyone to participate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
trust that the minister will recommend that the judge hold Mr. 
Schelew in contempt of court for refusing to appear.
<P>
	Given that the minister has called a judicial inquiry, will he 
expand that inquiry to include IRB members who have been 
artificially inflating acceptance rates? Will the minister refer an 
investigation of the entire IRB executive to the Standing 
Committee on Immigration?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, for weeks on end that party 
has lectured the House about quasi-judicial boards. Now the 
member suggests that I call a judge and give that judge 
direction. I will do no such thing. The Minister of Justice has the 
responsibility. He is a responsible minister.

	Last Friday, the defence minister touted the merits of Unisys, 
which he said was the best company in the world for providing 
computer services for Canadian frigates. From 1992 to July 
1994, defence department officials in charge of this issue 
denounced Unisys's incompetence and inability to meet the 
terms of the contract and deplored the waste of public funds.

know how many times one has to repeat answers to get through 
to the hon. members opposite. This was essentially the same 
question that was asked by one of his colleagues on Friday. I 
gave the answer.
<P>
	If the hon. member still does not accept the answer then I 
would invite him to attend a briefing to be given by national 
defence officials. We will lay out all the terms of the contract, 
how it was renegotiated, how the concerns were met. I am sure 
the hon. member then will not continue to do what his colleagues 
started on Friday, denigrate a very worthy company based in 
Montreal which happens to be in his province, Quebec.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Marc Jacob (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like the defence minister to understand that whether it is a 
Quebec company or not, if public funds are wasted, we will 
denounce it. If officials have told the department that the 
company was not fulfilling its mandate, the department ought to 
let the company know.
<P>
	Are we to understand that in order to hide this waste of public 
funds, his department has decided to remove the officers 
responsible for monitoring contract compliance?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
department did not put aside any officials. There was a problem 
with the development of the specific combat training systems. I 
explained that on Friday. It is not unusual when you are dealing 
with high tech, highly specified equipment. The terms of the 
contract were renegotiated and the first tests are under way right 
now with the Canadian patrol frigate and I do not see where any 
problem remains.
<P>
	I would invite the hon. member to be briefed by my officials 
and after that briefing I would challenge him whether he will ask 
these same questions in the House because I think he will be

Friday the Deputy Prime Minister was quoted as saying ``when 
you make policy as a government you can't make laws based on 
exceptions''. That is good advice. Perhaps she could have shared 
it with the Minister of Justice.
<P>
	The Criminal Code in this country states that people should be 
punished for rape, physical assault and battery except, it 
appears, when the criminal has had too much to drink or is too 
stoned to realize what he is doing.
<P>
	The justice minister does say he is concerned. Is he concerned 
enough to end the drunk defence now?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney

and this government is concerned enough to end it as soon as we 
can responsibly prepare a provision for the Criminal Code that 
will withstand an attack under the Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms and that will achieve the objective we all have in mind 
which is accountability in the criminal law.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
where there is a will there is a way and this government, with all 
the resources at its fingertips, could have that thing ready by 
week's end.
<P>
	The minister quickly put an end to the possibility of a cultural 
defence when he thought perhaps it could hurt his political 
career. The minister could close this loophole today if he wanted 
to.

question is for the Prime Minister. We just learned that the 
federal government is about to spend over half a million dollars 
on a series of television programs to be aired weekly to promote 
federal services, but only in Quebec.
<P>
	The Director of Communications for the Department of 
Human Resources Development said that the project has nothing 
to do with the referendum, and she added: ``We are not getting 
involved in politics''.
<P>
	If this is not a pre-referendum operation, will the Prime 
Minister tell us why these documentary films on federal services 
will only be aired in Quebec?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, over a year ago a 
communications firm approached a number of federal 
departments to suggest that with the major reorganization of 
departments going on it would be very helpful for Canadians to 
understand the range of services provided by integrated 
departments such as human resources, heritage and others.
<P>
	As a result a series of information documentaries is being 
prepared that will be shown across Canada. It will be available 
to help Canadians understand the availability of services and 
how they can effectively use them, how they can make the best 
use of the resources we have. That is the whole purpose.
<P>
	The program is being paid for out of a reallocation of existing 
communications money. No new money is being added. It has 
nothing to do with the referendum. It has something to do with 
good service to Canadians.

	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my

	As I said in my opening response, what happened is that last 
fall of 1993 an independent communications firm made a 
proposal that was originally directed toward my department as a 
way of providing proper information services for all Canadians 
right across Canada. We thought it was a good idea to work with 
other departments to provide a joint program. That program is 
now being implemented to ensure that all Canadians understand 
just what good services they receive from this government.

	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, recently the Minister of Human Resources 
Development pointed an accusing finger at the automotive 
industry regarding misuse of the unemployment insurance 
system.
<P>
	In actual fact the federal government lays off over 70,000 
persons every year at a cost of $400 million to the program; that 
is more than five times the cost of the auto industry. Yet the 
minister is not shy about pointing an accusing finger and 
singling out the automobile industry for abusing the system.
<P>
	Why is the minister singling out any specific sector of the 
economy and how does finger pointing at any specific sector 
improve the problem or help solve the problem?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we are not pointing an 
accusing finger at anybody. We are simply tabling the facts. In 
the last 10 years the frequency of use of unemployment 
insurance has gone from about 13 per cent to 40 per cent.
<P>
	I want to inform the hon. member that I had a very useful 
meeting this morning with representatives of the automobile 
industry and the unions in that industry. We agreed that it is 
something that we should jointly look at. We have agreed that 
we will collaborate and co-operate on sharing information. It 
shows that this government is interested in co-operating with 
people and working out solutions to our problems.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there are a lot of Canadians who are really distressed 
with what has happened to the unemployment insurance system 
in the country.
<P>
	It is passing strange that someone earning $20,000 a year is 
subsidizing people who could make up to $40,000 a year through 
the unemployment insurance system which has really become 
income redistribution.
<P>
<B>(1455) </B>
<P>
	Will the minister ensure in the forthcoming program review 
that unemployment insurance is returned to its original 
mandate, that is to protect employees from transitional or 
temporary harm due to temporary job loss, and remove it from 
being a make work project or an income supplement project?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, certainly one of the major 
objectives is to have an unemployment insurance system that is 
both efficient and cost effective.
<P>
	At the same time one of the most important ways of ensuring 
it is cost effective is to ensure that we use resources from that 
fund to help retrain and upgrade many workers who do need to 
face the adjustments that the work place poses, especially now 
when we are going through such massive changes.
<P>
	I simply point out to the hon. member that we have presented a 
series of proposals as to how we can use the unemployment 
insurance system to turn it into an employment insurance 
system to give people a much better chance of having the 
opportunity to be employed.

	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	For obvious reasons, this House is often preoccupied with one 
of Canada's largest provinces, Quebec, but I would like to ask 
the Prime Minister a question about the province of Ontario 
today.
<P>
	It concerns the fact that Ontario is increasingly being treated 
unfairly by the federal government with respect to the 
diminishing share of social assistance costs that the federal 
government is picking up. The federal share is now down to 29 
per cent when in eight other provinces it is at 50 per cent.
<P>
	We know why Quebec gets the attention but why has the bloc 
Ontario that is in his caucus not done anything about the way the 
federal government is treating Ontario the way it did under the 
Tories and the way it is now doing under the Liberals?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, if the hon. member would 
refer to the green paper that we tabled dealing with reform of the 
social system he would recognize that we put in that paper an 
objective to ensure a much fairer distribution of benefits 
throughout Canada.
<P>
	I have had discussions with ministers of the Ontario 
government to say that the best way that they can ensure that 
Ontario does receive proper attention is to become a part of the 
process of review. That is what we want to do. If we could have 
the full collaboration of the Government of Ontario we could 
work out those formulas.
<P>
	In the meantime I would say to the hon. member that he might 
want to direct the question that he has raised to his own leader 
who seems to be opposing the benefit it would bring, close to $3 
billion worth of jobs to Ontario in developing the Candu reactor.

<P>
	As part of these reforms, a new approach to addressing 
student needs was developed. However, as the minister knows, 
students are concerned that the new needs assessment approach 
was too harsh, that the contribution by parents was too high for 
many families and too much emphasis was placed on student 
income.
<P>
	Will the minister take immediate action to address this 
growing concern?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic

the announcement we made last week concerning the 
improvement to the student loan program was somewhat 
overshadowed by an impromptu lunch I had in the front yard of 
Parliament Hill.
<P>
	I would like to point out that the federal government has met 
with its provincial counterparts. We have come to an agreement 
that we will provide for a very different set of rules as applied to 
the existing student loan program which will allow part time 
income to be more broadly accepted, to allow parental income to 
be revised in a different way and to ensure there is much better 
flexibility.

in Brighton, close to Toronto, and the other close to Rimouski, in 
Quebec. Both could have resulted in tragedies. Luckily, no life

better protect the lives of passengers and the public?

	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr.

weekend in the Gaspé and on the route between Toronto and 
Montreal is obviously very, very concerned. The matter is under 
investigation. It is being investigated by the appropriate police 
forces and by the transportation board.
<P>
	What is very important in matters of this kind, because we are 
dealing with literally thousands of miles of rail in this country, 
is to make sure that every precaution is taken by the appropriate 
authorities and that we not raise unnecessary fears but that we do 
maintain every degree of surveillance we can to ensure that 
these very unfortunate incidents do not reoccur.
<P>
	Particularly to those people who were injured in the incident 
on the VIA line between Montreal and Toronto, we extend our 
deep concerns. I agree with my hon. colleague that everything 
that can humanly be done should be done.
<P>
	I do want to say to my hon. colleague, to members of the

of this nature it does not serve any useful purpose to speculate.

<P>
	These petitioners request that Parliament not amend the 
Canadian Human Rights Act or the Charter of Rights and

approval of same sex relationships or homosexuality, including 
amending the Canadian Human Rights Act to include in the 
prohibited grounds of discrimination the undefined phrase 
sexual orientation.

<P>
	The petitioners ask that Parliament ensure that the present

amend the Criminal Code to ensure stiffer sentences and 
mandatory treatment for all child abusers. I support both of 
these petitions.

pursuant to Standing Order 36, I have the honour on behalf of the 
constituents of Vegreville to table two petitions in the House 
today requesting that Parliament continue to reject euthanasia 
and physician assisted suicide in Canada and that the present 
provisions of section 241 of the Criminal Code of Canada, which 
forbids the counselling, procuring, aiding or abetting of persons 
to commit suicide, be enforced vigorously. The petitioners also 
request that Parliament consider expanding palliative care so 
that it would be accessible to all dying persons in Canada.

	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
pursuant to Standing Order 36, I would like to present two 
petitions today, both of which I support.
<P>
	The first is signed by over 300 constituents of Crowfoot. The 
petitioners would like to draw our attention to the fact that a 
natural and fundamental relationship exists between 
grandparents and grandchildren. However, grandparents as a 
consequence of the death, separation or divorce of their children 
are often denied access to their grandchildren by their 
guardians.
<P>
	Therefore, they call upon Parliament to amend the Divorce 
Act to include a provision similar to article 6(11) of the Quebec 
civil code which states: ``In no case may a father or mother 
without serious cause place obstacles between the child and 
grandparents'' so that grandparents who are granted access to a 
child have the right to make inquiries and be given information 
as to the health, education and welfare of the child.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="ASSISTEDSUICIDE">ASSISTED SUICIDE</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, the 
second petition is from people who believe that if section 241 of 
the Criminal Code was struck down or amended the protection 
of our most vulnerable members of society would no longer 
exist and the disabled, the terminally ill, the depressed, the 
chronically ill and the elderly would feel an implied pressure to 
end their lives.
<P>
	They therefore ask that Parliament not repeal or amend 
section 241 in any way and that it uphold the Supreme Court of 
Canada decision of September 30, 1993, to disallow assisted 
suicide.

	The House resumed from November 18 consideration of the 
motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, it gives me 
great pleasure today to speak on the social policy review. This is 
something that touches everyone. I think all of us from talking to 
our constituents know just how much people are concerned 
about this entire review that is taking place.
<P>
	During the break when I was back in my constituency, I had 
the opportunity to conduct a number of town hall meetings. I 
started on Monday with a group in an agricultural community. 
Many people came out and we had a great discussion. From 
there I went on to service clubs and a couple of other town hall 
meetings.
<P>
	In all cases the approach that I found worked was to first talk 
to people about the real financial problem in which we find 
ourselves. Most people have just a fleeting concept of what a 
billion dollars is and exactly how serious the situation is.
<P>
	To put it all into perspective, if you tell people we are 
spending in excess of $160 billion and we are only taking in 
$125 billion, they very quickly get the message. If you go 
further and say that of the $160 billion, roughly $80 billion goes 
to social services, $40 billion to other government services and 
$40 billion in interest payments, you will get their attention. 
They will have an understanding of just how real the social 
reform package is and how serious they must take it when they 
look at plans the government has.
<P>
<B>(1515 ) </B>
<P>
	I talked to a group of people who were discouraged because 
they did not get any real answers from government. Instead they 
got another discussion paper, one which gave them only a few 
highlights of what the government might have in mind three, 
four, five years, or whenever down the road. They want to hear 
some hard facts. They want to hear the suggestions that the 
government might have with regard to these changes.
<P>
	As far as the interest payments are concerned a lot of people 
ask why we would not just write off the debt and the deficit. Very 
quickly we ask them if they have any Canada savings bonds, 
T-bills or pension plans that might be part of this Canadian 
investment. They answer that they do so the interest payments 
must remain. Obviously, the single biggest threat to our social 
programs then are those interest payments themselves which we 
must get under control.
<P>
	As far as the social programs are concerned all of us value 
them as Canadians. We all feel they are an important part of 
being a Canadian. We would like to maintain as many of the 
social programs as possible but we recognize it must be done 
within our budget. I believe all Canadians know the programs 
must be changed. Ask any group. They will tell you that there 
are abuses and there are areas which have to be changed.
<P>
	Looking at the ongoing studies the one thing we have learned 
more than anything else from Alberta is that you have to take 
action; you know what you have to do and you do it and then you 
show people how it will benefit  them. It seems the longer we 
study something the longer it is put off. The longer it goes on and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8048"> 8048 </A></B>
<P>
on the less likelihood there is we can ever change it. There have 
been enough studies and enough input. Everybody knows about 
the problems and abuses. It is time to get on with the necessary 
changes.
<P>
	I would like to quickly look at some of the areas of our social 
safety net and examine them briefly as to what some of the 
problems and possible solutions might be.
<P>
	Certainly from the standpoint of OAS it is rather dangerous to 
say that we are going to cut pensions. When we approach it by 
asking whether those over 65 earning a family income of over 
$54,000 need to get OAS, most will answer that no, they really 
do not need it. In other words, while the idea of universality is 
very nice, it is something we cannot afford any longer. If people 
understand that, they are prepared to accept that as their portion 
of the cut.
<P>
	We must also remember that in the next 15 years the number 
of people over 65 will increase by 40 per cent and the burden on 
others will be unbearable. Obviously we have to come back in 
terms of pensions and seniors and promote everything we can to 
help people realize they have to take care of themselves.
<P>
	We have to show them that RRSPs are the way to go. Certainly 
taxing them will be the most disappointing, negative and 
reactionary thing that could ever happen from this House. We 
cannot let that happen because it flies right against people taking 
care of themselves.
<P>
	Let us look at the Canada pension plan. When it was started in 
1965 we were basically told: ``Give your money to government. 
Government knows how to take care of it for you better and will 
guarantee the return of this money when you retire''. I was one 
of those people just starting in the workforce. I was told that I 
should give my money to the government, that it would take care 
of it and guarantee a pension to me.
<P>
<B>(1520) </B>
<P>
	It was an insurance plan but now people are saying: ``Let us 
take care of our own pension plans, but obviously we want back 
what we paid into Canada pension''. Remember there is an 
unfunded liability of close to $500 billion. It is like the airlines 
with their frequent flyer points. Those are real liabilities. 
Whether you like it or not those are going to come back to haunt 
future generations. We must address the problem of Canada 
pension self-sufficiency.
<P>
	Of course UIC has major problems. Again, I do not know 
many who would not tell you they have a problem with UIC or 
that they know somebody who has had a problem with it. All 
kinds of things crop up: seasonal workers, false claims, abusers, 
people who lie and cheat with regard to claiming UI. There are 
no free lunches. We have to change the attitudes of people 
toward this whole program. It has to be an insurance program, 
one that is there for between jobs, not instead of jobs. All of  us 
have said that. We are going to have to act on that and very soon.
<P>
	What concerns me most in this House is that I hear a minister 
who sounds almost like a 1970 socialist and believes in a utopia 
out there where everybody can have everything they want and 
somebody will pay the bills. That somebody is finally not going 
to appear. We are going to have to look at this from a real solid 
standpoint. We have studied it enough. Let us fix the problem. 
Let us not study it any further.
<P>
	What kinds of things can we do? The first is to provide more 
jobs. We need more jobs in our society so that we do not have to 
depend on things like UI. How are we going to do that?
<P>
	First we are going to lower taxes. We can lower taxes and 
reform the whole tax system and look at a flat tax. If the system 
is considered to be more fair, more people will be providing 
jobs, there will be more small businesses and the whole system 
should improve dramatically in the area of jobs.
<P>
	We must break down the existing interprovincial trade 
barriers. We lose some $6 billion a year just from 
interprovincial trade barriers. Those are negative to jobs and 
negative to getting this whole economy rolling and not so 
dependent on UI.
<P>
	We have to destroy the massive bureaucracy. If you visit 
companies in any area of Canada you will find they have one or 
two and sometimes three levels of management, but they never 
have six, seven or eight levels of management as you find in the 
bureaucracy. We have to get some efficiency into our system. 
Obviously as a result of seeing that businesses will say that now 
that we have our act together the jobs will come.
<P>
	We have to break down the regulations governments seem so 
set on putting into place. Of course above all we have to destroy 
the underground economy which saps dollars from our entire 
system of our social safety net. I come back to tax reform and a 
flat tax system. If people saw a fair tax system they would not 
mind paying the tax. It would be lower and they would not need 
to be part of the underground economy. Things like the GST 
have driven people to become criminals. That will continue 
unless there is a massive reform of the tax system.
<P>
	We need to look at self-funding of the whole UI program. It 
should never have to depend on government. It should be a 
temporary program. Above all, we can certainly consider the 
concept of working for UI. I do not believe UI is something 
someone should expect. People could easily work for it and it 
would then start to mean something.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8049"> 8049 </A></B>
<P>
	We must lower federal taxes. We must return a lot of the 
programs to the delivery level which is at the provincial and 
municipal levels of government.
<P>
<B>(1525 ) </B>
<P>
	Let us look at the fourth area, social programs and the welfare 
area. There will always be people in our society who need help. 
The problem is that number has grown. It is like the Australians. 
For so many years they brought their young people up to say: ``I 
do not mind going on pogey. It is expected of me and I can enjoy 
the beach''. We have to change the atmosphere and environment 
which creates that sort of thinking. Everyone knows about the 
abuses. It is the government's job to provide an environment in 
which jobs can be provided for the people.
<P>
	Through our education system we must provide the pride of a 
work ethic and certainly in some cases even prime the pump 
through training. Above all we have to get people off the dole 
and out working with some pride for their country.
<P>
	On the health care system Canadians want the very best. If 
there is one area we really do not want to sacrifice that certainly 
would have to be it. I do not believe we need to sacrifice it. It 
seems so often when we downsize in the health care system we 
go after the beds and the nurses instead of going after the other 
end. A great deal of savings could be had from looking at the 
administration end of things rather than the other end.
<P>
	Post-secondary education is our future and another area we 
cannot sacrifice. From working in the foreign affairs area many 
of us realize what we have in terms of our advanced education 
system. It was probably best brought home to me this summer 
when I was visiting with Swedish businessmen in Stockholm, 
Sweden. They said that over the course of the last three years 
they had hired 700 Canadian graduates to work in Swedish 
invested companies in Canada. They said that they would 
always hire Canadians over Americans or anybody else because 
of the training and reliability of the Canadian graduate. That is 
something we should be proud of.
<P>
	For the last seven years the Reform Party has had the voucher 
system as part of its program. This system should be examined 
and looked at. It might not be the answer to everything but it 
should at least be looked at as another way to provide some 
accountability in our advanced education institutions. There 
should be some competition for the students. It is a more 
positive system if students are controlling that through 
vouchers.
<P>
	Again we come back to the top heavy nature of 
administration. I am sure that in examining our educational 
institutions savings can be made and efficiencies can be found.
<P>
	In conclusion, instead of carrying on more and more studies, I 
say for the hon. member across the way that he missed my 
portion on the flat tax-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> I watched it on 
television.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Red Deer):</B> Certainly we need to have that flat tax 
system. We do not need to study it any more. We need to change 
our UI system. We do not have to study that any more. We need 
to change and reform these systems, but we do not have to study 
any longer. We need action.
<P>
	There are 295 MPs who can bring here the words of their 
constituents through town hall meetings. We do not need to have 
high priced studies nor listen to a bunch of special interest 
groups and academics tell us how to do things. The people will 
tell us how to do things. It is the job of the 295 MPs to get out 
there and find out about it.
<P>
	There is a questionnaire from the Minister of Human 
Resources Development. That is a pretty good item. The only 
thing is we can predict every single answer we are going to get 
because we have already done that.
<P>
	Above all we need to destroy party discipline in this House. 
We need to go to a free vote system whereby we can really get 
into voting the way of our constituents. Rather than sending 
people across this country at a cost of $800,000, $1 million or 
whatever, we have the information and we know what people 
want. Now is the time to act on it. In terms of social reform, that 
is what I encourage the government to do more than anything 
else.
<P>
<B>(1530) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I wish to congratulate my colleague from Red Deer. I 
found that his remarks other than the free vote remark were very 
well thought out.
<P>
	It is a pleasure to see that everyone in this House has taken 
this issue of social security reform seriously. It is very important 
for Canadians to see that.
<P>
	I have a question for the member, a very serious question 
coming out of his remarks that I would like him to consider. He 
mentioned in passing that he thought that the delivery of 
programs should be downloaded to the provinces rather than the 
federal government.
<P>
	I just wish to say that I had trouble with that. I know it is the 
Reform Party platform point but I have trouble coming from 
Ontario where I am not entirely satisfied with the way the 
Ontario government handles education for example.
<P>
	There is a lot of unevenness in the way various provinces 
handle various programs. I would like him to consider that. Does 
he not think that actually it is preferable and more efficient if the 
federal government keeps as many programs as it can to itself 
and make them more efficient rather than relying on the 
provinces to do so?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8050"> 8050 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Red Deer):</B> Madam Speaker, the point that I 
would really like to make about offloading from the federal 
government is getting down to the actual delivery level, 
particularly in some of the areas like welfare.
<P>
	Those sorts of areas lend themselves probably the best to 
getting them down to the very delivery levels themselves. 
Obviously that means that the federal government has to give up 
something. It has to give up the collecting of that money to the 
level that is providing the service. As so often would happen, we 
would not want to go that step. We would just want to give them 
things to do to keep the money for ourselves. That will not work, 
obviously.
<P>
	They can feel part of it by cutting out those tiers of 
administrators. So often we have that. In Ottawa they think they 
know how to do it this way and that message then comes down to 
the province and the province then translates it to its particular 
political bent. Then it goes down to the municipality and it 
delivers the service.
<P>
	By the time one gets all that bureaucracy, one has lost the 
efficiency, lost the true delivery to the people. That is what I am 
getting at. I can understand the member's point. Certainly some 
provincial governments are less desirable than others and that 
would be a concern but I guess we have to trust the people to 
simply replace that government if that were the case.
<P>
	I would much rather trust the local officials to deliver than I 
would somebody here in Ottawa.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, it is nice to have you back 
here in the House. We have not seen you for a while.
<P>
	I would like to begin by reading from the conclusion of this 
working document that was given to us by the Minister of 
Human Resources Development. It is the chapter entitled 
``What can be accomplished by reform?''.
<P>
	The purpose of this paper is to stimulate interest and debate 
among Canadians over the coming months about how together 
we can reform one of our great national institutions, the social 
security system.
<P>
	It is a system, a set of programs and services that reflects the 
best of who we are, our compassion for those less fortunate in 
our society and a commitment to equality of opportunity and our 
belief in the dignity of work.
<P>
	As times change, so must our institutions. Without exception 
provincial governments have recognized this and many of them 
have launched discussion papers of their own, setting out reform 
priorities. This is the federal government's contribution.
<P>
<B>(1535) </B>
<P>
	I want to congratulate the Minister of Human Resources 
Development for undertaking such a comprehensive push on 
reform to our social security system. I believe, quite frankly, 
that very few men or  women in this House could actually take 
this challenge on other than the minister. I say that because I 
think most members of this House and most people in the 
country who know the minister realize that his history, his 
tradition in public service over the last 25 years has 
characterized him not only as a strong Canadian nationalist but 
also as someone who has always been there for the most 
disadvantaged in our communities.
<P>
	I can remember in the last government when we were in 
opposition whenever the minister would speak it would drive the 
Conservative Party nuts because many viewed his vision, his 
feeling, his caring for the country as a sort of radical left 
position. I never viewed his position as radical left. It is very 
important that someone who has won the trust of our 
communities in caring for people who are disadvantaged lead 
this charge. This is a very comprehensive review.
<P>
	We are talking about reviewing a program of reform that is 
almost $39 billion in taxpayers' money. We are talking about the 
Canada assistance plan of $8.2 billion; the Canada student loans 
program of $.5 billion; the post-secondary education 
established programs financing of $6.1 billion; the UI 
administration of $1.2 billion; UI maternity, parental adoption 
and sickness, $1.7 billion; unemployment insurance regular 
benefits, $12.4 billion; employment programs for 
developmental uses, $1.9 billion; employment programs 
consolidated revenue fund, $1.4 billion; vocational 
rehabilitation for disabled persons, $.2 billion. That is a total of 
$38.7 billion.
<P>
	Obviously I cannot in this short time take on every aspect of 
this particular reform initiative. I would like to address my 
remarks to a very special, very tight area of this debate, women 
in poverty.
<P>
	All the statistics of children in poverty and women in poverty 
have been talked about in the last few months before this House. 
I believe it is incumbent upon all of us who are involved in this 
creative exercise of reform to really make sure that when the 
recommendations for renewal come forward at the end of this 
debating exercise, we make sure we have the most enviable 
program in the world for women who are involved at the lower 
end of the income spectrum.
<P>
	We cannot miss this opportunity. I say that because I believe 
that women in the entrepreneurial sense and in the business 
sense are one of the great untapped markets of opportunity to 
help revitalize the economy of this country, and in so doing 
bringing dignity not only to themselves but to their own 
families, especially their children.
<P>
	I want to remind colleagues in the House about something that 
is happening in the United States right now. Women owned or 
partnered businesses in the United States are employing more 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8051"> 8051 </A></B>
<P>
Americans today than all the Fortune 500 companies combined. 
That is a staggering statistic.
<P>
<B>(1540 ) </B>
<P>
	The force of women in the United States is becoming a 
recognized fact. I do not believe that it has hit the consciousness 
of this country yet or sunk in to all of us in this Chamber who are 
presently charged with redesigning the social security system.
<P>
	As the minister has asked us for ideas during this debate, I 
would like to present the idea that we consider as a Chamber and 
as a government to set up women in business centres all across 
Canada. I am talking about centres the purpose of which would 
be to offer women training and support in developing 
businesses. We are talking about centres that would facilitate 
access to capital for women in business, centres that would be 
test sites for innovative, educational and technological efforts. 
These centres would also act as a catalyst for business and 
entrepreneurial opportunity. It would ultimately improve the 
business and entrepreneurship capability in Canada.
<P>
	I have to talk about a personal experience for a moment that is 
driving me in this direction about women in business. My 
grandmother was a widow at age 48. She had 14 children but at 
age 48 she still had eight of those children at home. Four of her 
sons had gone off to join the RCAF, one of them being my father.
<P>
	This single mother was left with eight children at home. We 
are talking now about the early 1940s. She had a small, home 
based business. It was a very simple business. She rented tables 
and chairs for banquets, weddings and social functions. My 
grandmother managed, because of her own creativity and her 
hard work, to raise that family of eight children under her roof 
and to provide a respectable living for all of them. As time went 
on she eventually developed the business and it grew into 
something that looked after many other families other than her 
own children.
<P>
	My point in bringing this example up is that this happened at a 
time when there was absolutely no unemployment insurance and 
no welfare system. There was no social security system to look 
after a single mother in the early 1940s who had eight children. 
They had to use their own creativity, their own work ethics and 
had to rely on their friends and neighbours. Certainly there was 
not a lot of support from the banks for a widowed mother with 
eight children. That just was not part of the scene in those days.
<P>
	That example of what an individual can do under great stress 
for me has always been testimony that if there is a will there is a 
way as long as there is some kind of support system from your 
friends and community.
<P>
	I think what the minister of human resources is saying to us in 
this debate is that defending the status quo which is not working 
is not in the cards and by wanting to defend the status quo we are 
defending a decline, not to mention the fact that we are spending 
almost $40 billion a year and we are not getting the results.
<P>
	When we go through this exercise we have to look at every 
idea presented to us. I use as an example my grandmother who 
was a single mother with eight children at home. She built a 
family business from her home with no government grants, no 
support. It shows me that if we give a little bit of support to 
women in business throughout the country, we can probably get 
a lot more Canadians working. The most important thing is to 
raise the standard of living of a lot of women who are currently 
trapped in a welfare system that is certainly not working. It is a 
system that none of us in the House wants to defend.
<P>
<B>(1545) </B>
<P>
	I welcome the opportunity to participate in the debate. It is a 
comprehensive challenge that the minister has placed before us 
but if we use the premise that we put all of the ideas on the table 
and keep an open mind concerning those ideas, then I believe at 
the end of this exercise we can create a new social security 
system that will be the envy of the world.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
also glad to see you again. We did not forget you while you were 
away.
<P>
	I listened very carefully to what my colleague had to say. Of 
course, in 15 or 20 minutes, he could not touch on all the various 
aspects. Given the examples he used concerning the family, the 
underprivileged women and all the problems he mentioned, I 
would have liked to hear his views on education.
<P>
	Unemployment is the big problem. It is an economic problem 
and we have to pay for it. Unemployment causes other problems 
to develop. For example, our youth are faced with problems like 
dropping out of school, drug and alcohol abuse, and so on. In the 
reform currently under review, we are being asked to reconsider 
student loans. I, for one, say that education is the cornerstone of 
the whole system.
<P>
	If we do not invest in areas like human sciences, where we 
should inject a lot of money into research and development 
when, in fact, we are cutting research, if, as I said, we do not 
give education all the tools needed to catch up in this area and to 
undertake important research projects, we are heading not only 
for bankruptcy, but for real chaos.
<P>
	I would like my colleague to comment on these cuts in 
education and research and development, which the government 
wants Canadians to swallow.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
would like to begin by thanking the member for his question.
<P>
	As I stated in my opening remarks, the minister responsible 
for human resources is calling for a debate where we advance 
ideas on how we can take the current $38 billion expenditure and 
redesign it in a way that we can get a better bang for the 
taxpayers' buck.
<P>
	I believe that education is paramount in this debate. No one is 
questioning that. In fact there are no further cuts. It is a redesign 
of the current system.
<P>
	I share the member's view. Education is something to which 
we must continually commit ourselves and of course the R and D 
that the member mentioned as well.
<P>
<B>(1550 ) </B>
<P>
	In order to make sure that the resources are there, to make sure 
our educational system can handle not only the R and D aspect 
but also make sure that our younger people have access, we have 
to create an economy where they have income so that they can 
afford to pay for their tuition rather than take student loans. The 
greatest problem that our young people have had, especially in 
the last three years, is they have not been able to get decent work 
to pay for their university education. The whole economy has 
been flat.
<P>
	The member knows full well that if we can create a more 
vibrant economy where younger people can get work it does not 
take long for a student, working part time and in the summer, to 
raise $6,000, $7,000 or $8,000 a year which goes a long way 
toward paying for his or her education.
<P>
	We are going to have to put more emphasis on the macro 
economy rather than just the old system where we would 
automatically write cheques.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Vaudreuil, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
listened with great interest to my colleague's comments.
<P>
	I want to state categorically that the question of status quo is 
not only unique to Quebec, as I found from travelling with the 
pre-budget consultation hearings on the finance committee. It is 
a preoccupation throughout Canada from one coast to the other.
<P>
	I would like to bring to the attention of my hon. colleague two 
valid ideas that surfaced from a workshop in my riding this week 
on the reform of human resources. One was that small business 
people who are unemployed and try to start up a business find 
that they cannot collect unemployment insurance. The 
suggestion was brought forward that perhaps a person who is on 
unemployment insurance should be allowed to collect their 
benefits at the same time as starting up a business.
<P>
	The other question I would like the hon. member to comment 
on is this. He mentioned the need for assistance for women in 
business. Another suggestion from our workshop was that the 
older group, the 55 year plus, have a wealth of experience and 
cannot find jobs. They would be willing to work 5 to 15 hours a 
week to help the women that he mentioned and youth who want 
to start up small businesses. Could he put in his idea the concept 
of allowing older people to give the benefit of their experience 
to the young and the women to start up their businesses? Could 
he not consider these two ideas in his proposal also?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
want to say to my colleague this is when a debate becomes most 
enjoyable. We are advancing ideas. We are building on ideas.
<P>
	The idea of taking a counsellor assistance program, not unlike 
the one in the Federal Business Development Bank, and 
marrying that with the youth and my pet project, women in 
business, is a great way to go. That is a way of using up the great 
wisdom and experience that exists from people who have taken 
perhaps early retirement from a 70 to 80 hour a week job but 
want to only work 10 or 12 hours a week.
<P>
	I would certainly support that idea. It is a great one. That is the 
kind of thing I believe our minister needs to hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
appreciated the hon. parliamentary secretary's comments, 
especially with regard to his grandmother and the eight children.
<P>
	I have two questions stemming from that. The first one is a 
question on welfare and whether he thinks there is a possibility 
that had welfare, as it is now, been available to his grandmother 
that instead of finding her own way she might have gone on to 
welfare and become a burden to taxpayers. That is the first 
question.
<P>
<B>(1555 ) </B>
<P>
	The second question is about programs for women. Had it 
been your grandfather with the eight children in the same 
situation, the same difficulty, would he have been any less 
deserving than your grandmother?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Madam Speaker, first 
I want to answer the question about welfare.
<P>
	I knew my grandmother because she looked after me. 
Probably she would have figured out a way to avoid the welfare 
option. However that is my own declared bias for my 
grandmother. Maybe she could have fallen into that trap as well.
<P>
	That is one of the real problems we have in our society today. 
The system is set up in such a way that it becomes the thing to 
do, and people are not challenged to their depths in terms of their 
work ethic or their creativity. We have to redesign this program 
in a way that the basic inner strength of people, their creative 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8053"> 8053 </A></B>
<P>
skills and work  ethic are maximized. By changing the welfare 
system that will happen.
<P>
	As to the second question, I do not differentiate because we 
are all equal. However society is much more receptive to men 
who are involved in the business realm than women. As a 
government we have a chance to do something unique in this 
mandate by moving women in business from the back burner to 
the front burner. If we were a House of Commons that did that, it 
would be one of the great experiences we could leave this place.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to take part in today's debate on the social programs 
reform. I did not think this issue would show up so soon on the 
Order Paper, but I am glad it did, because I spent last Thursday, 
November 17, working with my riding assistants to organize 
public hearings, since I feel that the Gaspé constituents will be 
hard hit by the measures proposed in the social reform.
<P>
	So, along with my assistants, I decided to hold public 
hearings, because the closest the Parliamentary Committee will 
come to my area is Rivière-du-Loup, a one day journey away. 
As you can understand, my constituents wanted to be heard on 
this issue. However, because of the distance, few will able to 
make it to Rivière-du-Loup on December 11.
<P>
	I organized these hearings with the firm belief that this social 
programs reform is such a crucial issue that it goes beyond 
partisanship. With this in mind, and that will make some of the 
members opposite smile, I asked the director of an hospital 
centre, a known Liberal, as well as a former PQ minister and 
MNA for Gaspé, to give me a hand. With these two 
commissioners on board, we heard something like 18 witnesses, 
including representatives of at least 16 social organizations.
<P>
	If only to pay tribute to these people, since this had to be 
organized rather quickly because I also thought crucial to start 
the discussion in my constituency, I would like to mention them 
in this House.
<P>
	So, the following have made themselves heard: the Regional 
Municipality of Côte de Gaspé, the Gaspé Chamber of 
Commerce, CRCD, the concertation committee of the Regional 
Municipality of Parbock, the Regroupement contre 
l'appauvrissement dans l'est du Québec, the United Church, 
CASA, the Anglophone Social Action Committee, the 
Ralliement gaspésien et madelinot, the Anse-à-Valleau 
Development Committee, the Denis Riverin Unemployment 
Action, the Regional municipality of Parbock Work Action, the 
Gaspé CNTU, the Association des capitaines propriétaires de la 
Gaspésie, the Regroupement des pêcheurs professionnels du sud 
de la Gaspésie.
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	We also heard from Rural Dignity and the Regroupement des 
femmes and others whose name I forget. These are either 
regional or local groups and this was reflected in their 
comments. But they are all wondering if after the reform 
proposed by the minister the safety net which we have now in 
Canada will still suit Gaspé constituents. Madam Speaker, allow 
me to state at the outset that people are very sceptical about that.
<P>
	I would like to state a few facts. First of all, people from the 
Gaspé Peninsula know how to read. They heard about the leaks 
in the <I>Toronto Star</I> regarding the possible cuts of $7.5 billion 
and another $7.5 billion that would accompany this reform. 
Every time they were questioned about their briefs, they would 
talk about these cuts. They would tell us also that, from their 
viewpoint, the objective of the reform is not to improve 
assistance to the needy, but rather to cut assistance to the 
disadvantaged. To them, it is absolutely inconceivable.
<P>
	Some facts about our riding are in order. As I have already 
mentioned to the Minister of Human Resources Development, 
the riding of Gaspé receives approximately 27,000 
unemployment insurance applications a year. About 33 per cent 
of those applicants have worked only 10 or 11 weeks. It is not 
because they do not want to work longer. There are no jobs. Our 
region has to live with the seasons.
<P>
	If I look at the situation in some areas in particular, in the 
Chandler area for example, 38 per cent of UI applicants have 
worked only 10 or 11 weeks. These figures were provided to me 
by the employment centres for the Gaspé Peninsula and the 
Islands. In the Magdalen Islands area, and my colleague 
opposite can correct me if I am wrong, close to 40 per cent of UI 
applicants have worked only 10 or 11 weeks.
<P>
	I used to work for the fishing industry, representing 
fishermen, and I wonder where these people could go to work 
more weeks, especially considering the fact that this resource 
has been scarce. When the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans 
declares a moratorium on fishing, his goal is the conservation of 
stocks, but the Minister of Human Resources Development is 
telling us we should be working more. In the Madgalen Islands 
and the Gaspé Peninsula, our economy is seasonal in nature. 
Tourism is a seasonal industry, although we have started to take 
action in order to extend the season. We have yet to reap the full 
results of those measures and reach our ultimate goal, which is 
to have people work during at least six months each year in 
viable businesses.
<P>
	Forestry workers would also like to work more. The problem 
they face is winter conditions. When winter begins, at about this 
time of year, at the beginning of December, there is already a fair 
amount of snow high up in the mountains beyond 
Sainte-Anne-des-Monts. It is very difficult to work in the 
snow, not onlybe-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8054"> 8054 </A></B>
<P>
cause of the cold, but also because it is hard to haul the timber 
out.
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
	Of course, we could use heavy equipment, but it gets 
expensive for businessmen to clear bush roads every time there 
is some timber to haul out whereas, during the summertime, 
roads are always open and accessible. Springtime conditions are 
no better. It is hard to work in the bush when the snow is melting. 
When you are using a chain saw, you need to have your two feet 
on solid ground. There is also the haulage problem, which can be 
serious in the spring.
<P>
	I have already dealt with fisheries, but I could add the 
example of lobster fishing. The data on resource preservation 
show that, for as long as I can remember, at least since the 
beginning of the 1970s, lobster fishing has been limited to ten 
weeks. The resource itself makes it impossible to fish for a 
longer period. Around the Gaspé Peninsula, they go lobster 
fishing from Mother's Day to the beginning of July. In 
Nova-Scotia, they go a bit later. For example, some areas are 
still open around Nova Scotia. However, the resource is subject 
to a limit of ten weeks.
<P>
	How can we find a way for these people, who have a highly 
specialized job, but one which does not provide them work for 
any longer than that, to continue to earn a living? In the past, 
they used to rely on cod fishing, but there is no more cod to be 
caught. We worked with these groups in order to create other 
projects for them to start fishing other species and diversify, but 
it is not an easy task. The first years when you start working 
under a federal program made mostly for shore workers, there 
are no incentives that would allow for a lucrative kind of fishing 
to emerge, such as soupfin shark, or spiny dogfish as we call it in 
my region.
<P>
	However, I will admit this is a remarkable effort and I know 
the people opposite in the government co-operated. I hope we 
will get the same kind of co-operation next year and the 
following years. The Gaspé Peninsula needs tools like this. It is 
not because we did not reach the objective this year that we 
should forgo the experience next year. On the contrary, we 
should profit from what we have learned this year.
<P>
	I am going from one subject to another, but I would like to 
mention some other points. First, I am somewhat moved by this 
because life in that region flows with the seasons. We need this 
form of support. If we want to do without social programs like 
unemployment insurance, the question is: Are you people 
listening to us this afternoon willing to pay two, three, four 
times what you are paying now for your seafood? Maybe you 
are, maybe not. One thing is certain, we will have to be given 
time. What we want are the tools to give more responsibility to 
people in the industry. Marketing tools, of course, but also tools 
to clean up the industry, in particular as regards incidental 
captures.
<P>
	Last spring I attended hearings where I heard a number of 
groups from the Atlantic region. Whether they were from 
Quebec, Nova Scotia or Newfoundland, people wanted to be part 
of the discussions on their future. People wanted to be 
consulted. More than that, they wanted to be able to intervene 
locally on matters of interest to them. Unfortunately, this is not 
possible under the present system.
<P>
	I wish to draw the attention of the Minister of Human 
Resources to the fact that a debate on this subject is 
forthcoming. Last week, the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans 
recognized that we would have to review the whole fisheries 
administration in Canada. I congratulate him for acknowledging 
that we have a problem. I also let him know that the province of 
Quebec had submitted a project that might solve the problem. 
He told me that, naturally, he had to consult the other provinces. 
During the next few weeks I will follow up on that, to make sure 
that the minister has, indeed, started discussions with his 
counterparts and that officials of the two levels of government 
are doing the necessary groundwork. It is most important.
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	I would like to go back to what my constituents said because it 
touched on all of this. They said: ``We do not understand this 
reform. We are in dire straights, and we would like the 
government to help the poorest members of society, to give us 
the necessary tools to break this vicious circle''. Before, it used 
to be called the 10/42, from now on it will be the 12/38. The 
government is tightening eligibility, increasing the number of 
work weeks, while shortening the benefit period. It is very 
disappointing for people.
<P>
	People would like to have the tools to take care of themselves. 
But the government is not providing them. With respect to the 
unemployment rate in the Gaspé Peninsula, the government 
came to the brilliant conclusion that we do not have too many 
people out of work, we have too many people for the number of 
jobs available.
<P>
	The second point which really irks people is the matter of 
employability. A fisherman told me this: ``In our village, with a 
population of 200 to 300, should everyone become a welder?'' It 
does not make any sense to retrain some 30 fishermen to all 
become welders. What I want to point out with this story is the 
fact that we need the tools to modify the economic structure of 
our regions.
<P>
	We will not be able to transform the Gaspé Peninsula 
overnight into something like Montreal. Montreal also has its 
share of problems. The unemployment rate in this city is 
somewhere around 13 per cent, I believe. People are warning me 
that if this reform goes any further, it will trigger an exodus. 
Where will people go, if they have to leave an area where the 
unemployment rate is now 17 per cent to go to an area where it is 
13 per cent? It is robbing Peter to pay Paul.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8055"> 8055 </A></B>
<P>
	But this will not solve the problem; our problem is one of 
structural unemployment. We are not showing our people how 
to become self-sufficient. We are not giving them their own 
decision-making tools, we are not allowing them to manage 
their own affairs. These tools should be transferred to them, 
people should be consulted, and yet it is not done; it is one of 
their main comments.
<P>
	I would like to point out that I will supply the Minister of 
Human Resources Development with a summary along with 
these briefs. I will also give it to the parliamentary committee, 
which is on the road right now.
<P>
	But I would still like to raise a few points. As I believe was 
mentioned by some hon. members a few minutes ago, shared 
time is one solution to the employment problem being used by 
the CNTU in the Gaspé Peninsula. People are ready to discuss 
solutions, to look at all the possibilities. As I said earlier, 
fishermen throughout the Atlantic provinces, not just in Quebec, 
mentioned that they are hoping, and indeed are asking, for a 
bigger share, for permits with more variety.
<P>
	Some of the things I heard were amusing. There was one 
woman who said: ``The Liberals are forever consulting, but we 
need more than that right now. The barn is on fire and we need a 
fireman who knows what to do''.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, as I told you earlier, I was accompanied by 
two commissioners. I am merely repeating what people told me. 
One woman asked: ``Why are we reforming social programs, 
when the problem is elsewhere?'' The problem is in the lack of 
employment, in the fact that the government is facing excessive 
debt, that over half this debt is owed outside the country and that 
we are going to be in serious trouble if we do not get our finances 
in order soon.
<P>
	The message is that the Bloc Quebecois agrees that the deficit 
must be reduced and said so during the election campaign. 
However, we do not want cuts to be made blindly. We want there 
to be respect for the public. If there is an objective to be met, 
people should be asked what tools they need to reach it, and 
whether it is feasible. If it is not feasible then, as a society, we 
will have to make a choice. We will always need fishermen.
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	One of them told me: ``I am willing to work 12 months a year, 
but is the Minister of Human Resources Development willing to 
thaw the gulf in the wintertime? Is he willing to stock it? If so, I 
could fish 12 months a year''.
<P>
	Of course, we had a bit of fun. In spite of the seriousness of the 
problems, people in the Gaspé Peninsula came to these hearings 
with a smile on their face and kept their cool. They suggested 
solutions. They also sent a serious warning to the government. If 
it realizes what their needs are and gives them the necessary 
tools, they will meet the objectives that the government wants to 
set behind their backs.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mac Harb (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Trade, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, let me begin by 
congratulating the government and the Minister for Human 
Resources Development on his initiative. Indeed, it is a bold 
approach that in my view will respond to the nineties and 
beyond.
<P>
	This is one segment of an overall strategy and overall action 
plan which will be proposed by this government over the next 
year or so in order to respond to a commitment made by the 
Prime Minister on behalf of the Liberal Party of Canada as well 
as on behalf of the people who elected him. Those commitments 
were made in <I>Creating Opportunities</I> or the red book as people 
might call it.
<P>
	There are three aspects of the proposal. One looks at the whole 
way in which we deliver our social programs in Canada, as well 
as human resources training and development. The second 
aspect will look at the overall industry in Canada and the way we 
deliver our goods and services here and abroad. The third aspect 
is to try and put our house in order in terms of looking at the 
overall finances of the government.
<P>
	There is no doubt in my mind that if one is to look at Canada 
from the outside, which the United Nations has done on a 
number of occasions, one would come to the conclusion that we 
live in the greatest country on earth. I knew that 20 years ago 
when I came here. I knew I was going to heaven on earth. I am 
sure that my colleagues in this House and all Canadians would 
agree and would know that we live in the greatest land on earth.
<P>
	To keep Canada in the forefront in terms of equality of social 
programs that we provide our citizens, the quality of education 
that we provide and access to the finest medicare in the world, 
we have to do a number of things.
<P>
	Before I enter into a detailed explanation I want to share with 
you some statistical information in terms of the status quo, the 
situation that now exists in Canada.
<P>
	Today approximately 10 per cent of the Canadian population 
are considered to be senior citizens. By the year 2031 that 
number will double to the point where more or less about one in 
every four Canadians will be a senior citizen. In parallel with 
that if we are to look at the number of people who are entering 
the workforce, we have a shrinkage. Today there are a lot less 
people in the workforce than there were 10 or 15 years ago.
<P>
	The challenge is to use the output or the productivity of those 
people who are in the workforce to try and support all of the 
programs, social benefits and everything else in order to contin-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8056"> 8056 </A></B>
<P>
ue to provide the quality of life that we have been providing to 
Canadians for the past 100 or so years.
<P>
	To that extent one would say that we not only have to work 
harder but we have to work smarter.
<P>
<B>(1620 ) </B>
<P>
	I would be misleading the House and Canadians if I were to 
say that at the turn of the switch things are going to be better. 
Canadians know that in order for things to get better we all have 
to make sacrifices. We all have to take a bold approach toward 
changing not only the appearance but the fundamental structure 
when it comes to the kinds of things we do and the programs we 
provide.
<P>
	The reason I say this is because if we look at the programs that 
we have today, many have been in existence 25 to 50 years in 
some cases. Some of those programs have kept up to the demand 
and to the technological changes and have been updated. Other 
programs definitely require a closer look.
<P>
	I am going to give a couple of examples. Let us look at the 
figures for 1972. In 1972 the Canadian government spent $3 
billion on unemployment insurance and social assistance. Guess 
how much we spent in 1993? We spent $33.4 billion. Looking at 
how much we spent on education, it is interesting to note that 
Canada spent perhaps more than any other country in the world 
on education. All governments together spent in excess of $50 
billion a year on education.
<P>
	When it comes to the overall expenditure on all of the social 
programs, that would put Canada behind Sweden as the country 
that spent the most on social programs of any country in the 
world. That is why we have the finest support services anywhere 
on the globe. That is why we have to make sure we do everything 
we can to continue to provide the quality services that are 
required.
<P>
	If we look at what we are spending in terms of resources, 
gross, financial and otherwise versus in terms of how much we 
need in order to continue to support those programs, the devil 
will show up. That devil is a tremendous amount of debt that 
totals in excess of $700 billion if we combine the federal as well 
as the provincial governments' debts.
<P>
	To support that debt in terms of the deficit it is in excess of 
$37 billion to $40 billion on an annual basis. If we add this to the 
amount of funds we are putting in to support social programs 
and our educational system and if we continue to do the kinds of 
things we are doing today without some major overhaul, it will 
take us quite a while to catch up. I might suggest that we will 
never be able to catch up because, as my colleagues know, 
cutting services alone is not going to solve it.
<P>
	If the government was to fire every public servant we would 
still have a deficit of approximately $20 billion a year. Cutting 
programs is not going to solve it. What will solve it is if, as the 
Minister for Human Resources Development has suggested, we 
look at the way we provide those programs and services to the 
community and try to fine tune those programs and services so 
they will meet the needs and the challenges of the 1990s.
<P>
	Second, we have to improve our productivity and our standing 
on the international scene as well as here in Canada in order to 
create wealth. The NDP's theory of redistributing wealth failed. 
We have seen it in Ontario as well as in Saskatchewan and 
British Columbia when they were in power. It does not work.
<P>
	The second theory of ultra independent capitalism without 
government being at least there in order to provide a fair and 
proper environment also does not work because the private 
sector alone will not solve it. As well, if we leave it up the public 
sector alone it will not work.
<P>
	Historically, the best approach to solve our socioeconomic 
problems has always been the Liberal approach. Would the 
House not agree?
<P>
<B>(1625 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rideout:</B> Absolutely.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harb:</B> That is basically what this government is doing. 
We are looking at the way we deliver our services and our 
programs. We are trying to put in place a mechanism that will 
help us move ahead to control the deficit, reduce the national 
debt, eventually eliminating it, and continue to provide quality 
social programs for people, including our seniors, and continue 
helping our youth so they can obtain the kind of education they 
need.
<P>
	There are some challenges. I would like to share some of 
those. Now in Canada over 38 per cent of the Canadian 
population is considered to be functionally illiterate. In other 
words, these people may have difficulty to calculate properly, 
read or write properly, fill out an application form properly 
and/or properly read manuals that might relate to their daily 
work.
<P>
	The cost to the business community alone on an annual basis 
is over $4 billion. It costs the government $10 billion a year in 
terms of lost productivity and other accessories that go along 
with it. Looking at the national deficit of $40 billion alone, it 
costs us about 25 per cent of that. If we lived in an ideal world 
with no illiteracy, we would not have a problem. I know we have 
to catch up in order to reach that particular state.
<P>
	I spoke earlier about the fact that there is a shrinking in terms 
of the number of people who are entering the workforce. That is 
a result of two things. First, the productivity rate in Canada is 
decreasing, not increasing. Second, there is a major problem in 
our educational system. Out of every three students now there is 
one student not finishing high school. Did anyone know that?
<P>
	About 33 per cent of our youth are not completing high 
school. Instead, they are getting low paying jobs at Dairy Queen 
or at McDonald's. As a result of that eventually, if they are 
unlucky, as are many of our youth, they will find themselves in 
the unfortunate situation of not finding the job they need. They 
go on welfare or UI. They find themselves outside of the safety 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8057"> 8057 </A></B>
<P>
net this country has provided its citizens for the past hundred 
years or so.
<P>
	We have to make sure the system is open, accessible and ready 
to provide opportunities for those who would like to take 
advantage of them. On the other hand I will look at the overall 
situation in terms of the opportunities that exist for us as a 
country.
<P>
	Let us have a look at the other programs. I want to share some 
figures. We spent about $33.7 billion annually on UI in 1993. In 
1972 we spent something like $3 billion. One would think if we 
had spent more in 1993 that the figures in terms of 
unemployment would improve. In other words we should have 
less people on unemployment.
<P>
	Unfortunately, the numbers of unemployed since the fifties 
until now have not been improving. They have been going 
backward. In the 1950s, the number of unemployed people in 
Canada was in the range of 4 per cent to 5 per cent. In the 1990s 
unfortunately that figure exceeds 10 per cent of the population. 
That does not include the people who are on welfare.
<P>
	We have to work harder and we have to work smarter. I have 
said that 33 per cent of our youth are not completing high school 
and 38 per cent of the population is functionally illiterate. Our 
world is changing. My colleague from the Atlantic provinces 
would know that in the past in order for us to support our social 
programs all we would do was get a back hoe, dig some gold or 
metals and raw material and sell it. That was easy. We would 
take a few chain saws, cut a few trees and sell wood. That was 
easy. Or fish.
<P>
<B>(1630 ) </B>
<P>
	However the fish are being depleted, the number of trees is 
declining as are our raw materials. If we sold all the raw 
materials we could it would not be sufficient to support the 
expenditures our government and past governments have made. 
To that extent we have to do things a little differently.
<P>
	According to a study published by employment and 
immigration in the past three years, by the year 2000 
approximately 67 per cent of all jobs in Canada will require at 
least a grade 13 education. Looking at the present situation we 
will not be able to catch up. We will have to take the kind of bold 
approach the Minister of Human Resources Development is 
taking. We will have to take the kind of bold approach the 
Minister of Finance will be taking when he delivers his budget 
next February. We will have to take the same kind of bold 
approach the Minister of Industry will be taking. We will also 
have to take the kind of bold approach the Minister for 
International Trade or the Minister of Health will be taking.
<P>
	We have to look at the way we do things. The Minister for 
Intergovernmental Affairs has been embarking on a major 
undertaking to look at the programs the government is 
delivering and to see if those programs can be better delivered 
by another agency or another level of government. We will see 
what we as a federal government can do and what the provincial 
and municipal governments, agencies or crown corporations can 
do. That review will definitely lead to a more efficient and 
dynamic, a more progressive and upbeat government that can 
move forward with flexibility.
<P>
	We will never abandon our social programs. The Liberal 
government will never abandon its commitment to those who 
need assistance and support. However, we have to look at things 
and see if they still meet today's needs. I will give some 
examples.
<P>
	Despite the fact that we spend some $34 billion on UI and 
social programs I am amazed there are still 1.3 million children 
living below the poverty line. A large number of single mothers 
still cannot find work and cannot make ends meet without a 
social support network. They cannot get the education required 
to make a better life for themselves and their children.
<P>
	There is no doubt in my mind that a review is needed as the 
Minister of Human Resources Development has stated, that will 
be effective, affordable and fair. I am very much interested in 
the aspects of the proposal the minister has put forward which 
deals specifically with child care and child poverty.
<P>
	In Canada approximately 450,000 lone parents are on welfare. 
Ninety per cent of them are women who could work if they had 
the right support, such as child care. Instead of helping single 
mothers and their children to get out of the welfare trap the 
percentage of single mothers who work is actually declining 
rather than increasing. The problem is that good quality child 
care is expensive and not readily available.
<P>
	Most parents are in paid employment. In 1993, 63 per cent of 
women with children under the age of six were actually in the 
workforce, up from 47 per cent in 1981 and up from 35.5 per 
cent in 1976. Despite this increase the supply of licensed child 
care spaces in Canada is limited. Only 28 per cent of children six 
years and under with working parents are in licensed day care. I 
am sure that many of my colleagues know of some people who 
experience those kinds of difficulties.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	The shortage of affordable child care could keep parents, 
especially lone parents out of work. As well, the lack of flexible 
work arrangements such as job sharing and compressed work 
weeks make it difficult for working parents to balance work with 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8058"> 8058 </A></B>
<P>
family needs. One would ask how we can help those families and 
those parents do better.
<P>
	The minister came up with a number of options. He proposed 
that we can and should work with the provinces to increase the 
number of child care spaces. The government already has set 
aside new funding for up to 150,000 new child care spaces and 
we will work with the provinces to decide how the money will be 
spent. Also the government could work with employers to find 
ways to encourage flex time and a shorter work week.
<P>
	Also we can invest to help meet the child care needs of parents 
in paid employment. That makes good economic sense. Some of 
the benefits would perhaps include more productive employees, 
jobs for child care workers and less pressure on welfare 
programs.
<P>
	Those are some of the things we can do. I could go on but I see 
that my time is coming to an end. I conclude by congratulating 
this government on a job well done and I welcome the Prime 
Minister home after a wonderful trip. It is going to create many 
jobs for now and the future.
<P>
	<B>Mr. George S. Rideout (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Natural Resources, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, first I 
want to compliment the parliamentary secretary on an excellent 
and insightful discourse. The sheer volume of facts, figures and 
information was quite edifying for all members of Parliament I 
am sure. I would like to ask a couple of questions in two areas.
<P>
	With his experience in international trade as parliamentary 
secretary to the minister, I am sure he is aware of the types of 
educational requirements needed. If we are going to make this 
economy work, not only do we have to make government 
function better but we have to make the economy grow. The 
Prime Minister in his trip to China and the Asia-Pacific has 
shown the opportunities that are available to Canadians. We 
have to make the Canadian workforce ready for those 
opportunities. Perhaps the parliamentary secretary could show 
us how the social safety net could be utilized in order to take 
advantage of those international opportunities.
<P>
	Perhaps the parliamentary secretary could also discuss some 
of the things experienced in New Brunswick. There are 
disincentives built into the present system. I am thinking 
particularly of the UI system in which it is better to stay on UI 
than to go out and get a job. I am thinking of the welfare system 
in which it is better to stay on welfare because after taking a low 
paying low skilled position and getting off welfare the benefits 
available under the welfare system such as dental care, clothing 
allowances and allowances for single parents are lost.
<P>
	For anyone to say that the status quo is acceptable, that we can 
leave things exactly the way they are obviously has no real 
understanding of the tremendous change that is necessary and 
which this government has embarked upon.
<P>
	I would ask the parliamentary secretary to comment on the 
disincentives in the UI system and in the welfare systems in the 
different provinces and also to offer some hope to Canadians 
through the opportunities in the international marketplace.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harb:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague. It was 
because of his effort and his former experience as a mayor on the 
Federation of Canadian Municipalities that I was inspired along 
with my colleague from Nepean to co-chair the Liberal 
infrastructure task force which went across the country. It 
visited his home province. The task force came back with a 
report that was adopted by our caucus. I thank him again for his 
interest in the well-being of his constituents.
<P>
<B>(1640 ) </B>
<P>
	The hon. member asked me to mention the kinds of things we 
could do to prepare our workers and industries. We have to focus 
on training. Training and retraining is the key. People might ask: 
Training for what? That question deserves an answer.
<P>
	The global economy as they call it and you can call it 
whatever you want, but every country in the world economy is 
using high technology tools such as computers, robotics, 
machinery with advanced technology. Canadian industries have 
not adapted to that. About 50 per cent of Canadian companies do 
not use advanced technology instruments to help productivity.
<P>
	After Belgium, Austria and Australia, Canada's expenditures 
per capita on research and development are the third largest in 
the world but the private sector is nowhere to be seen. Canada's 
private sector, industry in Canada is not spending enough money 
on research and development. Because the job market is going to 
require at least a grade 13 education and the required 
information base, understanding and knowledge, we have to 
invest in the areas of research and development, education and 
training.
<P>
	The member asked what we could do to improve employment 
services. The minister is already looking at ways and tools to 
improve these services such as individual job counselling, 
helping people develop their own employment plan, providing 
information about the job market, pointing people in the right 
direction, giving them access to basic skills training, and 
helping them with reading, writing and math. We must give 
them better training programs to acquire skills that match-a 
key buzzword-the local labour market. That is very important. 
Train them for what? That is the key. Many of my constituents 
ask what they are being trained for.
<P>
	We must work in co-operation with the private sector. It takes 
two hands to clap. You cannot clap with one hand. Government 
cannot do it all by itself. We need the co-operation of the private 
sector. We have to work with it hand in hand.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8059"> 8059 </A></B>
<P>
	With respect to trade this government has probably done 
more in that area in a short period of time than any other 
government in the history of Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, let 
me go back to what the hon. parliamentary secretary said at the 
beginning of his speech, namely that it must be recognized that 
the reform under way is aimed at reducing the debt and the 
deficit. I do not want to repeat the figures, but he admitted that 
this reform was a total package in relation to the existing 
economic situation.
<P>
	He confirmed that the debt and the deficit will be reduced at 
the expense of the less fortunate, that is, the seasonally 
unemployed, students-some of whom we saw last week on 
Parliament Hill-, single mothers, high school drop-outs, to 
whom he also referred in his undoubtedly accurate figures. It is 
true that over 33 per cent of our students drop out of school. We 
must of course put our fiscal house in order before it goes 
bankrupt, but not at the expense of the less fortunate.
<P>
	I wish he had mentioned other ways to reduce the deficit. 
There are other ways such as family trusts, to name just one. 
What is keeping them from taking action on this front? What is 
keeping them from going after the millions of dollars we are 
losing because the GST is poorly administered? We could then 
achieve the same goal, that is, reducing the debt and the deficit, 
but not at the expense of the less fortunate.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harb:</B> Madam Speaker, I would like us to reread the 
``blues''. I never said that all this government wanted to do is to 
reduce the deficit on the backs of the poor. On the contrary, I will 
again repeat what I said, in case the hon. member did not hear 
me. We will continue to set up and launch the necessary 
programs to help Canadians. Let me quote what the minister said 
in English:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``A hallmark of our Canadian society is our commitment as a 
government to people who cannot work because of illness or 
injury, low income families struggling to make ends meet, 
people with disabilities or chronic illness and children living in 
poverty. Our social programs are the way in which we offer 
protection and hope to Canadians''. He goes on to list some of 
the social programs that we have in place.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Madam Speaker, the minister is dealing with the needs of 
people who ask for help.
<P>
	I especially want to point out to the hon. member that I never 
said in my speech that we would reduce the deficit on the backs 
of the poor. I am sure he agrees with me that we must control the 
deficit. To control the deficit, we must act more intelligently. If 
the hon. member tells me that $50 billion a year is not enough 
spent on education, well, I do not know, but we spend more than 
any other country in the world.
<P>
	Probably what we need in the end is to harmonize the systems, 
eliminate duplication and deliver services better, and I am sure 
that we will end up saving money, but never on the backs of the 
poor and those who need assistance.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I have a number of areas that I wanted to touch on but I 
keep adding as I listen to this debate here today.
<P>
	One of the areas that I would like to touch on briefly are the 
comments made by the hon. member for 
Broadview-Greenwood. I listened with interest to his heart 
warming and somewhat inspiring story of his grandmother. I 
believe that many people have similar stories. It does show what 
people are able to do under adverse conditions when the need is 
really there.
<P>
	One of the interesting things is that we have gone too far. I 
think the pendulum has swung the other way. I do not think we 
want to return to conditions under which he mentioned where 
there is absolutely no help for anyone under virtually any 
circumstances. It is very warming that his grandmother was able 
to persevere in the face of that kind of adversity.
<P>
	Nowadays we have a different situation. I have one friend as 
an example who has a son who plants trees. This may be alien to 
some of the people in some regions of the country but in British 
Columbia tree planting is a very active profession during the 
summer months. Someone who is a good tree planter can make a 
great deal of money during that season; $35,000, $40,000 or 
more in a three or four month season for those who are very good 
at this. It happens that his son is one of these who is very good at 
what he does and he makes very good money.
<P>
	During the balance of the year under the existing system he 
collects unemployment insurance. When I talk in terms of the 
pendulum swinging too far the other way, this particular 
individual belongs to something that is known in my riding with 
some satire, with tongue firmly in cheek, as the UIC ski team. 
He is an avid skier. This particular individual spends a lot of 
time at the local ski hill and to his credit volunteers a lot of his 
time to the voluntary ski patrol which is very worthwhile.
<P>
	The interesting story that his father conveyed to me is the fact 
that this individual one season was offered a job at the mountain 
to be on the regular ski patrol and to be paid for it. He went home 
that night and pondered his situation. He looked at his UIC 
benefits and looked at what he would be paid as a member of the 
ski patrol.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8060"> 8060 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	He weighed all the factors and he went back to the ski hill the 
next day and told them that he would be happy to remain a 
volunteer at the ski hill, but if he took the job he would give up 
his UIC and his net benefit would be a drop in income. He did not 
particularly care to do that.
<P>
	We have improved over the hardships that people like the hon. 
member's grandmother had to live under and deal with. As I say 
I think perhaps the pendulum has swung too far the other way 
and these are the kinds of things we are going to have to look at 
when we talk in terms of social reform.
<P>
	One other factor that I want to touch on while still on the 
subject of the hon. member for Broadview-Greenwood is that 
of women in business. Once again it is something that is moving 
in the right direction but with a potential problem as well.
<P>
	We saw recently in the province of Ontario a provincial 
government ad that said in essence white males need not apply. 
There is no question that women, whether it be in business or in 
any other area, have been discriminated against in the past. I 
hope that time is coming to an end. I am sure there is still 
discrimination out there but it is being reduced, it is being dealt 
with and it is something that people are now very much aware of.
<P>
	However, it is hard to really properly deal with it by 
introducing various types of reverse discrimination. There is a 
risk in doing that if you can help a woman to go into a business, 
to assist her and give her some benefit that is not available to 
other people. We see this not only in the area of women in 
business but we see it in many things. It applies in general 
business without categorization-it might be men to men-but 
nonetheless we have to take a very cautious look at any area 
which offers specialized help for any one group no matter what 
it happens to be.
<P>
	We obviously have to reduce the amount of money we spend, 
the payments that we make, as it were, under social programs. It 
has been said by very learned people that by some time in the 
next decade the cost of our social programs combined with the 
interest on our  debt-those two factors alone-will exceed the 
government's income. Obviously reductions can be made in 
other areas but if you eliminate everything, if you eliminate the 
departments of agriculture, fisheries, defence, foreign policy 
and all other departments, totally eliminate them, we still would 
not deal with our debt problem. Obviously changes have to be 
made under social programs.
<P>
	However, before we start reducing payments made under 
these programs we have to first reduce costs in other areas. 
These costs have to certainly be in the delivery of social 
program benefits. Not just under that, we have to look at all the 
other programs and all the other departments as well.
<P>
	One of the things that will happen is if we stop removing so 
much money from people in all the other areas it puts less 
pressure on the social programs.
<P>
	Something we might want to look at under agriculture, for 
example, is grain car allocation so that the farmers are better 
able to get their grain to market; likewise, the labour disruptions 
at ports. These are problems that affect the revenues of farmers. 
Not only that but as we saw in the last labour disruption in the 
port of Vancouver, it had a spinoff effect that started to shut 
down factories in other parts of the country that had absolutely 
nothing whatsoever to do with farming or grain. It is a matter of 
problems that tie up the ports and then start to affect people in 
other areas.
<P>
	In my own riding Cominco Ltd. had I think about three days 
worth of supplies left before it had to start providing layoff 
notices. These are things that we have to look at.
<P>
	On business subsidies, we are talking in terms of women in 
business. These business subsidies also apply in other areas. 
One of the problems with business subsidies is that not all 
people get them. How do we reconcile the fact that we give a 
subsidy to one business and not to another? We could end up 
with a government subsidized business competing directly with 
a similar business that receives no subsidy.
<P>
	The hon. member for Broadview-Greenwood had a question 
after his talk about why there cannot be some form of program 
that allows people on unemployment insurance to start a 
business of their own while collecting it.
<P>
<B>(1655 ) </B>
<P>
	There is such a program called SEAP, the self-employment 
assistance program, which does exactly that. One has to be on 
unemployment insurance in order to apply for it. The benefit 
that one gets is one year from the point of time that one's 
program is approved one gets to remain on unemployment 
insurance for one year while one starts his or her business.
<P>
	That has some potential but again it is one of these things 
where one cannot just arbitrarily say what a wonderful program. 
I have had cases come up in my  riding recently in which people 
who were on unemployment insurance were given the 
opportunity to start a business and had their unemployment 
insurance benefits continued while they did this for one year. 
However, two cases have come up in which they are in direct 
competition with existing businesses.
<P>
	The latest case that has come up has resulted in the person 
getting this assistance dropping his prices to carve his niche into 
the market which will result in the other competitor who is 
already there and did not get assistance before and is not getting 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8061"> 8061 </A></B>
<P>
assistance now probably laying someone off. Our program in 
this particular instance does not work.
<P>
	We also have to look at such things as interprovincial trade 
barriers. The Atlantic provinces, for example, receive economic 
development grants as do other regions of Canada. Just to put it 
into perspective, the cost to the Atlantic provinces of 
interprovincial trade barriers exceeds the benefit they get from 
the economic development grants. Obviously we have some 
changes we could make there that will enhance the prosperity of 
the region and take the pressure in some areas off of the social 
programs.
<P>
	We have the salmon fisheries on the west coast. The salmon 
fisheries are now headed down the road that many of the Atlantic 
fisheries have already travelled. We have a problem out there 
and this problem has to be dealt with. It has to be dealt with 
openly and quickly or we are going to have the same kind of 
problems in the west, at least in the fishing industry, that 
Atlantic Canada has experienced for many years.
<P>
	We then have the firearms legislation. We are now talking it 
seems about the registration of rifles and shotguns, anywhere 
from seven to twenty-one million of these rifles and shotguns 
depending on whose figures one uses. Let us say it is probably 
somewhere in the middle between those two figures. The 
expected cost of that could run as high as a billion dollars or 
even more. That is a cost to the taxpayer.
<P>
	Even if we charge an amount for each registration that is equal 
to the cost of the government registering them, it is still 
removing a billion dollars out of our economy that is doing 
absolutely nothing to resolve any of the other pressing problems 
of government or the deficit and debt problem.
<P>
	RRSPs are probably one of the most dangerous things that the 
government is playing with right now because it is trying to get 
some revenue out of possibly attacking RRSPs, the cost of which 
will be future problems down the road. If we have a shortage 
now because we are trying to pay pensions and other benefits to 
people who in some cases do not need it, think of the problems 
we are going to have further down the road when we are telling 
people they have to be more responsible for themselves, they 
have to look after themselves if they are able to do so when we 
potentially may set in force legislation today  which will affect 
their ability to look after themselves somewhere down the road.
<P>
	On the unemployment insurance commission, before we can 
go out to industry and start attacking industry that we feel may 
not be acting in the country's best interest, the government has 
to get its own house in order. The minister responsible for UIC 
specifically singled out the automotive industry. Maybe he 
should. Maybe there is a problem there. I am not an expert in that 
area but what I do know is that there is five times the cost that the 
auto industry causes the unemployment insurance program right 
in the government to the point that it is costing some $400 
million a year because of seasonal benefits in the government. 
The government cannot attack industry until it has its own house 
in order.
<P>
<B>(1700 ) </B>
<P>
	Under the question of consultation there is a problem that I 
have seen. I realize that this is my opinion and the government is 
free to counter it. I have seen a lot of instances in different bills 
in which the government loves to have a long list of all those 
groups it has consulted with. When we see this list of businesses, 
organizations and individuals who have been consulted with, we 
are supposed to assume that the government then automatically 
has listened to the input from these people it has consulted with 
and drawn its legislation based on that.
<P>
	We know the reality is that does not happen. The most prime 
example is the Minister of Justice again. The Minister of Justice 
has been quoted as saying with regard to the firearms lobby: ``I 
will not produce legislation on the basis of head count. I will do 
what I believe is the right thing''. This could be very easily 
interpreted as: ``I do not care what you want, I know better''.
<P>
	Reform consultation is ongoing on this particular thing as it is 
with the Liberal members in their various ridings. We are going 
to great length in trying to consult with people to find out what 
changes they will accept, what alternatives they have to suggest 
and how they see we should deal with the problem. The question 
is will the government consider our input after we have had this 
consultation or will it continue with its own agenda?
<P>
	I am having quite a number of meetings in my own riding. I 
am setting up to meet with pension groups, medical 
professionals, education professionals, labour groups, employer 
groups and student associations. In addition, to get a feeling of 
the general constituents in my riding I am holding ten town hall 
meetings over the winter break.
<P>
	With regard to dealing with student groups, I have a particular 
concern that we do not make significant further cuts to transfer 
payments in support of post-secondary education. We talk about 
government spending in the past. Whether it be Liberal or 
Conservative does not matter. We are here now and that is what 
happened in the past. Nonetheless we are in a  situation in which 
we have mortgaged our children's and grandchildren's futures.
<P>
	When we start dealing with student groups we have to 
recognize that we have already placed a huge penalty upon these 
people. Let us not add to that by placing another obstacle in their 
way to their getting the implements they need to deal with the 
legacy of debt we have left them.

<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am sorry to interrupt 
the hon. member, you are not quite out of time.
<P>
	It is my duty pursuant to Standing Order 38 to inform the 
House that the questions to be raised tonight at the time of 
adjournment are as follows: The hon. member for Kootenay 
West-Revelstoke, Pearson International Airport.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gouk:</B> Madam Speaker, my colleagues are pointing out 
that I have placed you in a position in which you have to 
interrupt me to tell me that I will be speaking further after I 
finish speaking.
<P>
	I am pretty well wrapped up on this, other than to say that 
consultation will take place. The very first thing I said when I 
rose in this House for the first time at the beginning of the 
session in the spring was that I am not here to oppose for the sake 
of opposition. I will be the first to applaud the government when 
it brings in legislation I or my constituents agree with. If I do not 
agree with its legislation then I hope I would be able to offer 
some constructive alternatives. That is what we are trying to do 
in terms of meeting with the people.
<P>
	I have my own certain ideas. I am not trying to sell these at 
town hall meetings. I am trying to explore with people what 
types of alternatives are out there, what the bottom line is that 
we have to reach, what the government is proposing and then 
listen the kinds of choices they make. I hope we will have good 
opportunity for consultation. We will not take an adversarial 
roles, saying we cannot accept anything you do because it makes 
less of our plan or vice versa. In the end we want what is going to 
work for the people of Canada. I trust we are all working toward 
that goal.
<P>
<B>(1705 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the member for 
Kootenay West-Revelstoke for his comments on my earlier 
remarks.
<P>
	I assure the member that we are sincere. The Minister of 
Human Resources Development is someone I have watched in 
this town since 1980. He is someone who respects good ideas. 
Without ideas we are dead around here.
<P>
	The members opposite should feel that any good ideas they 
put forward here, no matter where the members come from, if 
they will make the fabric of this country better we are going to 
take them.
<P>
	I want to pick up on the member's comments about the 
unemployment insurance ski team member. I have  problems 
with the UI ski team. I have problems for a number of reasons. I 
think the member said this person was making approximately 
$40,000 in three months working in his forestry career. If 
someone is doing that in three months and then all of sudden 
going on this unemployment insurance system, I think of the ski 
unit, if it happens at a time when it might displace someone else 
who needs more than the basic minimum wage that a UI cheque 
would give I think we are putting that other person at a 
disadvantage.
<P>
	In other words if I were looking for a job on the ski slopes and 
needed to get $15 or $20 an hour because I did not have the 
$40,000 income for the three months, and if all of a sudden I do 
not get the job because here is a fellow who is volunteering his 
time and it is not costing the employer a nickel, we are working 
against ourselves.
<P>
	Does the hon. member not think that when a firm receives the 
benefit of having someone contribute toward the health and 
viability of his business where it is being funded by the 
taxpayers through the UI system perhaps there should be some 
accountability so that we are not working at cross purposes?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gouk:</B> Madam Speaker, I am not sure exactly where we 
ended up with that question. I am sure the member will correct 
me if I get too far off the track.
<P>
	In the case of this particular individual I mentioned in my 
example, there are both volunteers anyway and full time people 
they are required to have as part of their licence. This individual 
by volunteering was just that, a volunteer who would if he had 
taken the full time job hopefully have been replaced with 
another volunteer. The full time job that he did not take because 
he was a volunteer still existed and still had to be filled by 
someone else. In that particular example he was not taking away 
someone's job by volunteering while supported by his 
unemployment insurance benefits.
<P>
	I think where the problem comes overall is we have taken 
some of the incentive away. It is not just a matter of policing. 
Some would argue that if there is no work for this individual and 
he is getting unemployment in any event he might as well be on 
the ski hill.
<P>
	The argument is that one of the things we are looking at in our 
policy dealing with unemployment insurance is if someone 
makes $40,000 a year, should he be able to collect benefits 
which are paid in part by someone who has a $27,000 a year job 
and works 52 weeks of the year paying premiums so that 
individual can be off.
<P>
	There has to be some cut through which we say you have made 
over a certain amount, you have gone beyond what we have 
guaranteed you would make and therefore you are not eligible 
for further benefits or at least it would be at a severely reduced 
point.
<P>
<B>(1710 ) </B>
<P>
	I am sure the hon. member is aware of our concept of old age 
pension for people with high income. If we applied the same 
type of principle to the unemployment  insurance program, the 
saving would run to quite a few billion dollars.
<P>

<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, first 
I want to emphasize a positive point made by the Reform Party 
member. I agree with him when he says that, as regards 
post-secondary education, the federal government should not 
put students deeper into debts. Consequently, the hon. member 
would oppose a reduction in federal transfers to the provinces 
for education. I hope his views are shared by the rest of his 
caucus.
<P>
	The hon. member approves the reform and every measure 
related to it. In fact, he said that on top of implementing this 
reform, we should also look at program expenditures. I agree 
that many departmental programs should be reviewed. However, 
my question is: Before implementing a social program reform 
which targets the poor and the unemployed, does he not think 
that we should take a look at foregone tax revenues for the 
government, because of family trusts, because of a major 
shortfall in GST collection, and because of subsidies granted to 
industries which do not appear to need them? Does he not agree 
that, before implementing this reform, the government should 
try to recover all the money it is losing right now?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gouk:</B> Madam Speaker, certainly there are problems. I 
assume the hon. member was referring largely to such things as 
the underground economy and how a lot of revenue the 
government should be collecting is disappearing. There are two 
ends of the scale. There are allegations that at the top end of the 
scale there are people who use tax loopholes to escape paying 
their due portion and at all ends of the scale from the bottom up 
there are people who are using this underground economy to 
escape paying high taxes and particularly the GST.
<P>
	These are things that definitely have to be addressed. One of 
the ways we are looking at addressing the tax system is using a 
flat tax type of system. Interestingly, one of the models I have 
looked at was originally devised by a member of the Liberal 
Party. Unfortunately it did not get a lot of response at the time.
<P>
	We have system that we have devised in which we will ensure 
that each person pays a fair share. The only deductions that will 
be allowed are those that apply to the most general population 
across Canada. With regard to the money we are losing in things 
like GST and so on with the underground economy, one of the 
problems is if we put so much burden on people, they finally will 
get to a point at which they justify in their own mind that it is 
proper, that it is actually the right thing to do to avoid paying 
taxes wherever possible. We saw this in the case of the cigarette 
tax in the east where people openly flaunted the fact that they 
were buying cigarettes that did  not have the tax paid on them. 
People will get to the point at which they say enough is enough.
<P>
	These are things that have to be dealt with. We think the only 
way that will be dealt with, rather than extracting more money or 
enforcing under GST, is to get government's end under control, 
which is the spending. We have to reduce the government's need 
for those tax dollars. We have to deal with the tax burden that is 
placed on people so we are not taxing people to the extent that 
they find every loophole they can get, legal and otherwise, to 
avoid paying their fair share of taxes.
<P>
<B>(1715 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Brent St. Denis (Algoma, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, it is a 
special privilege for me to participate in this debate. I am going 
to spend my time talking about what this government has been 
doing and proposes to do in support of older workers who sadly 
find themselves displaced from a job at a time in life when it is 
not easy to find a new job.
<P>
	I want to preface my remarks by saying that I have 
tremendous confidence in the Minister of Human Resources 
Development. He has put a set of options on the table that I 
believe are historic. They are based on extensive consultations 
which took place earlier this year. They are packaged in a format 
that Canadians can easily understand. I am confident that when 
the message is fully out and all the options are fully explained, 
Canadians will significantly support what it is we need to do to 
put Canada's social security safety net on a solid foundation for 
the future.
<P>
	I have had a number of round table discussions in my riding of 
Algoma over the last few weeks. I have met with a wide 
cross-section of the community to discuss how these options 
might affect them and to elicit their feedback. I have been most 
impressed with some of the things I have learned. I will not 
dwell on those items today. I am not finished those consultations 
and in fairness to the participants, I want to give them a 
summary of those meetings. I will report their comments, the 
consensus and disagreements to the standing committee and to 
the minister by early December.
<P>
	I get the sense that Canadians agree something has to be done 
to improve how we take care of those in need, how we make sure 
our young people get a proper education, how we take care of 
older workers who find themselves displaced. I am confident 
that the proper choices will be made when legislation is 
proposed next year.
<P>
	I especially want to spend time talking about the men and 
women who have devoted their lives to building this great 
nation. I know hon. members will agree that older workers 
deserve the same consideration as do all Canadian workers. Of 
course older workers generally find change much more difficult 
to deal with than younger workers, which is quite 
understandable.
<P>
	In years past workers could count on being at a job from their 
late teens or early twenties until it was time to  retire. 
Unfortunately and regretfully times have changed and the world 
of work has changed. Our country is very much enmeshed in the 
global 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8064"> 8064 </A></B>
<P>
economy and it is not so easy for people now to look forward to a 
lifetime of work at the same workplace.
<P>
	We require of our citizens and of ourselves a lifetime of 
learning and adaptation, but there are older workers who find 
themselves trapped. We are all creatures of habit. After 
spending 25 years or more at one job it is quite a challenge to 
suddenly be out of a job and faced with finding another job. This 
is usually a shock to the worker and his family. If it is part of a 
large lay-off in the community it is a shock to the entire region.
<P>
	Canadians are resilient. We have adjusted over many decades 
and I am sure we will be able to do so in the future. This 
government is certainly not abandoning older workers during 
the reform of our social security system. They are very much 
full participants in the reform process.
<P>
	This stage of social security reform is a learning process and 
we are learning from the measures we have already taken for 
older workers. For example, I remind hon. colleagues that the 
government did not abandon older workers who were hard hit by 
the decline in a large number of this country's industries. We 
have seen tremendous dislocation over the last 10 years. We 
have not and will not abandon those in need. The coming 
changes will ensure that those in need are protected.
<P>
<B>(1720) </B>
<P>
	One program that has been most helpful and has come into 
play in a number of difficult situations is the program for older 
worker adjustment, commonly known by its acronym POWA. 
Through absolutely no fault of their own many older workers 
find themselves out of a job and sadly with very little chance of 
finding a replacement job. This is where the program for older 
worker adjustment can be so helpful.
<P>
	Canadians want us to show compassion for those individuals, 
those hard working men and women who have contributed to the 
economy of Canada for the greater part of their lives. Let me 
emphasize that POWA is not a disincentive to seek work. By 
helping older workers adjust because they cannot find a job is 
not keeping them away from the workplace but simply providing 
a safety net or a bridge until they can make an adjustment or 
until their old age pension comes into play.
<P>
	This program is only one of a broad range of options available 
to older workers. As I say, it is only one measure the government 
has taken to support older Canadian workers. POWA has been a 
carefully crafted program that addresses the needs of workers. It 
is a fine example of government innovation and partnership 
between the federal government and various provincial 
governments to provide long term income assistance to older 
workers with little or no re-employment prospects.
<P>
	I can say from personal experience and the experience of 
hundreds indeed thousands of workers in my riding of Algoma 
that a number of laid off workers have benefited from the 
program for older worker adjustment. Since 1990 we have seen 
the loss of nearly 4,000 mining jobs in the community of Elliot 
Lake. In this group of nearly 4,000 workers many hundreds have 
been in the awkward age of 55 to 60.
<P>
	The program for older worker adjustment has been of 
significant help to many hundreds of laid off workers in Elliot 
Lake and the north shore region of my riding. While POWA 
cannot solve the financial problems of every individual family, 
it can play a major part in making life a lot easier during a very 
difficult time for these laid off workers.
<P>
	I would like to point out another example of where this 
government has exhibited its extreme interest in older workers. 
In the province of New Brunswick there is the New Brunswick 
job corps program. It is a proactive program that helps older 
workers get back into the labour force. It is different from the 
program for older worker adjustment. It recognizes the need to 
try different things in different areas and is a newer initiative.
<P>
	I will explain how the New Brunswick job corps initiative 
works. I will use the example of Gilles, which is a name I will 
use for the purpose of this discussion. He is a 53-year old 
worker who was on social assistance. Like many others his age, 
he had years of work experience but could no longer find work. 
At 53 it was very difficult; the new technology had simply 
pushed him aside. He was in danger of getting caught in the 
welfare cycle and Gilles being a proud person did not want to be 
on welfare.
<P>
	Thanks to the federal government's strategic initiatives 
program, we have been working in partnership with the New 
Brunswick government and since last July Gilles has been 
employed through the New Brunswick job corps. This older 
worker is now employed by the city of Bathurst in its parks, 
recreation and tourism department. How does Gilles feel about 
this? To quote him he says: ``I would rather be here than on 
welfare''. I do not think it matters so much the kind of work 
Gilles is doing.
<P>
	I am certain all of my hon. colleagues will agree that very few 
people who find themselves on welfare, family benefits or 
unemployment insurance actually prefer to receive their income 
through those programs. As the Prime Minister has often said 
the very best form of assistance and the best form of income is a 
job. One can achieve the dignity of bringing home a paycheque 
with which to purchase the family's food and shelter.
<P>
<B>(1725) </B>
<P>
	People like Gilles, and there are many thousands, can benefit 
from the kinds of initiatives this government is bringing forward 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8065"> 8065 </A></B>
<P>
that will give people a chance to have dignity each day as they 
bring home a well earned paycheque.
<P>
	The strategic initiatives program is a partnership with the 
provinces and territories. Together we are funding projects on a 
50:50 basis. In the New Brunswick example it is a $40 million 
investment over five years. This new kind of partnership, along 
with POWA which has been in existence for a number of years, 
is an example of the leadership of this federal government in 
trying to get this country back on the right road. Another 
example is job link in Ontario, a creative idea to allow welfare 
recipients broader opportunities to get back into the workplace.
<P>
	Gilles is only one of about a thousand participants in the New 
Brunswick program. Older displaced workers between the ages 
of 50 and 65 are given a guaranteed annual income of up to 
$12,000 in return for a minimum of 26 weeks of work. It gives 
these deserving men and women the opportunity to feel good 
about themselves. They are doing meaningful work and 
contributing to the prosperity of their province.
<P>
	The strategic initiatives program is enabling us to test 
innovative and cost effective ways of reforming our social 
security system. It is helping us to determine the best approach 
to creating lasting employment, to understanding what is needed 
in education and training and to adjusting income security 
measures so they address the realities of the 1990s.
<P>
	Of course the question often comes up: What have you done 
for us lately? This past Friday on behalf of the Minister of 
Human Resources Development I was involved in the 
announcement of a major study that will eventually help us to 
understand measures needed to assist older workers and other 
laid off workers.
<P>
	This major study was announced in Elliot Lake. It will 
provide valuable information, research that is available 
nowhere in the world on what happens to the community, the 
businesses, older and younger workers, families, spouses, 
children, teenagers, when there is a major layoff in a 
community.
<P>
	The study will be undertaken by a research team from 
Laurentian University in Sudbury in co-operation with the 
community. It will study the long term effects not only on 
displaced workers but on their community.
<P>
	Something like 4,000 jobs have been lost since 1990 in a 
community where the population was roughly 18,000 and 
several more thousands in the nearby north shore. There is only 
one mine left with about 550 workers. In spite of that some 
marvellous things are happening in the community of Elliot 
Lake and the surrounding area. You would be surprised at how 
vigorously the community has responded to the tremendous 
challenges it faced when the major layoffs occurred. I am very 
proud to have this community and this region in my riding.
<P>
	I believe this study will show that this occurrence and the 
response of the community will be an example to the rest of the 
country on how to deal with major layoffs. Imagine nearly 4,000 
workers out of a population of 18,000. That is nearly 25 per cent 
of the entire population. They had good paying jobs in the 
mining  sector. Take 4,000 jobs out of a community and see what 
happens if there is no creative response.
<P>
	Come and visit the area and see the miracle that is occurring, 
the response. In fact the population did drop a little bit. It is 
about 13,500 now. Projections are that it will soon start growing 
if it has not already done so.
<P>
<B>(1730 ) </B>
<P>
	This research announcement is again a partnership initiative 
with the province. The federal government will invest a little 
over $2 million under the innovations program. I believe great 
things will be learned from this exercise.
<P>
	In Quebec the federal government recently announced joint 
assistance to help eligible unemployed older workers between 
the ages of 55 and 59 whose benefits after unemployment 
insurance and other normal assistance programs had run out. 
Major lay-offs which meet the program criteria are designated 
by federal, provincial and territorial ministers on a case by case 
basis after being assessed according to a range of socioeconomic 
factors.
<P>
	The government is not sitting back, lying down and waiting 
for things to happen. We are acting proactively to anticipate 
what Canadians need.
<P>
	This is all part of social security reform. Older workers are 
invited, in fact encouraged to give their views to the Standing 
Committee on Human Resources Development during the 
committee's current public hearings. Their input is welcome and 
will be given as much consideration as that of any Canadian. Of 
course all citizens are entitled to express their views to their 
member of Parliament. I am sure that each member will ensure 
the minister and/or the committee will hear their views. It is 
important that we reach a consensus on how to repair the social 
safety net.
<P>
	As I said earlier, older workers are full participants in social 
security reform. Through the various programs and services that 
address their needs we will gather valuable information. I assure 
the House that the information will be reflected in our 
development of new social security policies and programs.
<P>
	I have been focusing on older workers particularly. The 
critical needs of our older workers must never be forgotten. The 
workplace has changed permanently and we must be creative in 
our search for solutions.
<P>
	I would like to conclude there. I mentioned earlier the round 
tables that I have had in my riding. I have been amazed at how 
much I have learned sitting around a table with average 
Canadians. We were all equals at the table. With all due respect 
to this place, I have learned as much around the table over a cup 
of coffee with average Canadians as I often have at meetings 
here in Ottawa. It is amazing the insights that one can get and 
garner 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8066"> 8066 </A></B>
<P>
from the experiences of folks who are living with their problems 
in their communities every day.
<P>
	I encourage those members who have not already planned 
their round tables or public meetings to do so. They are well 
worth the trouble.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
throughout his speech, the hon. member had nothing but praise 
for his minister, the Minister of Human Resources 
Development. I wonder whether tomorrow morning he will go to 
his office to receive a token of appreciation.
<P>
	The hon. member said that the document we are discussing 
was the result of extensive consultations, and that is the point I 
would like to discuss: those extensive consultations that 
produced a reform to be implemented at the expense of the most 
vulnerable in our society-the unemployed or the beer drinkers, 
as they call them.
<P>
	If these consultations were so meticulous, why, when we are 
consulting the public, does the minister send his go-between to 
do the ground work in our regions? The hon. member for 
Outremont is now scouting around Quebec to get the pulse of the 
people. In my own riding, in Chicoutimi, only fifteen people 
turned out.
<P>
	This is a waste of taxpayers' money. In Jonquière, the number 
of spectators, because that is what they were more than anything 
else, was even lower, and in Roberval they had to cancel the 
consultation. Since people do not want to hear about this reform, 
because it will be at the expense of the most vulnerable in our 
society, I think the minister should do his homework all over 
again. The public consultations being conducted by the 
committee across the country are a sham.
<P>
<B>(1735 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. St. Denis:</B> Madam Speaker, I want to thank the member 
for Chicoutimi for his comments and his question, although I 
believe he has it wrong. To suggest that the member for 
Outremont needs to go out, scout around and prepare the way for 
the Minister of Human Resources Development misses the 
point.
<P>
	First, I would suggest that a turnout of 15 at the meeting he 
refers to might also suggest that people are satisfied with the 
options that have been put on the table. They were not so worried 
that they had to go out and participate. I put that forward as a 
possible explanation for the low turnout. In polls that I have 
read, something in the order of 60 to 65 per cent plus Canadians 
support the initiatives we are taking in repairing and renewing 
our social safety net.
<P>
	Canadians have confidence that we will not take measures 
that will hurt those in need. To suggest we are doing this on the 
backs of the needy flies in the face of the philosophy on which 
our proposals are based. It is an attempt to deploy dollars in a 
more effective way so that those truly in need can get the help, 
retraining or assistance they need in order to become players in 
the workplace.
<P>
	The hon. member really has it wrong. I would suggest that he 
re-read the documents. The pulse I get from talking to the 
people on the street is to keep going for the changes. Move 
ahead. Do not be worried about our detractors, those who would 
speak negatively of our initiatives. We all agree changes have to 
be made. The status quo is not acceptable.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Vaudreuil, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
listened with enthusiasm to the report by the member. I would 
like to participate in the debate by sharing what my hon. 
colleague already knows, that I get a little bit upset when I hear 
day after day, when the government advances any type of 
reform, we are doing it on the backs of the least fortunate. To use 
this as an occasion to exploit those more unfortunate for 
opportunistic reasons I find is self-serving.
<P>
	My colleague and I both sit on the finance committee and we 
listen intently to the debate that is going on about the deficit. We 
both know that if we were to attack or remove outright the 
subsidies to small businesses, as business has told us, if we were 
to tax lottery and gambling winnings, and simply do as members 
of the Bloc Quebecois have said: ``Cut government spending 
and defence spending'' by 25 per cent, I put it to the House that 
the $3 billion the finance minister needs this year and the $6 
billion the finance minister needs next year, the $9 billion could 
come from these.
<P>
	How can members of the opposition continually stand in the 
House and say that we want to reform social security on the 
backs of the unemployed, students and the least fortunate? As 
the member knows, the status quo is not acceptable, not only in 
Quebec, it is not acceptable anywhere in Canada.
<P>
	Does he not agree with me that the present programs are 
outdated, no longer respond to the needs and aspirations of 
Canadians and Quebecers alike?
<P>
	<B>Mr. St. Denis:</B> Madam Speaker, my colleague is dead on. He 
has in very few words concisely put our government's agenda in 
the proper perspective.
<P>
<B>(1740 ) </B>
<P>
	My colleagues-at least the colleagues who would admit it, 
which would be the members of my party-and I are not 
receiving from our constituents the complaints about leaving 
programs exactly the way they are. ``Do not touch them''. We 
are not receiving those kinds of comments. People generally 
recognize that change has to take place. To argue: ``Don't make 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8067"> 8067 </A></B>
<P>
changes because this will happen or the sky will fall down'' is 
totally inappropriate.
<P>
	Those in need, the poorest of the poor, need us to make 
changes so they can more properly take their place in the work 
place. One of the previous speakers from the governing party 
mentioned literacy for example. There is a 38 per cent illiteracy 
rate in Canada. Almost four out of ten Canadians experience 
some serious degree of illiteracy where they have difficulty 
functioning in number or language skills.
<P>
	This is part of what we are talking about in dealing with a 
redeployment of human resources. To say that we are doing this 
on the backs of the needy is churlish in my view. It is 
complaining for the sake of complaint. Let us get on with the 
job. Let us recognize and acknowledge that what we have done, 
as my hon. colleague said, for 20 or 30 years is not acceptable 
anymore.
<P>
	Times have changed. The world is changing. We do not want 
huge sectors of our society being left behind as we move into the 
next century. If we care about our fellow Canadians, we must 
gather them up and move together. If we do not take action now 
and improve our safety net programs, we will leave those folks 
behind. That would be a tragedy of epic proportions. We have to 
take action.
<P>
	I suggest the options that have been placed before Canadians 
are the right place to start.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sharon Hayes (Port Moody-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to address the government's 
proposed social policy review today. I have been pleased to take 
the charge the government has suggested to participate in 
fostering informed public debate by taking up the debate in my 
constituency in the last several weeks.
<P>
	Today I would like to spend the majority of my time on the 
issue of the family as it relates to child care. First let me echo the 
surprise and concern of some of my constituents as I talked to 
them in the past while.
<P>
	First, when the whole social security program was presented, 
including old age security, the CPP and federal government 
transfers to provinces for established programs and 
equalization, the people in my community were convinced that 
surely we cannot avoid reducing expenditures in social program 
areas, as this represents a very major portion of government 
expenditures.
<P>
	In fact at present rates of growth in these very programs, 
social program expenditure and debt service charges alone will 
exceed our total revenue in government within just a few years. 
Cuts must be made. However, they feel that taxes must not be 
increased, specifically as relates to our CAP. They were shocked 
to hear that the federal government forbids a work component in 
any welfare assistance.
<P>
	There were a few things they were shocked about. They were 
shocked to hear of the unsecured liability of over $500 billion, 
as great as the federal debt, in the CPP program alone. They 
were angry at a government that would possibly consider 
taxation of RRSPs when its own security programs for seniors, 
including the old age security program, are becoming totally 
unsustainable.
<P>
	Changes must be made to provide a social security system that 
addresses the real needs now and for the future of our citizens.
<P>
<B>(1745) </B>
<P>
	As we speak of the future, I would like to spend the majority 
of my allotted time on the foundation for that future. The 
Reform Party believes in the importance of strengthening and 
protecting the family unit as essential to the well-being of 
individuals in society.
<P>
	The family, I believe, is the fundamental building block of our 
society. Not only is it the best institution for the transfer and 
protection of values, of culture and of social stability, it is the 
very best institution for the practical realization of our social 
policy renewal.
<P>
	I stand distinct in this House today in the fact that my 
background has basically been one of a homemaker. I have heard 
in this House people complain about different programs that 
government proposes or that are actually in existence that make 
one spouse dependent on another.
<P>
	I am not sure that is always a bad idea. A dependency in our 
social structure between people especially if those people can 
create a unit that will indeed strengthen the base of society is not 
a bad thing. There is strength in numbers. There is strength in 
combination of talents. There is strength in bringing viewpoints 
together.
<P>
	Our society must be built on values such as commitment and 
understanding, shared goals and willingness to sacrifice. These 
things are epitomized in our families and they should be 
honoured in that situation.
<P>
	Recently while attending the Standing Committee on Justice 
concerning changes to the Young Offenders Act I was not at all 
surprised to hear a witness remark that he felt that government 
legislation had worked against families.
<P>
	I see it often in my constituency office in stories from 
distraught parents as to how those provincial and federal laws, 
their programs and their bureaucracy have affected their 
children, their ability to make a living and even their hope for 
their future.
<P>
	Short term planning and ever escalating government 
programs have removed authority from parents. They have 
skewed their responsibilities in all directions and even hinted 
that perhaps they should not even work together in the home, it 
is better to work outside the home, and then they diverted their 
energies from their families into basic economic survival.
<P>
	With the social policy review, once again the government 
proposes new and bigger programs that will adversely affect 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8068"> 8068 </A></B>
<P>
families. Even presently according to the children's bureau 
federal spending on children exceeds $15 billion a year.
<P>
	Again much of the government's social policy focus is not on 
families but on children and more specifically to our discussion 
today the issue of the best care for our children. Like all 
Canadians, I would like to see the most effective means 
available to create opportunity for the families of these children.
<P>
	This solution, however, may not be-I do not believe it is in 
government programs-only addressed to children. Children 
are a part of families.
<P>
	Specifically as relates to child poverty, the backgrounder to 
the discussion paper reads: ``The very best way to fight child 
poverty is for parents of poor families to have a job''. Given the 
present levels of government debt and spending, potentially 
made even worse as I have mentioned by increased government 
programs, let us take a closer look at this statement.
<P>
	What happens when a family gets a job, particularly when a 
single parent family gets a job? May I suggest that single parent 
families or one earner families have a very difficult time in 
making ends meet even now. Let me explain.
<P>
	Recent statistics out of Port Moody-Coquitlam, my home 
riding, tell us that over 80 per cent of families are composed of a 
husband and wife and 12 per cent to 16 per cent, depending on 
the community, are single parents. Surprising to some, this 
actually is quite consistent with out national statistics.
<P>
	Nationally approximately 80 per cent of families are dual 
parents. Twenty per cent are single parents and that is up from 
approximately 17 per cent in 1981. Of concern are the low 
income families, that is those that fall below the StatsCan low 
income cut off point.
<P>
	What I found interesting was that over one-half of single 
female parent families, precisely 51.6 per cent, are low income 
when they work. They have a job but they are still low income. 
Almost one-quarter of one earner dual parent families are low 
income. These tell me that a job alone is not enough. One earner 
is not enough.
<P>
<B>(1750) </B>
<P>
	What is there in this make-up that encourages the single 
parent to actually get a job? There is not much. Over half of them 
will still be in a low income category.
<P>
	Given our present unacceptable high taxation directly 
resulting from continued government debt, spending and 
continued government program creation this poverty trap 
cannot be solved by a job alone.
<P>
	Recently during consultations in my riding I had a long 
discussion with a single mom. She already was having to do 
dishes at two o'clock in the morning after juggling work, child 
care and unfortunately right now time with a sick elderly parent. 
She was asking me what more can she do. When I said to her that 
the family should be the primary care giver she asked me if we 
were asking her to do more. She just could not comprehend her 
ability to do more than she is already doing.
<P>
	However, it is ever increasing government spending that will 
end up asking her to do more in the long run. Less and less of 
what she earns when she is working will be put toward her 
family. It is decreased government spending, decreased 
government programs at all levels that will actually free her to 
make more decisions and to apply her time the way she should.
<P>
	We are simply asking that the government do less and allow 
her greater choices with her consequently saved tax dollars. 
Such savings would allow individuals such as this single mom to 
be more self-reliant. Families would be able to choose their 
child care. Communities would benefit from the increased local 
resources and businesses would thrive and share in programs to 
support their local needs. This is a real long term and far 
reaching solution.
<P>
	Government economic and fiscal policies not only affect the 
income levels of Canadians, StatsCan figures reveal the average 
middle class after tax income was $39,500 in 1980 and by 1991 
that figure had dropped to $37,200. Government economic 
policies have actually been instrumental in forcing dual parent 
families into dual earner families simply to make ends meet. 
Presently most Canadian parents are in the workforce including 
those with preschool children because of the demands of taxes in 
their lives.
<P>
	The federal government presently spends more than $400 
million every year on institutionalized day care. Its red ink book 
promises $720 million more tax dollars over three years on 
subsidization or the creation of up to 150,000 new child care 
spaces. The 1994 budget promised $360 million tax dollars 
toward a national day care program over two years if economic 
growth hit 3 per cent this year.
<P>
	Reformers totally reject such a program regardless of our 
economic growth. Child care should be a personal choice. I 
along with many Canadians believe that the very best care is in 
the home. Canadians reflect that in their present decisions. 
According to a 1994 Statistics Canada report less than 40 per 
cent of child care presently takes place in day care centres.
<P>
	In my riding of Port Moody-Coquitlam the clear choice of 
child care for most parents is to have their children in the care of 
a sitter, a neighbour or a relative. Private child care is a natural 
part of many neighbourhoods. Moms with young children can 
opt to care for their own children and the children of working 
neighbours. Communities can work together. Child care needs 
are met in the communities.
<P>
	The government's proposal would create unnecessary spaces 
at a high cost to the taxpayer. Subsidization exclusively for their 
programs would coerce participation in government facilities 
over more casual arrangements as well as create yet another 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8069"> 8069 </A></B>
<P>
penalty against that parent who chooses to stay home to raise his 
or her own child out of their own convictions.
<P>
<B>(1755) </B>
<P>
	Relating to the government child care activities in the 
national day care program, let me read yet another interesting 
quote from the social policy review discussion paper: ``Linking 
child care and child development could represent a 
comprehensive and preventative approach to social problems at 
the earliest point in life. Rather than using our money to rectify 
social problems which eventually occur as a result of a lack of 
support or security for young children, investment at the front 
end could save us enormously in both human and financial costs 
10 to 20 years down the road''.
<P>
	The parent state seems alive and well in this government's 
agenda. What I read here is a government that feels it is a better 
parent than a parent of the child. It is no secret that failed full 
employment policies and failed nanny state systems of the past 
10 to 20 years are now being lived out through social turmoil in 
the former Soviet Union. It proved, and it will be proved again, 
that the state is not the best parent. A healthy family with a full 
choice for child care is the very best way to create a healthy 
society.
<P>
	We propose that child care programs must subsidize financial 
need and not the method of child care chosen. Any such subsidy 
must be directed to the children and to the parents, not the 
institution and professionals, in order to allow a full choice of 
that care including the choice of the parent to stay home.
<P>
	Surely a government which would consider direct payment of 
fees to students in its latest program of student fee transfers 
would consider the validity of a direct payment of child care 
costs to the parents of the child.
<P>
	We support the regulation of day care standards but at the 
provincial level. It is at this level that medical and social 
services and the decisions that go with them are made. These 
relate directly with the needs of day care regulations. More 
fundamentally, as so much of the issue of the need for child care 
stems from economic factors, we support the concept of income 
splitting between legally married couples to help support and 
nurture families. Why should a family with a single wage be 
penalized with higher taxes than dual earners with the same total 
income?
<P>
	Another more possibly distant solution would be a system of 
flat tax for all Canadians. I am encouraged as members from 
both sides of the House investigate this as a possibility. Within 
such a system accommodation could be made for the needed 
care of children through social assistance program support 
where it is needed, at the level closest to that need.
<P>
	This government can continue to promote short term 
solutions. More government programs will demand more 
taxpayer dollars. The need for the increased taxpayer dollars 
means less money for individual use. Decreased disposable 
income will create fewer real jobs and less incentive to work and 
in turn will create more poverty, which in turn will create more 
poor children.
<P>
	We need long term vision for the solutions. We reject a 
national day care program. Fewer government programs will 
allow individual Canadians to have choice and self-reliance. 
Families and their importance in our society will be enhanced 
for stronger communities.
<P>
	We speak often of citizenship and the necessity of 
participation in the community. It is time the government 
dropped the rhetoric and faced reality. I believe, and may I add 
that single mom agrees with me, that our sense of citizenship 
and belonging will come through our strength as families and 
our participation as families in our communities.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I wish to thank my colleague from Port 
Moody-Coquitlam for her remarks. I have to say that I think 
she makes some very good points. The member talked about a 
national day care program. There are still a lot of questions that 
have to be answered with respect to day care.
<P>
<B>(1800) </B>
<P>
	If I may, I will point out to her a little experience I had just 
recently with respect to that issue which might throw some light 
on it for her. It concerns a meeting I was at where a for profit 
lobbyist found her firm in a confrontation. They were hired by a 
private day care centre in a community to get established in that 
community. They were up against a publicly funded day care 
advocacy organization, in other words a special interest group. 
This special interest group which was supporting national day 
care and government controlled day care won the issue and the 
privately funded day care centre was forced to close.
<P>
	When we approach the issue of a national day care program, I 
think we all agree that the opportunity must be there however the 
opportunity is expressed. I think government has to be alert to 
the fact that we have a lobby group out there now that has for 
many years been funded by government and that lobby group is 
very alive and active.
<P>
	I certainly agree with the member that this is something we 
should debate. I certainly do not have my mind made up on it. I 
think we can carry it forward but I hope the debate will be done 
between ourselves or out in the community rather than without 
the intervention of special interest groups.
<P>
	I do not know whether the member would like to comment on 
that but I would invite her to do so.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8070"> 8070 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Hayes:</B> Madam Speaker, I appreciate the member's 
comments. I certainly am interested in the anecdote that he 
mentioned.
<P>
	This is probably the way things will progress given the 
present scenario of government involvement in day care. It will 
become increasingly impossible for an alternative to exist. This 
is the point I was trying to make. It will take away the choice 
from parents in communities and force on them a government 
dictated and funded program which will end up being more 
expensive.
<P>
	The root of this problem and so much of what has happened 
with government funded programs is around those special 
interest industries, shall we say, the very people who are 
employed and get their future security rally around the programs 
that the government proposes and then build their industry on 
that. I have seen it in immigration and in different areas of 
government involvement. If there is money to be had, security 
of employment and an opportunity for garnering government 
funds, we can be sure hands will be out and people will be there.
<P>
	This is certainly a problem with national day care especially 
as the government funds the institutions and the professionals 
that are involved rather than the families. Maybe that comes 
back to me underlining what I mentioned in my talk. If funds are 
needed to support child care that money should go to the parents 
for them to make the choice and be able to put wheels on that 
choice by choosing what they feel is the best care.
<P>
	Giving the money to the professionals, giving the money to 
the day care centres simply creates that special interest 
environment. Those people will be there to encourage a 
self-perpetuation of that system. That is not to the betterment of 
our families, our kids or our communities. I thank the member 
for his comment.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
was interested to hear what the hon. member had to say, 
especially when she talked about preserving the family unit, 
which is the nucleus of our society, and I think everyone in this 
House would agree wholeheartedly with that view.
<P>
	Today, however, we must realize that as a result of this 
reform, the family as we know it will change. We will be left 
with only two kinds of families. We will have very rich families 
with a lot of tax shelters and very poor families. The middle 
class will disappear altogether. What kind of country will we 
have as a result? A very wealthy class and a very poor class. No 
more room for the middle class.
<P>
<B>(1805) </B>
<P>
	You also pointed out that you were against introducing 
measures for spouses. I respect that, and I agree.
<P>
	Today, employers and employees pay very high 
unemployment insurance premiums. You said that to help 
families, it was necessary to create jobs, and not temporary jobs 
but well-paying jobs. In that case, in order to create jobs and to 
help employers and SMEs create jobs, present UI premium rates 
should be reduced.
<P>
	I would appreciate hearing the views of the hon. member and 
her caucus on the possibility of reducing UI premium rates for 
employers and employees in the very near future.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Hayes:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
comments. There were two major points made. I will address the 
first one. There are two kinds of families, the wealthy and, 
increasingly, the poor as indeed the middle class seems to be 
buffeted on all sides.
<P>
	What is it that is destroying our middle class? The very thing 
that is taking the power and the resources from that middle class 
is the increase in the government programs that are ever 
increasing its taxes.
<P>
	The poor become trapped in a cycle of not breaking out of 
poverty because, for instance, single parents families get jobs 
but earn hardly more than they receive on welfare. They choose 
not to because it works against themselves to do so.
<P>
	I believe the best way is a fair taxation system and 
government only doing what it has to do so that the resources are 
left in the hands of Canadians. A fair taxation system, for 
instance the flat tax system I suggested, would fairly treat 
wealthy and middle class, and allow and accommodate for 
poorer people so that Canadians would be able to use the money 
to address the needs they have. That way I believe the middle 
class can survive and the families of the middle class can 
survive. The more government we have the worse it is.
<P>
	I am not sure I quite understood the second half of the 
member's question. Again it may go back to the same 
philosophy. I agree we should not be asking for more 
government assistance for programs. The government money 
should go to people who need that money. Our social assistance 
programs should be designed to be targeted only to those who 
need them and if it is a social program, whether it be day care, 
UI, or any of the other many programs that are there. We could 
take it right to the equalization to provinces. Social spending 
should go only to the people who need it. Perhaps then 
employees and employers and indeed the families represented in 
those relationships would have more money to do what they 
need to do.
<P>
	I am not sure I answered the question but again it goes to less 
government involvement, therefore less government spending, 
better targeting for government spending long term. That is a 
solution to most of these problems.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8071"> 8071 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Lincoln, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, it is 
certainly a pleasure for me to have the opportunity to rise today 
and speak to this motion. I would like to focus my comments 
on the opportunities that Canadians have for input into the 
social security reform process and to encourage Canadians to 
participate.
<P>
<B>(1810 ) </B>
<P>
	Certainly, social security reform is one of the most important 
initiatives undertaken by government in many years. Canadians 
have an unprecedented number of ways of making their voices 
heard on this particular subject. All Canadians must be able to 
have their say on how we should rebuild the Canadian social 
safety network for the 21st century.
<P>
	Let me outline the many ways in which Canadians will have 
an opportunity to share their concerns, ideas and solutions on 
how to redesign our programs. These consultations will help to 
make our programs not only more efficient but certainly more 
effective, which is one the big goals of this whole social security 
reform.
<P>
	It has been about six or seven weeks since the launch of the 
discussion paper. Public interest in the document has certainly 
been quite high and remains high. Since October 5 the ministry 
has received over 12,000 calls requesting material and 
information. In total, we have distributed about 114,000 copies 
of the discussion paper and almost 210,000 copies of the 
summaries of that discussion paper.
<P>
	We want a mutual exchange of ideas with the public on the 
federal government's initiative to reform social security and we 
want to hear from as many Canadians as possible. To encourage 
this we have recently released a workbook called ``Have your 
say'' which seeks the public's input on our social security 
reform options. We supplied a postage paid envelope in each 
workbook for the return of the response. All answers mailed 
prior to January 16, 1995, will be part of a final published report 
on what Canadians have said.
<P>
	As well we will be sending the Standing Committee on 
Human Resources Development an interim report in late 
December. The analysis of the responses will be conducted by 
D.R. Harley Consultants Limited, an Ottawa based firm which 
assisted in the development of the workbook to ensure its 
objectivity.
<P>
	The workbook is widely available through postal outlets, 
Canada Employment Centres, many grocery stores, the YM and 
YWCAs across Canada. It is also available by calling the 1-800 
number, a toll free number, or by calling your local member of 
Parliament.
<P>
	The 1-800 line is a source of information and an avenue for 
Canadians to express their views on social security reform. 
Canadians have already made extensive use of this line and it 
continues to be heavily used. I think this alone is a prime 
example of the importance that Canadians place on social 
security reform and the government's commitment to hearing 
their views.
<P>
	In addition to the workbook and the 1-800 line, Canadians 
have an unprecedented number of ways to make their voices 
heard on social security reform.
<P>
	The Department of Human Resources Development Canada 
has produced a wealth of information on the reform that is 
available to the public. The information is not only available in 
print and alternative formats, but much of it is also available to 
Canadians on the information highway.
<P>
	The Standing Committee on Human Resources Development 
is the focal point for the consultations on this reform. All other 
forms of consultation will be fed into the standing committee for 
its final report.
<P>
	We should not forget that the committee is comprised of 
members from the three largest parties represented in this 
House. I am pleased to say that there is significant interest in 
appearing before that committee. More than 80 national 
organizations appeared before the committee between October 
26 and November 8 of this year. In general, these national 
organizations supported the need for reform and the principles 
laid out in that discussion paper. Most groups expressed a wide 
range of concerns about the specific options available in that 
paper.
<P>
	The committee has now started its consultations with 
Canadians. Fifteen members of the committee will travel for 
five weeks to 22 cities and towns in provinces across this great 
country. This will present Canadians, whether they live in an 
urban or rural setting, in the far north or in downtown Toronto, 
the same opportunity to participate. Once again, interest from 
the public has been overwhelming. Nearly 500 requests came 
into the committee from the western portion of its trip. The 
committee is making every effort to hear from as many groups 
and individuals as possible.
<P>
	Those who cannot appear have the opportunity to submit a 
brief before December 9, 1994, so that committee members can 
benefit from the widest range of views and ideas. We would 
encourage Canadians who may not be able to appear before the 
committee or attend any of the local workshops presented by 
members of Parliament to submit a brief to the committee before 
December 9.
<P>
<B>(1815 ) </B>
<P>
	Social security reform consultation encourages each member 
of Parliament to become involved in these consultations. 
Working within their own constituencies to inform the 
electorate, MPs provide Canadians with yet another avenue to 
express their concerns, ideas and solutions on how to redesign 
Canada's social security system.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8072"> 8072 </A></B>
<P>
	Recently I had the pleasure of hosting a social security 
workshop in my riding of Lincoln. Approximately 70 
constituents took the time to come out and address their 
concerns. They raised a number of important issues.
<P>
	They felt that government must remove the disincentives to 
work and that government should provide some sort of income 
supplement but only to those individuals who need it. We must 
stop duplicating training programs. We need to work with 
industry and the provinces to ensure that they are efficient and 
practical. Industry and government have to work together to 
ensure that programs meet the needs of tomorrow's workers. We 
should look at more effective ways of forecasting for jobs. We 
also had widespread endorsement for the idea of restructuring 
student loans based on the ability for students to repay those 
loans.
<P>
	Since the release of the discussion paper more than 190 public 
town hall meetings have been planned by members of 
Parliament, including several members from across the floor. 
The feedback we have been getting is that Canadians understand 
the need for reform and recognize that change is not only 
inevitable but essential. Canadians may differ on the solutions 
but whether these town hall meetings are held in Bridgewater or 
Whitehorse, Canadians want to be an integral part of the 
dialogue and the debate.
<P>
	Community agencies are getting involved in the consultation 
process. Agencies such as the United Way, the Laurier Institute, 
the Atlantic Provinces Economic Agency and the Institute of 
Urban Studies at the University of Winnipeg are organizing 
seminars across the country on social security reform. The 
seminars are designed to provide Canadians some of whom are 
the individuals most affected by social security reform with an 
opportunity to offer their views. I am pleased to report that some 
500 Canadians are taking part in these seminars.
<P>
	Finally, a series of four policies colloquia will provide an 
opportunity for experts to brainstorm on some of these options 
in the areas of lifelong learning, post-secondary education, 
training and employment development services and child 
poverty. These colloquia will take place in January 1995 and are 
being organized by institutes such as Caledon and the 
Conference Board.
<P>
	The purpose of these colloquia is to broaden the dialogue on 
some of the more contentious issues associated with social 
security reform. These issues are identified in a discussion 
paper but have not to date been fully addressed in briefs, 
submissions or other forms of consultation.
<P>
	As this update illustrates we are serious about consulting with 
Canadians. The public may be heard through the 1-800 number, 
the workbook, the standing committee, their MPs at town hall 
meetings, in consultation seminars and through policy 
colloquia. In addition, Canadians are encouraged to write 
directly to their member of Parliament or to the Minister of 
Human  Resources Development or to fax or send electronic 
mail to the minister. We want as many Canadians as possible to 
take part in rebuilding our social security system to meet the 
needs of Canadians today and into the 21st century.
<P>
	I want to make a couple of points based on the discussion I 
heard today from a number of colleagues from across the floor. 
One of the first speakers today from the Reform Party had 
indicated they wanted government to say more on this 
consultation process. The purpose of the consultation is to hear 
from Canadians and not to bias the discussion in any way, to 
make sure that the whole process is very transparent and open. 
We are doing that.
<P>
	The other comment was that we need to act now and that we do 
not need to consult any more. I do not believe this type of 
consultation has happened before. It has never happened before. 
Government will show leadership by taking action after 
listening to Canadians. We will be acting in a way that reflects 
Canadians' concerns.
<P>
	Another comment made was that taxpayers' money was being 
spent uselessly. I beg to differ. As I mentioned in my discussion 
constituents in my riding came out to speak with me. The 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Human Resources 
Development came out to meet with the people of Lincoln to 
discuss and consult on what the options were. We heard what 
some of those options were and received feedback from 
constituents.
<P>
<B>(1820) </B>
<P>
	I will close by saying that our government will listen and lead. 
That is the leadership Canadians have asked for and that is the 
type they will receive from this government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it is always a pleasure to rise in the House after 
listening to the Liberals describe how they have discovered 
consultation after 125 years of sharing power with the 
Conservatives. It is long overdue but a very welcome discovery. 
We would recommend it to them at any time.
<P>
	It begs the question of course: What were they doing for the 
previous nine years as they sat in opposition? What were they 
doing with their red book? It is a good thing it did not take them 
as long to organize the red book as it has taken them to organize 
what needs to be done here. It could be that what we have in front 
of us is a softening up process.
<P>
	Everyone agrees that changes have to be made. Everyone in 
the country knows we cannot go on the way we have been and 
that changes are required and must be made. We all agree on the 
principle, it is the policies that are going to be a little difficult.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8073"> 8073 </A></B>
<P>
	I would ask my hon. colleague from Lincoln who has 
delivered such an impassioned, reasoned address: What should 
be the criteria? He mentioned in his discourse that the criteria 
for social benefits must be based on need which would preclude 
then that social benefits should be determined by want. They 
should be addressed on need and certainly I think most 
members in this House would concur. What will be the criteria 
for need? Has the hon. member opposite given any thought to 
what the criteria should be for those who are to receive social 
benefits from the taxpayer?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Valeri:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
question. I would certainly like to recognize once again that the 
hon. member does agree with the whole process and I thank him. 
We are certainly on the right track. I am hearing from my 
constituents that consultation is long overdue and is something 
our government is moving on quite rapidly.
<P>
	When I reflected in my discussion on what the town hall 
participants said I was reflecting what my constituents have said 
to me. One of those things is to assess our programs and try to 
make them more effective and more efficient.
<P>
	When it comes to need, we are absorbing that information 
from the constituents and from the various sources of 
information and different processes that are available. Once the 
consultation period is over we will be coming forward with very 
concrete responses to that question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Dromisky (Thunder Bay-Atikokan, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I was most impressed with the delivery and the 
content of the message given by the hon. member for Lincoln, as 
well as the hon. member across the way from Edmonton 
Southwest.
<P>
	<B>Mr. DeVillers:</B> Somewhat less.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dromisky:</B> But somewhat less.
<P>
	However, the member across the way recognized the 
importance of the red book this government has been using for 
guidance, a bible as one might call it.
<P>
	This publication is the result of the efforts and contributions 
of tens of thousands of people over a two year period. It is a 
beautiful example that for the first time in the history of this 
country the democratic process was put into operation prior to 
an election over a very lengthy period of time. It produced an 
enlightened document and provides us with the guidance we so 
require in order to guide this country out of the turmoil it is 
presently in.
<P>
<B>(1825 ) </B>
<P>
	I would like to point out, as the member for Lincoln has 
pointed out, that the democratic process we have been using is 
very time consuming. It is true. If this was a dictatorial system, 
we would have an answer immediately. Because we adhere to 
basic, democratic principles, we will always listen to the people 
for guidance. That is exactly what we have been doing with  the 
document pertaining to our social network and social services.
<P>
	As a result, from coast to coast, a multitude of strategies have 
been put into operation. We are, as our eloquent speaker has 
already pointed out, receiving the type of guidance that is 
required to be sure that no one is suffering because of drastic 
changes in financial support or human resources or any kind of 
policy whatsoever.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Valeri:</B> Madam Speaker, I can only repeat once more that 
the whole process is about listening first and then leading. That 
is the leadership Canadians have asked for and that is the type of 
leadership they will receive from the government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I too 
have a question or some comments for the hon. member. We 
have seen two types of consultation take place in regard to this 
process. The first type is members of Parliament consulting 
directly with their constituents. Certainly Reform has been 
doing that for some time. I am pleased to see that the Liberals 
have picked that part up. That consultation has been very useful.
<P>
	The second type of consultation has been through the human 
resources development committee. That is the travelling road 
show. It has been much less successful. I liked the hon. members 
comments on that.
<P>
	A young person approached me in my constituency. He said 
he had been invited first of all to Calgary to meet with the 
minister to discuss advanced education on less than 24 hours' 
notice. This young person was then invited to the meeting in 
Edmonton. He was cancelled from the meeting in Edmonton. 
The person who told him he was cancelled said to him that the 
committee is in a shambles.
<P>
	I would like the hon. member to comment on that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Valeri:</B> Madam Speaker, I want to address the hon. 
member's comment on consultation. Certainly he realizes that 
he does not have a monopoly on consulting with his 
constituents. The Liberal Party has been doing that for some 
time.
<P>
	As far as the committee is concerned and whether it is 
working properly, nearly 500 requests came into the committee 
for the western portion of its trip. The committee is functioning. 
Canadians have an opportunity to appear before the committee 
and I encourage more to do so.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Hamilton West, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
want to congratulate the hon. member for Lincoln for his speech 
this afternoon. Obviously the hon. member has a firm grasp on 
the importance and relevance of this issue to Canadians and to 
his constituents in the riding of Lincoln.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="8074"> 8074 </A></B>
<P>
	As far as the member from Windbag, Saskatchewan, what is 
it, Gasbag, Saskatchewan, I have to say that I find it somewhat 
humorous if not ironic, maybe even hypocritical, when we hear 
the reforming social security part of this agenda for growth here 
in this great country of Canada-
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
My hon. colleague opposite referred to Windbag, Saskatchewan. 
I wonder if the Chair might ask the member opposite to be a bit 
more explicit. Did he mean Windbag, Alberta?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keyes:</B> If there was time allowed, I would get into much 
detail on this hon. member's riding. As I said, the hypocrisy I 
see here is that we are talking about reforming social security as 
part of our agenda for growth.
<P>
	This is a concept that the Reform Party does not quite grasp. 
We know the Prime Minister, the Minister for Human Resources 
Development, all Canadians, those in my riding of Hamilton 
West, or in the riding of Lincoln, where the hon. member hails 
from, realize that these programs put together will put people 
and jobs together. The programs we have today do not do that 
well enough and we are making sure that it will be working for 
Canadians in the future.
<P>
<B>(1830) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Valeri:</B> Madam Speaker, I certainly concur with what my 
hon. friend has said in that there is much need for reform of these 
policies. These policies have been in existence for a long time, 
for decades. Canadians are looking for more effective ways of 
dealing with these policies. This reform process and the 
consultation process will point us in that direction.
<P>

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">ADJOURNMENT PROCEEDINGS</H2>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 
deemed to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="PEARSONINTERNATIONALAIRPORT">PEARSON INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it seems to be a fairly standard procedure for me to end 
up in adjournment proceedings whenever I ask a question of the 
Minister of Transport. The purpose of adjournment proceedings 
is to try and get an answer when you did not get either a full 
answer or any answer at all during Question Period. That occurs 
almost every time I pose a question to that minister.
<P>
	The question that brought me here tonight is can the Minister 
of Transport advise the House how he justifies denying any 
Canadian the right of due process? It is not the first time I have 
asked that question and it is not the first time that the minister 
has declined to answer.
<P>
	The minister instead came up with his usual type of rhetoric. 
One of the comments he made, which of course I have heard 
before, is that I want to help my friends, that I want to help my 
Tory friends.
<P>
	I would deal with that the same way I would deal with it when 
it has been brought up before. Only 18.5 per cent of those on the 
Pearson consortium were known to have close Tory ties, while 
over 50 per cent are known to have close Liberal ties. I have 
never heard the minister suggest that I am out to help the 
Liberals, although God knows they could use some help.
<P>
	What I would ask instead is with regard to due process. How 
can he justify denying it to any Canadian?
<P>
	Had the Pearson consortium been made up of American 
companies or Mexican companies, the minister would have had 
to give them the right of due process because it is guaranteed 
under the North American free trade agreement signed by the 
Liberal government.
<P>
	Interestingly, the Prime Minister rose in this House in early 
October and stated for the record that José Salinas Mendoza, a 
sexual predator who has been deported from this country and is 
back again now claiming refugee status, has the right to due 
process.
<P>
	I had a conversation on air with the chairman of the Standing 
Committee on Transport who says that is not valid, that is 
criminal law and we are not dealing in Pearson with criminal 
law, while the NAFTA argument was civil law.
<P>
	Civil law or criminal law notwithstanding, it seems that 
everyone including foreign companies and illegal immigrants 
have the right of due process. Why will the minister not grant 
that to Canadians?
<P>
	This could set a dangerous, unbelievable precedent for all 
kinds of different companies and organizations throughout 
Canada that have contracts with government.
<P>
	Where is the actual break point between what happens with 
Pearson and what happens with any other company in Canada 
that has a contract with the government?
<P>
	The minister said in answer to my question, an alleged 
answer, that if this thing ends up in the court the court could find 
that the contract was valid and entered into in good faith, in 
which case damages would be awarded, and we do not want to 
pay that money, so consequently we will ban them from the 
court.
<P>
	He also said Reform has no respect for the court or the law. On 
the contrary, we have respect for both of those institutions and, 
more important, we have respect for all Canadians and their 
right to due process.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="8075"> 8075 </A></B>
<P>
	I will repeat my question to the minister, hopefully to get an 
answer. How do they justify denying the right of due process 
to any Canadian or Canadian company?
<P>
	<B>Mr. George S. Rideout (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Natural Resources, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I stand 
here amazed by the member's approach to this issue. The real 
question must be is anybody on the top side of God's green earth 
prepared to defend this deal on its merits? Is the member 
defending the way the members of the now defunct 
Conservative administration set up this deal? Do we understand 
from this that the member is defending the consortium's right to 
$445 million of taxpayers' money when it did not put one new 
nail in the terminal, did not paint a wall and did not pour a drop 
of concrete?
<P>
	It is up to Parliament to decide on the public policy and to 
defend the interest of taxpayers. Out of curiosity, is there anyone 
else on that side of the House who would believe that we should 
increase the deficit by $445 million in one fell swoop?
<P>
	The Reform Party decries the length of time it takes to go 
through due process for individuals, wanting us to tell judges 
what they should be doing. When it comes to taking care of the 
taxpayer, after this government reviewed the process and public 
policy questions on this deal, the Reform Party cries for due 
process.
<P>
	Sure, the member wants due process for his new found Tory 
friends who are anxious to protect their claim for $445 million 
of taxpayers' money. People on the west coast must be reeling 
trying to keep up with the Reform Party and its new found ties to 
the erstwhile targets in the Senate. They have had the experience 
of watching their members embrace a $445 million Tory trip to 
the trough and now we have the incredible sight of the 
Reformers in bed with their Tory bosom buddies in the other 
place taking a final fling up the coast.
<P>
	I can promise that we will be vigilant in protecting the 
taxpayers' interests especially in light of the apparent 
abandonment of any fiscal responsibility by the party opposite.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Pursuant to Standing 
Order 38(5), the motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to 
have been adopted. Accordingly, this House stands adjourned 
until tomorrow at 10 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 6.36 p.m.)
