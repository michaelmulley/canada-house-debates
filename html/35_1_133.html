	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have a point of order regarding a conversation you and I had 
yesterday concerning a newspaper article that came out recently 
in the Ottawa <I>Citizen</I>. You had some concern that I was 
questioning the integrity of the Chair.
<P>
	I would like to put on the record that I in no way am imputing 
any motives to you and that I am not questioning the integrity of 
the Chair or the Speaker.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I take it then there is a complete withdrawal of 
any statements which were attributed to her in the article?

	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise in the House today to present two 
petitions. The first petition is on behalf of 40 residents of 
Edmonton Southwest and was put together by Lynette Ruptash. 
It asks that physicians not get involved in the taking of lives but 
to save lives. It brings to our attention the fact that the majority 
of Canadians are law-abiding citizens who respect the law and 
the sanctity of human life. The second petition has 30 
signatures. It also asks that physicians not be involved in the 
taking of human life. It is against the whole notion of euthanasia 
and it is my pleasure to present it to the House.

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="WORLDTRADEORGANIZATIONAGREEMENTIMPLEMENTATIONACT">WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION AGREEMENT 
IMPLEMENTATION ACT</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (for the Minister for International 
Trade)</B> moved that Bill C-57, an act to implement the agreement 
establishing the World Trade Organization, be read the third 
time and passed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mac Harb (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Trade, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the legislation we are 
considering today at third reading, Bill C-57, an act to 
implement the agreement establishing the World Trade 
Organization, will ensure the implementation of the GATT 
Uruguay round agreement which the Minister for International 
Trade signed on behalf of Canada in Marrakech on April 15, 
1994.
<P>
	Adoption of this legislation would enable Canada to reap the 
benefits of the biggest trade deal in history by creating a more 
open and stable international trading environment. This 
agreement will generate increased Canadian exports and 
investment which are crucial to Canada's continuing prosperity 
in the achievement of the government's jobs and growth agenda.
<P>
<B>(1010 ) </B>
<P>
	Since the second world war Canada's trade with other 
countries has risen by over 70 per cent as a share of the gross 
domestic product. This is due to trade liberalization, our ability 
to explore trade opportunities and a reduction of average tariff 
rates to Canada from over 10 per cent to an average as low as 3 
per cent in 1992 figures. While this alone may not be directly 
responsible for economic growth, one can clearly conclude that 
trade liberalization and the removal of trade barriers such as 
tariffs can generate economic gains while at the same time 
create jobs.
<P>
	Free trade and trade agreements have to be fair, 
comprehensive and transparent. Despite some of the unresolved 
trade issues between Canada and our trading partners, I believe 
that Canada's trade interests are served today more than ever 
before. Since the adoption of the first general agreement on 
tariffs and trade, GATT, in the 1940s, global production has 
increased over five times and the quality of life has improved for 
trading countries. Many trade barriers were removed and many 
third world countries moved up to join the ranks of developed 
economies. However, there is still room for improvement.
<P>
	Before assuming office the government made it clear that we 
would continue to support the GATT as a cornerstone of 
Canada's trade policy. We undertook to focus our effort on 
breaking the deadlock in the Uruguay round negotiation and on 
building a new World Trade Organization. This legislation is the 
fruit of those efforts. The Uruguay round was the largest, most 
comprehensive trade negotiation ever undertaken.
<P>
	The final package contains over 30 agreements, 
understandings and declarations. These agreements made many 
important gains for Canada. The following stand out as 
highlights for us.
<P>
	First, the market access package includes the largest tariff 
deal in history with most industrial tariffs being cut by at least 
one-third. Second, the agricultural sector is brought under the 
rules based multilateral regime for the first time ever. Third, 
trade and services and trade related intellectual properties are 
brought within the framework of multilateral disciplines. 
Fourth, the agreement thoroughly reforms and strengthens 
subsidy and trade remedy rules, thus realizing one of Canada's 
priority objectives going into the round. Fifth, the new 
integrated dispute settlement system with clearer rules, tighter 
deadlines, an appeal process and binding effect is a major 
improvement over the existing GATT system and should 
effectively preclude unilateral measures responding to trade 
disputes.
<P>
	Finally, the crowning achievement of the Uruguay round is 
the creation of a new World Trade Organization, WTO, that will 
oversee the preparation of the complex series of agreements 
resulting from the round. It will put international trade on a firm 
institutional footing. The World Trade Organization will  be-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8391"> 8391 </A></B>
<P>
come the third pillar, along with the World Bank and the 
International Monetary Fund, of the world's commercial and 
financial structure.
<P>
	Completion of the Uruguay round will have major 
implications for the world and for the Canadian economy well 
into the next century.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The GATT secretariat estimates that, in year 2005, global 
revenues will be at least $500 billion US higher than what they 
would have been without the Uruguay Round. Based on a 
conservative economic assumption, we estimate that 
quantifiable gains to Canada will amount to at least 0.4 per cent 
in terms of real income, or $3 billion per annum, once the 
agreement is fully in force. This means an income increase of 
$400 per year for each Canadian household.
<P>
	However, these quantifiable gains are only a portion of the 
real earnings that we are almost sure to enjoy. Clearly, for 
Canada, the challenge now is to optimize its share of the 
economic benefits resulting from the Uruguay Round, through 
increased trade and investments, which in turn will promote job 
creation, higher income and a higher actual standard of living.
<P>
<B>(1015) </B>
<P>
	There are tremendous opportunities. In several traditionally 
strong sectors of the Canadian economy, such as forest, 
chemical and pharmaceutical products, tariffs will be 
eliminated or substantially reduced world-wide, not to mention 
that major non-tariff barriers will fall.
<P>
	Our service sector, which accounts for 20 per cent of our 
export earnings, will benefit from more open and stable global 
markets. New agreements on intellectual property rights on 
exported goods, combined with clearer rules of the game for 
supporting research and development, will open up new 
prospects for our technology and knowledge intensive 
industries.
<P>
	I especially want to emphasize the export and growth 
opportunities now open to small and medium sized enterprises 
to expand onto new niche markets abroad. It is these firms that 
are now the most important source of job creation in Canada.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Our service sector which accounts for 20 per cent of export 
earnings would benefit from improved and more secure global 
opportunities. New agreements on trade related intellectual 
property rights combined with clearer rules of the game for 
supporting research and development will open up new 
prospects for our technology and knowledge intensive 
industries.
<P>
	I want to especially emphasize the export and growth 
opportunities presented to small and medium size enterprises to 
expand into new niche markets abroad. It is these firms that are 
now the most important source of job creation across Canada.
<P>
	There is a saying that if one does not use it one will lose it. If 
our Canadian small and medium size businesses do not respond 
to these new opportunities our economy stands to lose a great 
deal. Here is why. Between 1979 and 1989 small and medium 
size firms created over 85 per cent of net jobs representing over 
2.2 million people. Out of 920,729 firms in 1992 figures, 
920,233 or 99.8 per cent of firms were small and medium size 
with less than 100 employees. Out of 10,736,700 private sector 
jobs, there are over 6,360,000 or around 59 per cent who are 
employed by small and medium size enterprise. Therefore, most 
of the new jobs will be generated by this sector of our economy.
<P>
	These figures follow a similar trend in most developed 
countries. If we were to compare the number of Canadian firms 
involved in trade with other countries we would find that 
Canadian small and medium size businesses are missing many 
opportunities. In fact, according to a 1990 study, 100 Canadian 
companies accounted for more than 60 per cent of the $141 
billion of exports and only 7.6 per cent of all Canadian firms 
exported at all. However in Korea 42 per cent of their export is 
done by small and medium enterprise and in Taiwan it is 55.9 per 
cent. In China, 50 per cent of small and medium size enterprises 
are involved in export.
<P>
	To increase the number of small and medium size enterprises 
involved in trade we must involve our small business sector and 
different levels of government must respond to their needs and 
concerns. Of course our competitors are already focusing on 
these very same opportunities. However, we must be smarter, 
more persistent and more aggressive in identifying and 
exploiting the hard won gains in access to both traditional and 
newly emerging markets around the world.
<P>
	In response to this challenge the government has recently 
launched an international business initiative called Access 95. It 
is designed to translate the complex Uruguay round market 
opening measures into a strategy that targets the best export 
prospects among the billions of dollars in newly accessible 
global opportunities.
<P>
<B>(1020 ) </B>
<P>
	This initiative will help our business partners to select and 
develop more efficiently those new markets offering the highest 
value added returns over the long term. By enhancing industrial 
competitiveness, Access 95 will contribute to our domestic 
growth strategy to attract investment in the high tech industries 
and the jobs of the future.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8392"> 8392 </A></B>
<P>
	Before outlining the Access 95 initiatives, I would like to 
highlight international trade opportunities that should open up 
to export industries across the country as a result of legislation 
before us today.
<P>
	Agricultural producers across western Canada should benefit 
from a gradual increase in international prices for grains or 
oilseeds and special crops over the six year transition period and 
from expanded export opportunities.
<P>
	Canadians will compete in a fair environment as European 
and American export subsidies for agricultural products are cut 
by 36 per cent. Quantitative import restrictions and variable 
import levies will be replaced by tariffs that will be cut by 15 per 
cent over six years, thereby stabilizing the export markets in 
Europe, Asia and Latin America for wheat, canola, barley, malt 
and alfalfa.
<P>
	Our beef and pork producers should also profit from the 
replacement of foreign import restrictions and levies with a 
tariff based regime, as well as from improved and more uniform 
rules on sanitary and phytosanitary measures. These should 
foster increased export of breeding stock, embryos, plus beef 
and pork products to Europe, Japan, Korea and Australia.
<P>
	Agri-food producers across the country can take advantage of 
greatly improved export prospects, especially for dairy 
products, seed potatoes, fresh and processed fruits, vegetables, 
beer, whisky and horticultural products.
<P>
	Clearer international rules and fairer phytosanitary 
regulations will further stimulate exports and encourage 
Canadian processors to invest and plan upgrades and 
expansions. Our consumers will also benefit from access to a 
broader range of lower cost food products.
<P>
	Manufacturers of horticultural, construction and mining 
machinery in Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Ontario will 
be able to build on the economies of scale which have already 
resulted from improved access to the U.S. market. The 
elimination of tariffs on many of these machineries in major 
offshore markets should spur our exports.
<P>
	Western Canadian producers of large scale and special crop 
farming technologies are especially well positioned to take 
advantage of new market opportunities as our exporters of 
construction and mining material and handling equipment.
<P>
	Export oriented chemical producers in Alberta, 
Saskatchewan, Quebec and Ontario can also capitalize on tariff 
cuts of over 40 per cent and harmonization of rates between zero 
and 6 per cent. The prospects are excellent for chemical 
commodities in major industrial markets and for specialty 
products in each market.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Computer and instrumentation companies concentrated in 
Quebec and Ontario should welcome with enthusiasm the 
elimination or considerable reduction of tariffs in major 
industrial markets. They will enjoy wider access because of 
tariff consolidation in newly industrialized countries and tighter 
implementation of technical standards.
<P>
	The generalized elimination of non-tariff barriers will open 
up new markets for manufacturers of computers and computer 
parts. The new rules on services and investments and better 
copyright protection will facilitate trade in computer services 
linked to hardware and software sales.
<P>
	Manufacturers of electronics and industrial machinery 
throughout Canada should get ready to exploit new and 
exceptional export opportunities in key industrial markets 
where tariffs on electronics, most electrical appliances and 
industrial machinery will sometimes be cut by 65 per cent. 
Lower tariffs will also bring down the price of imported 
machinery, which is good news to Canadian investors thinking 
of equipping or modernizing their plants.
<P>
<B>(1025 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The fisheries industry in Newfoundland, Prince Edward 
Island, Nova Scotia and British Columbia can diversify exports 
of basic fish items and higher value added fish products to 
Europe, Japan and Korea where tariffs will be cut between 8 per 
cent and 30 per cent and non-tariff barriers reduced. Canadian 
tariffs on a wide variety of fish processing inputs and equipment 
will be reduced or eliminated.
<P>
	The primary and fabricated metals industries in British 
Columbia, Saskatchewan, Ontario and Quebec can also take 
advantage of substantial reductions on tariff and non-tariff 
barriers by our main trading partners to boost sales of primary 
and fabricated metals such as aluminum, nickel, zinc and 
copper. This could well induce new investment over the long 
term. Tariffs are to be eliminated on a wide range of steel 
products, creating a more stable investment climate and more 
secure access to key industrialized markets.
<P>
	The subsidies and countervail agreement would provide 
clearer rules on actions that may be taken against our 
competitors' sales of subsidized iron and steel products that 
displace Canadian products in foreign markets as well as in the 
subsidizing country's domestic market.
<P>
	Pharmaceutical and medical devices exporters across Canada 
will be major beneficiaries of the agreement as key trading 
partners eliminate pharmaceutical tariffs and reduce a wide 
range of non-tariff barriers. This more dynamic trading 
environment should foster Canadian research and development, 
investment and expansion of manufacturing. Freer trade with 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8393"> 8393 </A></B>
<P>
developing countries  should favour the export of specialized 
drug products. Export prospects for high technology medical 
devices in Europe and Asia should also improve along with sales 
of standard devices to Latin America.
<P>
	For these industries which are driven by major and rapid 
technological innovation, the new intellectual property 
agreement will be of particular benefit in ensuring that the many 
proprietary aspects of drug and medical devices are not copied 
by offshore competitors.
<P>
	Our telecommunications industries in Quebec, Ontario, 
Alberta and British Columbia are also poised for further 
expansion into major industrial markets as tariffs are eliminated 
or deeply cut. The binding of tariffs by many advanced 
developing countries would secure Canadian access to those 
booming markets. Moreover, our prospects for winning foreign 
contracts for telecommunications systems are much better given 
the improved access to foreign markets for service technicians 
under the agreement on trade in services.
<P>
	Our transportation industries in Manitoba, Quebec and 
Ontario will also profit from a more level international playing 
field as a result of improved disciplines on the use of 
government subsidies. This will facilitate the export of business 
aircraft, small engines, avionics, landing gear, simulators plus 
parts and service contracts.
<P>
	Tariff cuts reaching 33 per cent will stimulate exports from 
the automotive, urban transit and rail equipment sectors. As 
well, substantial Canadian tariff cuts on original automotive 
parts will reduce costs for original equipment manufacturers.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Wood processing companies in New Brunswick, Quebec and 
British Columbia will be more competitive on foreign markets 
where they will be subject to fairer regulations on the price and 
quantity of their products. Tariffs on lumber and wood products 
will go down by 50 per cent in major industrial markets and will 
decrease in many developing countries.
<P>
	Since the implementation of standards such as the European 
Union's phytosanitary regulations and the development of 
product standards and building codes in Europe and Japan will 
be tightened, it will be easier for our businesses to break into 
these crucial foreign markets.
<P>
<B>(1030) </B>
<P>
	Pulp and paper companies in British Columbia, Ontario, 
Quebec and the Atlantic provinces will enjoy unprecedented 
advantages on foreign markets. For the first time in history, 
most industrialized countries are committed to completely 
eliminating their tariffs. This decision applies in particular to 
the pulp and paper industry as well as to the book trade and other 
products printed on paper. Furthermore, many developing 
countries will reduce and consolidate their tariffs on paper 
products, thus providing Canadian exporters with  excellent 
opportunities to diversify their value-added exports.
<P>
	Besides the tariffs, which will be phased out over a ten-year 
period, some non-tariff barriers will also be abolished, in 
particular the European Union's requirements for waterproof 
paper. The agreement on import licensing procedures and the 
agreement on technical barriers to trade will give Canadian 
companies more stable access to foreign markets in general and 
to those of developing countries in particular.
<P>
	On the whole, freer world trade and more predictable access 
conditions should encourage our producers to modernize their 
plants and in the long term promote the re-establishment of pulp 
and paper companies.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Service industries across Canada are closely tied to the 
offshore export prospects of the related merchandise sector. It is 
estimated that every dollar of goods exported contains 39 cents 
worth of service output. Additionally stand alone exports of 
service amount to $25 billion a year and are growing at almost 
twice the rate of exports.
<P>
	The general agreement on trade in services of the World Trade 
Organization provides for the first time a comprehensive 
framework of rules and discipline on measures affecting 
services, including banking and investment. Once a country has 
committed to open its service sectors to a specified degree, it 
must grant Canadian service firms in the sector the same 
treatment accorded to domestic companies.
<P>
	These market openings and safeguard measures will greatly 
improve the access of Canadian firms to billions of dollars in 
requirements for computers, construction, specialized 
engineering, management, telecommunications, as well as 
environmental, financial and professional services.
<P>
	Both the magnitude and complexity of these opportunities are 
reflected in the Uruguay text of 500 pages of trade rules in 
addition to some 26,000 pages of tariff schedules applicable to 
120 countries. The objective of the government's Access 95 
initiative is to transform some of these often highly technical 
and complex provisions into a trade strategy that helps Canadian 
businesses take advantage of our hard won gains in access to 
foreign markets.
<P>
	Access 95 is one of several important government initiatives 
to respond to the rapidly changing needs of our business 
community. We are committed to ensuring that our international 
trade developmental resources are focused on opportunities that 
offer the highest payoff for industry in the nineties. Given the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8394"> 8394 </A></B>
<P>
current fiscal situation I should mention that the initiative will 
be funded from existing resources.
<P>
	The government is especially determined to strengthen our 
partnership with small and medium sized enterprises. These 
businesses often lack the resources and market specific 
expertise to discover and pursue newly accessible offshore 
opportunities. The government is tailoring its programs and 
services to assist small and medium enterprises in developing 
their particular niches in the new offshore markets.
<P>
<B>(1035 ) </B>
<P>
	At the direction of the first ministers the Minister for 
International Trade and his provincial counterparts are working 
to implement a trade Team Canada approach to better 
co-ordinate international business development. The advantage 
of the approach was demonstrated by the signing of contracts 
worth potentially $8 billion in China and over $100 million in 
Vietnam when the Prime Minister led a team of first ministers 
and 375 business leaders to Asia earlier this month.
<P>
	We envisage that cost effective delivery of streamlined 
business development programs through federal-provincial 
one-stop shops will improve accessibility for firms while 
eliminating wasteful duplication. The approach will entail joint 
enhancement of exporter awareness services to prepare small 
and medium enterprises to export or to expand beyond the U.S. 
market. The development of stronger investment and 
technology linkage will assist small and medium enterprise to 
find the most suitable production technologies and partners 
abroad.
<P>
	The more effective focusing of existing federal resources has 
greatly improved the delivery capabilities of our international 
market information and intelligence network. This links posts 
abroad with industrial analysts and trade officers across Canada 
in gathering and disseminating to Canadian firms timely and in 
depth foreign market intelligence that relates directly to their 
priority interests.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The Access 95 initiative was designed on the basis of these 
priorities. Launched recently by the departments of Foreign 
Affairs and International Trade, Agriculture and Industry, 
Access 95 will, first show Canadian exporters where tariffs and 
non-tariff barriers have been reduced; these reductions will be 
major gains for them because it will be easier for them to export 
some 200 key products and 11 types of services in 42 priority 
markets.
<P>
	Secondly, it will provide information from our offices abroad 
on the most promising new markets and the key criteria for 
being competitive on these markets.
<P>
	Thirdly, it will send information quickly and directly to 
interested companies through our market information network.
<P>
	Fourthly, it will provide our exporters with the services of 
well-informed specialized consultants who can explain to them 
the complex provisions of the WTO agreement, in particular the 
implementation timetables, and indicate to them the best ways 
to overcome the obstacles they will meet abroad.
<P>
	By specifically targeting the openings created by the Uruguay 
Round agreement, Access 95 should encourage our small and 
medium-size businesses, which are already prepared to export 
to the United States under the free trade agreement, to penetrate 
Latin American, Asian and European markets as well.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Before concluding my remarks today I want to thank hon. 
members on both sides for the constructive approach they have 
taken in the House and in committee to this most important 
piece of legislation. I look forward to a similar constructive 
approach from our colleagues in the upper chamber as Canada 
makes a special effort, together with our trading partners all 
over the world, to adopt implementing legislation in time to 
bring the agreement into force on January 1, 1995.
<P>
	Let me assure my colleagues who may be concerned by 
legislative development or the lack thereof in other capitals 
around the world that we are keeping a close eye on the 
implementation process of all our major trading partners. I can 
repeat the assurances already offered by the Minister for 
International Trade that we will proclaim the legislation only 
after our principal partners have completed their requisite 
implementation procedures.
<P>
	Moreover, Bill C-57 provides that the governor in council 
shall bring the legislation into force only when he is satisfied 
that the World Trade Organization agreement is in force.
<P>
<B>(1040 ) </B>
<P>
	In submitting the bill for approval the government counts on 
the support of all parties in the House for the fundamental 
principles of trade policy set out in the preamble of the bill. 
These are: that the cornerstone of Canadian trade policy is the 
multilateral system of mutually agreed market access 
conditions and non-discriminatory trade rules; that free, fair 
and open trade is essential for the future of the Canadian 
economy and for securing the competitiveness and long term 
sustainable development of Canada; and that trade expansion 
contributes to job creation, achieves a higher standard of living, 
offers a greater choice to consumers and strengthens the 
Canadian economic union.
<P>
	These are the essential objectives the bill seeks to promote. I 
invite my colleagues to join me in assuring its timely adoption. 
Once again I thank my colleagues in the opposition for their 
excellent contributions at the committee level, at second 
reading stage in the House of Commons and at report stage.
<P>

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, do 
not think that earlier, when I went to get a glass of water, I did 
not want to bring you one. Quite the contrary. I intend to 
eventually offer you something with more flavour, like an apple 
juice, since Quebec is one of the main apple juice producers.
<P>
	That being said, we are now at third reading of Bill C-57, an 
act to implement the agreement establishing the World Trade 
Organization, signed at Marrakesh on April 15, 1994, by some 
125 trade partners. It took over eight years of negotiating to 
reach this historical compromise, which signing members can 
be proud of. As we have pointed out throughout the legislative 
process, the Bloc Quebecois and I support Bill C-57, in spite of 
a number of flaws which I will discuss later.
<P>
	Why do we support Bill C-57? I have had a few opportunities 
to point out in this House that Quebec is fundamentally a free 
trader and is open to the world. Quebec was and still is a strong 
promoter of free trade between Canada, the United States, 
Mexico and, eventually, other trading partners. Quebec was and 
still is a promoter of NAFTA and, as I was saying, it is in favour 
of expanding this treaty to include other countries from the 
American continent.
<P>
	Let me briefly mention the benefits, for Quebec and Canada, 
related to the signing of the agreement which followed the 
Uruguay Round of negotiations. First, our companies will have 
greater access to foreign markets, thanks to tariff reductions, for 
example on wood, pulp and paper, as well as pharmaceutical 
products. This will certainly result in increased exports, which 
is good and which is what we seek of course through this 
agreement.
<P>
	Trade rules are also strengthened. In the past, GATT members 
often took advantage of the vagueness of some definitions to 
adopt protectionist measures. The new GATT, that is the 
agreements following the Uruguay Round of negotiations, 
clarifies a number of trade rules, particularly as regards the 
definition of a subsidy, the types of subsidies which are allowed, 
compensable or prohibited, as well as the use of countervailing 
duties, safeguard measures and anti-dumping duties, etc.
<P>
	The new GATT also puts in place the foundations of a system 
based on the rule of law rather than on power plays. We like to 
hope that member states will make proper use of the rule of law 
set up in the new GATT. There will also be a new dispute 
settlement mechanism. The general council of the World Trade 
Organization will be responsible for this quicker and more 
efficient dispute settlement mechanism.
<P>
	Again, with such a system based on the rule of law, smaller 
trade partners, like Canada for example, will be able to better 
defend themselves against the protectionism favoured by the 
economic superpowers, including Europe, Japan and the United 
States. It is also important to note that the World Trade 
Organization will be replacing the GATT secretariat. A new 
more modern  structure will replace the old one, which was a bit 
outdated and unsuited to the increasingly popular protectionist 
strategies and to the new industries covered by these 
agreements, like the intellectual property and service industries. 
I will come back to these a little later on.
<P>
<B>(1045) </B>
<P>
	Export subsidies for agricultural products have also 
decreased. After some spirited discussions, the GATT members 
finally agreed to reduce export subsidies by 36 per cent in terms 
of total value of the exportations and by 21 per cent in terms of 
volumes. Of course, we are talking here in percentages and not 
real values.
<P>
	The gap between countries that subsidize the least and the 
most will stay the same. So, there is something wrong here, 
since the developing countries and those, like Canada, which do 
not subsidize their industries a lot compared to a number of their 
trade partners, will continue to be at a disadvantage. This 
nonetheless constitutes a step forward, which reduces the 
upward pressure on what I would call less ``subsidizing'' 
countries and gives them a new hope.
<P>
	The Uruguay Round agreements also clarify the rules 
governing intellectual property. It is the first time this issue is 
discussed at the GATT level. Creators and businesses benefit 
from a minimum protection or, as I would say, a bottom 
protection. These new provisions apply to royalties, trademarks, 
patents, etc. They limit industrial piracy and trade of counterfeit 
goods.
<P>
	The Uruguay Round agreements also provide for an opening 
of government procurement contracting so that our businesses 
have an easier access to the competitive bidding system of our 
partners' government agencies and governments. These 
provisions are subject to prescribed limits on government 
procurement of goods and services and on building contracts.
<P>
	Again, this will open new markets to our businesses, which, in 
return, will have to be more competitive and aggressive. Indeed, 
this is the challenge they have to face with free trade.
<P>
	As I said earlier, service industries are now included in the 
GATT agreement pursuant to the new provisions, although free 
trade does not apply to services as much as to goods. It has to be 
understood that if, for the latter, years of experience and 
negotiations have brought about freer trade, this is only 
beginning in the service industries.
<P>
	I want to point out that service industries represent 20 per cent 
of the world economy. Canadian and Quebec 
telecommunication companies, mentioned earlier by the 
parliamentary secretary, as well as the financial services sector 
will benefit from this liberalization.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8396"> 8396 </A></B>
<P>
	There is still a long way to go because many differences of 
opinion remain concerning transportation, 
telecommunications, audiovisual material and financial 
services, in particular, among the main trade partners, including 
the United States, the European Union and Japan.
<P>
	Finally, the Uruguay Round agreement contains provisions 
allowing each country to exclude cultural industries and 
co-production works from the list of subjects covered by GATT. 
I believe that we owe that exclusion to France. As it did with 
NAFTA, Canada excluded cultural industries and co-production 
agreements from its list of concessions.
<P>
	This ends my enumeration of what could be considered the 
gains made under the Uruguay Round agreement and, if you 
allow me, I will now turn to the less positive side of that 
agreement, and therefore of Bill C-57.
<P>
	Throughout the negotiation process leading to the agreement 
and a little later, when Bill C-57 was drafted, the federal 
government boasted about its desire to consult the provinces. 
Undoubtedly, there was an effort made in this regard with the 
preparation of a draft bill which was submitted to the provincial 
governments. I would add that the federal government did it 
only because it cannot implement the agreement without the 
co-operation of the provinces in their particular fields of 
jurisdiction. Nonetheless, the federal government has not acted 
on three basic demands of Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1050) </B>
<P>
	For one thing, we wanted to ensure that the bill contained a 
federal clause providing for consultation with the provinces 
concerning the application of the agreement in areas under 
provincial jurisdiction. The provinces, particularly Quebec, 
have agreed to adapt their respective legislation and regulations 
to the international agreement signed by Canada.
<P>
	Quebec was hoping to be better protected by the Canadian 
government. The federal clause included in the Marrakech 
agreement is indeed too threatening and too restrictive in that it 
gives the federal government full responsibility for the 
implementation of the final agreement. At the very least, 
Quebec was hoping that this clause would not be changed from 
what it was in the former agreement. At best, it was hoping that 
the federal government would better protect the interests of the 
provinces in negotiating with its GATT partners a federal clause 
that would better reflect Canada's constitutional reality.
<P>
	Section 24.12 of the final agreement stipulates that the 
Government of Canada is fully responsible for compliance with 
GATT provisions and will take all reasonable measures to 
ensure that this obligation is fulfilled by local governments. So 
this means that, according to what is provided for in the 
agreement, the federal government will not consult with the 
provinces, but it will make decisions for them.
<P>
	Not only is Quebec opposed to this wording, but it would have 
liked to see in Bill C-57 provisions establishing a 
federal-provincial consultation process for important decisions 
and for decisions regarding matters under provincial 
jurisdiction.
<P>
	Again, Mr. Speaker, allow me to point out that the federal 
system has proven its inability to produce agreements that are 
satisfactory to all the parties concerned.
<P>
	I will come back to the federal-provincial dispute settlement 
mechanism later on. Of course, we were also hoping that the bill 
would provide for a number of adjustment programs for workers 
and businesses in soft sectors like textile and clothing, which are 
very important in Quebec. A promise to that effect appeared in 
the red book, a promise that apparently will not be kept. I will 
get back to this later on.
<P>
	As I pointed out earlier, Bill C-57 is deficient in a number of 
ways, and we have tried to deal with that by proposing a number 
of amendments in committee and at the report stage. The 
government decided, on I would say philosophical grounds 
which are questionable, to say the least, to reject the whole 
package ``en bloc''. No pun intended. We hope that the 
government's failure to give these amendments serious 
consideration will not prove to be an obstacle to proper 
implementation of the Uruguay Round agreement.
<P>
	The government must realize that by rejecting these 
amendments which, I should point out, had been toned down and 
modified to make them palatable to the government majority, it 
went against the wishes of several groups directly concerned by 
Bill C-57.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, perhaps I may recall the various amendments we 
proposed and our reasons for proposing them, and then comment 
briefly on the disastrous impact of the government's rejection of 
these amendments.
<P>
	First, we had the amendment proposed by the hon. member for 
Laval-Est, whose purpose was to establish a process for 
consultation with the provinces. Of course, this process would 
have applied specifically to matters within provincial 
jurisdiction. The consultation process could also have been 
extended to any matter relating to trade dispute resolution and 
any economic matter of major international significance.
<P>
<B>(1055) </B>
<P>
	I may also recall that this type of consultation process exists 
in the legislation now before the U.S. Congress, where it 
concerns both economic matters of major significance, 
according to section 102, part B of the U.S. bill, and also matters 
relating to trade dispute resolution, section 102, part C, 
paragraph 3<I>(i)</I>.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8397"> 8397 </A></B>
<P>
	In a context where trade disputes are frequent and 
increasingly concern matters within provincial jurisdiction, the 
government could have been expected to provide a mechanism 
for consultations with the provinces. I think that in a federal 
state like the one Canada claims to be, a state that claims to 
respect the jurisdictions of the provinces, it is necessary to 
provide a mechanism for dispute settlement as well as a 
mechanism for federal-provincial consultations.
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary said earlier that the federal 
government and the provinces were co-operating well on trade 
issues. He mentioned Team Canada. Nevertheless the 
Government of Quebec has expressed the wish, and it still does, 
that a process for consultations be included in the bill. If the 
government is so anxious to consult the provinces, why does it 
persist in its refusal to provide specifically for such 
consultations in the bill? I cannot understand this attitude.
<P>
	They mentioned Team Canada, but when people work as a 
team, all players should have a chance to get on the ice. The 
parliamentary secretary mentioned the glorious trip of Team 
Canada to Asia. Well, for technical reasons, the federal 
government steadfastly refused to let one of the players on to the 
ice. From the very start, Team Canada has not been running very 
smoothly.
<P>
	The proposed amendment was also aimed at forcing the 
federal government to obtain the provinces' agreement before 
taking important steps which would ultimately have an impact 
on the provincial jurisdictions, for instance, a change in the 
allocation mechanisms for tariff quotas. As things now stand, 
the Minister of International Trade has full discretionary powers 
regarding the allocation of tariff quotas. It would have been 
desirable for the provinces to be consulted on the allocation of 
such quotas, and on the establishment or implementation of 
policies for selecting trade partners who would have access to 
the Canadian market.
<P>
	If you will permit, Mr. Speaker, I will spend a few minutes on 
the issue of tariff quotas because I believe that it is an area of 
great concern. The purpose of this amendment was to ensure that 
the minister, when making decisions in respect of prices and 
quantities of subsidized exports, considers actions taken in the 
relevant areas by foreign competitors.
<P>
	Getting back to the issue of tariff quotas, I just want to say that 
the federal government will impose nearly no duties on a certain 
number of agricultural products entering Canada. Beyond 
established quantities, tariffs will increase significantly, up to 
200 or 300 per cent. It is the minister, acting on behalf of the 
federal government, who will have the authority to decide which 
importers will be allowed to import under these preferential 
tariffs.
<P>
	The federal government, under more or less formal 
agreements, will determine from which country certain 
agricultural products will be imported into Canada under these 
preferential tariffs. We believed that it was essential to ensure 
that the provinces could voice their  opinion regarding the 
choice of importers who will benefit from these low tariffs.
<P>
	It is all the more important because the provinces may often 
have competing interests; therefore, the process should be as 
open as possible, in order to avoid scheming and conflicts of 
interest. We know, for example, that the federal government has 
already entered into agreements with some countries 
-including New Zealand which was granted a significant butter 
tariff quota, probably in exchange for a similar quota for 
Canadian beef exports to New Zealand; under such agreements, 
the government guarantees a country access to the Canadian 
market for certain of its products in exchange for access to its 
market.
<P>
<B>(1100) </B>
<P>
	On the one hand, this kind of agreement can have serious 
consequences for local producers and can antagonize our other 
trade partners. On the other hand, developing countries-I think 
it is important to recognize it-are the big losers with this type 
of agreement, because they have nothing to offer in exchange for 
access to our markets. We have to take that into account, Mr. 
Speaker.
<P>
	Our amendment was intended to avoid the possibility of 
haggling over the granting of tariff quotas and the risk of 
conflicts of interest for the minister. We wanted to avoid putting 
the minister in a situation where he would have to set tariff 
quotas while taking into consideration the conflicting interests 
of the various provinces.
<P>
	This amendment was also intended to prevent the minister 
from allowing products imported outside tariff quotas, in case of 
shortages on the domestic market, to be sold more cheaply than 
the same goods produced on the domestic market.
<P>
	I will now move to the amendment to clause 3 proposed by the 
hon. member for Longueuil. Its goal was to ensure minimal 
follow-up by Parliament which would have forced the 
government to make a public evaluation of the implementation 
of the agreement. This was, in my opinion, the least we could 
ask as a safety measure. That amendment had been suggested to 
us by the Union des producteurs agricoles du Québec and the 
Canadian Federation of Agriculture, when they came before the 
Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade.
<P>
	There again, the government decided that this amendment 
was not worthy of consideration, and it was rejected late 
yesterday.
<P>
	This amendment would have also required that we examine 
the implementation of the agreement by our main trading 
partners, most notably the United States. I might add that the 
American legislation presently before Congress contains such 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8398"> 8398 </A></B>
<P>
provisions in its section 424. That section of the American bill 
states that, no later than six months after the day the agreement 
has come into force, the President shall report on Canada's 
performance  fulfilling its commitments respecting dairy 
products and poultry.
<P>
	Such a clause is not overly aggressive. It does not violate the 
scheme of the Uruguay Round agreements. It simply keeps us on 
our toes regarding our major trading partners, who may at times 
be aggressive towards us.
<P>
	The amendment was also designed to ensure that the 
government table an annual report on the impact of the 
agreement on workers and companies, as I said earlier.
<P>
	The Liberal government made promises in that respect during 
the election campaign. We know that many workers and 
companies will be affected by the implementation of the 
Uruguay Round agreements. There is no doubt that they are 
prepared to take up the challenge of the Uruguay Round 
agreements, but they could use a little boost to face this new 
reality.
<P>
	I now move on to the amendment to Clause 58 brought forth 
by the hon. member for Louis-Hébert, to ensure that the 
protection would apply not only in the present but also in the 
future. The intention was to make the clause technologically 
neutral, that is to say not to limit its application to today's or 
yesterday's technologies, because the clause actually provides 
for the protection of recordings made on perforated rolls. 
Imagine that, Mr. Speaker, perforated rolls!
<P>
	As I indicated in the debate at report stage, I would probably 
have had less of a problem with this aspect if I had been debating 
the bill to implement the agreement establishing the World 
Trade Organization as a member of this House immediately 
after the Second World War. Then, I would have told myself that 
the days of the perforated roll, as a recording medium, were not 
so long gone after all. But in 1994, in the age of the laser and the 
optic fibre, I think that we should come up with a 
technologically neutral clause, that is to say a clause that does 
not apply only to technologies that existed in the old days or 
exist today, but that also allows for the development of new 
technologies, new means of fixing information.
<P>
<B>(1105) </B>
<P>
	It was a purely technical amendment, simple but 
fundamentally important. Today, as noted in the Union des 
artistes' brief to the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and 
International Trade: ``The perforated roll makes us laugh 
because it is so obsolete as a way to reproduce sounds. 
Tomorrow it may well be digital tapes or laser disks that make us 
smile because they will seem like technologies from another 
age''.
<P>
	The government's approach of limiting comments to the 
perforated roll appears timorous and hesitant. It does not augur 
well for the review of the Copyright Act. Just because we 
proposed only one amendment in this regard does not mean that 
we agree with the position of the current government, which is 
unduly delaying the introduction of a bill to amend the 
Copyright Act.
<P>
	As we clearly pointed out last week, the government must not 
use trade treaties as an excuse to review the Copyright Act in an 
haphazard and incidental way. Again, as suggested in the report 
of the Liberal majority on the Special Joint Committee 
Reviewing Canada's Foreign Policy, the government is taking 
over areas of shared jurisdiction under the pretext that it is the 
only one entitled to deal with their extension on the international 
scene.
<P>
	The amendment to clause 185, which I had the honour to put 
forward, was simply aimed at clarifying the guidelines used by 
the trade tribunal to rule on dumping cases. Clause 185 in Bill 
C-57 outlines how the Canadian International Trade Tribunal 
must deal with dumping complaints. Complainants had to prove 
to the tribunal not only that dumping effectively took place but 
also that it had caused injury to Canadian industry.
<P>
	The bill also provides that the tribunal can recognize injury 
only if the circumstances causing the said injury are clearly 
planned and imminent. As you can see, Mr. Speaker, this 
``planned and imminent'' provision is much too vague and 
restrictive. What we wanted to achieve through this amendment 
was simply to clarify a little bit the circumstances that can cause 
injury, which are now quite vague.
<P>
	This bill also provides that the Governor in Council can, on 
the finance minister's recommendation and if he feels like it, set 
regulatory guidelines that will give the Canadian International 
Trade Tribunal more specific directives on acceptable evidence 
as well as the general interpretation of new dumping conditions.
<P>
	Canadian steel producers submitted to us that the U.S. 
legislation was much more precise and, as I just said, gave their 
courts much clearer and more precise indications as to how these 
new conditions should be interpreted and what evidence could 
be presented to a court.
<P>
	Given this state of affairs, Canadian producers are clearly at a 
disadvantage compared to their American competitors, since 
they have absolutely no indication of how they will have to 
prove that they are victims of dumping by their U.S. 
counterparts. I mentioned how important the steel industry is for 
Canada's economy. I will not cover the same ground again, but 
we should understand how urgent such an amendment to the bill 
was, not only for the steel industry but also for very many 
industries and sectors of the Canadian economy.
<P>
<B>(1110) </B>
<P>
	The purpose of the amendment was to require rather than to 
simply permit the Governor in Council to establish regulations 
to guide businesses and the court in its decisions; it was also 
intended to specify the kinds of evidence which should be 
included in the regulation and also suggested that the Minister 
of Industry be involved in the operation since obviously he is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8399"> 8399 </A></B>
<P>
probably the one who is best able to judge how various sectors of 
the Canadian economy are doing.
<P>
	At this point, I would like to mention the important 
contribution of my colleague from The Battlefords-Meadow 
Lake, who presented some amendments to this House. In most 
cases, these were similar to amendments proposed by the Bloc 
Quebecois and, unfortunately, were also rejected. In his 
statements, he too clearly pointed out the difference between 
U.S. legislation, which provides some defence for American 
industries, and Canadian legislation, which leaves it up to the 
good will of the World Trade Organization and the strict 
application of the rules of law. This is a dangerously narrow 
approach and with all my heart I hope it will turn out to be a 
viable strategy that will benefit the Canadian economy.
<P>
	It is important to say a few words about the progress of 
legislation in the U.S. Congress. Over the last few days we 
learned that the situation had changed and that a majority of 
American senators now intended to support the bill on the 
Uruguay Round agreements, even though, as Lloyd Bentson, the 
U.S. Secretary of Treasury, put it, the GATT vote was not a done 
deal. We have every reason to be very optimistic at this moment.
<P>
	However, should the American Senate or Congress reject the 
GATT agreement, and should the U.S. close its markets, a return 
to protectionism at the international level would be a distinct 
possibility and would have disastrous consequences for the 
economy world-wide. Consequently, the signal which will be 
sent by our major trading partner is vital. We will follow the 
proceedings in Congress with great interest. We hope that the 
Canadian Minister for International Trade will use every 
available means to convince our trading partner to pass its bill 
on the Uruguay Round agreements as quickly as possible, and 
also to make stubborn American legislators aware of what is at 
stake here.
<P>
	I want to conclude by making some criticisms regarding the 
process to which we were subjected over the last few weeks. 
There is no doubt now, and in fact that was the case from the very 
beginning, that the Bloc Quebecois supports this legislation to 
implement the Uruguay Round agreements. We know that the 
Reform Party also supports the bill.
<P>
	Consequently, why did the government wait for so long before 
tabling its legislation? It did so at the last minute and then it put 
all kinds of pressure to rush the bill through every stage of the 
process, including in committee. The government thus kept us 
from conducting a thorough review of Bill C-57 which, as you 
know, includes over 200 clauses.
<P>
	Given the scope and the volume of this legislation, the 
government should at least have consulted us, as it did regarding 
other bills. A draft bill was distributed to various sectors of the 
Canadian economy, as well as to the provinces, and that is 
certainly a good thing.
<P>
<B>(1115) </B>
<P>
	Considering the consensus that prevailed in this House, we 
would have hoped that the government would at least have had 
the decency to provide other parliamentarians with a copy of its 
draft bill, so that we could have looked at it and even made 
suggestions before the bill was studied in the House and in 
committee. But now the government is stuck. In an attempt to 
ensure transparency and to protect its image, it is rejecting every 
compromise and every amendment to its bill.
<P>
	The committee heard a limited number of witnesses, who had 
very little time to get ready. In any case, none of their 
presentations was taken into account and, with the way the 
committee's business was organized, it was impossible to take 
into consideration their requests. Public hearings ended two 
weeks ago, on a Wednesday, and the following day we were 
already studying the bill clause by clause.
<P>
	How could we have taken into account the proposals, 
comments and suggestions made by the witnesses when right the 
following day we were asked to railroad the almost 200 clauses 
of this bill?
<P>
	To conclude, I just want to say that we will, of course, support 
this bill to implement the trade agreements reached during the 
Uruguay Round. I stressed the importance of this bill for Quebec 
and I mentioned the consensus that prevailed in this House on 
this issue.
<P>
	We give our support to this bill in the hope that the 
government remembers the reservations we have had ever since 
this bill was introduced, most of which have been expressed by 
the witnesses before the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs 
and International Trade, including the Canadian Federation of 
Agriculture, the Union des producteurs agricoles, the Union des 
artistes, and the Canadian Steel Producers Association. I just 
want to remind members that several concerns and several 
suggestions came up, but the government chose not to take them 
into account. We hope that the government will at least take 
these various reservations into consideration when it prepares 
the regulations.
<P>
	Obviously, we hope that these flaws in Bill C-57 will not have 
regrettable impacts on already frail areas of our economy and 
that these flaws will not place businesses in Quebec and in 
Canada at a disadvantage in relation to our major trade partners.
<P>
	As for the implementation of the Uruguay Round agreements, 
we hope, since that is all we can do, that the federal government 
will keep its word and will be so kind as to consult with the 
provinces before making major decisions on matters of concern 
to them.
<P>
	We also hope that the government will do a proper follow-up, 
that it will monitor the conduct of our major trade partners, and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8400"> 8400 </A></B>
<P>
that it will keep its promise in the red book with respect to 
adjustment programs for workers and businesses. In that regard, 
it is important to quote the following excerpt from the red book: 
``Governments must assist individuals and firms to deal with the  
restructuring that is occurring as a result of trade liberalization. 
Such assistance is critical to building acceptance of structural 
reforms in the Canadian economy''.
<P>
	We know very well that given the current state of government 
finances, the Liberal government could be tempted to disregard 
the promise to set up restructuring programs for those 
businesses most heavily affected by the Uruguay Round 
agreements and NAFTA.
<P>
	Of course, the Bloc Quebecois and I readily recognize the 
need to reduce the monstrous Canadian deficit in an intelligent 
manner. However, we are also aware of the fact that workers in 
some sectors of the economy will have to make an extra effort to 
adjust to new market realities.
<P>
	While I am absolutely sure that workers and businesses in 
Quebec and in Canada will be able to show the innovation and 
energy needed to deal with these new realities, I also know that 
government intervention is absolutely necessary in some cases.
<P>
	Before I conclude, I too would like to thank all members who 
took part in proceedings on Bill C-57 in this House, including 
my colleagues from Louis-Hébert, Laval East and Longueuil, 
and my colleagues on the government side and in the Reform 
Party, and more particularly organizations and individuals who, 
despite the inconvenience of the process, came to Ottawa at 
taxpayers' expense to appear before the Standing Committee on 
Foreign Affairs and International Trade, even if their concerns 
and suggestions have not been taken into consideration.
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary mentioned the positive approach 
taken by members on both sides of the House. I have to say that I 
cannot give the government such high marks, because it did not 
co-operate as much as we would have liked.
<P>
	That being said, we will certainly support this bill.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
happy to rise today to support Bill C-57, an act to implement the 
World Trade Organization under GATT.
<P>
	I think it is a tribute to this House and to Canadians that we 
have all-party agreement for this to move forward. We 
recognize there are some problems that have to be worked out as 
a result of this trade deal as it applies to internal policy in 
Canada, but Canada needs this deal very badly. We have been a 
world leader in trade promotion and trade rules since the second 
world war.
<P>
	In 1947 Canada was one of the early leaders in proposing a 
rules based trade arrangement with the GATT that took place. 
We have also been working very hard in the last seven years 
under the Uruguay round to bring about international trade rules 
that bring sectors such as agriculture and the service sector 
under international trade rules for the very first time. These 
sectors have been operating without these international trade 
rules and we believe they are very important.
<P>
	We in the Reform Party are very supportive of the 
implementation of the GATT and the World Trade Organization. 
We are looking forward to the organization getting organized 
and up and running quickly.
<P>
	Canada needs a rules based trading relationship. We will 
benefit. We have a small population in a big country; we have a 
lot of resources. About 30 per cent of our GNP is directly related 
to trade. Unlike some countries for example the United States 
which is far more self-contained, Canada needs to trade and we 
are a world leader in terms of trade.
<P>
	One reason we need this is we have had a trade war going on in 
agriculture for approximately the last 10 years. We have seen 
how destructive this can be to the economy of the industry 
affected. Without the Uruguay round we were in danger of this 
expanding into other sectors, something Canada could not have 
had happen. It was very important to us.
<P>
	We cannot play the game if everybody is playing by different 
rules. That is what we are saying by trying to get international 
trade rules. In that way trade is very much like a game. We 
always hear the term level playing field and there is a reason for 
that. It means we need to have rules that are equal and every 
team has the same opportunity under those rules.
<P>
	To use an analogy, for me it is very much like hockey. Hockey 
is my favourite sport. It is a sport that Canada invented. We have 
set the rules for hockey over the years. We are very good 
nationally. We need to work as a national team when we go 
abroad. We have to recruit the very best players and we have to 
train those players. To that degree, it is very much like the 
Uruguay round. We need international rules in hockey as well as 
international rules in trade.
<P>
	We need a neutral referee in hockey and in trade. The World 
Trade Organization is going to be that neutral referee applying 
the rules fairly. The Acting Speaker who was in the chair earlier 
will certainly know something about refereeing. He was in the 
National Hockey League as a referee for a number of years. The 
one qualification referees need is good eyesight. They have to be 
very vigilant and that will be the role of the World Trade 
Organization.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8401"> 8401 </A></B>
<P>
	Canada is a trading nation and will benefit greatly by trade 
liberalization. Canada produces a surplus of many goods and 
services in demand around the world. Yet Canada cannot 
possibly produce the full range of goods and services that 
Canadians need. In that way it is to our advantage to export 
those goods and services we produce best. We do produce a lot 
of these very well, just as it is to our advantage to import those 
goods and services that other countries produce best.
<P>
<B>(1125) </B>
<P>
	In 1993 Canada exported $181 billion in goods and services 
totalling about 30 per cent of our gross domestic product, very 
high. For every billion dollars in new exports, over 1,100 new 
jobs are created. It is very important to Canada that we continue 
to be good traders.
<P>
	With more liberalized trade the overall prosperity of 
Canadians will be enhanced. In Canada trade accounts for one 
out of every four jobs generated. In my riding of Peace River we 
are very dependent on trade to provide jobs.
<P>
	The Peace River area of Alberta is booming right now. The 
economy is very strong. Agriculture is doing well. The oil and 
gas sector is booming. The forestry sector is booming as well. It 
is the good fortune of my riding that all of these industries have 
healthy export sales and it is no more evident than it is in the 
Peace River riding of Alberta.
<P>
	We do have some problems in making this trade deal work. 
Some of them are right here at home. In that way I compare it 
with our national team playing hockey. We have to work with 
our players to make this deal work effectively for Canada, the 
players in this case being the business community and 
provinces, and we have to work together.
<P>
	If I may continue with my analogy for a moment, if we cannot 
practise together how can we learn to play the game? Young 
players start by playing locally in the neighbourhood rink. If you 
are limited to your backyard, however, where do you get your 
expertise and where do you learn how to make the moves 
necessary to move on to the next level?
<P>
	Recently GATT has rebuked Canada for having too many 
internal trade barriers. I think we have to pay attention. Having 
minimum compliance and getting Bill C-57 established and 
getting it into effect is the right approach. We want this 
agreement to be in effect very quickly. To do that we have 
minimum compliance. That means amending approximately 31 
acts to bring us into minimum compliance.
<P>
	It shows that we have some serious flaws in our domestic 
policy that have to be addressed. I hope that the manager of the 
team, the coach, the federal government, will be working to pay 
attention to those problems. Some of them are concerns over 
transportation regulation, transportation subsidies, government 
regulations, regional development. All of these things are  really 
slowing us down in terms of competing effectively abroad.
<P>
	There are many categories of barriers. In agriculture and the 
food processing industries there are over 100 of these barriers. 
They include marketing boards, production quotas, quality and 
packaging standards and transportation and stabilization 
subsidies.
<P>
	In the liquor and wine industries we have provincial 
production requirements, local bottling requirements, 
differential markups, quotas, packaging requirements and 
marketing favouritism.
<P>
	In the transportation industry we have different licensing 
requirements in different provinces, size and weight 
requirements, safety regulations, provincial transport board 
discretionary powers and varying fuel and sales taxes. It has 
been said that we have more barriers to trade internally than in 
all of the European Union. That is something we have to work 
very hard at to overcome.
<P>
	In the area of government procurement we find explicit and 
implicit preferences for local suppliers and requirements for 
locally produced materials. With government procurement 
expenditures exceeding $100 billion per year, approximately 20 
per cent of our gross domestic product, this is by no means 
insignificant.
<P>
	In the area of labour mobility there are different licensing 
requirements for professionals and tradepersons from province 
to province. These barriers parade significant impediments to 
people wishing to move to other provinces since skilled workers 
have to meet additional licensing requirements.
<P>
	Then there is the area of capital mobility where industrial 
incentives, local investment funds and local tax incentives are 
barriers.
<P>
<B>(1130 ) </B>
<P>
	Such barriers are often used for regional development and 
create an inefficient allocation of financial resources. The cost 
to our nation of these and other internal trade barriers is in the 
neighbourhood of $6.5 billion per year, something that simply is 
not acceptable and which we have to work on.
<P>
	Interprovincial trade barriers have fragmented the Canadian 
marketplace and hindered Canada's ability to compete 
internationally. Furthermore, these barriers give competitive 
advantages to large firms that can afford to comply with the 
stringent rules imposed by government. At the same time they 
hinder small businesses from reaching their market potential. 
Unless we can improve competition within our own borders we 
will never be able to reap the rewards of these expanded trade 
opportunities.
<P>
	Yesterday an interesting item was reported in the press. Garth 
Whyte, director of national affairs at the Canadian Federation of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8402"> 8402 </A></B>
<P>
Independent Business, says that he finds it ironic that Ottawa 
and the provinces appeared to work so well together in Asia but 
cannot agree on  bringing down interprovincial trade barriers 
back at home. This is something I have mentioned many times in 
the past in this House and something that is really tying one arm 
of our business people behind their backs in their ability to trade 
internationally.
<P>
	Mr. Whyte goes on to say that many members of the CFIB, 
which represents 85,000 small and medium size businesses 
across Canada, do not even dream of tackling foreign markets 
because they cannot expand into next door provinces that would 
allow them to grow big enough to compete abroad. It is one of 
our Achilles' heels. It has been recognized in our foreign policy 
review that we need to create a better international business 
environment at home, giving small and medium size businesses 
the opportunity to compete.
<P>
	Most of our international trade is done by about 100 
companies in Canada. There is much opportunity for small and 
medium size businesses to compete but we have to start opening 
up these trade problems and barriers at home to allow them to 
get a bigger share of the domestic market so they can use that as 
a chance to expand into the international field.
<P>
	Our national team has some problems. We are not working 
together as a team. That is the job of the coach, the manager of 
the team on the other side. Team Canada has to work more 
effectively at home so we can do a better job abroad.
<P>
	I see some problems coming as well with the implementation 
of the World Trade Organization and how it will affect us in 
Canada. It is something we have to work to resolve. There will 
be some disputes ahead that need to be settled by this 
government. To get back to my hockey analogy, if we slow down 
the game too much with too many penalties it does slow the 
game down. In this case it is tariffs and interprovincial trade 
barriers.
<P>
	I believe that some of the problems we are facing are tariff 
rate quotas, the allocation of them. We have some problems with 
our supply management sector that have to be worked out. We 
have some problems under the Western Grain Transportation 
Act that will have to be resolved as a matter of the 
implementation of the World Trade Organization, and the export 
volume caps that are going to be imposed.
<P>
	I would hope that government would work very closely with 
industry and the provinces involved to make this a very easy 
adjustment to be phased in so that eventually we can phase down 
quotas, subsidies and tariffs all across the country and Canada 
will be a free trading nation.
<P>
	I want to quote a couple of examples, one of them being the 
beef industry. We are getting representation from both sides of 
that issue, which may be good or may be bad. One group is 
saying that the tariff rate quotas are high enough and it does not 
want them lifted. The other side of the industry is saying that 
they are much too low and it needs better access. I can see some 
problems coming. There will even be a market trade in tariff rate 
quotas which I do not believe is necessarily a good thing.
<P>
	We heard earlier today from the parliamentary secretary, the 
critic for the Bloc and us. Everyone is looking at what the other 
major team, Team U.S.A., is doing. It is trying to change the 
rules of the game, adding many requirements and regulations as 
a part of its implementation legislation. It is not the right 
approach.
<P>
<B>(1135) </B>
<P>
	I believe that the referee, in this case the World Trade 
Organization, will look at that very closely when considering 
the disputes brought forward before the World Trade 
Organization. All of the relevant factors will be taken into 
account and we will have the weight of 123 member countries 
behind us when these rulings are made in favour of whatever 
party.
<P>
	I would welcome very much that we move quickly to the 
implementation of the World Trade Organization, allow some of 
these disputes that have been lingering in Canada for some time 
such as the wheat dispute in western Canada. We all know about 
the amount of cases taken to the dispute panel in the United 
States with regard to steel. Those are two that should be moved 
quickly to the World Trade Organization to be resolved and have 
the weight of all of the member countries behind them.
<P>
	What happens in the United States is of principal interest to 
Canada because currently it accounts for about 75 per cent of 
Canada's two way trade. We have a strong relationship with the 
United States which has allowed Canada to become the seventh 
largest trading nation in the world, even though we have a 
population that only ranks 31st in the world.
<P>
	In conclusion, we in this party support moving quickly to the 
World Trade Organization, the full implementation of the 
GATT. We think we can do quite well. We are going to have a 
neutral referee with good eyesight, I hope. We are going to rely 
on the things that we do best, skill and agility. We are not going 
to resort to the tactics of some teams that tend to get the 
enforcers in place. We think we can do quite well based on skill. 
We can trade well with any country as long as we have a level 
playing field.
<P>
	Let us get on with the game, let us get on with implementing 
this as quickly as we can and let Canada continue to take a 
leadership role at the World Trade Organization as it needs to be 
changed in future reforms. Let us at home continue to work hard, 
be diligent to resolve some of the problems that we have in terms 
of trade barriers. Let us be diligent at home with regard to 
getting our debt and deficit under control because we know that 
is one of the biggest costs in business. It is one of the reasons 
that we do not compete well internationally. We have a very high 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8403"> 8403 </A></B>
<P>
tax rate. We think we can win the game if we look after that and 
do very well in trade.
<P>
	We believe that Team Canada can hold its own with any team 
in the world, given the same rules.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Before resuming debate I 
want to remind the House that pursuant to Standing Order 74, 
following the first three members this morning, the next five 
hours of debate will give members the opportunity of 20 minutes 
maximum for speeches, subject to a 10 minute question or 
comment period. Sometimes the practice is that members split 
their time and I would hope that if members are going to be 
splitting their time they would indicate that to the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harb:</B> Mr. Speaker, on the government side we will be 
splitting the 20 minutes for the first five hours. There will be two 
speakers for every 20 minutes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Prince Albert-Churchill River, 
</B><B>Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is an honour for me to speak in support of 
Bill C-57, a bill to implement the Uruguay round of agreements 
of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
<P>
	In excess of 120 countries are signatories to this agreement 
and this bill will make Canada party to the most comprehensive 
trade agreement in history.
<P>
	This government was elected on the basis of a number of 
factors. These same factors have kept the government in high 
regard. We have the leader, we have the team and we have the 
plan, the red book. The focus of the red book was all about job 
creation and getting Canadians back to work, to give all 
Canadians an opportunity to participate in the economy, to allow 
all people the dignity that comes with having a job, and the pride 
that comes with the ability to put bread and butter on one's own 
table.
<P>
	Since the election of our Prime Minister and the new 
government over 300,000 new jobs have been created, most of 
them being full time. In addition, business and consumer 
confidence is way up. This is because the government has been 
single minded about its promise to create jobs. The government, 
together with all Canadians, is succeeding.
<P>
<B>(1140) </B>
<P>
	Whether we are talking about the infrastructure program 
which has resulted in the construction of roads, sewers, 
sidewalks, health care facilities and other valuable projects, tens 
of thousands of Canadians are now back at work as a direct result 
of this program.
<P>
	Whether we are talking about the review for science and 
technology, whether we are talking about the Minister of Human 
Resources Development and his review of the western 
diversification program or his very important and necessary 
review of the social safety net, in all of these areas we are 
looking to see how best we can create a climate of economic 
growth and jobs in this country.
<P>
	We look to see how we can make Canada a better competitor 
on the global marketplace. The success of our Minister for 
International Trade and our Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food at the GATT is no exception to the government's 
direction which is to create jobs and economic growth in 
Canada.
<P>
	The Uruguay round of GATT is an international agreement but 
it has many significant, positive local impacts in Prince Albert, 
Churchill River and all throughout Saskatchewan.
<P>
	A significant industry that will be helped in Saskatchewan is 
the agricultural machinery manufacturing sector. Tariffs on 
these products will be eliminated internationally over a 
five-year period. Western Canadians and Saskatchewan based 
farm machinery manufacturers are particularly well positioned 
to take advantage of this new economic reality as exports of our 
large scale dry land farming technology is on the cutting edge 
worldwide both in terms of environmental protection and 
encouraging economic efficiency and effective production.
<P>
	These industries are already very competitive because of a 
close proximity to the American market and good access at the 
present time. Therefore we can effectively take advantage of 
these new market opportunities.
<P>
	I believe in Saskatchewan farmers because they have been 
through drought. At the same time they were subjected to low 
commodity prices brought on by the devastating grain subsidy 
war waged between the Americans and the European Union.
<P>
	There is no doubt that Saskatchewan farmers are among the 
most efficient producers of agricultural products in the world. A 
reduction in subsidies on the international level is going to be 
good news for our farmers because they are already so efficient.
<P>
	One of our most significant changes produced by this 
agreement is the end to this terribly damaging international 
grain subsidy war between the Americans and European Union. 
The volumes of European Union and American wheat exported 
will be reduced by over 40 per cent over the next six years. This 
will significantly improve the access and the market prospects 
for Canadian farmers who grow grains and oilseeds.
<P>
	This is good news for farmers. As the subsidies are reduced 
the economic incentive for the growth of industries in the area of 
processing of agricultural products in western Canada will also 
increase. For too long we have in western Canada been hewers of 
wood and drawers of water. For too long we have been shipping 
our produce outside the province and outside the country to be 
processed.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8404"> 8404 </A></B>
<P>
	We will see the day when we will achieve a much greater 
economic diversity in Saskatchewan. We will see the day when 
our farmers will not have to ship such a large percentage of their 
agricultural products out of the province or out of the country 
for processing. Saskatchewan people will do it right at home.
<P>
	We will soon see secondary processing of agricultural 
products in our province. We will be less dependent on the 
uncertainties of international raw commodity prices for our 
economic stability, diversity of economic activity and diversity 
of markets. It is a sure formula for economic improvement and 
stability.
<P>
	The GATT also provides greater protection for the Canadian 
farmers in that the United States will no longer be able to use 
existing repressive trade laws and other regulations against 
imports of Canadian wheat or other agricultural products.
<P>
	This agreement is also good news for the red meat sector of 
the Saskatchewan economy. There will be greater export 
opportunities and greater likelihood of investment in the meat 
processing industry. The mining sector will also benefit from 
having more trade rules which will ensure continued and more 
certain access to markets with respect to raw products. In 
addition we will see more secondary processing of metals which 
are now precluded from economic export opportunities by tariff 
barriers in other countries.
<P>
<B>(1145) </B>
<P>
	The GATT will also help the pulp sectors of our economies 
again by the reduction of tariffs. This will enhance the viability 
of the Canadian industry and enhance the economies of 
Weyerhauser Canada Limited, the owners of an already 
successful pulp and paper complex in the riding which I 
represent. The production of wood products and wood will also 
be enhanced for the same basic reasons.
<P>
	The GATT is certainly a big help in terms of specific primary 
production sectors that will benefit from the reduction in tariffs 
and in terms of secondary or processed products.
<P>
	One of the largest benefits to Canada from the GATT is the 
fact that clearer trading rules have been established and more 
effective measures for settling disputes have been put into place. 
This is particularly important and beneficial to Canada which 
has a mid-size economy. This will also ensure that the rule of 
law determines trade disputes and not simply have trade 
disputes resolved by who has the biggest economy or who can 
throw their economic weight around on the international scene.
<P>
	This is particularly helpful to third world economies that for 
too long have been controlled by arbitrary economic interests 
outside their borders and by the economies of industrialized 
nations. This allows them access to fair treatment. When they 
can rely on the rule of law as opposed to economic might they 
will achieve greater economic self-sufficiency. This will allow 
the economies of such third world countries to grow. When  their 
economies grow they will have greater economic wherewithal to 
achieve and to purchase more goods and services from countries 
like Canada.
<P>
	This deal is good for all of Canada but it is good for western 
Canada, Saskatchewan and Prince Albert-Churchill River. 
Whether we are talking about opportunities of a more 
substantial nature in the pulp and paper industry, the mining 
sector, the agricultural sector, the wood products sector or any 
manufacturing or value added industries or activities associated 
with primary resource production, all these opportunities will 
have a very positive impact on the good people of my riding.
<P>
	The agreement will free up the truly entrepreneurial spirit 
which already exists in fine measure in my riding and across the 
country. Over time increased wealth and opportunity will result, 
which is good for all our people.
<P>
	Once again I congratulate the Minister for International Trade 
and the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food for their efforts, 
their vision and their success in doing their part to ensure the 
government will live up to its commitment contained in the red 
book to create jobs and bring dignity back to the lives of many 
Canadians who are out of work through no fault of their own. 
This is what we promised to do. This is what we are doing. This 
is what we will continue to do with the help of all Canadians to 
create jobs and economic opportunity and stability.
<P>
	The GATT is a good agreement. The bill and consequent 
amendments supporting the agreement are in the best interests 
of all of Canada, and I speak in favour of it. Finally, I thank all 
members from the opposition parties who supported this 
excellent initiative and agreement.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the hon. member's comments.
<P>
	We have been dealing with the backtracking of grain for the 
last year and we still have not seen any action on it by the 
minister. How much time does the hon. member think we have to 
resolve some of these issues? They will be very critical when we 
come into the World Trade Organization. I would appreciate a 
few comments on that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kirkby:</B> Mr. Speaker, on the question of the hon. member 
with respect to backtracking, it has been made clear by the 
minister of agriculture that this type of wasteful practice must 
be dealt with.
<P>
	The minister has already conducted extensive consultations 
and they are still ongoing. I think there is general agreement 
among all players across the country who see this type of 
backtracking presently going on that the practice must stop. The 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8405"> 8405 </A></B>
<P>
consultation process must continue and will continue. Action 
will be taken once the appropriate legislative changes are made.
<P>
<B>(1150 ) </B>
<P>
	It is certainly our desire to implement all changes necessary to 
ensure that Canada complies with the international agreement 
on tariffs and trade. We will take those steps. The minister of 
agriculture is working very hard and will be coming up with a 
solution to the particular issue.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we all realize that Canada is at its best during periods 
of negotiation agreements outside the country.
<P>
	The problems that I hear from many business people in 
Canada seem to be interprovincial trade barriers along with high 
taxation in Canada. What does the hon. member think about 
interprovincial trade barriers?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kirkby:</B> Mr. Speaker, certainly the existence of 
interprovincial trade barriers is a very important issue that must 
be dealt with. As the hon. member will be aware, the Minister of 
Industry in conjunction with his provincial counterparts has 
already taken steps to reduce interprovincial trade barriers. This 
culminated in an agreement which was signed and agreed to 
some time last summer.
<P>
	This is also something that has been very important to many 
other ministers in government, particularly the Minister of 
Human Resources Development who for many years has 
advocated much closer economic links among western 
provinces to reduce interprovincial barriers.
<P>
	This will take a continued effort to ensure these barriers are 
removed in a sensible fashion. We have accomplished a lot 
already; it is a start. We must continue to ensure that the types of 
barriers which impede economic growth and negatively impact 
our international competitiveness are reduced to make 
companies all across this great country more competitive and 
more able to fight it out on the world scale. This will in turn have 
a great and positive economic impact all across the country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it gives 
me great pleasure to enter the debate on Bill C-57, an act 
respecting the World Trade Organization. This is an extension of 
the Uruguay round agreement.
<P>
	It is appropriate to consider why we need free trade. As the 
history of the world has developed different countries have 
created trade barriers. We have used all sorts of tariffs in our 
country to protect local industry.
<P>
	We support and protect quite often inefficient industries all 
over the world. In other words when somebody can make 
widgets a bit better in Africa then we can and should allow them 
to do it. We may well do better some of the things we are strong 
at such as the pulp and paper industry. This is why free trade is 
good.
<P>
	The important part for Canada is to realize that by freer trade 
we are making the trading mechanism more efficient. We are 
also increasing the actual trade in business that goes on in the 
world. Canada will have a percentage share of a larger pot. We 
will all be better off. Basically free trade is a win-win situation.
<P>
	Another aspect in our economy and in the world is that 
bigness in industry is going out of vogue. Large industries 
throughout North America, Europe and other industrialized 
countries are under constant pressure to downsize, to be smaller, 
to be more effective and to be more efficient to deal with 
specific niche markets in their own communities. These two 
factors have a big role to play for Canada.
<P>
<B>(1155 ) </B>
<P>
	Canada has been very much involved in the resource based 
sector. I think of iron mining, steel fabrication and forestry 
products. All these industries, it would appear to me, are 
somewhat in decline in the sense that we have to put more value 
into our products. We have to add more value to them to be more 
efficient and attract world trade. It is no longer good enough to 
sell raw logs to China, for instance. We have to fabricate them in 
our country.
<P>
	Earlier my colleague talked about the grains industry. It is 
important that we value add in the prairies before they go into 
the final markets.
<P>
	In addition Canada has been typified as a country that has very 
specific trade alliances. Historically it started with the United 
Kingdom. It has since switched in the last century primarily to 
the United States. We talk about Canada being a world trader but 
in reality our major trading partner, the United States, accounts 
for something like 90 per cent of our trade. We are really not a 
world trader; we are a North American trader.
<P>
	It seems this has to stop. We have to look at the world. We 
have to look at other markets. There are a number of reasons for 
it. It could well be that the U.S. market will not be expanding as 
rapidly as some other markets in southeast Asia, possibly 
Europe or even eastern European countries. These could well be 
the trading partners that will push Canada and its economy 
toward prosperity.
<P>
	The World Trade Organization gives Canada an open door, a 
chance to do something different, a chance to trade differently. 
As we approach the 21st century it is a good time to look at our 
industrial policy and how it can change.
<P>
	I talked about small and medium sized businesses. These 
businesses are growing rapidly and can attract world markets. 
They are the biomedical research industry, software 
development, telecommunications and geomatic engineering. 
These are some of the areas our country excels in. One of the 
problems is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8406"> 8406 </A></B>
<P>
that Canadians do not realize how good they are. They do not 
realize that people in other countries think Canada is a world 
leader in some of these areas.
<P>
	The smoke stacks are growing idle all across North America. 
The smoke stack economy is falling into decay. For instance, a 
recent book by Nuala Beck states that in British Columbia more 
people are engaged in communications and telecommunications 
than in forestry. In Nova Scotia more people are engaged in 
education than fishery, forestry and construction put together. 
This should turn on a light. It should tell us that things are 
changing in our own country.
<P>
	How can the government assist and make Canada a world 
trader? Small and medium sized business will be the engine of 
the future fueled by brains. It will be driven by a new set of 
entrepreneurs. These people will be the new employers. They 
will be the wealth creators. Statistics Canada recently showed 
that job growth was almost entirely related to companies with 
fewer than 50 employees. Those with greater than 50 employees 
were actually net job losers. When we talk about creating 
jobs-and indeed our government is committed to it-we must 
focus on where those jobs are being created. Clearly it is in the 
small and medium sized business sector. Employment growth in 
these companies averages 3 per cent to 10 per cent a year.
<P>
	Canada has been historically a trading country. Thirty per cent 
of our gross domestic product is related to trade and most of the 
trade occurs with only a few companies. These are the 
companies that are downsizing about which I spoke before. 
Often they are the old industry companies.
<P>
	We must create a new impetus to move the small and medium 
sized businesses into the international trading environment. 
Government can play a big role in this. Indeed the Department of 
Foreign Affairs and International Trade has some new ventures 
going with our banking community which are located in most of 
our international environments.
<P>
<B>(1200) </B>
<P>
	They are studying what it takes for these small and medium 
sized businesses to effectively access international trade. They 
have aggressive training sessions and are looking at new, 
intuitive ways to finance export trade for the small and medium 
sized business sector. The Export Development Corporation and 
the Canadian Commercial Corporation will be retooled and 
redefined to provide funding and capital support for small and 
medium sized businesses to access international markets.
<P>
	We need to restructure our foreign missions. I had the 
advantage of being in Beijing in early May and visiting our 
embassy there. I was surprised at the attitude of some staff. 
Their orientation seemed to be to continue on in the 
international environment. They were going to move from 
Beijing to Africa and were never coming home. Quite frankly I 
took offence to their attitude toward Canada. This has to change. 
These people have to relate more to how we are going to expand 
trade for small and medium sized business rather than the IBMs 
of this world.
<P>
	As you know, Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister and others 
recently came back from the Team Canada mission. I would like 
to say one more thing about my own mission. Incidentally China 
is not a signatory of GATT but we feel that it will be in the near 
future. While I was in Beijing I was able to make a contact for 
some of the people in my riding. I note that the township of 
Whitby has entered into an economic alliance with one of the 
provinces of China. Eighty-five million people live in this 
province. Some of the small and medium sized businesses in 
Durham are now trading with these people. This has created 
employment. This is happening now. This is not an intellectual 
exercise.
<P>
	Sometimes governments are the worst enemies of small and 
medium sized businesses. For instance the small and medium 
sized business community is assessed high taxation, both 
commercial and business taxation, meddlesome provincial 
standards and regulations, the dreaded GST and high levels of 
personal and corporate taxation.
<P>
	The deficit has hemmed us in. It has also created a crowding 
out in the capital markets. The small and medium sized 
entrepreneurs cannot get the capital they need to establish 
themselves. Our best commitment to the small and medium 
sized businesses will be to reduce deficits, to reduce demand on 
borrowing to allow capital markets to form and be available to 
small and medium sized businesses.
<P>
	The government has done some things. They involve the 
Small Businesses Loans Act, venture capital programs, but there 
is much more we can do.
<P>
	I am concerned that the small and medium sized sectors do not 
have adequate capital markets. We need to create an over the 
counter small market for small and medium sized businesses, 
one that is easy to access. It should not be like the TSE which 
requires five years of financial statements and a fairly 
substantial track record nor like the Vancouver Stock Exchange 
of which a lot of the investors of this country are a little afraid.
<P>
	What we need is a regulatory process that will allow Mrs. 
Smith at the corner who would rather invest in GICs to invest in 
those small and medium sized businesses.
<P>
	In conclusion I would like to reiterate that it is small and 
medium sized business, together with the GATT negotiations 
and Bill C-57, that will provide Canada a new future as it moves 
into the 21st century.

<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	It is not to surprise anyone. I am not trying to sneak up on 
anyone or cause anyone any anxiety. But the debate has to follow 
certain processes, and that one is integral to our business here in 
the Chamber.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Godin (Châteauguay, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
apologize. Put it down to my lack of experience. I thought you 
were going to call me at the beginning. I promise I will be there 
next time.
<P>
	Today it is my privilege to speak in the debate on third reading 
of the bill to implement the agreement establishing the World 
Trade Organization or GATT.
<P>
	This debate follows the defeat of two motions to amend the 
bill that were presented by two of my Bloc Quebecois 
colleagues, the hon. member for Laval East and the hon. 
member for Longueuil.
<P>
	The purpose of the first motion, standing in the name of the 
hon. member for Laval East, was to establish a process for 
consultation with the provinces when implementation of the 
agreement relates to a matter within provincial jurisdiction, any 
matter relating to trade dispute resolution or any economic 
matter of major international significance. The motion also 
intended to make prior agreement of the provinces essential 
before authorizing any change to the agreement in respect of 
allocation mechanisms for tariff quotas and before establishing 
or implementing policies for selecting trade partners to receive 
access to the Canadian market.
<P>
	According to the same motion, with respect to subsidized 
exports, the minister shall have regard at all times to actions 
taken in the relevant areas by foreign competitors. Finally, in 
respect of agricultural products imported beyond established 
tariff quotas at a time of shortage of such product in domestic 
markets, the minister shall take certain measures to ensure that 
such products are not imported at prices lower than those 
prevailing in domestic markets.
<P>
	The second motion, presented by the hon. member for 
Longueuil, reflected the spirit of transparency and 
accountability by which we should all be guided today. We 
hoped to amend the bill to make it incumbent on the Minister of 
International Trade to lay each year before the House of 
Commons a report taking into account the priorities identified 
by the committee of the House of Commons that normally 
considers matters relating to external affairs. Such matters 
would concern the implementation of the agreement in Canada, 
trade obligations and commitments undertaken at the 
international level by trading partners of major importance to 
Canada, especially the United States, and finally, the impact of 
the agreement on Canadian workers and companies.
<P>
	Unfortunately for the provinces, for the public, for taxpayers 
and for democracy, both motions were rejected by the Liberal 
government's silent majority. The bill would have been 
improved as a result of these two amendments. However, we can 
conclude from this exercise, whether we are talking about these 
motions or all the others, that the federal government is not at all 
in the mood for a real debate on the question, a debate in all 
serenity, a consultation that would enhance the bill before the 
House today. All the government wants is to see that this 
agreement, whose bulk is as impressive as its consequences for 
our economy, is bulldozed through the House at record speed.
<P>
<B>(1210) </B>
<P>
	Some people here have a good memory and will remember 
that parliamentary indiscretion, that breach of good government 
practices. We will remember how this very fundamental 
legislation was passed in dreadful conditions. If this bill seems 
to be an incidental measure, a legislative adjustment to the 
agreement signed by Canada in Marrakesh on April 15, 1994, 
the details of that agreement will have impacts which are yet 
largely unknown.
<P>
	Perhaps even specialists in the field are still not aware of 
those impacts. The simple fact that they will not consult with the 
people who experience the market economy, that they will not 
listen to their representatives, that they will not listen to 
common sense and that they only deal in figures and 
macroeconomic data shows that the government is intentionally 
eliminating this information and, in so doing, could very well 
worsen the financial crisis in this country. The government is 
not assuming its responsibilities by passing this Bill C-57 so 
quickly.
<P>
	My colleagues have explained it clearly. Quebec is in favour 
of free trade and international trade agreements. As the hon. 
member for Rosemont so rightly said, this is even a very elegant 
way of confirming the sovereignty of signatory countries while 
ensuring their association in this globalization of markets and 
economies. A sovereign Quebec would easily be recognized by 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8408"> 8408 </A></B>
<P>
the World Trade Organization according to section XVI(5)c) of 
the  GATT. This would lead to a definite trade association with 
all other member countries, including Canada.
<P>
	I am not an expert in this very complex area of international 
trade. However, I do know that it is advantageous for all nations 
of the world to agree in order to set a level playing field for the 
relations between their respective markets, in a spirit of mutual 
respect. As Gilles Vigneault once said, the complexity of 
international trade is seven times greater than the mystery of the 
Holy Trinity. Ordinary people have a very hard time 
understanding the issue. That is why I feel I should explain the 
impact of the implementation of the agreement establishing the 
World Trade Organization with a very concrete and 
down-to-earth example, the marketing of chicken.
<P>
	Canada signed both the Free Trade Agreement with the United 
States and the North American Free Trade Agreement, the 
NAFTA. Article 706 of the Free Trade Agreement says that if 
Canada maintains or introduces quantitative import restrictions 
on chicken products, it will have to allow import quotas 
equivalent to no less than 7.5 per cent of the previous year's 
domestic production. The provisions of NAFTA are much the 
same.
<P>
	For 1994, the import quota for chicken is 46,488,000 
kilograms. This is the maximum nationwide, and within this 
limit an importer can apply for chicken import permits. This 
quota seems quite sufficient for this year, since import permits 
granted up to October 25 represented only 76 per cent of the total 
quota.
<P>
	Uruguay Round negotiations have replaced the quota system 
by a tariff system for agricultural products. This was a way to 
apply Article XI of GATT. Under this agreement, Canada 
submitted to GATT, on December 15, 1993, the list of tariffs 
which will replace the present quotas. According to this 
schedule, imports of chicken over and above the quotas accepted 
under free trade agreements will be allowed, but subject to 
duties amounting to 280 per cent of their value, a tariff high 
enough to protect Canada and Quebec producers for a number of 
years.
<P>
<B>(1215) </B>
<P>
	According to the agreement these tariffs must come down by 
at least 15 per cent over the next six years. It is, therefore, a new 
protection system. The previous quota system which restricted 
imports to 7.5 per cent of domestic production is now replaced 
by a tariff system.
<P>
	This new formula still recognizes the notion of quotas, but 
any import above the quota will be subject to duties amounting 
to 280 per cent of the value. It is quite likely that this new tariff 
quota system will be in place by January.
<P>
	Chicken will remain on the list of controlled imports 
established under the Export and Import Permits Act, so that all 
imports will require a permit. The way our domestic market 
protection system is evolving, in a paradoxical free trade 
context, is causing a certain  amount of friction with our great 
neighbour. The United States claim that, by imposing new tariffs 
on bilateral trade, Canada directly contravenes its obligations 
under NAFTA. A strict interpretation of article 302 of this 
agreement shows that Canada must abolish all tariffs aimed at 
the United States by the end of 1998, and that no new tariff can 
be introduced by either partner. If that were the case, chicken 
production would no longer be protected.
<P>
	For its part, Canada is of the opinion that GATT must prevail 
over NAFTA. Indeed, article 309 of NAFTA recognizes 
Canada's right to cite article XI of the GATT or any measures 
that might replace it, to protect its agricultural industry. This 
debate is still to come.
<P>
	As far as the chicken market is concerned, we must recognize 
that there is no drastic change. Whereas we only had quotas per 
se, under this legislation we will now have quotas plus very 
heavy tariffs. What concerns our parliamentary wing, excuse the 
pun, are the provisions in case of shortages.
<P>
	We do know that the demand for chicken products is 
increasing steadily. Be it live, eviscerated, cut up, boneless or 
processed chicken, these products are increasingly diversified 
and in high demand. While the quota may look quite high, 
certain sectors, such as the restaurant business, require products 
that can appear to be in short supply. In that regard, Bill C-57 
leaves it entirely up to the minister to determine access and set 
the tariff accordingly for products considered in short supply.
<P>
	Like the Canadian Federation of Agriculture, the Bloc 
Quebecois would have preferred that the minister be required to 
take action in case of shortage to ensure that the price of 
imported products is not lower that the one asked on the national 
market. Ministerial discretion remains a case-by-case approach 
that leaves the door open to favouritism, if not to circumventing 
standard, equal and equitable rules. Not to mention the zoning 
this bill does, a zoning that confirms all the disparity that exists 
in this beautiful country. This country is united only in its 
opposition to Quebec.
<P>
	This creates some concern. How can we protect adequately 
our farming industry, all the while ensuring continuous supply 
by diversifying sufficiently this industry's production? That is 
the question a good many traders who depend on processed 
products are asking themselves.
<P>
	The implementation of this legislation will no doubt give us a 
chance to get a very good idea of what is at stake over the next 
few months. As stated in the preamble of the bill, free, fair and 
open trade is essential for the future of this country's economy 
and for securing its competitiveness and long-term sustainable 
development.

	Trade expansion contributes to job creation, achieves higher 
standards of living, offers greater choices for consumers and 
strengthens the economic union of nations.
<P>
<B>(1220) </B>
<P>
	A multilateral trading system of mutually agreed upon market 
access conditions and non-discriminatory trade rules applicable 
to all, is the cornerstone of any modern trade policy that is open 
onto the world.
<P>
	The trade agreements resulting from the multilateral trade 
talks of the Uruguay Round will create an international trade 
environment much more open and stable for Canadian 
agriculture, resources, manufacturing, services, technology and 
investments. The World Trade Organization (WTO) will pave 
the way for integrated management of the new strengthened 
multilateral trade system, particularly with regard to trade 
dispute settlement.
<P>
	As GATT's successor, the WTO will be a forum for future 
trade talks on the continued liberalization of global trade and the 
establishment of new international trade regulations. In this 
regard, we must bring Canadian legislation into line. That is 
why this bill, which amends some 31 laws now in effect, will 
implement the agreement establishing the World Trade 
Organization throughout Canada.
<P>
	The future of peoples around the world depends on their 
economic agreements. That is why we are not worried at all 
about the inescapable links between the people of 
Newfoundland and those in Vancouver, between the people of 
Quebec City and those in Los Angeles, between the people of 
Halifax and those in Miami. The identity, the authenticity, the 
necessary differences that expand our horizons are not barriers 
but bridges between men and women of all ages and cultures.
<P>
	Recognizing our differences does not mean withdrawing into 
ourselves but opening up to others. The legendary League of 
Nations is still an avenue which we must seek without denying 
others or ourselves. It is in this sense that international trade 
agreements are a concrete way of recognizing national 
sovereignty. You can rest assured, Mr. Speaker, that Quebec will 
be part of this international reality. A sovereign Quebec will be 
part of the global market.
<P>
	In summary, the Bloc Quebecois will support this bill. Even 
though our amendments were rejected, even though we have 
some reservations, we know that the future of a people depends 
on its reciprocal agreements. We agree with the basic principles 
behind this bill. The implementation of the agreement 
establishing the World Trade Organization is necessary and 
desirable.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened with great interest to the member who just spoke. I 
understand his concern for the adjustment that is  required for 
the industries to make the jump to free trade.
<P>
	The question I have for the member is which would he prefer, 
the phase down of tariffs over a 10 year period through NAFTA 
as he talked about earlier, or the system that is currently in place 
with the GATT where there is a tariff that will be reduced over a 
period of time? Which would be better for the supply 
management sector in his province that he is referring to? I 
would like an answer to that.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Godin:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for this 
question. I am not a specialist in the field and besides you must 
understand that the application to this field is fairly recent. It is 
rather difficult for me to say exactly what is good or what should 
be subject to quotas or to tariffs.
<P>
	Last week in my riding, the issue of the chicken trade came 
up.
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>
<P>
	A businessman came to see me about it. Here again it is rather 
difficult to say exactly what is good or what might be good in the 
future, tariffs or quotas. For now, I think that the businessman of 
course always tries to pay the lowest price for chicken and 
naturally he does not limit himself to our producers very often. I 
think that a balance must be found and only time will tell.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened with interest to my colleague's comments, particularly 
with regard to supply management.
<P>
	I would like to follow up a bit more. In his presentation the 
member expressed concern with the implementation of GATT 
and concerns about which free trade agreement, GATT, NAFTA 
or CUSTA, really will apply. Canada has one idea in that regard 
and the United States has another. Certainly these are very 
important issues.
<P>
	I would like to ask another question. If Quebec is successful in 
separating over this next year or so, how would the hon. member 
rate the harm and damage to the supply managed sector in 
Quebec because of separation? For example, in dairy they will 
certainly lose half of their market virtually overnight because 
right now Quebec has almost 50 per cent of the market with only 
25 per cent of the population. Certainly the rest of Canada would 
not be open to taking this oversupply.
<P>
	I would like the member to comment on the damage that will 
be done due to separation as compared to his concerns in regard 
to the implementation of GATT and the other agreements.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Godin:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his 
question. When we talk about sovereignty, we must understand 
that if Canada were completely self-sufficient, maybe it could 
force its way or dictate to Quebec, but I think that Canada, like 
Quebec, is a country that needs outside markets and I am sure 
that Quebec will do very well in this big system of international 
trade which will be increasingly governed by such treaties.
<P>
	To give the hon. member a better answer, I might suggest that 
he refer to what my colleague from Rosemont said in the debate 
on November 1. Here is an excerpt:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It is largely a matter of international law, the broadening and reinforcement 
of which the minister praised today. Article XXVI(5)(c) of the GATT 
agreement provides that a new state carved out of a country which is already a 
member of GATT automatically becomes a member on becoming a sovereign 
state, provided it accepts the conditions and requirements applicable to the 
parent state. It is quite simple and clear. A C.D. Howe Institute study says that 
most Canadian experts fully recognize that fact.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Quite simply, Canada will respect and work with Quebec just 
as it works with all other sovereign countries.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to pursue this matter a 
little bit further. I think it is very important that Quebec dairy 
farmers and Quebec farmers involved in supply management 
really consider this issue. It is extremely important.
<P>
<B>(1230 ) </B>
<P>
	I would like to ask the member to pursue this a little further. 
First Quebec is not a signatory to GATT or the free trade 
agreements. These agreements would not apply if Quebec were 
to separate. This is the first thing to consider.
<P>
	Second, international law has never had a precedent set that 
would be along the line of Quebec voluntary separation. There is 
no precedent under international law.
<P>
	I would like this member to explain how he can go straight 
faced to the Quebec dairy farmers and say we are not going to 
have a massive problem in terms of having markets available 
and with regard to prices falling virtually overnight to world 
prices, not to the artificially high prices set under supply 
management in Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Godin:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think I may have been 
misunderstood earlier. The hon. member should refer to the 
November 1 issue of <I>Hansard</I>. He will see that the member for 
Rosemont provided a very good answer to that question. This 
has to do with Article XVI(5)(c) of the GATT, which I could 
read, but what I said earlier is that a new state carved out of a 
country which is already a member of GATT need only apply to 
automatically become a member.
<P>
	Also, you have to understand that trade is a matter of give and 
take. The government should not use scare tactics and have 
people believe that the milk which we sell to English Canada 
will suddenly no longer be bought by those provinces.
<P>
	Let us not forget too that western provinces sell 600 to 800 
million dollars worth of beef to Quebec. I do not think that the 
beef industry in English Canada exists merely to help Quebec. 
That beef is raised because there are profits to be made. And why 
do they sell it in Quebec rather than elsewhere? Because they 
have the advantage of selling it right here in Quebec, where their 
clientele is located.
<P>
	It will be a matter of give and take. If you refuse to buy 
Quebec's milk, you might have to consider selling your beef 
elsewhere.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> Mr. Speaker, when the hon. member makes a 
comparison between supply managed industry, which is an 
industry that has an artificially high price developed, and the 
beef industry, he is fooling no one. Clearly beef trades at world 
prices everywhere including inside Canada. Quebec has become 
a much smaller part of the Canadian beef market. Trying to 
compare the consequences of supply management with that of 
beef is totally trying to fool someone and it is not going to work 
here.
<P>
	I would like the member to respond to that.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Godin:</B> Mr. Speaker, we are not trying to fool anybody. 
This is simply the reality. This is business. When you do 
business, whether it is milk, beef or other products, it is a matter 
of give and take. You negotiate and you strike a deal: I buy your 
product and you buy mine.
<P>
	As regards Quebec's sovereignty, if it is so bad for Quebecers, 
then why is English Canada about to spend hundreds of 
millions? Already, the government is preparing to air 13 
television broadcasts in Quebec, to show the benefits related to 
being part of Canada.
<P>
	When I was 14, I was apprised of the sale of our neighbour's 
business. The buyer asked the following questions: ``Do you 
want to sell your business?'' ``Yes.'' ``Do you have debts?'' 
``No.'' ``Are you incurring a deficit or making a profit?'' ``I 
make a profit.'' ``How much do you want?'' The scenario will be 
the same for Canada. If Canada has a debt of $508 billion and a 
deficit of $40 billion, this will have to be taken into account. You 
can be sure that if it were not good for Canada to keep Quebec, it 
would let us go much more easily than it is doing now.

Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to say a few words on Bill C-57, an 
act to implement the agreement establishing the World Trade 
Organization.
<P>
	The World Trade Organization which Canada is joining will 
only work if there is a political will on the part of every nation to 
make it work. The Americans complain about loss of 
sovereignty through the GATT-tough bananas. We talked 
about that in this House during the free trade agreement and we 
did not get very much sympathy for Canada.
<P>
	Whenever you join a world organization there are certain 
things to which you have to agree and as a responsible nation 
you are expected to fulfil. Therefore, every nation that joins the 
World Trade Organization had better know where it is going.
<P>
	Just because we are having a debate in this House, just 
because we pass this bill does not mean that there are not going 
to be problems. There are also going to be many positive sides to 
the agreement.
<P>
	The hon. member for Malpeque delivered an excellent speech 
on this a few days ago. He talked about the business pressures 
that are being brought to bear on the American Congress. Today 
where there is a Republican Congress and a Democratic 
president, it probably becomes even more underlined than it was 
a few months ago.
<P>
	A business paper presented to the American Congress simply 
stated: ``The only way that international bodies such as the 
World Trade Organization gain strength is to take power from 
their member countries. This is precisely what the World Trade 
Organization does. The World Trade Organization is a 
stealth-like power grab by international bureaucrats of 
unprecedented proportions. It diminishes U.S. sovereignty. It 
shifts control to a world trade system from developed nations to 
small and undeveloped countries. Most significant, it creates an 
international autocracy that overlaps United States democratic 
institutions''. That is the kind of pressure that is being brought 
to bear on the American Congress by its business community.
<P>
	Let us turn for a moment to what the Senate bill and the House 
of Representatives bill actually says to implement this 
legislation on the World Trade Organization.
<P>
	Section 102(a)(1) states the following: ``United States law to 
prevail in conflict. No provision of any of the Uruguay round 
agreements nor the application of any provision to any person or 
circumstance that is inconsistent with any law of the United 
States shall have effect''. How can the United States under that 
condition sign the World Trade Organization agreement? It is  
saying it is not going to abide by it before it even accepts it.
<P>
	Going on to Mickey Kantor who is the trade representative for 
the United States on the World Trade Organization, he said: 
``Our sovereignty is more protected under this new agreement 
than it has been in the 47 years of the old GATT.
<P>
<B>(1240 ) </B>
<P>
	Section 102 of the implementing legislation is clear that when 
there is any conflict between either the Uruguay round 
agreement or any regulation thereunder and U.S. law, the U.S. 
law applies in every case''.
<P>
	Those words are very familiar. I remember very clearly, as 
other members will, having heard those same comments in this 
same House of Commons when we were debating the 
Canada-U.S. free trade agreement, that U.S. law would prevail.
<P>
	Those are some of the concerns that we must have in 
discussing this legislation. I want to come back to my initial 
statement that the World Trade Organization will not work 
unless there is a political will on the part of every nation that 
signs that agreement to make it work.
<P>
	I have here an example of an American law that was passed in 
1930 right after the great recession started. It dealt with 
products going to the United States. As an example, I will cite 
Eddy Match Co. If the match pack had the name of a restaurant 
on it, the made in Canada logo had to come right underneath the 
restaurant name. If it had the name of another restaurant, 
suppose it was a chain of restaurants, the made in Canada logo 
had to come immediately after that in the same size lettering. 
Everything had to be in the same size lettering.
<P>
	When this did not happen, the trucks were stopped at the 
American border. The trucks were stopped at the American 
border 62 years later in 1992 because the made in Canada logo 
was not in the proper place on the package of matches to suit 
American customs. They were looking for irritants, for ways to 
keep Canadian products out of the United States. If this is the 
way they are going to operate, then how can the world receive 
fair treatment under these kinds of policies?
<P>
	One of the ways for Canada to go in the World Trade 
Organization is to follow up on the excellent example set by the 
Prime Minister, by nine premiers and by about 375 business 
people, to bombard China in a very friendly way based on our 
relations over many decades. The visit to Hong Kong and to 
other Asian countries was a phenomenal success. The same 
process can be used in other areas of the world. We should be 
targeting those countries that are developing a large middle 
class. That is what there is in many Asian countries today.
<P>
	There is a large middle class developing there that is going to 
be able to do business with other countries of the world. 
Business people could go there and talk to them and make 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8412"> 8412 </A></B>
<P>
agreements. Selling our technology is a  big route. Canada has 
laid some excellent bases on R and D and technology over the 
years.
<P>
	Private industry in Canada has one of the poorest records of 
the big seven nations in the areas of participating in research and 
development. In order to make this World Trade Organization a 
success Canadian businesses are going to have to set more aside 
for R and D.
<P>
<B>(1245 ) </B>
<P>
	If they do not, we will be in trouble in competition down the 
road. If they do, we will be able to compete with anybody at the 
industrial level. The sale of two Candu reactors to China is one 
great example of what can be done.
<P>
	Here is a developing middle class. Here is a country that is 
moving ahead very rapidly. It is going to need all kinds of 
energy. There is an opportunity there for us in the future for 
more sales. Radioisotopes for medical purposes, there is a whole 
market opening up around the world, particularly in Asian 
countries.
<P>
	There will have to be a lot of emphasis put on eastern Europe. 
The economies there are in very bad shape. It is to the benefit of 
the rest of the world to try to help those countries get back on 
their feet so that they too become very worthwhile trading 
partners.
<P>
	I want to conclude by repeating an article from the <I>Globe and 
Mail</I> dated January 9, 1992. I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>As tariffs continue to fall under the Canada-U.S. free trade agreement, 
Canadian exporters complain that the United States is increasingly turning to 
the marking rules as a trade barrier to Canadian goods.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``It's a significant irritant'', said Jim Moore, vice-president for policy at 
the Canadian Exporters' Association. ``The U.S. is the only country with 
comprehensive country-of-origin markings.''</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Those things have to go if we are going to deal with one 
another on a fair basis. The supply management system, which 
is very important to Canadian agriculture, will have to be 
protected in some way by this government. We have high tariffs 
now. We had better be ready for some strong negotiations down 
the road because we want those things to remain in place.
<P>
	Farming is an industry in this country the same as any other. It 
has to be managed properly and it has to have the support of the 
Government of Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Walt Lastewka (St. Catharines, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to rise today to address the legislation before us, Bill 
C-57, an act which implements the agreement establishing the 
World Trade Organization.
<P>
	As a member of the House of Commons standing committee 
which studied this bill, I know how important this proposed 
legislation will be for Canadian business. The government is 
very aware of the need to provide a positive environment for 
business in Canada. We know that it is essential for business to 
have all the benefits possible to compete domestically and in the 
global marketplace.
<P>
	Domestically the government has worked to provide an 
environment where more jobs will be created and business can 
excel. We have implemented the infrastructure program with the 
provinces, directly creating 90,000 jobs over two years. We are 
also outlining an agenda to create a better environment for small 
business, including working capital for growth, programs to 
help small businesses expand and create new jobs, the single 
business registration number to cut paperwork, Canada business 
centres for one-stop shopping for government services, and the 
technology incubator, a very important item.
<P>
	With the co-operation of the provinces we have reached the 
first ever federal-provincial agreement on eliminating internal 
trade barriers, an area where much more work needs to be done. 
The Canadian economy created over 300,000 jobs in the first 
nine months of this year, most of them full time.
<P>
	As an example, an upturn in the domestic and export sales in 
the automobile industry resulted in an announcement at General 
Motors that it would be postponing the planned phasedown of 
the foundry operations previously scheduled for December in 
my riding. The foundry is a major contributor to the 
employment in St. Catharines and this was very positive news.
<P>
	We also know the importance of assisting Canadian business 
internationally. Canada belongs to a continually expanding 
international market. Making those markets accessible to 
Canadian companies is vital.
<P>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
	Economically, trade must be one of our top priorities. This is 
because one in five jobs in Canada is generated by exports. In 
fact among G-7 countries Canada is second only to Germany in 
dependence on international trade. Last year during the election 
this government stated in its red book that trade policy and trade 
relations are crucially important to the achievement of Canada's 
economic and social goals.
<P>
	We noted the importance the GATT has had to Canada in 
improving access to international markets. We made it clear that 
we supported a resolution to the stalled Uruguay round talks.
<P>
	The red book also dealt with the problem of definition of 
subsidies and dumping and that Canada has been subject to trade 
harassment due to the lack of definitions in trade agreements.
<P>
	Dispute resolutions are often lengthy and costly and of no 
value in enhancing trade or relations between countries. I was a 
member of the special joint committee reviewing Canadian 
foreign policy which released its report a few weeks ago. The 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8413"> 8413 </A></B>
<P>
report points out the need for creating and promoting an 
international orientation for Canadian business. This report also 
states that the World Trade Organization is crucial to the 
development of a rules based international trade system and 
should be targeted as a priority organization for Canadian  
involvement. There is no doubt in my mind that if the world is 
able to have a rules based trading system Canadians will be able 
to succeed on the international scene.
<P>
	The Uruguay round took some seven years to be completed 
with some 123 countries involved. The agreement reached 
includes national commitments to lower tariff and non-tariff 
barriers, thorough reform of trade rules and the extension of the 
world trading system to cover the areas in services and 
intellectual property.
<P>
	The World Trade Organization will implement the 
achievements of the Uruguay round. It will be a permanent 
effective institution to oversee world trade policy and settle 
disputes between nations on a multilateral basis. This is the 
beginning of a new trade era.
<P>
	In his speech in the House on October 27, the Minister for 
International Trade said that the World Trade Organization will 
finally put international trade on a firm institutional footing by 
becoming the third pillar of world commerce and financial 
structure along with the World Bank and the International 
Monetary Fund.
<P>
	The WTO is a major step forward in multilateral trade. It will 
assist Canadian exporters in obtaining fair access to foreign 
markets. This in turn creates jobs and provides a higher standard 
of living for Canadians.
<P>
	Increased openness in markets is also good news for 
consumers, resulting in greater choices and decreased costs for 
quality goods and quality services.
<P>
	Canada must be a leader in helping global organizations to 
mature. Last week I had the opportunity to tour a fish farm in my 
area which wants to export fish to Japan. The Uruguay round 
achieved tariff reductions with Japan of some 70 per cent. We 
know that historically the export of fish has been subject to 
harassment from countervail actions. Under the new deal 
Canadian exporters can expect more secure access to markets 
for export of fish and hopefully lumber, pork and magnesium, 
all of which have been controversial in the past.
<P>
	Another company in my area would like to sell prefabricated 
housing units to foreign markets. This agreement provides 
major gains for Canadian exporters of wood and wood products. 
Negotiators representing our most important offshore markets 
agreed to phase in tariff cuts on wood and wood products 
averaging 45 to 50 per cent over five years. In the area of 
prefabricated housing, tariffs will fall in the European Union, 
Korea and in Japan.
<P>
	Recently, as mentioned many times earlier, the federal 
government led a group of Canadian business people, provincial 
premiers and others on a trade promotion trip which resulted in 
great success and gives an outstanding example of Team 
Canada. Canadian business exporters and potential exporters 
learned that working together pays dividends.
<P>
<B>(1255 ) </B>
<P>
	I conclude by reinforcing once again that with rules based 
thinking and rules based agreements Canada will not only be 
better for it by its exports, but Canada can be a leader in having 
the WTO be good for large developed countries and also for the 
smaller, less developed countries as they too try to develop their 
areas.
<P>
	The time has come for us to be an example to others by 
proceeding to implement GATT in the manner it was intended. 
The WTO is scheduled to supersede GATT in 1995. This is a 
major step for the international community and Canada is 
pleased to be part of it. As a member of this government and the 
committee that studied this bill with my colleagues across the 
way, I look forward to the implementation of the World Trade 
Organization in the very near future.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
enjoyed the comments of the member for St. Catharines. Having 
worked with the member on the foreign policy review, I know 
that he supports free trade and the move to the World Trade 
Organization.
<P>
	I would like to ask this question: Does he also recognize, and I 
believe he does, there is considerable work that needs to be done 
at home to improve our domestic environment for business in 
terms of our internal trade barriers and how that is limiting our 
ability to trade and to give our small and medium size businesses 
an opportunity to develop so they can also become part of the 
international trade environment?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lastewka:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for Peace 
River. Yes, it was great to be able to work together with all of our 
colleagues on foreign affairs and trade. The member is 
absolutely right. We have a lot of work to do in Canada to not 
only be able to work with our exporters and the new exporters 
who would like to export. We must be able to provide them with 
communication networks much faster and much easier.
<P>
	Likewise, I have had a committee in my area studying the 
various areas of the U.S. and Canada along the border. There are 
many free trade zones in the U.S. which export to Canada and 
other areas of the world.
<P>
	We will have to look at, and I think the government is 
proceeding along this way, new ways to make it easier for our 
manufacturers and our businesses to be on the same level 
playing field especially with the U.S. as we try to export, not 
only to the U.S. but to many other countries around the world. It 
is very important that we work with these organizations 
immediately.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8414"> 8414 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, again it gives 
me pleasure to speak to Bill C-57, the enabling legislation to 
implement Canada's participation in the WTO. To introduce 
more or less some of the ideas I would like to put forward, the 
big thing we all have to remember in the developing world and 
in a country like Canada is that globalization is an important 
part of what is happening in the environment in which we now 
have to do business.
<P>
	We all have to recognize that the European Union is growing, 
is becoming more of an entity, more of a functioning trade part 
of the world. It was interesting this morning in talking to the 
President of the Czech Republic to hear him saying that they are 
an associate member of the EU, how they hope to become a 
member and by the turn of the century how that will be a very 
important part of their trade in the world.
<P>
	As well of course we have the Asia-Pacific and the 
developing tigers with all of the power and strength in trade 
there. Then we have the Americas as the third major trading 
unit. As Canadians we are making a terrible mistake if we do not 
realize that we must become major players in the OAS and in all 
that means to the developing of Canadian business and Canadian 
jobs.
<P>
	We have had a number of people tell us about some of the 
negatives, some of the concerns that we will not be able to 
compete, that our big brother to the south will gobble us up. I do 
not see that as being a fear. In fact I see the WTO as opening up 
things so that we now are dealing with a much more level 
playing field, as the hon. member across the way mentioned. 
That playing field will become even more level and we will do 
better when competing with the U.S. and with other countries.
<P>
<B>(1300) </B>
<P>
	We must become very aggressive. We have an inferiority 
complex and have not always been as aggressive as we could be 
in the world of international trade. We should assure the people 
who have concerns that there is a review mechanism and that the 
dispute settlement mechanism will work much better than 
anything we have had up to this point. It will be an opportunity 
to review the issues that affect the steel industry, the beef 
industry and those industries that have some concerns. We 
should reassure them by telling them they will have the ability to 
question the areas of their greatest concerns.
<P>
	According to this legislation and similar legislation being 
passed by other governments of the world, WTO members 
agreed to reduce or eliminate tariffs and other trade barriers. 
This is pretty good stuff and is the kind of thing we need going 
into the 21st century. It is the kind of forward looking legislation 
that is going to create jobs and provide Canadians with a way of 
life to which we have grown used. It is the only way we are going 
to maintain that way of life.
<P>
	Before I get into the main part of my speech, I would like to 
quote briefly from a chapter on international trade in the 
Canadian foreign affairs review, of which I and other members 
were a part. The chapter called for building shared prosperity. I 
put emphasis on the word prosperity. We are threatened with 
losing our position, our status and our quality of life and this is a 
way to turn things around.
<P>
	I hope the Minister of Foreign Affairs will pay particular 
attention to this chapter and this section. One of the statements 
in the chapter reads as follows: ``The wealth, prosperity and 
well-being of all Canadians depend in a decisive fashion on 
international trade, on foreign investment and on financial 
arrangements that facilitate or hinder trade and investment''. 
We should hang on that for a minute and think about what it 
means to us going into the 21st century.
<P>
	It goes on to state: ``In the next century the key to Canada's 
involvement in the global economy will be its ability to build 
mutually rewarding trade and investment links with the new 
trading giants who will be our neighbours to the east, the south 
and to the west''. We must look far beyond our borders for trade. 
It is one of the most important areas for our economy and 
therefore legislation that deals with it clearly affects the lives of 
every citizen.
<P>
	I am sure it is no surprise to anyone that I am a free trader and 
that in my previous life, before I was elected to this position, I 
was a businessman. I believe that the WTO presents us with a 
singular opportunity to gain access to many new markets.
<P>
	As already mentioned by several of my esteemed colleagues 
in the House, some new areas which have been added under the 
WTO over the old GATT agreement are services, trade related 
investment and intellectual property. These new areas are vitally 
important to our future prosperity since trade and services alone 
account for approximately one-quarter of the total $4 trillion in 
global trade. What better country to provide these services 
around the world, banking services, all kinds of services like 
that, than a country like Canada.
<P>
	As we know, services are the largest sector of the economies 
of the industrialized world and in many countries one of the 
fastest growing. As a result of these new rules, the OECD has 
estimated an increase in world trade of at least $360 billion 
annually to the world economy. In addition the gains for Canada 
are estimated at $3 billion annually when the agreement is fully 
phased in. This is not chicken feed. Beyond this the extension of 
a rules based, multilateral system through the creation of the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8415"> 8415 </A></B>
<P>
WTO will also expand Canada's ability to ensure that the largest 
world traders do not use their economic power to unilaterally 
pressure Canada in any trade disputes which develop.
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
	This new dispute resolution mechanism will also increase 
Canada's bargaining power in our trade relationship with the 
U.S. While this trade relationship is a good one and has allowed 
Canada to become the seventh largest trading nation even 
though we are only 31st in population size, it is not without its 
problems. I am certain the WTO will help us to manage this 
relationship over the coming decade and will promote 
prosperity within both countries.
<P>
	I will now switch to the more general theme of trade and its 
benefits for Canada. Over 20 per cent of Canadian workers 
depend on exports for their jobs. That is over two million jobs. 
In addition over 30 per cent of Canada's gross domestic product 
comes from exports. Last year this amounted to around $181 
billion in goods and services.
<P>
	Therefore it is vital that Canada aggressively promote itself 
throughout the world. If we do not face up to the trend of 
globalization, then we are all going to be in big trouble. A 
country like Canada cannot afford to be protectionist in the 
mid-1990s. Therefore it is essential that the House support Bill 
C-57. We just do not have the people to do anything but.
<P>
	The WTO offers Canadian businesses a great opportunity to 
continue building sales abroad. While we also have to open our 
markets to others I do not see this as a fundamental problem. 
While there will be an adjustment period for certain industries 
Canadian businesses can compete with anyone in the world. Let 
us not have that inferiority complex that I spoke about earlier.
<P>
	All we want is a fair and open international system with a 
level playing field. The WTO goes a long way in accomplishing 
this. When it comes into effect next year the WTO agreement 
will commit some 120 countries to gradually reducing trade 
barriers. This will have the long term effect of increasing world 
trade dramatically.
<P>
	As we know any increase in world trade means more exports 
for Canadian business and more jobs for Canadian workers, over 
11,000 for every $1 billion in new exports. This means greater 
prosperity for Canadian families.
<P>
	If we take the figures of the Department of Finance which it 
claims are conservative-I hate using that word-the WTO will 
lead to an estimated annual gain of $3 billion. This would 
translate into roughly 30,000 new jobs per year for this 
agreement alone. The WTO will also help us to diversify our 
trade patterns which are currently dominated by the United 
States. It buys some 80 per cent of our total exports.
<P>
	One of the most exciting growth markets for new Canadian 
trade under the WTO will be the Asia-Pacific region which 
within five years could represent 40 per cent of the total global 
consumption of exports. To date we have had some success. 
Japan for instance is already the second biggest trade partner 
and purchases more Canadian exports than the U.K., Germany 
and France combined.
<P>
	In addition China has the fastest growing economy in the 
world. With its huge population it is predicted that by early in 
the next century China could be the second largest economy in 
the world. At the present time there are still some problems with 
China's participation in the WTO but it is not a matter of will 
China join, it is a matter of when will it join.
<P>
	We would like to see greater trade with Latin America. I have 
mentioned the OAS and the importance of Canada taking a 
leadership role there. While we would like to see the expansion 
of NAFTA which has already given Canada unprecedented and 
preferential access to Mexico's growing market of 85 million 
consumers, until such time as the Americas also decide that an 
expanded NAFTA is in its interest the WTO will certainly be an 
in for Canadian businesses. This is not to say that it is 
unimportant for the Canadian government to push for NAFTA 
accession. It simply means that the WTO will help in the 
meantime.
<P>
<B>(1310) </B>
<P>
	As I mentioned a few minutes ago, under the WTO a new 
dispute settlement body will police international trade disputes 
and ensure that legitimate complaints about unfair trade 
practices get resolved according to a clearly established 
schedule. This dispute mechanism will likely be much more 
effective than the one we have under NAFTA. This should help 
us considerably and help to allay the fears of some of our 
industries.
<P>
	In my work as critic for foreign affairs for the Reform Party, I 
have heard time and again about the importance of such a rules 
based multilateral system. While the WTO does not solve all of 
the problems which exist over international trade, it does take a 
giant step in the right direction.
<P>
	Hopefully in the years to come Canada will play a leadership 
role in promoting the strengthening of this rules based 
multilateral system by promoting the WTO to effectively deal 
with the questions of trade remedies and anti-dumping actions.
<P>
	Another area which the WTO will have to tackle is the whole 
problem of agricultural export subsidies. While the WTO does 
good work to promote Canadian interests, clearly a great deal 
remains to be done to straighten out the mess of agricultural 
subsidies that have developed over the years. The Reform Party 
would like to see the government take a constructive and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8416"> 8416 </A></B>
<P>
aggressive role in this respect and the WTO is a vehicle through 
which it can happen.
<P>
	I would now like to speak to the related topic of internal trade 
barriers. I heard the previous speaker talk about that a little bit. 
It is incredibly ironic that we are making good progress in 
eliminating our international barriers and yet we are stuck with 
the barriers within Canada.
<P>
	Under the current system Canada's domestic market is 
seriously split by provincial trade barriers. This not only affects 
our competitiveness internationally but it reduces our collective 
prosperity at home. Provincial impediments to free trade add 
around $6.5 billion annually to the cost of doing business. This 
is absolutely unacceptable. It amounts to approximately $1,000 
per family.
<P>
	While we have taken some steps forward, nobody has really 
attacked the problem as we feel it should be attacked. We would 
press the federal government to push harder on the provinces to 
eliminate these trade barriers because this is going to slow down 
our ability to take advantage of the WTO.
<P>
	If we could eliminate barriers to trade at home it would 
increase the efficiency of Canadian businesses and also expand 
their ability to trade internationally. What better way is there to 
improve our position in the international marketplace? This is 
especially true for small and medium sized businesses which are 
suffering under the current system.
<P>
	To conclude, Canada must aggressively promote free trade 
throughout the world. This means eliminating provincial trade 
barriers, becoming a leader in the WTO, becoming a leader in 
the OAS and fulfilling our international commitments.
<P>
	The first goal can be accomplished by working with the 
provinces. The second one involves working with other 
countries to ensure that the new World Trade Organization 
operates in a way that is genuinely universal and multilateral, 
with the widest possible membership consistent with generally 
accepted standards.
<P>
	It is obvious that support for the WTO and the involvement is 
there. We can see the prosperity it will bring for all of us. It is 
just a matter of providing information to people about all of the 
positives that this new trade agreement will provide for us.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Walt Lastewka (St. Catharines, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
want to commend my colleague from Red Deer for his excellent 
presentation. I was glad that he was able to bring out some of the 
flaws in NAFTA that have tried to be corrected in the GATT and 
now the World Trade Organization.
<P>
<B>(1315 ) </B>
<P>
	There has to be a lot of training and facilitating of people 
across Canada in various businesses as far as becoming 
exporters is concerned. They not only have to know the rules but 
have to understand what has to be done to export to various areas 
of the world where the member has travelled, I am sure.
<P>
	To be able to market these goods, exporters will need to work 
together perhaps in a Team Canada approach across the country. 
As far as implementing the WTO is concerned, it needs to be 
done in a very short term to gain the advantages the hon. member 
mentioned.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Red Deer):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for 
his question. As I mentioned, information is the key factor. The 
big problem has been that it is easy to trade with the U.S. 
Everybody knows the language there is English and the customs 
are somewhat the same; it is pretty easy to go down and trade 
there. When things get tight in U.S. trade we start looking 
internationally and our companies, particularly the big ones, 
start dealing internationally. The biggest problem has been that 
a lot of smaller and middle sized companies, once the U.S. 
market returns, go right back to the U.S. market and forget about 
their international interests.
<P>
	I do not want to encourage government to set up more 
bureaucracy to try to obtain business out of the country. That is 
not the answer. The answer is to work with business through 
seminars and joint ventures to get people out there and get them 
the contacts. Government provides the contacts, much as Team 
Canada did. It opens the door and then those guys go for it. We 
have to get them through the door. That is all government should 
be doing.
<P>
	It is a matter of encouragement and of helping with the 
technical aspects but not direct involvement or government 
agencies doing the work for business. That will never work. It 
will just become another drain on society.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lastewka:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Red 
Deer for his response. Another area I would like the member to 
comment on is the importance of being able to export in areas 
where their language is not either of the two languages of our 
country.
<P>
	He started to mention that there was work to be done and it 
takes time. I think he mentioned that it requires training and 
facilitating to allow exporters to export and that we should not 
only export south of the border once times get better. He 
mentioned that areas throughout the world needed to be 
explored and because of the world being so large we had to take 
things on a priority basis to facilitate businesses and let them do 
the work of manufacturing and exporting into those countries.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Red Deer):</B> Mr. Speaker, again the member for St. 
Catharines raises important questions. I am sure we could work 
very well together in terms of what kinds of things we need to do 
to get business promoted.
<P>
	We have a lot of people of various ethnic origins in the 
country and we must utilize them. In dealing with the 
Asia-Pacific we have a million people of Asian descent whom 
we can 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8417"> 8417 </A></B>
<P>
utilize in the process and who can be an important part of what 
we do.
<P>
	Again to go back to globalization, the EU has the advantage of 
being a more sophisticated market. It basically thinks nothing of 
knowing three or four languages and understanding much more 
broadly the cultures of other people. English stands one in fairly 
good stead in most European countries except for the eastern 
bloc. That will help us deal in that market.
<P>
	English is pretty important in the Asia-Pacific but Mandarin 
is more important. That is where we can utilize Canadians of 
that descent to help us.
<P>
<B>(1320 ) </B>
<P>
	Let us face it. In the Americas there are 34 countries in the 
OAS and only one of them uses French. That happens to be 
Haiti. All the rest use Spanish or English. We must recognize the 
importance of those languages and the importance of using 
South American Canadians in that regard. It is extremely 
important. We need through foreign affairs to put a lot more 
effort into developing and utilizing Canadian citizens of those 
origins.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Maloney (Erie, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure 
to speak this afternoon on the issue of the World Trade 
Organization.
<P>
	The Uruguay round of multilateral trade talks under the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade or GATT was intended 
to bring world trade law into the 21st century. Negotiators 
agreed that this could be done by taking three key steps.
<P>
	First, after painstaking negotiations the means were found to 
resolve longstanding quarrels over the existing trade of goods 
including agricultural products.
<P>
	A second momentous measure decided upon was the creation 
of a World Trade Organization. The WTO will be a permanent, 
effective institution to oversee world trade policy and federal 
disputes between nations on a multilateral basis.
<P>
	Third, trade services which account for roughly a quarter of 
$4 trillion in global trade were brought under the purview of 
global trade law for the first time.
<P>
	Along with these three key steps, Uruguay round negotiators 
agreed on more than 25 separate measures which together 
amount to the most significant package of new trade rules the 
world has seen since the GATT was created in 1947. These 
measures include strengthened trade rules, particularly on 
subsidies and countervailing duties, and a more effective system 
of dispute management.
<P>
	New areas have also been brought into the ambit of world 
trade rules including intellectual property, trade related 
investments and services. Most of the 120 countries 
participating in the round have made significant commitments 
to lower or eliminate tariffs and other barriers to trade.
<P>
	Throughout the 26,000 page text of the Final Act of the GATT 
and all its principles, proposals and provisions there is one key 
theme: multilateralism. It is because the Uruguay round puts 
world trade law firmly on a multilateral footing that the global 
marketplace will never be the same. The WTO will put a brake 
on the tendency of governments to use unilateral trade actions to 
harass trade from competing countries. That means Canada will 
be less vulnerable to efforts by larger competing economies to 
use their size and power to interfere with Canadian exports. It is 
difficult to overstate how important an achievement that is for 
Canada where one in five jobs is created by exports.
<P>
	I would like to talk about the second step. The World Trade 
Organization or WTO will implement the achievements of the 
Uruguay round negotiations. By replacing the GATT secretariat 
the WTO will co-ordinate the functioning of its three new 
components: the goods council, the services council and the 
intellectual property council. Dispute resolutions will be 
accelerated with a strict time limit established for the 
conclusion of the process once it is under way. Members also 
make a commitment to avoid using unilateral retaliation.
<P>
	It is important to note that the WTO administered dispute 
settlement process will prevent a single member from blocking 
the adoption of reports of trade dispute panels or on appeal of 
appellate bodies. This institutional provision is the cornerstone 
to ensure that the new multilateralism functions smoothly.
<P>
	As one of the most trade dependent countries in the world, the 
Uruguay round of multilateral trade negotiations was vitally 
important to Canada in terms of expanded access to markets and 
stronger trade rules and institutions. While the negotiation 
achievement is of historic proportions, the task remains to 
translate the outcome into reality.
<P>
	Momentum must be maintained to complete the negotiations 
in areas such as financial services, telecommunications and 
government procurement. Clearly these are areas of growing 
importance to world economic development. We must all strive 
to realize the greatest possible degree of rules based 
liberalization. The potential benefits to both producers and 
consumers should not be denied.
<P>
	There is a question of accession of new members to the WTO, 
particularly and pre-eminently China, Taiwan and Russia. 
Canada is on the record as supporting in principle their 
accession to the WTO. Broader membership will be positive for 
the rules based trading system and will offer significant benefits 
to the countries concerned.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8418"> 8418 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1325) </B>
<P>
	However accession is not a right. Countries acceding to the 
GATT WTO must be prepared to commit to a transparent market 
oriented economy, to embrace the basic principles of the 
multilateral trade system and to provide real improvements in 
market access. On the other hand we must not impose 
requirements for acceding countries that are more onerous than 
those which apply to members.
<P>
	There is the question of the new trade issues: trade and the 
environment, labour standards, investment and competition 
policy. These are questions all trading nations are grappling 
with. They are complex and do not lend themselves to simple 
policy prescriptions. However we feel that certain principles 
must be kept in mind as they are defined, debated and 
developed.
<P>
	First, Canada does not support the use of trade sanctions to 
impose standards of conduct. Quite apart from the question of 
fairness in a world that is becoming increasingly interdependent 
where the one common denominator is adherence to a market 
based system, the costs of authorizing any one country to use its 
economic muscle to impose its own standards are too high for 
all.
<P>
	Second, we must guard against the possibility that new rules 
can become a vehicle for new protectionism unless they reflect a 
broad international consensus. In this respect we are sensitive to 
the concerns of countries, developing and developed alike, that 
fear the new rules may be aimed at directing barriers to their 
exports.
<P>
	Third, Canada wants to ensure that the rules of the 
multilateral trading system are complementary to and not 
contrary to the attainment of broader societal objectives. In the 
case of trade and the environment we are committed to the goal 
of sustainable development. With respect to trade and labour 
standards we endorse the need for compliance with 
internationally recognized labour standards.
<P>
	There is an ongoing process to determine how labour and 
environmental issues will be handled by the WTO. At this time 
Canada is working with its trade partners on these very 
important matters.
<P>
	We feel that international bodies such as the Organization for 
Economic Co-operation and Development and the International 
Labour Organization should accelerate their studies of these 
issues and use their findings to help guide discussion in the new 
WTO. We are concerned that without that kind of background 
work the World Trade Organization could get bogged down 
before it has had a chance to establish its institutional footing.
<P>
	The Uruguay round of negotiations will have a significant 
impact on Erie riding in such areas as agriculture and steel. The 
world trade talks under the GATT produced a common set of 
rules governing world trade in agriculture. Canada's key 
objective in talks dealing with trade in agriculture included 
improved access to markets, increased disciplines on subsidies 
that  distort world trade, more predictable and secure border 
arrangements to preserve Canada's farm supply management 
programs, and assurance that health and sanitary regulations 
will not be used as disguised barriers to trade.
<P>
	Agricultural trade proved to be one of the most difficult issues 
tackled in the seven years of negotiation under the round. At the 
end of the day Canada had met its goals. As a result of the round 
overall tariffs on agricultural goods will fall by 36 per cent and 
no less than 15 per cent for any specific product in six equal 
annual steps between 1995 and 2001.
<P>
	In addition, all GATT countries will open their markets to 
imports by specific minimum amounts starting next year in 
1995, with the level increasing by 2001. Tariffs in place of 
quotas will also provide the tools to maintain an effective supply 
management system for Canada's poultry, egg and dairy 
producers. Producers of red meat, pork and horticultural 
products will also benefit from the new market opportunities in 
Asia and elsewhere.
<P>
	Lower volumes of subsidized exports are expected to lead 
over the medium term to higher prices for grains and other 
agricultural commodities, spurring demand in Canada and other 
markets for agricultural machinery and equipment.
<P>
	Canada's manufacturers shipped farm equipment worth some 
$865 million in 1992. Exports totalled $467 million. More than 
90 per cent of these exports went to the United States. The 
United States also accounts for the largest share of Canada's 
imported farm equipment.
<P>
	The Canadian industry produces four-wheel drive tractors, 
combine harvesters, seeding and tillage equipment, hay 
handling and harvesting equipment, grain handling and storage 
equipment. This technology is at the leading edge in production 
of cereal grains from large farms under the dry land prairie 
farming conditions. Substantial opportunities for export growth 
exist in Australia, Mexico, Europe, Russia, Ukraine and China. 
The John Deere plant in my riding, a leading manufacturer of 
agriculture equipment, I am sure would welcome these 
increased trade opportunities.
<P>
<B>(1330) </B>
<P>
	In recent years the Canadian industry has been in the forefront 
of several technological achievements. Among these is the 
development of a large capacity four-wheel drive and 
bidirectional tractors and axial flow combines. Such advances 
will receive worldwide protection for the first time under the 
new trade related aspects of intellectual property rights under 
the agreement reached in the round.
<P>
	Over five years beginning January 1 next year, Canada and its 
major trading partners including the European Union, Japan and 
the United States, along with industrialized countries such as 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8419"> 8419 </A></B>
<P>
Finland, Korea, Norway and Sweden, will phase out all tariff 
and non-tariff barriers for key products in this sector.
<P>
	Full line firms producing major items such as tractors and 
combines will benefit as tariffs fall to zero in major markets. 
Short line firms making a variety of farm implements and 
attachments such as cultivators, chisel ploughs, seeders and 
fertilizer distributors will see tariffs fall to zero as well. Both 
full line and short line manufacturers will enjoy improved 
access to offshore suppliers of key parts components.
<P>
	All this levels the playing field for Canadian farm equipment 
makers. Before the agreement was signed Canada and the United 
States both extended duty free access to agricultural machinery 
from all most favoured nation countries under the GATT. Many 
of these countries maintain tariff and non-tariff barriers against 
imported farm equipment. Within five years under the Uruguay 
round agreement these barriers will be history.
<P>
	Located in my riding is a Stelco plant which is one of the 15 
companies operating in six provinces that make up Canada's 
primary steel industry. My riding also has a productive nickel 
refinery, Inco, nickel also being a very essential component part 
in the steel industry.
<P>
	In 1993 steel industry sales exceeded $8.6 billion. The 
industry employs about 33,000 Canadians. Another 18,000 
Canadians work in pipe, tube, wire and wire products industries, 
transforming steel into other finished products.
<P>
	As a result of the Uruguay round most developed countries 
including the European Union and Japan, along with Korea, will 
phase out all tariffs on steel and steel products over 10 years.
<P>
	In conclusion, the establishment of the World Trade 
Organization is an expression of new realities in the economic 
and political relationships among nations. The trading system 
no longer operates as the exclusive domain of a few. As the 
Uruguay round negotiations unfolded over a seven year period 
we have witnessed an evolution in the roles of key players.
<P>
	I spoke about the success of the Uruguay round and how it will 
positively impact on my riding. In a very real way our work has 
only just begun. With the all important creation of the World 
Trade Organization we have taken the first step. Now we must 
begin the effort of investing this institution with the 
commitment necessary to take us into the 21st century.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened very carefully to the speech the hon. member for Erie 
just made and I was surprised to learn that the John Deere tractor 
I own was probably built in his riding. I would also like to 
remind my hon. colleague from Erie that, in 1988, Quebecers 
showed the most support for international trade, and especially 
for NAFTA.
<P>
	In fact, in more than 62 out of 75 ridings, the vast majority of 
Quebecers elected the Conservative Party which had made 
NAFTA the cornerstone of its 1988 election campaign. Of 
course, where agricultural products are concerned, Quebecers 
are extremely well positioned in supply-managed sectors, like 
poultry, milk and egg production. To replace supply 
management, the GATT agreement provides for what is 
commonly called tariffs that can reach up to 360 per cent in 
some cases.
<P>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
	As the previous speaker pointed out, these tariffs will be in 
place for the next six years, and this six-year period is crucial if 
our farmers are to adjust and take their place on the market.
<P>
	Of course, in case of disputes, we will be able to present our 
case to the panel. This panel is fine, but among our 
representatives we need to have good negotiators who can stand 
tall instead of crawling in front of our opponents and saying: 
``We have already lost'', even before beginning to defend the 
interests of the people they represent.
<P>
	I recall three particular incidents where I have not been 
impressed at all by the way our representatives have stood up for 
us. First, there was the softwood lumber dispute, then the hog 
dispute and most recently the durham wheat business, which 
especially affected Western Canada.
<P>
	I am concerned about the guarantee and I would like the 
previous speaker, my colleague from Erie, to reassure Quebec 
farmers that the people who will represent them before these 
panels will be up to our expectations.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maloney:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the comments of my 
hon. friend. I agree with him there is no question that our 
negotiators have to be firm and strong. I disagree with him on 
those issues he has mentioned, the softwood industry, the pork 
industry and most recently the grain situations.
<P>
	There were panels, there were challenges. In all those cases it 
was found that Canada's position was the correct position. 
Certainly the agriculture minister in negotiating in those 
situations with the Americans-Americans are tough 
negotiators-has negotiated well for our country. Looking at 
those situations as an example, as a precedent, I have no concern 
that the interests of Quebec, the rest of the country will be well 
taken care of by our Canadian negotiators. We will negotiate 
strongly and firmly for the benefit of our agricultural industry.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I was curious to hear the Liberal member for Erie make some 
comments about the steel industry and the steel producers in his 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8420"> 8420 </A></B>
<P>
constituency in light of the fact that he is supporting Bill C-57 
before the House today.
<P>
	He made the argument that the steel industry is quite 
important in his constituency and that this trade agreement will 
benefit it. This flies in the face of what the Canadian Steel 
Producers Association has told us in this House of Commons. It 
says this bill requires some significant amendments to ensure 
protection of the steel producers and the producers association 
in Canada with trade with the Americans.
<P>
	The Americans have a very strong legislative arm which 
protects their steel producers. When Canada produces and sells 
steel to the American economy and to the American business it 
is subject to some very rigorous and tight regulations. As a 
matter of fact, there have been a number of occasions when the 
Americans have levied anti-dumping charges against Canadian 
steel producers.
<P>
	Bill C-57 does not address the concerns of the Canadian Steel 
Producers Association. Yet the member for Erie and the member 
from the Bloc stood in this House saying they are going to 
support this bill. They are saying it is going to be good for the 
steel industry. To the member for Erie, why is he saying this is a 
bill he is going to support, that it is good for the steel industry in 
Canada, when the Canadian Steel Producers Association says 
that it is not good for Canadian producers of steel? It has asked 
for a number of amendments which the New Democratic Party 
has put forward in this House to assist it in having a fair level 
playing field with the Americans.
<P>
<B>(1340) </B>
<P>
	Mr. Member, why are you supporting this bill? Why are you 
saying it is going to help Canadians to-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. I regret that the 
question and comment period is relatively short when members 
are splitting their time. I would remind everyone to direct their 
interventions through the chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maloney:</B> Mr. Speaker, as a result of the Uruguay round, 
most developed countries including the European Union, Japan 
and Korea will phase out all tariffs on steel and steel products 
over 10 years.
<P>
	I have a quote from the Canadian Steel Producers Association 
that says the Canadian steel industry will gain from the Uruguay 
round if, as expected, this further liberalization of trade results 
in improved economic growth and hence improved steel 
demand.
<P>
	With respect to the new provisions governing subsidies, the 
Canadian Steel Producers Association said it was easier to take 
action against subsidies by one foreign country which caused 
serious harm to our export interest in a third country.
<P>
	Canada's steel makers agree. Some benefit will flow from the 
procedural improvements negotiated respecting the 
administration of anti-dumping procedures. According to the 
Canadian Steel Producers Association the changes will bring 
U.S. practices slightly more in line with Canada's and reduce 
slightly the capacity of the United States to use anti-dumping 
actions for trade harassment.
<P>
	The Canadian steel makers also welcome the WTO, saying 
that it will have a greater flexibility in its operations than the old 
GATT council which required unanimity to act. The assurance 
of access to markets secured by the elimination of existing trade 
barriers-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. I regret time has 
clearly lapsed on this round.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Raymond Chan (Secretary of State (Asia-Pacific), 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, Canada's role in the world can be 
strengthened by developing a secure multilateral context for 
countries like ours within a framework of international law and 
the forum of the United Nations.
<P>
	I would like to congratulate my colleague, the Minister for 
International Trade, for his work in promoting the 
implementation of the agreement establishing the World Trade 
Organization through Bill C-57.
<P>
	The creation of the WTO is largely the result of a joint 
initiative by Canada and the European Union. The WTO is a 
means of securing a common institutional framework for the 
conduct of international trade relations.
<P>
	The Uruguay round signed in April is the largest, most 
comprehensive trade negotiation ever undertaken. Under the 
Uruguay round agreement, the impact on the world economy is 
dramatic.
<P>
	The final package contains over 30 agreements, capped by 
agreements to create the world trade organization, featuring a 
much strengthened framework for the settlement of trade 
disputes.
<P>
	The Uruguay round will ease bilateral trade tensions and 
strengthen GATT rules to make the playing field more level, 
transparent and predictable. The round will pave the way to 
integrating developing and centrally planned economies such as 
China, our sixth largest trading partner.
<P>
	Under the Uruguay round agreement, access to markets for 
industrial products will be substantially improved, with most 
tariffs being cut by at least one third. Overall, Canadian gains 
from trade by the year 2002 are estimated at about $2.5 billion 
U.S. The gain in net income directly and indirectly from the 
round is about $4 billion U.S.
<P>
	Canada will benefit enormously from ratification of the 
Uruguay round deal and by our participation in the World Trade 
Organization through the passage of Bill C-57.
<P>
	The WTO provides a trading environment that is more free 
and more fair. It will benefit our traditional agricultural and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8421"> 8421 </A></B>
<P>
resource sectors and provide more open markets for value added 
and high technology manufactured goods.
<P>
	This will not only help Canada adapt to the forces of 
globalization but will enable us to seize its advantages through 
the development of a dynamic industrial structure. The Uruguay 
round will enhance very significantly our export prospects in the 
Asia Pacific, my area of responsibility and the most dynamic in 
the world economy.
<P>
	The round will provide a tremendous boost to Canadian 
exports to the Pacific in agricultural and resource products. It 
will also reinforce new opportunities in telecommunications 
and other major infrastructure areas where the needs in Asia are 
massive and Canadian ability to compete is strong.
<P>
<B>(1345 ) </B>
<P>
	Through its supervision of the agreements made and its 
management, the WTO will be a great equalizer in international 
trade for smaller, medium sized and developing countries. 
Countries like Canada will be less vulnerable to the efforts of 
more powerful economies to interfere with Canadian exports.
<P>
	Of special interest to Canada in light of recent experience is 
the speeding up of the process and establishment of time limits, 
the effort to make it more difficult to block implementation of a 
panel report and the commitment to avoid unilateral retaliation.
<P>
	Bill C-57 will increase clarity and discipline in the use of 
multilateral trade rules. For the first time there will be an appeal 
process and binding effect which is an improvement over the 
current GATT system. It is important that Bill C-57 be enacted 
as soon as possible so as to give full legislative power to the 
minister as he pursues his important initiatives in the 
international arena for the benefit of all Canadians.
<P>
	Canada's economic strength now and in the future will depend 
on our willingness to stay on the leading edge of freer trade, 
taking an active role in forging new relationships and building 
new structures to extend the reach of a rules-based international 
order.
<P>
	The Prime Minister said in Hong Kong on our recent very 
successful trip to Asia: ``We will be examples for the world and 
we will move into the 21st century, proud, competitive and 
generous''. This legislation will ensure the success of the World 
Trade Organization and will allow Canada to remain one of the 
best countries in the world.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish to 
make a few comments to the hon. member.
<P>
	I am not sure that the hon. member or the members of the 
government realize that the matter of protecting the viability of 
the Canadian sugar industry is at stake with this bill. It has been 
brought to my attention in the past week that if the U.S. actions 
continue to go unchallenged, which are in this bill, by the 
Canadian government Canadian companies will close many 
operations of the sugar industry.
<P>
	In my area there is a possibility the Lantic Sugar Refinery will 
close January 1, 1995 if this bill goes unchallenged in the 
manner in which it is presented at this time.
<P>
	I have been told that little did the government know that the 
U.S. took the opportunity to severely restrict our already limited 
ability to export to the American market when it tabled its 
market access commitments. This deals with the Canadian sugar 
industry.
<P>
	Can the hon. member tell me what the minister is going to do 
about this? We only have about a month to go. It can mean 1,700 
jobs in the sugar industry if we allow the bill to be passed in the 
manner in which it is written.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chan:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am not aware of the impact on the 
sugar industry.
<P>
	If we look at the overall impact of the bill on Canada there is 
no doubt in my mind the Uruguay round and the establishment of 
the world trade organization is a step forward to allow freer 
access to markets around the world.
<P>
	I would like to take the question under advisement and ask the 
trade minister and the department to look at the complaint and 
arrange for a proper reply for the hon. member.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
colleague from the Liberal Party who just spoke presented 
several arguments to the effect that the WTO is supposed to be 
very beneficial to Canada's foreign trade.
<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
	He said that it will benefit farmers, the export of our natural 
resources, high-tech industries, and also our processing 
industries. Can it really be beneficial across the board?
<P>
	He is known to be straightforward, and rightly so. Could he 
take a few seconds, a few minutes of his time to tell us in which 
areas it would be less beneficial?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chan:</B> Mr. Speaker, there is no doubt in my mind that 
some industries in Canada are less competitive and some are 
more competitive.
<P>
	The most important part of this agreement is that it 
establishes a level playing field for all countries. There is a

	As Canadians we have to be very competitive in using this 
opportunity before we can benefit from this agreement. There 
is no other way out. In order to remain economically strong and 
in order to keep all of our integrity and all the values we need 
to be able to compete in the global market. If we can have a 
free hand to compete in the world, if subsidies are eliminated 
from most of the other countries, even in the farming industry 
we should be able to compete proudly and freely.

	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on debate, please.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Before I recognize the 
member on debate, are there any further questions or comments 
to the secretary of state?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, as an 
official member of the joint committee on international trade, I 
had the opportunity to work at some length on the new direction 
to give Canada so that Quebec and Canada perform better on the 
international market. We examined new policies in various 
sectors, and the way Canada should behave with respect to 
international matters.
<P>
	Today, we are focusing on Bill C-57 which confirms the 
World Trade Organization. As a member of this committee and 
as a member of this House for more that ten years now, I must 
say first off that I agree with the bill as a whole. This is why I am 
going to talk instead about the role lawmakers should play in 
Quebec and Canada with respect to this opening of markets we 
will have to face in the years to come.
<P>
	It is the responsibility of lawmakers to co-operate in order to 
create and maintain a just and fair society. To create a just and 
fair society, we must ensure that individual Quebecers and 
Canadians have reasons to be hopeful, at least those who are 
willing to take the chance to be creative, to invest, and to be 
successful in this society. While being fair, we must make sure 
that people can hope to succeed without having to give before 
they receive.
<P>
	Obviously, we must deal with the economy, which is in a sorry 
state right now. Almost 12 per cent of the population is 
unemployed, another 12 per cent is on welfare, which means 
that, depending on the region, 22, 23 or 24 per cent of the people 
who are fit to work cannot find a job. It is a great pity. We must 
deal with this appalling economic problem.
<P>
	We must also see to it that the appropriate legislation is passed 
to improve the economic situation.
<P>
<B>(1355) </B>
<P>
	The economic problem, as I just said, is high unemployment, 
a skilled labour force unable to find jobs, a labour force which 
does not have the qualifications that the available jobs require, a 
low job-creation rate and deficiencies in manpower training. 
We can see that every day. There are major problems.
<P>
	Productivity is stagnating. We know that it is not improving 
and we must find ways to increase productivity if we want to be 
competitive on international markets. Investments are also 
stagnating. We need a formula which will bring investors and for 
that, as I said earlier, we need a business environment 
favourable to investment.
<P>
	For the last several years, investors have been reluctant to 
come here for several reasons, but in particular because of the 
debt and inadequate manpower. Then, there are the markets. 
This is a plus for investors, but we have to find new ways to 
stimulate investment.
<P>
	At the present time, we depend on other countries for a large 
number of manufactured goods. For example, much 
manufacturing is done here but by American companies and we 
also import many products. We are dependent on imports and on 
manufactured goods that are produced here but not under our 
control.
<P>
	We have to find intelligent solutions to promote job creation 
and to improve manpower training. We are still struggling with 
this question of co-operation, or absence of, between the 
governments of Canada and Quebec regarding manpower 
training. This is a terrible handicap for Quebec not to be able to 
control training and to prepare its labour force to serve 
adequately its businesses, and therefore improve productivity.
<P>
	This stubbornness on the part of the federal government, 
which insists on national standards for manpower training, is 
not only regrettable, it is a disgrace. We know full well that 
several countries which are doing well, most notably Germany 
and Japan, have had regionalized manpower training for several 
years, something which is geared to local industry and also 
extends to scientific training.
<P>
	Regions should be able to set their own standards to train 
people in areas where a given region has the most economic 
activity. Mr. Speaker, it is now time for Question Period. I shall 
continue afterwards. Thank you.
<P>

Period.

	<B>Mrs. Sue Barnes (London West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the

recently announced a five-part action plan that will help to 
accelerate 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8423"> 8423 </A></B>
<P>
Environment Canada's greening initiatives and save money.
<P>
	One of the most significant changes resulting from this plan is 
the introduction of the green procurement policy to help ensure 
environmentally responsible purchasing. The procurement 
policy directs employees to use ecologo products or those that 
exceed the environmental choice program and to use products 
that have been recycled or can be recycled.
<P>
	This policy also calls for the avoidance of products containing 
resources from environmentally sensitive areas. Personnel will 
also avoid acquiring over-packaged products and, wherever 
feasible, require suppliers to take back excess packaging for 
reuse and recycling.
<P>
	In addition to saving the environment and money, the 
initiative helps to develop Canadian environmental industries, 
thereby creating jobs, stimulating the economy and improving 
our international competitiveness.
<P>
	Many departments have already taken impressive steps in this 
direction.

	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Liberal government refuses to consider requests from the 
business community and citizens' groups for a reduction in 
unemployment insurance premiums. High premium rates slow 
down job creation in addition to putting an additional burden on 
the taxpayer, who is always paying more for fewer services.
<P>
	How can the government keep turning a deaf ear to taxpayers' 
demands, when it knows that the current rate, according to the 
Minister of Finance, is killing jobs?
<P>
	The minister should establish a genuine job creation strategy 
instead of trotting out the pretty speeches the Liberal 
government uses to impress the public.
<P>
	The Liberal government should find a more imaginative 
solution than squeezing Quebec and Canadian taxpayers to 
service the debt.

	<B>Ms. Margaret Bridgman (Surrey North, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in 1989 a royal commission was formed to inquire into 
the area of new reproductive technology. This commission spent 
four years on public hearings, research, opinion surveys, and 
consultation with a wide variety of groups.
<P>
	In 1993 the commission published its two volume, 1,300 page 
report, making 293 recommendations. While it has been over a 
year since the release of this report, the government's belated 
response has been a promise for further discussion.
<P>
	What is required now is action, not more discussion. That is 
why with the assistance from six of the commission's 
recommendations I have submitted a private member's motion 
on the issue of foetal sex testing for non-medical reasons.
<P>
	I urge this government to follow my example and act upon the 
recommendations of the committee in order to prevent further 
commercialization of reproductive technology.

	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today on behalf of the NDP caucus to pay tribute to Alexa 
McDonough who last week stepped down as leader of the Nova 
Scotia New Democratic Party. Alexa's many achievements in 
Nova Scotia remind us of the way our party has been a path 
breaking party in welcoming women to positions of leadership.
<P>
	In 1932 Agnes Macphail, who in 1921 was the first woman to 
be elected to Parliament, joined the CCF. In 1951, Thérèse 
Casgrain was elected to lead the CCF in Quebec and even though 
she did not win a seat she became the first woman to lead a 
provincial party in Canada.
<P>
	One year after her election as party leader in 1980, Alexa 
herself became the first woman to lead a party in a legislative 
assembly. My colleague, the leader of the NDP, the hon. member 
for Yukon, presently completed this string of firsts by becoming 
the first woman to win the leadership of a federal party in 1989.
<P>
	We thank Alexa for 14 years of dedication to fighting the good 
fight for social justice in Canada, a fight that needs to be fought 
the world over in this era of unrestrained globalization. We 
acknowledge the debt we all owe to the distinguished and 
committed Canadian women who have given leadership to our 
movement and made Canadian history at the same time.

	<B>Mr. Robert Bertrand (Pontiac-Gatineau-Labelle, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, last week, the Premier of Quebec spoke to 
members of the Canadian Club in Toronto.
<P>
	In his speech, the indépendantiste leader warned his audience 
against the consequences of a win for the ``no'' side in the next 
referendum. He said that if Quebecers voted no to his plan for 
Quebec's independence, they would continue to be dissatisfied 
with their status in Canada, and for English Canadians, this

would be as bad as an endless session in the dentist's chair, 
according to the a daily newspaper <I>Le Droit</I>.
<P>
	He stated that a win for the ``no'' side in the referendum 
would be useless and that all Canada's constitutional problems 
would remain, while a win for the ``yes'' side would rid Canada 
of the Quebec problem for good.
<P>
	I think that this week, the Premier of Quebec missed a golden 
opportunity to explain what his sovereignty plan is all about. 
Scare tactics are certainly not the way to sell his plan to the rest 
of Canada. It is important for Quebecers to know exactly-

with the WHO. Forty-two countries representing 70 per cent of 
the world population will make a joint affirmation of their 
commitment to fight HIV/AIDS.
<P>
	The Paris declaration will reflect the principles and values 
already adopted by the United Nations for HIV/AIDS and will 
add a new component for nations to respond to urgent needs with 
practical and lasting measures. This declaration would be 
operational by January 1996.
<P>
	AIDS is a public health issue and political world leaders have 
made the fight against this disease a priority. Special attention 
will be given to reducing the vulnerability of women to AIDS to 
the important role of associations of persons living with AIDS 
and to strengthening national and international mechanisms for 
human rights and ethics as they relate to AIDS.

$31,000 in severance pay. Mr. Ansley was rehired last month at 
an annual salary of $93,000, but was not required to pay back his 
allowance, despite the fact he had voluntarily left his job.
<P>
	By way of explanation, the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans 
is trying to mollify the public's legitimate outrage by arguing 
that such practice is not inconsistent with Treasury Board 
guidelines.
<P>
	So, what does the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans think of 
the rules established by the Minister of Human Resources 
Development, which deny benefits to unemployed workers who 
have voluntarily quit their jobs? This double standard policy is 
only good for undermining the credibility of the Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans and this government as a whole, for 
perpetuating such a practice, which is even more unacceptable 
in the context of a public finances crisis.

<P>
	For over a year we have been listening to the Reform Party 
rant about cuts to government spending. Ranting is exactly what 
it has been because yesterday its finance critic admitted it has 
absolutely no idea what affect its $25 billion in cuts will have on 
Canadians or on the economy. Is this what the Reform Party

This flagrant lack of ethics and of openness, despite the

shamelessly immersed in the same arrogant attitude and even

Uruguay round agreement on April 15, 1994, the Canadian sugar 
industry applauded the conclusion of these negotiations.
<P>

Further, there are 400,000 Canadian men who are suffering.

	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister. The 
Canada-Newfoundland Offshore Petroleum Board just made its 
ruling regarding the award, without call for tenders, of a 
construction contract to Saint John Shipbuilding, as part of the 
Hibernia megaproject. The Board ruled unequivocally that the 
MIL Davie shipyard, in Quebec, had suffered a prejudice, since 
it had bidden on this contract, unlike Saint John Shipbuilding. 
This important contract involves several hundred jobs.
<P>
	How can the Prime Minister justify the decision made by the 
Hibernia consortium, of which he is a shareholder, to directly 
award the contract to Saint John Shipbuilding, rather than to 
MIL Davie, which is a blatant violation of the applicable rules?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I was informed of this regrettable incident yesterday. I 
agree with the hon. member that the contract should not have 
been awarded directly to Saint John Shipbuilding. I have asked 
the Minister of Natural Resources to immediately contact the 
chairman of the consortium and ask him to review the decision. 
Some claim that there was legal authority to act as they did, but 
they certainly violated the spirit of the agreement, to the effect 
that everyone should have a fair opportunity. We hope that they 
will review the decision and allow MIL Davie to bid, like other 
interested parties.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, will the Prime Minister pledge to give clear 
instructions to the representative who sits on Hibernia's board 
of directors, so that he will make a plea in favour of awarding the 
contract to MIL Davie?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we have been in touch with the consortium to the effect 
that it should review its decision. We made it very clear. There is 
one representative, not directly of the federal government but of 
a corporation connected with the federal government, and we 
will give him instructions to vote in favour of changing the 
decision.

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, today a confidential document produced by the 
International Monetary Fund states that the government's goal 
of reducing the deficit to 3 per cent of GDP is woefully 
inadequate and will permit the addition of another $155 billion 
to the federal debt over the next few years.
<P>
	The problem here is that the minister's deficit reduction target 
is essentially political, geared to appeasing proponents of high 
spending rather than a real fiscal target aimed at balancing the 
budget.
<P>
	My question to the finance minister is will he follow the 
IMF's advice and introduce more ambitious deficit reduction 
targets now?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 3 per cent 
target is a very important target. It really does mark that point in 
the evolution of the nation's economy where once again the 
growth in the economy becomes superior to the growth in the 
debt.
<P>
	The 3 per cent target as well is a very ambitious target. It 
means having the deficit as a percentage of GDP in under three 
years. It is a target that has not been hit by any government in 
over 20 years, and it is going to require a very ambitious 
program.
<P>
	I would say that not only are we prepared to follow the IMF's 
advice but in conversations we have had in Madrid along with all 
the other countries in the IMF Canada was singled out for its 
economic performance.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister beats around the bush. Is not the real 
reason that the finance minister will not commit to firmer deficit 
reduction targets that he cannot convince enough of his 
ministerial colleagues to take the necessary measures to reduce 
government spending?
<P>
	Over the last month we have seen minister after minister and 
heads of agencies show up at committees pleading for 
increasing or maintaining high levels of spending, not putting 
forward major reductions. For example, the minister of heritage 
last week is said to have promised his resignation if the CBC 
were to be partially privatized.

<P>
<B>(1425 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this cabinet and 
this government are united behind our goal to achieve the 3 per 
cent deficit.
<P>
	There are no splits on this side of the House contrary to the 
splits which existed in the Reform Party when the leader of the 
Reform Party's hand was forced when his own members said 
finally after a year maybe they should get constructive and start 
saying what that party would do in terms of the deficit.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the fiscal reality is the international money markets 
have already factored in the government's deficit target, the 
Canadian dollar is weak, interest rates are rising and 
unemployment is still at the 10 per cent level.
<P>
	Unless the government adopts a more courageous stance on 
deficit reduction during the present recovery it will make 
exactly the same mistake the Mulroney government made in 
1984-85.
<P>
	I ask the Prime Minister why does he not expend some of his 
present political capital on eliminating the deficit rather than 
allowing ministers to fritter it away on half baked measures?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we have a program that is very clear. We have cut 
expenditures and we will keep cutting expenditures. We are 
making sure at the same time that we have growth in the 
economy.
<P>
	If tomorrow we were to eliminate the deficit from $42 billion 
to zero there would be a huge recession in Canada. The wise 
thing is to do it in a progressive way. We are doing that.
<P>
	There are a lot of people complaining because we have too 
many cuts but we will achieve our target of 3 per cent of GDP by 
the third year of our administration.

question is for the Minister of Natural Resources.
<P>
	The federal government has been pouring billions of dollars 
into the Hibernia project. It has one of the six seats on the board 
of directors, which allows it to influence administrative 
decisions such as the one resulting in awarding a contract 
without tender to Saint John Shipbuilding.
<P>
	Can the minister explain why she has consistently refused to 
answer the questions put to her by the opposition for several 
months now with respect to the lack of supervision of the 
day-to-day management of the company, which has led to the 
current problems with respect to the way contracts were 
awarded to Saint John Shipbuilding?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Natural Resources, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, let me reiterate that which I have said before 
and perhaps correct the hon. member in one small way.
<P>
	We are one of five on the Hibernia management company. 
That company is seized with the responsibility of the day to day 
management of the Hibernia project.
<P>
	I will reiterate here today, as I have before, it is not this 
government's intention to micro-manage on a day to day basis 
that project.
<P>
	However, as the Prime Minister has indicated, in relation to 
the situation involving MIL Davie there is a clear report from 
the Canada-Newfoundland Offshore Board indicating MIL 
Davie and other Canadian companies were not given full and 
fair opportunity to bid for the work in question. The Prime 
Minister's answer has been clear today that we are as concerned 
about that as the hon. member and we will take action.

question is for the same minister.
<P>
	In view of the minister's answer not to interfere with the 
day-to-day management of the project, am I to understand that 
the federal government's refusal to intervene is part of its 
strategy to close down the last major shipyard in Quebec, while 
Quebec has supported 90 per cent of the efforts made to 
streamline the shipbuilding industry?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I want to repeat what I said earlier. I was informed 
yesterday that this contract might have been awarded without 
tender. We intervened immediately. We asked the chairman of

Canadian shipbuilders to bid on the contract.

a purpose in Bosnia?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr.

When we look at the deployment of the Canadian soldiers to 
Bosnia, they have been called upon in very difficult 
circumstances to hold some very responsible posts.
<P>
	They have been delivering food and medication and are still 
trying to mediate a possible peace. They are not there to make 
peace; they are there to supervise peace. There is no peace at the

	Yesterday I was very clear that everyone wants a ceasefire. 
We want the activities on both sides to stop so that Canadian 
troops, as part of the United Nations group, can play their role. I 
think they will serve to the end of their mandate because when 
Canadians say they will do something they stick to their word.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister wants something the Prime

no humanitarian aid being conducted in Bosnia.
<P>
	General Rose said this morning that the situation was beyond 
the capabilities of a peacekeeping mission. If the troops needed 
to control the situation were brought in, Canadian peacekeepers 
would be forced into a combat situation when they have no 
mandate to participate in war.
<P>
	Is the Prime Minister suggesting that Canadians should go to 
war in Bosnia or is the Prime Minister suggesting that Canadian 
troops should come out? What is the Canadian government's 
position?

	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Canadian position is a very clear one. It is to stay 
there and try to bring about peace. This is why they have been 
able to help a lot in the last three years. There was a debate in the 
House of Commons. Everybody was consulted. The majority of 
the House wanted the Canadian group to stay there and fulfil its 
mandate.
<P>
	We will be negotiating with our allies, but we have decided 
that the best course is to be with the others to try to install peace 
there. It is not Canada's role to engage in war. They are not there

Unfortunate, but true. Let us hope he will be better informed 
today. The Prime Minister answered in the House yesterday that 
the amounts allocated for the  fight against AIDS would be 
reviewed, as would all other government programs.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister confirm, as he is about to leave for 
Paris, that his government is preparing to cut funding for the 
fight against AIDS, contrary to the position he took when he was 
in the opposition?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I gave no indication that we intended to cut funding. 
We all know people would like to see us spend more on medical 
research, not just for AIDS but for other causes as well. The 
government has committed $203.5 million over a five-year 
period, and we intend to meet our commitments.
<P>
	If we had more resources, we would be able to spend more. We 
still have $1.5 million which has not yet been allocated. The 
minister has several options, including the summit on this issue 
to be held in Vancouver in 1996. Part of the money will be used 
to prepare the summit, which will bring experts to Canada and 
help us make some progress in this area.
<P>
	Yesterday, I was not aware of what was happening to the $1.5 
million, but that does not mean I am not aware of what is 
happening in this area. In this particular instance, I did not 
know, I made inquiries and I have the answer today. I am

consideration?

from the public in our reference under the Canada <I>Gazette</I> on the 
direct to home policy.
<P>
	I want the hon. member to understand very clearly a couple of 
things. First, this is in no way an overruling or a setting aside of 
the CRTC decision with respect to the exemption order that was 
issued. That order stands and the CRTC has enunciated its views 
on how it would issue such orders in the future.
<P>
	Let me also make clear this point. We are dealing with the 
articulation of government policy. That is the responsibility of 
the government and not of a regulatory body. That is what this 
party was elected to do last October. That is the responsibility 
we bear and that is the responsibility we will carry forward when 
this policy is announced.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, is 
it indeed articulation of government policy that two of the three 
members of the government's so-called non-partisan 
committee have strong links to Power Corp, strong links to the 
Prime Minister and his associates or both?
<P>

the Minister of Canadian Heritage restore the public's 
confidence in the process by dismissing the proposed committee 
and referring the matter to a joint heritage-industry 
subcommittee?

their good judgment, their integrity and their intelligence over 
many years.

ability to determine whether there was any possible conflict of 
interest for any of these individuals. It is my view that there is no 
such conflict of interest. If the hon. member is aware of a 
conflict of interest, I would like her to make specific allegations 
as to the nature of that conflict and make them in a forum where 
she is accountable for those allegations.

	That being said, the hon. member must realize that I, and 
certainly the Minister of Human Resources Development also, 
want to lower UI contributions. In fact, we lowered these 
contributions from $3.07 to $3.00. It is very important to ensure 
stability. This means that we do not want to find ourselves in a 
position where we would be forced to increase UI contributions

UI contributions when it is appropriate to do so.

delighted to hear of this conversion on the road to Damascus. I 
would suggest however that the member might want to listen to 
what the Minister of Human Resources Development and I have 
said. It is crucial once the unemployment insurance rates go 
down that they stay down. The business community and workers 
should not be subject to some kind of a yo-yo effect where every 
time there is a downturn in the economy we are forced 
counterproductively to raise those rates.
<P>
	What we have said is that the rates are certainly going to come 
down. But when they come down under this government they are 
going to stay down.

	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
September 22 of this year the justice minister said in response to 
a question I asked him: ``We read the report recently about the 
defects in the present registration system for restricted firearms 
and the need to improve the registration''.
<P>
	Was the Minister of Justice referring to the justice department 
report covering the review of the present handgun registration 
system submitted by Mr. Terence Wade or is there more than one 
report outlining the defects of Canada's registration system for 
handguns?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, that is the report to 
which I referred.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Minister of Justice has not tabled the Terence Wade report with 
the Standing Committee on Justice. He has not made it available 
to the public and his departmental officials have refused to 
release the report to members of Parliament.
<P>
	Is the reason the report is being concealed the fact that it 
contains a devastating condemnation of the current handgun 
registration system, reveals its failure to reduce the criminal use 
of handguns and also exposes the uselessness of the minister's 
plan to expand this failed registration system to rifles and 
shotguns?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, none of the above.
<P>
	The fact is that I see no reason why the report should not be 
made available to members of Parliament. Had I known of the 
member's interest, I would have provided him with a copy.
<P>
	I can tell the hon. member that the report evaluates the system 
for the registration of handguns and finds weaknesses and areas 
for improvement. It has been very valuable as we have looked at 
ways to design, should we decide to do such a thing, a 
registration system for the people.

Mr. Speaker, my question is for the parliamentary secretary 
responsible for Canada Post.
<P>
	Canadians from coast to coast are astonished to learn that last 
year Canadian postage stamps were printed in Australia instead 
of in Canada. What has the minister done about this issue?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it was in February that the minister indicated that 
Canada Post was anxious to have stamp production back in 
Canada as soon as economically feasible. In November 
contracts were signed with MBC Corporation and the Canadian 
Bank Note Company to return stamp production to Canada.
<P>
	Members will be happy to know that beginning 
mid-December Canadian stamp production will be in Canada. It 
means more jobs for more Canadians.

	<B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, earlier this 
month fishery officers presented the minister of oceans with a 
report showing that a lack of enforcement was a significant 
cause of this year's salmon disaster on the west coast. However 
the report presented by DFO to the minister's review panel did 
not give any significance to the reduced enforcement effort.
<P>
	Why would the minister withhold this critical information 
from his review board?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to assure the member, because I know 
of his interest in the matter, that no information has been 
withheld from the Fraser review panel.
<P>
	If there is information that ought to be presented to it by any 
member of the commercial industry, any stakeholder or by any 
professional group within the enforcement community, they are 
quite free to make those recommendations.
<P>
	I have had a very constructive meeting with enforcement 
officers in Vancouver. I am studying the information that has 
been given to me. As a consequence of listening to people in the 
field, on the front lines and on the rivers I hope to do a better job 
in 1995 than we are able to do in 1994.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the fact is 
that information contained in the fishery officer's presentation 
was not presented to the review board. That presentation 
confirmed that habitat and poaching investigations were not 
done. Undercover investigations had come to an abrupt end and 
enforcement reports were not received at the highest levels.
<P>
	Why did the minister not bring this and other critical 
information contained in the fishery officer's report to the 
review board's attention?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I did not clearly understand the question 
when it was asked the first time.
<P>
	I have no intention of in any way, shape or form, directly or 
indirectly, trying to influence the flow of information or the 
outcome of the review being done by an independent review 
panel headed by the former Speaker of the House of Commons, 
John Fraser.
<P>
	I agree that all of the information available ought to be 
presented to the panel so that a solid conclusion is arrived at. 
Any and all information provided to me, even in a confidential 
meeting by enforcement officers who seek to take me through an 
apprenticeship, is available and will be available to the full 
review panel.

	<B>Hon. Audrey McLaughlin (Yukon, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	The question of private health care clinics in Alberta has been 
discussed in the House for over a year. Clearly these clinics, 
which charge both the patient and the government, are part of a 
two-tier system. The Prime Minister has said he would not 
allow this.
<P>
	As the Prime Minister was a part of the government that 
formulated the Canada Health Act when it came into being, 
could he say, because apparently the department can still not 
decide, whether these clinics contravene the Canada Health Act, 
as he understands it?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we are completely committed to the Canada Health Act 
and it has to be respected.
<P>
	In terms of the interpretation, that question is being evaluated 
at this time. Everyone knows that not every aspect of health care 
is covered by the Canada Health Act.
<P>
	We are looking into it. If it is against the Canada Health Act 
we will apply the act and withdraw the money.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Audrey McLaughlin (Yukon, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have a supplementary question for the Prime Minister.
<P>
<B>(1500 ) </B>
<P>
	With respect, Mr. Speaker, this has been under study for some 
time. It has been obvious to everyone that these clinics have 
been operating for some time. I would ask the Prime Minister

<B><A NAME="8434"> 8434 </A></B>
<P>
the date by which he believes the department can make this 
decision.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister indicated that this problem exists in the 
interpretation. It is being debated between nine provinces and 
the federal government in order to clarify what is covered by the 
National Health Act of Canada.
<P>

concluded we will draw the line. If these clinics are not within

question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	Last week Campaign 2000 released statistics indicating that 
there were 331,000 more poor children in Canada than there 
were five years ago. Given this deplorable situation, can the 
minister tell this House about his commitment to the goal of an 
enhanced child tax benefit?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for addressing what is probably the most important social issue 
in this country, the plight of many of our poor children.
<P>
	As members know, we have tried to address this directly by 
putting it forward to Canadians as part of the green book. We 
want to mobilize full efforts behind opportunities for better 
work for parents of poor children, better support for child care, 
and certainly enrichment or increasing of child benefits.
<P>
	The key question is can we mobilize the support of members 
of this House, the provinces, and Canadians throughout the 
country behind a major national effort to deal with the question 
of child poverty. I am still confident that we can and with the 
help of the hon. member and others I think we will.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="WORLDTRADEORGANIZATIONAGREEMENTIMPLEMENTATIONACT">WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION AGREEMENT 
IMPLEMENTATION ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill 
C-57, an act to implement the agreement establishing the World 
Trade Organization, be read the third time and passed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is with 
pleasure that, after being interrupted by oral question period, I 
take the floor again to say that I support Bill C-57 because 
Quebec is very open to international trade. We have always been 
very open to the world, particularly as regards trade.
<P>
	I was in the process of explaining that rational solutions must 
be found, solutions such as encouraging economic growth 
within Quebec and Canada by providing our businesses with an 
effective trading environment. There are serious problems for 
businesses, because they have to deal with two governments 
which, in terms of taxation for example, use two different 
systems.
<P>
	These two levels of government have environmental 
regulations and legislations that are completely different, which 
makes life extremely difficult for businesses dealing with them. 
For example, they have to conduct some environmental studies 
under Quebec legislation and others under federal legislation.
<P>
<B>(1505) </B>
<P>
	So it really hinders big projects that affect the environment. 
Everything is duplicated, like the manpower office, so that 
business does not have the environment it needs to develop. To 
act quickly on environmental issues, we must restrict the 
obligations that companies must meet in this regard.
<P>
	One solution is international trade. It is not the only one, of 
course, but it is a very important way to promote our companies. 
Again, I must mention here that I tabled a motion in this House 
which was defeated last night. Its purpose was to provide the 
steel industry, among others, with sufficiently strict regulations 
here in Canada, or at least regulations that are as strict as those 
in the United States for import-export and especially for 
dumping.
<P>
	This motion was defeated and, again, I did not understand 
why the government still did not accept this motion. On many 
occasions, representatives of the steel industry asked us to 
revise the regulations in Bill C-57. The government refused to 
support my motion and I am very sorry that this part of the law 
could not be amended.
<P>
	I want to say to people in the steel industry, who are surely 
listening to me today, because they care about what is going on 
here, that we in the Bloc Quebecois did all that was necessary to 
meet their requests. Unfortunately, the government did not 
consider our demands or those from the steel industry.
<P>
	To face this international competition, we must also 
encourage creativity. We also tabled a motion. The bill says, for 
example, that present products must be protected. We tabled a 
motion that would also have protected future products. We think 
it is very important, if you want to encourage creativity, our 
business people and small businesses, to protect future products 
in the same way as existing products are protected by law.
<P>
	Once again the government refused to accept this motion, a 
motion we felt was entirely normal and fair in its attempt to help 
our creators, SMEs and researchers improve their prospects of 
succeeding in these increasingly globalized markets.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8435"> 8435 </A></B>
<P>
	We must take an intelligent and structured approach. We must 
avoid wasting energy and resources on taking on all markets 
indiscriminately, without considering factors such as 
transportation, specialization and economies of scale. We need 
good strategic planning that considers our strengths and 
weaknesses, the benefits and drawbacks, while monitoring the 
development of attractive and promising markets.
<P>
	In Quebec, we must consolidate our positions on the North 
American market, now and in the future. In Quebec especially, 
we supported the North American Free Trade Agreement, and 
we also supported the first free trade agreement with the United 
States, which, as I remember, was a very controversial issue. I 
was a member of the government at the time, and in 1988, when I 
ran for Parliament, I did so mainly to help adopt the free trade 
agreement with the United States.
<P>
<B>(1510) </B>
<P>
	I was supported in this endeavour by the vast majority of 
Quebecers. We were practically unanimous in our approval of 
free trade between Canada and the United States. For us in 
Quebec, it was crucial.
<P>
	For many years and many decades, we have been involved in 
trade with the United States. About 80 per cent of our exports go 
to the United States. It should come as no surprise that we want 
to go on consolidating our efforts to continue our exports to this 
very important market.
<P>
	To give you some idea of the size of the U.S. market, I will 
look at the number of people living within a certain radius. For 
instance, if we look at the number of people living within a 
radius of 1,000 kilometres from Montreal, including the United 
States and Toronto, there are 100 million people. Imagine, 100 
million consumers, among the richest in the world! That is why 
it is so important for us in Quebec to continue to develop our 
exports and to do business with the northeastern United States.
<P>
	This is not to say we should neglect other markets, such as 
Asia and the Pacific Rim. We know that in this region, markets 
are developing and the standard of living is going up, especially 
in Japan and China. Last year, China's economic growth was 
between 12 and 15 per cent. There are 1.2 billion people living in 
China. We should position ourselves so that we can take 
advantage of the future opportunities in those countries, 
especially in China.
<P>
	We are somewhat apprehensive about letting the federal 
government be responsible for helping Quebec promote its 
economy. We have heard-it is not official, but there are 
indications-that the Canadian government intends to reduce 
the number of employees in charge of international trade in the 
United States, and increase the number deployed in Asia and the 
Pacific Rim.
<P>
	This is cause for some concern as, for obvious reasons, and I 
mentioned this earlier, we want to continue doing business with 
the United States, and increase our trade connections with them. 
First of all, it is a great market,  where trading is made easier by 
the fact that the Americans speak a familiar language, namely 
English, and that our cultures -economic cultures and social 
cultures- are similar. We live in a space that is almost the same, 
but it is quite another story when you talk about the Asia-Pacific 
area, with the linguistic difficulties being bigger, the distances 
longer and the efforts required to promote our products take 
longer and cost more to produce results.
<P>
	In a context of staggering deficit and debt, I think that we 
must look at the easiest opportunities to increase the 
profitability of our businesses, so that our economy becomes 
healthier and that the governments can get afloat as soon as 
possible.
<P>
	That is why I think and we, in Quebec in particular, think that 
continued efforts are necessary to try and maintain and increase 
our market opportunities in the United States.
<P>
<B>(1515) </B>
<P>
	Of course, this will require a high level of cohesion between 
our industries, the unions, the government, our universities, and 
so on. Without this co-operative effort, I think that we will find 
it increasingly difficult in the future to be efficient and 
productive.
<P>
	This is why we, in Quebec, are looking forward taking our 
future in our own hands in order to act together and eliminate 
duplication of all kind that gets in the way of united action and 
efficiency. In that sense, we are looking forward to gaining 
control over our taxes, to spend this money according to our 
priorities and ensure that we succeed more rapidly in this global 
context.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philippe Paré (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, first I 
want to congratulate my colleague from Longueuil on his 
speech, which is practical and sticks to reality. It is not a 
theoretical speech. We see that the member for Longueuil has 
experience.
<P>
	I also thank him for reminding us that Quebec is open to free 
trade and foreign trade. Quebec is not a society that is turned in 
on itself, quite the opposite. I also thank him for recalling the 
importance of trade with the United States for Canada and 
Quebec; 80 per cent of our trade is with our big southern 
neighbour.
<P>
	I would like to ask him this question: Does he believe that the 
agreements reached following the Uruguay Round negotiations 
will help the poorest countries progress? Under these 
agreements, will it also be possible to protect the environment 
and better protect the rights of workers in countries that are less 
well organized than western countries?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leblanc (Longueuil):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. 
member for Louis-Hébert for his kind words.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8436"> 8436 </A></B>
<P>
	I think that we must be very careful in helping the poorest 
countries, because we tend to think in the short term and to pay 
more attention to trade than to the poorest in the world. I think 
it is obvious that if we increase our productivity, our trade, our 
ability to pay, we will be in better position to help the poorest 
countries.
<P>
	In many ways, we must be very careful not to work only with 
the countries from which we stand to gain the most. We must 
also develop markets with the poorest countries, thus helping 
them ensure their own development.
<P>
	I made several trips to developing countries with External 
Affairs officials. The ambassadors I met told us that one way to 
help developing countries was to trade with them.
<P>
	Since Bill C-57 is aimed at opening up trade, I think that if we 
do it with dignity, we can increase trade with these developing 
countries, thus helping them become better traders. There is 
nothing better than practice to learn how to do business.
<P>
	If we can show developing countries how to borrow, how to 
lend, how to do business, how to make goods, I think it would be 
one of the best ways to help them.
<P>
<B>(1520) </B>
<P>
	This does not mean that we should not help those in need, 
those who must be fed every day, those who need help to become 
better farmers, and so on.
<P>
	In this regard, I think that opening up markets to the entire 
world will give developing countries better opportunities to 
trade and to learn from successful trading countries. I am 
convinced that this will help them a great deal in the future.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I understand the hon. 
member for Winnipeg Transcona and hon. the member for The 
Battlefords-Meadow Lake will be splitting this next block of 
interventions, so ten and five each.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it gives me great pleasure to be able to participate in this debate 
this afternoon. The NDP finds itself in the position of being the 
only party in this House to oppose the legislation we have before 
us, the legislation that would bring into being the World Trade 
Organization.
<P>
	It appears that unlike the government, the official opposition 
and the Reform Party we are the only party willing to develop 
and maintain a sustained critique of the way the world is going 
according to GATT, according to NAFTA, according to FTA.
<P>
	Some would say this places us in the position of being 
defenders of things past and in some sense that is true. We would 
like to defend the notion of fair trade and markets adjusted to 
meet social and human need rather than accede to the demands 
of the multinational  corporations that the world be arranged for 
their pleasure, which is the way we view the WTO and the 
legislation to implement it.
<P>
	The WTO is in effect a new constitution for the globalized 
economy that is written by and for multinational corporations. 
One of the ways this could have been offset would have been if 
some effort had been made during the negotiations or even after 
to introduce the notion of a social clause that would ensure 
multinational corporations and others recognize basic labour 
and environmental standards for instance, to prevent the race to 
the bottom or what is also called social dumping.
<P>
	This was not done during the negotiations, although I 
understand that some countries did bring the idea forward, not 
Canada unfortunately. It was not able to be done during the 
debate on this legislation despite the amendments that the New 
Democratic Party brought forward because the government 
rejected our amendments suggesting it ought to work on a social 
clause and report back to the House of Commons on a regular 
basis as to what it had done in respect to developing such a 
clause.
<P>
	Another concern we had during this debate, which we 
expressed at report stage and we express now, is that this new 
WTO, even though it supposedly offers a new rules based 
trading regime that will bring relief from trade harassment, in 
spite of this, American behaviour under NAFTA rules and the 
evasive measures the Americans put into their implementing 
legislation make it very unlikely that the Americans will play by 
the rules.
<P>
	That is why we offered through our amendments to put into 
our legislation that which the Americans had in their legislation. 
We thought what is fair for the Americans is fair for Canadians. 
What is good for the goose is good for the gander, or however the 
expression goes. No deal, the government defeated our 
amendments, argued against them as did others.
<P>
	One has to ask the question of globalization through the WTO, 
but on whose terms? It would seem to be on the terms of the 
multinational corporations and in a secondary way on terms that 
are more favourable to the Americans than to Canadians and to 
others. Americans always make sure they have these riders, 
these qualifiers, these caveats in their legislation to make sure 
the rest of us will play by these rules. When push comes to shove 
if their interests are at stake they do not have to play by the rules.
<P>
	The WTO as it now stands without a social clause would be a 
constitution for a new world order in which the multinationals 
would preserve their position as what we would like to call 
outlaws. They would be free to pursue their own interests 
outside the power of the law of any one land whereas the 
constitution for the new world order of the global marketplace, 
the WTO agreement as it stands is remarkably one sided in our  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8437"> 8437 </A></B>
<P>
view in its defence of the rights of investors and its silence on 
the rights of workers.
<P>
<B>(1525) </B>
<P>
	It pretends that labour, social security and the environment 
are not trade issues and that attempts to regulate in these areas 
will be considered barriers to trade. It is eloquent about the 
multinationals' right to be free of any public policy that would 
affect their rights to intellectual property or to the free 
movement of capital but it refuses to allow similar protection 
for workers' rights to form trade unions or to have a safe 
workplace.
<P>
	In the developed economies of Europe and North America 
globalization has contributed to the chronically high levels of 
unemployment, falling real wages and workers facing the stress 
of longer work hours. Most important, wages and salaries are 
dramatically falling as a percentage of GNP. That is, workers are 
getting a smaller and smaller piece of the pie.
<P>
	When robust rates of growth such as we are now experiencing 
in Canada continue to be accompanied by depression like rates 
of unemployment and falling real wages, it is clear that benefits 
from growth in the new globalized economy are going to a very 
select group of people at the expense of most Canadians.
<P>
	Some developing countries in Asia have experienced 
phenomenal rates of growth in the new order but in the most 
successful countries like Indonesia, South Korea, Singapore and 
China such growth has occurred in societies without basic 
human rights, without independent trade unions and with 
economies in which child labour, prison labour, conscript army 
labour are widely practised. This is sometimes referred to as the 
Asian miracle, the new miracle. I call it just an old form of 
exploitation revisited and does not deserve the word miracle at 
all.
<P>
	The WTO as it stands puts its seal of approval on a world 
economy in which the benefits of growth flow more and more to 
the shareholders of the multinationals and less and less to their 
employees and to communities. What we should be seeking is a 
WTO that concerns itself not only with the classic trade disputes 
between nations but also the problem of what has become known 
as social dumping, which I referred to earlier; that is, a nation's 
competitive advantage that results from unregulated labour 
markets and lack of environmental protection regulations and 
other ways in which nation states are being asked by this new 
order to play this sort of beggar thy neighbour game by reducing 
the quality of their social standards in order to create what is 
euphemistically called a good investment climate.
<P>
	A social clause needs to be added to strike a balance between 
the market efficiencies of liberal trade and investment practices 
and the social solidarity of all communities that want basic 
human rights and decent employment practices enforced 
everywhere where capital is free to come and go.
<P>
	In debate on report stage, as I mentioned, we proposed an 
amendment to Bill C-57 that would have had the government 
report to Parliament regularly on progress made in WTO 
negotiations toward a social clause. In a related amendment 
seconded and supported by the Bloc Quebecois we also 
proposed prohibiting the importation of goods made by children 
in contravention of International Labour Organization 
conventions.
<P>
	The idea of a social clause is one that enjoys wide support 
around the world as a necessary counter weight to the 
liberalization of investment. A social clause for the WTO is 
supported by the International Labour Organization's 
secretariat which earlier this month recommended to the 
governing body of the ILO that there should be a social clause to 
the WTO.
<P>
	The majority report of the joint committee that recently 
reviewed Canadian foreign policy also included a 
recommendation that there should be a co-ordination of 
international labour and social standards. We were disappointed 
therefore but not surprised that the Liberals who wrote that 
report did not support our amendment that would have been a 
step toward the goal that they share.
<P>
	In debate on our amendment on child labour, the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for International Trade 
said that he agreed with the spirit of our motion and that the 
government was working with the OECD and the ILO on the 
question. He did not say, however, that at a recent UN meeting 
on the upcoming UN conference on social development Canada 
came down firmly against any attempt to link trade with labour 
or environmental standards. Shame on the government.
<P>
	This confirms the dramatic drift of the Liberal Party to the 
right on trade issues.
<P>
<B>(1530 ) </B>
<P>
	The Liberals opposed NAFTA during the election on the 
grounds that there was no definition of subsidies and that the 
labour and environmental side agreements were not strong 
enough. They then proceeded to ratify NAFTA without a 
definition of subsidy and with the existing weak side 
agreements.
<P>
	The Minister for International Trade then talked about the 
deepening and broadening of NAFTA, even comparing NAFTA 
to the early days of the European community. Now the Liberals 
say they are opposed to any linking of labour standards and 
environmental standards to trade in the WTO. The 
metamorphosis is complete.
<P>
	On his recent visit to China and Indonesia, the Prime Minister 
claimed that the best way to improve the human rights situation 
in certain developing countries was to engage with them in 
trade. However, the WTO as it stands without a social clause 
will allow existing human rights abuses to flourish. There is 
nothing in the WTO that prevents countries from allowing child 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8438"> 8438 </A></B>
<P>
labour, from using prison labour and conscript labour or from 
denying workers' rights to form independent trade unions.
<P>
	China could join the WTO, as it is likely to do, and expect to 
enjoy the protection of the WTO free trade rules while it 
continues to allow 10-year old children to work in unsafe 
factories for virtually nothing. Indonesia could continue to 
operate an economy where over two million children work in 
contravention of ILO standards. For the government to deny any 
link between trade and labour standards makes a mockery of its 
claim to support human rights through trade.
<P>
	Furthermore, and in conclusion, the advocates of the 
liberalization of world markets assumes that as developing 
countries become more prosperous internal social pressures will 
be generated from a maturing and self-confident workforce to 
insist on higher wages and better working conditions as 
happened in the past. This assumption fails to recognize that the 
vast pool of unemployed workers in rural sectors in the 
economies of east and south Asia, for example, not to mention in 
the former Soviet Union, creates a huge drag on the ability of 
wages to rise at a reasonable rate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak on third reading debate of Bill 
C-57, the act that implements the agreement establishing the 
World Trade Organization and ties Canada conclusively to the 
GATT agreement.
<P>
	Canadians know very little about the 26,000 page agreement 
that their government signed on their behalf at the special GATT 
meeting in Marrakech on April 15, 1994. The agreement was 
reached after eight years of negotiations. It is a huge deal that 
takes Canada even beyond where the Canada-U.S. Free Trade 
Agreement and the North American Free Trade Agreement 
dared to go.
<P>
	Now, with very little debate, the federal Liberal government 
is going to accept the new world economic order dictated by the 
multinational corporations and reduce Canada's ability to 
determine its own economic destiny even further.
<P>
	After yesterday's vote in which the Reform Party and the Bloc 
Quebecois joined with the Liberals in supporting this bill at 
report stage, it is easy to see who Canada's real opposition is 
here in Parliament. Only New Democrats, who have taken the 
time to examine not only the previous trade deals but this one as 
well, are standing up for the interests of ordinary Canadians in 
the face of economic globalization and the dominance-no, Mr. 
Speaker, the tyranny of the multinational corporations.
<P>
	Make no mistake, the implementation of the agreement and 
the establishment of the World Trade Organization is the 
creation of a new world government which has the power to tell 
countries what they can or cannot do within their own borders. 
This will not be a democratic government. This is a new 
government dominated by the unelected and self-appointed 
multinationals that replace the possibility of a democratic 
response to the problems of the world.
<P>
	This was the deal that was negotiated by the Mulroney team, 
but it was signed and is now being implemented by the Liberal 
government without opposition from anyone but the New 
Democrats. This is quite extraordinary.
<P>
	The agreement through this legislation sells out farmers and 
working people alike and jeopardizes the future economic 
prospects for all of Canada's youth and particularly the youth 
who live in the regions of this country.
<P>
	At this time in our history and at this time in our economic 
development, we should be doing everything in our power to 
stand up for Canadians in all walks of life.
<P>
<B>(1535 ) </B>
<P>
	The World Trade Organization is in effect the new 
constitution for the globalized economy that is written by and 
for the multinationals. The Liberal government has rejected a 
policy of developing a social clause to the WTO that would 
ensure that multinationals recognize basic labour and 
environmental standards to prevent the race to the bottom. I 
made comments about this and about child labour at report stage 
the other day.
<P>
	Let me take a moment to try to tie together a couple of what 
would appear to be unrelated events. Only a short time ago the 
Prime Minister and all of the provincial and territorial leaders, 
except the premier from Quebec, toured China on a major 
business trip. They talked trade and they made a lot of deals. 
Every one of those deals was paraded in the pages of the 
newspapers around this country. What the Prime Minister and 
the premiers were telling us is that the economy in China is 
booming, or is expected to boom in the very near future, and that 
Canada must be a part of that.
<P>
	Meanwhile, back home in response to their interpretation of 
the GATT agreement clauses, the Ministers of Transport and 
Agriculture were telling Canadian farmers that our domestic 
transport support program known as the Crow benefit will have 
to be changed. It would seem that the net result will over a few 
years reduce the money available to the Canadian grain to port 
for export, reduce the dollars available to farmers at the farm 
gate and likely as a result reduce the grain grown for export 
across the prairies.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8439"> 8439 </A></B>
<P>
	Let us go back and have a look at China again for a minute. 
I just finished reading an article done for the Worldwatch 
Institute called ``Who will feed China''? I certainly recommend 
the article by Worldwatch president Lester R. Brown to 
everyone.
<P>
	Mr. Brown acknowledges the growing affluence of the 
Chinese. He acknowledges the growing population, the growing 
demand for food, the growing demand for meat in particular. 
More important, he points out China's shrinking capacity to 
produce food.
<P>
	We know from circumstances around the world that as 
incomes rise, one of the first things that low income people do 
with their money is diversify their diets, shifting primarily to 
more meat, milk and eggs. In China as in Japan, South Korea and 
Taiwan before it, this is beginning to happen. Of course with the 
rising demand for a diversified diet also comes the demand for 
additional grain.
<P>
	China has been encouraging the production of laying hens and 
therefore the production of eggs. The official goal of the country 
for egg consumption has been set at 200 eggs per person per year 
by the year 2000, double the quantity consumed in 1990. By the 
way, that is about the equivalent of what residents of the United 
States consume in a year.
<P>
	With the Chinese population expected to reach 1.3 billion 
people by the year 2000, annual egg consumption would be 
expected to rise to 26 billion. Interestingly enough, Chinese 
hens lay about 200 eggs per year each so China will require a 
flock of about 1.3 billion hens to meet its needs.
<P>
	The point to be taken here is that to reach this goal China will 
require at a minimum an additional 24 million tonnes of grain to 
feed those birds to produce those eggs and 24 million tonnes of 
grain just happens to be the equivalent of the entire grain export 
from Canada.
<P>
	If the per capita grain consumption climbs even modestly in 
China from under 300 kilograms per person at present to 350 
kilograms in the year 2030, demand will also climb to 568 
million tonnes of grain. With a total production of only 263 
million tonnes by 2030, the deficit will be made up by imports 
which will have to rise to a staggering 305 million tonnes of 
grain. We must recognize that in 1993 the entire export of grain 
from all countries around the world was just 200 million tonnes. 
In other words, by the year 2030 China could eat up almost two 
thirds what the world is producing today for export grains.
<P>
	We know that China is not the only country that is growing 
and likely to experience a grain deficit. India, Iran, Ethiopia, 
Nigeria and others fall into this category.
<P>
<B>(1540 ) </B>
<P>
	We need our federal government more than ever to stand up 
for strengthened orderly marketing, single desk selling and 
internal transportation support so that as the world needs our 
grain we are not only producing it but  we are also able to deliver 
it quickly and efficiently as required.
<P>
	I see that my time is running out. Although there are many 
more things that I would like to say to contribute to this debate, 
in conclusion let me say to my colleagues in the House that not 
only am I opposing this legislation in front of us today but I am 
encouraging all members to oppose it and give Canada and 
Canadians a fighting chance to make it in the world today.
<P>
	Trade can spread wealth and knowledge or it can accelerate 
the destructive trends now under way. Sadly, I see this 
legislation and through it this government taking us down a very 
destructive path.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have a question for the hon. member. I will preface it 
with a truism. The truism is that if you do not compete you 
cannot be competitive.
<P>
	Accepting that truism, I wonder if the hon. member would 
comment on whether or not in his opinion various protected 
industries in Canada have been made more competitive, which 
has resulted in lower costs and better product to the consumer as 
a result of restrictive trade processes in the past within Canada, 
trade barriers within Canada, and whether there is a parallel 
between interprovincial trade barriers which raise prices and 
decrease competition and national trade barriers.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am happy to answer that question 
and actually another one that came to my mind as the member 
from Edmonton was speaking.
<P>
	Essentially, as I view the world I see the words competitive 
and efficiencies working hand in hand. A competitive economy 
or an efficient economy are one and the same thing.
<P>
	To me, and more importantly as I look at the whole country, 
when the country or the world looks at an efficient economy it 
sees an economy that will produce wealth that can be 
redistributed to ensure that all members of that particular area 
will be able to benefit from that increased wealth.
<P>
	An efficient economy produces jobs. The world economy 
today is not increasing jobs. The OECD countries are all 
exhibiting unemployment rates from 7 per cent to 30 per cent. 
Those sorts of numbers tell us that we are not a very efficient 
economy.
<P>
	One of the things that I had hoped to indicate in my remarks 
while I had the floor but was unable to because of time dealt with 
the matter of trade and the environment. I wanted to indicate in 
answer to this question that I believe that trade and the 
environment are also very much linked. When we look to the 
future of the world and the carrying capacity of the earth it is 
very easy to see that our task as leaders on this earth is to ensure 
that we plan far enough ahead to ensure that our grandchildren 
will be able to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8440"> 8440 </A></B>
<P>
survive on this planet without eating foods made from artificial 
substances.
<P>
	Currently when we look at GATT planning documents we see 
that these leaders are predicting declines in employment for 
many sectors of the existing economy. High on that list 
scheduled for future unemployment are our farmers, 
agricultural workers, textile workers and office clerks. From 
that list it would appear that the GATT planners seem to be 
expecting us to go hungry with no clothes on our backs, without 
any information from people who are supposed to collect it for 
us.
<P>
	With world populations increasing the way they are, surely 
this is absolute nonsense. Canada's leaders should be looking at 
building an efficient economy that produces wealth to ensure 
that Canadians have the jobs to be able to compete with those in 
the rest of the world.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I did not have a list of speakers so I have been rising 
pretty regularly. I finally made it and I appreciate your 
indulgence.
<P>
	It is always a pleasure to rise in this House and speak on the 
issues. Today it is the World Trade Organization bill. It is a 
pleasure as a farmer and now as a politician to address some of 
these problems.
<P>
<B>(1545) </B>
<P>
	I have heard so much today about trading with different 
partners. I would like to remind some of the hon. members in 
this House that when we talk about trade with the United States 
we have a trade surplus of roughly $35 billion right now as far as 
goods are concerned. We can imagine increasing our trade with 
the U.S. but I think we will also have to be realistic and realize 
that we import more from the U.S. at that time.
<P>
	The problem as I see it is that we lose this huge trade surplus 
with the U.S., with negative trade balances with a lot of other 
countries that could really afford to pay for more products that 
we have to sell. Japan has a $2 billion trade surplus with us. 
Germany has the same amount, more or less. The British Isles 
have over a $2 billion trade surplus. Even Mexico has a $2 
billion trade surplus with us.
<P>
	When we look at those points there has to be something wrong 
that we cannot penetrate these markets. I have a big feeling that 
some of it goes back to the inefficiencies of our manufacturing 
and exporting companies. We have heard over the last couple of 
weeks in testimony before the Standing Committee on 
Agriculture and Agri-Food that we could probably donate raw 
products that our farmers produce to the manufacturing 
companies and they still would not be able to compete. It does 
not really seem that the problem of competition is in the primary 
producers' field.
<P>
	Therefore I have to address one of the big problems that I see 
and that is in the transportation policy. If members watched the 
CBC last night they would have seen the CBC addressing the 
issue of backtracking grain from Thunder Bay to Winnipeg and 
into the U.S. We have heard so much that this Liberal 
government is trying to correct some of the problems that are 
there. I point out that the western grain transportation policy 
was passed by the previous Liberal government. It had a very 
nice provision in it where non-performance could be thrown 
against transportation companies like the railways and they 
could be charged if they failed to deliver the products that were 
guaranteeing under the Western Grain Transportation Act.
<P>
	Backtracking is simply a breaking of that agreement. It is 
disrupting the transportation system. It is making it inefficient. 
It is not allowing us to compete with other countries. It is also 
putting an extra tax burden on our taxpayers. The one 
backtracking issue is costing taxpayers today anywhere from 
$15 million to $40 million a year. We cannot afford that in this 
country with the debt load we have.
<P>
	We also have to realize that the railways probably are in a 
pinch in some areas. When we look at the over taxation on fuel 
compared with the United States and some other countries, if we 
look at the extra taxes that our corporations are paying 
compared with the Americans, they also are in a bind and are 
trying to somehow make ends meet.
<P>
	Some other problems are in the management of the crown 
corporations. When we see a management person getting 
$300,000 as just a little benefit of interest free money, this is 
added into the cost of shipping our products. Those are issues 
that we have to address.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	We say we need more value added. This has been the theme 
that I have heard on the farm for the last 10 years now. We need 
more value added but in the next breath we hear that we have lost 
100 food processing plants and abattoirs.
<P>
	Why has this happened? It has happened very simply because 
we were not competitive in the world's finished products. We 
are very competitive in raw products. However when it comes to 
the processing end and we see markups of 200 per cent from the 
time it leaves the farm gate until the time it hits the retailer, this 
is not efficiency.
<P>
	These are things that have to be addressed before we will 
become competitive in the World Trade Organization. It makes 
one wonder sometimes why we would stress the point to become 
more efficient always at the primary producer to produce more. 
If we look back at statistics we see that we have increased 
production in grains and oilseeds. We have increased production 
in all other products far ahead of the efficiencies that have been 
built into our manufacturing plants.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8441"> 8441 </A></B>
<P>
	We have to start realizing that something has to happen 
because if we are going to compete, we have to be competitive. 
It is imperative that the western grain transportation subsidies 
be revamped. Somehow under GATT it is going to be forced 
on us and the sooner we do it the better off we will be.
<P>
	During the election the Reform Party promoted very strongly 
its plan of a trade distortion program that would take over the 
transportation subsidies. It seems to me that maybe that is the 
direction we will have to go to make our transportation system 
more efficient.
<P>
	If I look at what is happening under the World Trade 
Organization rules and subsidies today, it means that we will be 
shipping a fraction of our grain under these subsidies and still be 
qualified as green. All of a sudden one day in the middle of a 
month we will find out that we have shipped an amount that we 
were qualified to ship under these subsidies and we will have a 
totally different freight rate.
<P>
	This is going to cause a lot of stress in marketing especially 
when farmers are realizing that products like canola have a very 
small quantity allocated to them under this grain subsidies 
program because the quantities have been set according to the 
production that we had in the 1985 to 1990 period.
<P>
	This means that canola production increased drastically from 
1990 to 1993. Our limits on subsidized transportation on canola 
will be very small so that the producers who may be selling into 
that market in the first month will qualify for the subsidized 
freight and then the rest of the canola production will have to go 
under full freight rate costs.
<P>
	This will also pertain to wheat and I can see this being very 
disruptive and argued among farmers trying to push their 
product on to the market, trying to get a little advantage, get a 
little better price, and it is going to create a lot of hardship and a 
lot of heard feelings in the farming community.
<P>
	That is why I would suggest very strongly to this government 
that it quickly restructure the western grain transportation 
subsidies into another program so that we do not have these 
disputes arising even among farmers. We do not need any more 
disputes. We need more co-operation.
<P>
	If we do not get more co-operation between farmers, 
manufacturers and transportation we will not compete in this 
World Trade Organization globe. It is very important that we do 
enter this World Trade Organization and play fair ball with it.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, it was mentioned before that you had some 
experience in refereeing. I think you will also agree that the 
linesmen were very important in that game, that they did have to 
help in keeping the game under control.
<P>
<B>(1555 ) </B>
<P>
	I think this is where the hon. member from the NDP failed to 
realize that we will have referees and linesmen who are not from 
the multinational food processing corporations. These are going 
to be set and enforced by countries. It is only with the will and 
determination of countries like Canada supporting this trade 
organization, making sure that the laws are kept and abided by 
that we will have a very successful entry into this trade 
organization.
<P>
	I would appreciate it if the hon. members on the other side of 
the House would take it to heart and make us competitive by 
becoming competitive inside the country, doing away with trade 
barriers, doing away with overtaxation and doing away with 
some of the disruptions in the grain handling system by strikes. 
We need co-operation. We need this country to get more exports 
to improve our balance of trade and to make this country 
productive and rich again.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this is an historic occasion.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> On a point of order, the 
hon. member for Vegreville.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> Mr. Speaker, actually I was standing for debate. 
We had shared time, the member for Lisgar-Marquette and I.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Certainly in reviewing 
and consulting with the table it would confirm that the member 
for Lisgar-Marquette only used 10 minutes. Regrettably, the 
Chair was not apprised that the member would be sharing his 
time, but having only used up 10 minutes I will recognize the 
member for Vegreville for a 10-minute intervention followed by 
five minutes question and comment. My apologies to the 
member for Vancouver Quadra.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased today to take part in this debate on the implementation 
of the GATT agreement and the World Trade Organization.
<P>
	This is the first time since GATT negotiations have taken 
place that agriculture is a substantial part in the agreement 
which is very encouraging. As we can see from the general 
support for this legislation which will implement GATT and put 
in place the World Trade Organization, there is widespread 
support in this House as well. I think it is very encouraging to 
see that.
<P>
	There are however some problems with this bill. I would like 
to speak about some of the concerns I have with the bill, 
although again I want to reiterate that Reform does support this 
bill strongly and I support this bill. However, there are still some 
concern mainly with regard to implementing GATT and the 
workings of the World Trade Organization.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8442"> 8442 </A></B>
<P>
	I know farmers are ready for this trade organization. I have 
seen this over the past years as the GATT negotiations have 
proceeded. I certainly hear it now from individual farmers and 
farm groups that they do support this deal. Clearly farmers are 
ready for this deal to be in place and to have the World Trade 
Organization in place as a referee, to use the analogy of my 
colleague. Is government ready?
<P>
	I am going to ask a lot of questions today about whether this 
government is ready for the implementation of this GATT deal 
and for the World Trade Organization to be put in place.
<P>
	My questions fall into two areas. The first question is in the 
area of interprovincial trade barriers and the lack of this 
government's dealing with that area, especially in agriculture.
<P>
<B>(1600 ) </B>
<P>
	Agriculture is a major part of the GATT negotiations. Yet in 
the negotiations on reducing interprovincial trade barriers held 
by the government with the provinces over the past summer, 
there was virtually no substantial agreement or deal made 
between the provinces and the federal government in the area of 
agriculture. This important part of trade in the world situation 
and in the GATT has not been dealt with in this country. That is 
the first area.
<P>
	The second area is with regard to government agencies. I have 
questions about whether the government is ready for the deal 
when we look at how it is taking part and refusing to change 
certain government agencies.
<P>
	I would like to briefly talk about interprovincial trade 
barriers. Agriculture is an important part of the overall GATT 
deal, but it has not been dealt with as a serious issue in terms of 
freeing up the barriers between provinces in the area of the trade 
in agricultural commodities. It is important that there be some 
action on the part of the agriculture minister and other cabinet 
ministers in the area of lowering and removing interprovincial 
trade barriers.
<P>
	The third area is government agencies and how the 
government has dealt with them. The agencies I am talking 
about particularly are the Canadian Wheat Board, the supply 
management system and the Western Grain Transportation Act. 
I will keep my comments on the Western Grain Transportation 
Act very brief because the member for Lisgar-Marquette has 
already dealt with the issue to some extent. I will talk about the 
Canadian Wheat Board and some of the questions I have with 
regard to changes that will be required to the Canadian Wheat 
Board to make the GATT deal work.
<P>
	In the agreement there are two changes to the Canadian Wheat 
Board Act. They are laid out in clauses 48 and 49 of the bill. 
Clause 48 deals with changes to section 45 of the Canadian 
Wheat Board Act. Under these changes the Canadian Wheat 
Board will control only exports and no longer control imports of 
wheat and barley.
<P>
	I want members to think about that a bit. Right now the 
Canadian Wheat Board controls imports and exports of wheat 
and barley. Under the change the Canadian Wheat Board will 
only control exports of wheat and barley. I ask if it makes much 
sense for our government to control exports when we have just 
negotiated a trade agreement which is meant to allow for freer 
trade of goods in and out of the country. It makes no sense.
<P>
	Clause 49 changes section 46 of the Canadian Wheat Board 
Act. It says that the Canadian Wheat Board no longer controls 
licences for imports into Canada. It gives up the restriction on 
imports of grain and gives up the control of licensing imports. 
At the same time it maintains under the Canadian Wheat Board 
Act restrictions on exports. It seems absolutely ridiculous that 
imports are no longer restricted under the act and exports 
continue to be restricted under the Canadian Wheat Board Act.
<P>
	What does that mean in terms of what will happen in the grain 
industry? I think it means a lot of things. It means that American 
farmers will now be able to sell directly to Canadian millers 
while Canadian farmers may not. Does that sound incredibly 
ridiculous? It is. We need further changes to the Canadian Wheat 
Board Act to allow Canadian farmers to sell directly to Canadian 
millers. American farmers will have this right after the bill is 
passed, as it surely will be.
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
	I would like to tell a story about a Canadian entrepreneur that I 
heard at the wheat board rally in Regina three or four weeks ago. 
To diversify his operations a farmer built a flour mill on his 
farm. He employed people from off farm to run the mill. It was 
the type of operation we all want to see.
<P>
	What was his concern and why was he one of the speakers at 
the wheat board rally in Regina? The reasons are really quite 
simple. For him to use his own wheat in his flour mill, it was 
necessary for the farmer to sell his grain through the Canadian 
Wheat Board to be strictly operating under the law. He needed 
his own flour because he was making specialty flour products 
and selling them across western Canada. Yet to do that, to use 
the wheat that he was growing to produce flour, he had to go 
through the Canadian Wheat Board. That sounds almost 
unbelievable when we are talking about opening up the trade 
environment.
<P>
	The farmer also wanted to expand into the American market 
with his specialty flour. What was restricting him from doing 
that? The Canadian Wheat Board was restricting him from doing 
that. He would have to get a permit under the Canadian Wheat 
Board Act to sell his flour into the American market, a 
restriction that he did not want to live with.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8443"> 8443 </A></B>
<P>
	If we look at the particular situation of the farmer and carry 
it a little further and if the bill passes as it almost certainly will, 
the farmer may go to an American farmer across the border, 
buy his flour without going through the Canadian Wheat Board, 
buy wheat for his mill without going through the Canadian 
Wheat Board. He will not be able to do that under the changes. 
The sellers will not need a licence to import the wheat to be 
used in his mill. Yet he cannot use his own flour in his own 
mill. He cannot use his neighbour's flour in his own mill 
because of the restrictions of the Canadian Wheat Board. It 
sounds absurd and it is absurd.
<P>
	I would like to ask the minister a series of questions. First, 
does it seem reasonable to allow Canadian farmers the same 
freedom American farmers enjoy? Does that seem reasonable? 
Should not Canadian farmers at least have the same freedom in 
marketing their wheat and their barley as American farmers 
have, especially when we are talking about marketing into the 
Canadian market? They do not now have the same freedom.
<P>
	The second question is in regard to giving farmers control of 
the Canadian Wheat Board which, after all, is their organization. 
Farmers pay the bills to operate the Canadian Wheat Board. The 
Canadian Wheat Board supposedly exists for the benefit of 
farmers. That being the case, how could the minister or any 
other minister possibly refuse to give farmers control over this 
organization?
<P>
	I have asked the minister this question several times over the 
past few months and the answer has been that they have to study 
the matter or the answer went in some other direction entirely.
<P>
	When I am talking about giving farmers control over their 
own organization, I am only talking about farmers electing a 
board of directors to replace the present appointed board. That 
would make the Canadian Wheat Board accountable to farmers 
who really pay for the operation of the organization. Why on 
earth would the minister or anyone else have to do a study to 
decide to give farmers control over their organization by 
electing a board of directors? I cannot think of an answer.
<P>
	I would just like to ask a couple more questions in the time I 
have left. Has anyone asked farmers whether they want the 
wheat board maintained as a monopoly operation? I know other 
Reform members and I have. The minister certainly has not and 
it is time that he did. The minister has an obligation to ask 
farmers whether they want this monopoly maintained. Has 
anyone asked farmers whether they want appointed 
commissioners replaced with an elected board of directors?
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order, please. I know 10 
minutes can sometimes go by rather rapidly, with the greatest 
respect.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a 
short question for the hon. member from western Canada. I 
would like to know what he has to say about the fact that we are 
still paying the cost of shipping western grain, in other words, 
Canadians have to subsidize the transportation of western grain. 
I always thought we should subsidize the transportation of grain 
in proportion to the distance involved. The fact is that although 
we subsidize the transportation of western grain, there are no 
subsidies for the transportation of grain from the East. I always 
thought that was unfair. I would appreciate some explanations 
from the hon. member from western Canada.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> Mr. Speaker, the question was with regard to 
subsidies and whether subsidies should be distance related. A 
further comment by the member that there were no subsidies to 
grain from central Canada was untrue. The seaway is a very 
expensive system to keep open and operating. A lot of 
government money has gone into and continues to go into it. 
Certainly there are subsidies to central Canadian farmers in 
terms of shipments as well as to western farmers.
<P>
	The second point was why the Crow benefit, as it used to be 
called, came into being in the first place. It came into being early 
in this century to get raw product to central Canada for 
processing. That was the reason that the Crow benefit was paid 
in the first place. It was not because western farmers needed a 
subsidy. It was because central Canadian processors wanted 
western farmers to be hewers of wood and drawers of water. This 
is no longer acceptable. The Crow benefit payment has 
prevented western farmers from developing a processing 
industry in western Canada.
<P>
	We can no longer talk about whether or not the subsidy should 
be distance related. The question is whether we should have a 
subsidy. The answer is no. There should be no subsidy connected 
directly with distance or to be paid out in any other way.
<P>
	The money now paid out under the Western Grain 
Transportation Act, the Reform Party has said, should be put 
into a trade distortion adjustment measure which would 
compensate farmers directly for damage done due to unfair trade 
practices in other countries. The compensation could be for 
damage in any commodity; it would be commodity neutral.
<P>
	The way things work, probably the compensation would be 
for grain at first. Certainly over time the compensation would be 
for other commodities as well.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean Landry (Lotbinière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a 
question for the hon. member about grain transportation. Today, 
to be eligible for the subsidy, western grain is first shipped to 
Thunder Bay, and we are talking about grain that is going to be 
shipped to  Europe. Then, they ship it back to Vancouver, and 
from Vancouver the grain is sent by ship through the Panama 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8444"> 8444 </A></B>
<P>
Canal to Europe. I would like to know whether the hon. member 
has some alternatives, when we are talking about saving money. 
I wish he could suggest some ways to save money in this 
particular instance.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> Mr. Speaker, I believe the question refers to the 
backtracking that has been occurring for several years and was 
pointed out to the minister very clearly a year ago. Backtracking 
involves grain being shipped under the subsidized rate to 
Thunder Bay and then going back at the full market rate. It 
makes no sense.
<P>
	As my colleague mentioned before, it costs Canadian 
taxpayers between $15 million and $40 million a year. It is 
absurd. It should not be happening. Why could the minister of 
agriculture not say it will not happen any more within a month of 
when he found out it was happening? Why? There is no good 
answer for it. It should have happened.
<P>
	The minister himself is backtracking. Originally he said that 
the backtracking would cease to exist on January 1. Now he has 
put it off until the end of July, to the new crop year.
<P>
<B>(1615 ) </B>
<P>
	Certainly there are some problems with contracts that were 
made before this problem was widely recognized but those 
should be dealt with directly and backtracking should have 
ceased long ago.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is an historic occasion to enter this debate because it 
does mark the end of half a century of specialized experience in 
world trade, what we would think to be flawed experience, and 
the moving into the 21st century.
<P>
	I am reminded of the vision of the great wartime leader 
President Franklin Roosevelt whose plans for the post war 
period included not merely a United Nations organization but a 
parallel international trade organization that would promote 
principles of liberalism, free trade and that would remove trade 
tariff barriers around the world.
<P>
	President Roosevelt did not live to see his vision implemented 
or to see it fail. The reasons for the failure are a matter for 
historians. Some wrongly blame it on the cold war but we would 
have to say it was the persistence of protectionist feelings in the 
United States associated with that tragically ill-advised attempt 
retroactively to cure the world depression, the Smoot-Hawley 
high tariff wall approach.
<P>
	Mr. Roosevelt and his heirs, Mr. Truman and others, had to 
fight against that. They also had to fight against the 
neo-isolationist American thinking that one found bound up 
with the Bricker amendment controversy seeking to limit an 
affirmative American role in western Europe's political and 
economic recovery.
<P>
	The failure of the International Trade Organization, the 
failure of the high hopes of Bretton Woods toward the end of the 
war led to the creation of this strange institution. Some have 
said, borrowing from <I>Guys and Dolls</I>: ``The oldest permanent 
floating crap game in the world,'' but in fact it is a periodic, 
recurring international diplomatic conference, GATT.
<P>
	GATT had many things to offer in terms of history, but if one 
looks back on it it was a concentration of particular problem 
solving operations, each bringing in its own set of specialists, 
each producing an arcane set of diplomatic negotiations that 
were never open to larger public debate.
<P>
	GATT had a function to fulfil but the quest for overarching 
principles or an overarching vision of a world economy was 
simply not there. This is the significance of the revival half a 
century later of the concept of a World Trade Organization. It 
will finally balance in the economic sense what the United 
Nations is intended to do in a governmental sense.
<P>
	With the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, it 
completes a triad of international economic organizations. That 
is all to the good and we might say that it is about time. It is a 
federalizing process. It is a constitutional process. It will mean 
that the large issues of world trade are no longer debated in 
secret in those holiday resorts visited off season because that is 
really where the GATT conferences were held.
<P>
	They got cut rate rates. One visits Uruguay in winter instead 
of the beach in summer. GATT had its function but it did not 
really answer up to the problems of the emerging 21st century. 
This WTO initiative comes with a period when the walls are 
falling down all around the world, all the walls. The Berlin wall 
falls politically. You cannot shut out the economic ideas when 
you open the way to political ideas.
<P>
	It has been said, and it is true, that you can achieve a market 
economy without having a liberal democratic society but you 
cannot maintain the one without the other. The English 
historical experience was that certainly free trade principles 
emerged before the political liberalization but the political 
liberalization marches hand in hand with that.
<P>
	In very many respects this is an historic occasion for us. The 
debate has been constructive and helpful. I noted in particular 
the interventions of my colleagues, my friends of the Bloc with 
their concerns about federalism. I can assure them that on this 
side of the House we share the desire for a more flexible, 
co-operative federalism in which there is, not merely as a matter 
of political common sense but also of a genuine sense of 
goodwill, co-operation and liaison between the federal 
government and provincial authorities. So much of the 
achievement of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8445"> 8445 </A></B>
<P>
free trade depends on the working co-operation at all levels of 
government.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	Those interventions have been helpful and have been taken 
note of. You may be assured that in the implementation of the 
government's structural reform programs they will be operated 
on so that we move from a period in which Canadian economic 
policy has been governed by bilateralism plus multilateralism 
through this periodic international diplomatic conference that is 
called GATT into what has been called a mondialist, one world 
type of conception, a parliamentary constitutional organization 
where the debates are open, where the delegates can make thrust 
and counter thrust but where everything is into the open. That I 
think accords with the spirit of our times.
<P>
	It is not a closed organization, although it is important to 
stress-and I think we have borne this in mind-that you cannot 
in our debate on an act to implement the World Trade 
Organization and in the guise of making amendments to national 
legislation insert unilateral reservations to an international 
treaty. If we are to be in at the beginning as a charter member of 
the World Trade Organization, we must do so without 
reservations and with the full confidence of our ability to make 
the system work.
<P>
	We have disengaged more easily and more elegantly than 
some other countries, certainly more easily than our neighbour, 
the United States, from the old order. The swords are being 
turned into ploughshares. Economic forces guide the next 
century. The old order on which the cold war was based is over. 
As a charter member of the World Trade Organization we are in a 
position to make very concrete suggestions on the accession of 
new members. We can help the entry of China into this 
organization. We can look at the special case of Taiwan because 
I do not think Taiwan can be ignored. We can look at a place for 
Russia with its new liberalizing phase still to be completed.
<P>
	There is an enormous challenge in this transition from a cold 
war, politically and militarily based world order to one based on 
free trade and the free commerce in intellectual ideas that goes 
with this.
<P>
	This is something of a challenge to Canada because we have 
led in foreign policy in so many areas. We invented 
peacekeeping. In very many senses if you look at the substantive 
principles of the United Nations they are our ideas for a 
democratizing of a world organization that perhaps too easily 
fell into the concept of a permanent members' club. We are in 
the fight there.
<P>
	This is the challenge of the new bill and in some sense the 
happiness that we find such a consensus around the House from 
virtually all the members of the House in support of this 
principle and this idea.
<P>
	In moving the new system into the 21st century there is no 
derogation from our special relations with the United States and 
Mexico under NAFTA. These agreements subsist but they are 
seen in the larger context of one world with its own principles in 
which a pluralism of decision making occurs. This has been the 
Canadian way from the beginning. I return to my original point. 
It is a moment in history. Half a century, in a certain sense, of the 
carryover of the old, pre-World War II economic order comes to 
an end with new hopes and new visions. It is a privilege to have 
been part of it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Vic Althouse (Mackenzie, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was 
pleased to hear the hon. member for Vancouver Quadra put an 
historical sense to what is being proposed at third reading of the 
World Trade Organization, something that was attempted after 
the second world war and was always, by my reading of history, 
blocked by the United States.
<P>
<B>(1625 ) </B>
<P>
	It was interesting to note the hon. member mentioned that in 
his opinion and apparently in the opinion of the government as 
well because they did stop all attempts to insert unilateral 
reservations into international agreements.
<P>
	I think he was referring to the amendments that NDP members 
had put before the House at report stage. Essentially we were 
attempting and continue to make the argument for a level 
playing field between ourselves and the Americans. Their law 
which we copied and we are hoping to insert into our law 
effectively says that where a dispute or problem arises on trade 
matters, U.S. law shall prevail. That is something the United 
States has adhered to ever since it became a country. Its 
constitution gives its Congress that right. I understand that.
<P>
	However, I have greater difficulty understanding the action it 
has taken with its proposed law which effectively says the U.S. 
considers that consensus is still the rule in mediating disputes. 
That is not what all people conclude the international agreement 
says. It says where there is a dispute, the disagreement shall be 
resolved by a vote with the majority carrying. The U.S. 
persistence in saying that consensus is required means that in 
any dispute we might have with one of the largest economies and 
certainly a country with one of the largest armies in the world 
will only be resolved by consensus. This means if the U.S. does 
not agree to it, we do not get an agreement.
<P>
	Since this is an historic occasion and we have gone to a true 
World Trade Organization where a majority rules and where the 
same rules will apply to all parties, does the member not have a 
bit of a suspicion in the back of his mind that as far as our 
relations with the United States are concerned, it is still going to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8446"> 8446 </A></B>
<P>
be its rules and the World Trade Organization will take a couple 
of more decades before it arrives between Canada and our major 
trading partner.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McWhinney:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
his very thoughtful question. We believe in the rule of law. The 
World Trade Organization has its constitution, its charter and its 
rules, including the rules as to how decisions are made. We will 
try to apply that to other countries, including if necessary our 
neighbours the United States.
<P>
	The charter will evolve of course. I would hope that we will be 
submitting amendments in the future that will strengthen the 
dispute settlement procedures and submit, in the ultimate, 
issues to the compulsory jurisdiction of the World Court. We are 
not afraid of that. For a number of reasons the United States is. 
But we can perhaps bring them along to our point of view.

IMPLEMENTATION ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill 
C-57, an act to implement the agreement establishing the World 
Trade Organization, be read the third time and passed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Gallaway (Sarnia-Lambton, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is my pleasure to rise today and speak in support of 
Bill C-57. I am not going to discuss agricultural issues today. I 
want to discuss the implications of this bill with respect to a 
major segment of Canadian industry, the petrochemical 
industry.
<P>
	I am speaking in one sense out of self-interest because the 
petrochemical industry happens to be the largest industry in my 
riding. It came about as a result of chance when oil was first 
discovered about 20 miles outside the city of Sarnia in the 
mid-1850s. Oil was brought into the city by truck and train and 
later by pipeline to the point that Sarnia became an oil town. Out 
of that evolved the petrochemical industry which now plays a 
major role in the economy.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	The demand for oil and oil related products particularly 
following the second world war led to an expansion of 
petrochemical companies throughout Canada but in particular in 
my riding.
<P>
	We saw during the post-war period, after the second world 
war through to the eighties, massive expansion, massive 
demand for petrochemical related products. We saw that the 
income of those who worked in this particular segment of the 
economy was probably the highest per capita income of 
Canadians.
<P>
	However, in the eighties, in the downturn, the petrochemical 
industry suffered a number of economic set backs. There has 
been a decrease in demand since 1988 due to the recession. 
There has been an increase in competition in particular in the 
Asian rim. Changes in government regulations have had a 
negative impact on an industry that remains very vital to our 
Canadian economy.
<P>
	I would point out that in the province of Ontario the provincial 
government has imposed a number of environmental regulations 
which are driving business out of this part of the economy. In my 
riding alone there have been more than 5,000 jobs lost since 
1988. Still, it is a vital part of the economy employing 
something like 17,000 people.
<P>
	There are 17 petrochemical facilities in my riding. There are 
the Imperial Oils, the Shell Oils, the Duponts, the list goes on 
and on. There are 10,000 people directly employed in it and 
another 7,000 people working in related fields. It is interesting 
to note that employees in the petrochemical industry earn two 
and one-half times the annual salary of the average Canadian 
worker.
<P>
	We realize that trade liberalization is a key to continued 
development in this industry. That is why passage of Bill C-57 
is essential for the economic well-being of a large number of my 
constituents. To understand why that is the case, we only need to 
consider the chemical industry or the petrochemical industry in 
Canada.
<P>
	Canada's chemical manufacturing sector has annual sales of 
over $10 billion and employs some 30,000 Canadians. It 
provides the basis for a broader chemical and chemical product 
sector which employs another 90,000 Canadians. This industry 
is Canada's third largest manufacturing sector and is also third 
in terms of value added. The chemical industry depends on 
international markets for its survival. Exports account for well 
over 50 per cent of annual production in Canada. In some 
facilities, especially in southern Ontario in my riding, it is well 
over 80 per cent that is exported.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8447"> 8447 </A></B>
<P>
	That is why the normalization of tariffs achieved by the WTO 
is so important. If we consider for one moment the size of world 
trade in this industry, we will know that in 1993 total exports 
of chemicals worldwide were some $313 billion U.S., or 9.2 
per cent of total world exports. For the same year total world 
production was over $1.25 trillion in U.S. funds.
<P>
	Bill C-57 represents a significant step forward for the 
chemical manufacturing industry in my riding, throughout 
Canada and particularly in Alberta. By joining the World Trade 
Organization Canada and its major trading partners, including 
the European Union, Japan and the U.S. as well as other 
industrialized nations have agreed to harmonize a broad range of 
chemical tariffs at low rates of duty. Any Canadian tariff that is 
currently below the harmonization levels will remain 
unchanged.
<P>
	Also included in the agreement are new global rules for the 
protection of intellectual property rights, including a set of 
standards in the area of copyrights and trademarks which 
commit each government to protect and enforce intellectual 
property rights. That is very important for Canadians where we 
have invented a number of procedures of a chemical nature that 
have been given protection as intellectual property.
<P>
	This agreement will also result in several benefits for Canada 
in general. Once again I speak in favour of my riding which will 
benefit from it.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	The reduction and harmonization of most favoured nation 
tariffs will improve market access for Canadian exports of 
chemicals and chemical products and plastics to niche markets. 
This improved access will be particularly beneficial for the 
export oriented petrochemical and synthetic resin industries 
located in Canada.
<P>
	For Canada the strength of the World Trade Organization and 
the GATT lies in their broad country participation. The 
disciplines that will apply to developing countries will improve 
our access to these markets. By providing more open 
international markets the World Trade Organization agreement 
will assist the Canadian industry to become better oriented to 
global markets.
<P>
	The traditional Canadian branch plant structure is giving way 
to one that is increasingly world competitive. International 
manufacturing mandates and research development mandates 
for Canada will be facilitated by this agreement. The World 
Trade Organization will also provide an improved dispute 
settlement regime for a more effective alternative to trade wars.
<P>
	I would like to talk briefly about the future. Market access for 
petrochemical products is essential to the continued growth of 
the industry. It is vital for economic renewal, notwithstanding in 
whose riding it may be. To be globally competitive means to 
have real access to global markets. In ratifying this agreement 
we as a  country are taking an important first step. We must 
continue our efforts if we are to ensure continued growth in this 
very vital sector of our economy.
<P>
	Canada's trade negotiations are, in my opinion, to be 
commended for their accomplishments during the Uruguay 
round. They were successful in getting the key target markets of 
Korea, Singapore and Hong Kong to agree to most of the tariff 
lines. These markets are of particular interest to the 
petrochemical sector in Canada.
<P>
	However, other countries-there is no question this is 
something that must be worked on-must be encouraged to join 
in in harmonizing their chemical tariffs in the future. In 
particular I am thinking of China, because China has a chemical 
industry that is two and a half times the size of Canada's in terms 
of production. The Chinese industry is growing at the rate of 15 
per cent a year and we must convince the Chinese to harmonize 
their chemical tariffs and discipline restrictive border measures 
for chemicals so that their borders are also open to our products.
<P>
	Briefly in conclusion, we have to realize that we are living in a 
world in which economies of scale are the determining factors. 
At the present time in Ontario and most Canadian manufacturers 
of petrochemicals are sized for the national and regional 
markets but they are not of international scope in size. To be 
truly competitive these facilities must be world scale in size. To 
be world scale in size they must be able to freely enter world 
markets without barriers in place. The larger our market the 
more efficient and competitive Canadian industry can be. That 
is obviously a truism.
<P>
	Our world scale plants in the manufacturing of 
petrochemicals such as ethylene located in Joffre, Alberta and in 
my riding of Sarnia, add substantially to our balance of trade 
with other countries, especially the United States.
<P>
	As Pacific rim countries attempt to break into the marketplace 
we are still in a position of strength. Recent studies clearly show 
that the workforce required to operate these petrochemical 
facilities is the second most educated and trained workforce 
today in Canada, second only to the software industry but in 
many respects virtually identical.
<P>
	To ensure that there is a place for our technical graduates we 
as a country must constantly strive to ensure open markets for 
our goods. Quite simply many of our Asian competitors do not 
have the skilled employees needed to operate such facilities 
effectively or efficiently.
<P>
	We must also remember that the production of petrochemicals 
ranks highest in Canadian manufacturing in adding value to raw 
materials. We have the raw feed stock in abundance, one need 
only visit the gasfields of Alberta to realize the volume of the 
gas stocks have. We have gas stocks in Ontario also. We must 
now ensure that we pass this bill in order to ensure that we have 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8448"> 8448 </A></B>
<P>
the markets to which we can ship Canadian products. We can  
use these raw stocks and we can add great value to them in the 
end.
<P>
<B>(1640 ) </B>
<P>
	Finally, without the passage of this bill we will slowly but 
surely strangle this important segment of our industry in our 
economy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member started by saying that today he was not going to speak 
about agriculture. He did not but I have a question with regard to 
agriculture.
<P>
	The member knows that in Ontario the Ontario Wheat Board 
has an elected board of directors. This elected board of directors 
controls the operations of the Ontario Wheat Board. In the west 
the Canadian Wheat Board is controlled by an appointed group 
of commissioners.
<P>
	I am looking for an open and honest opinion. Does it make 
sense that a marketing group, the Canadian Wheat Board, which 
is paid for by western Canadian farmers, be controlled by a 
group of appointed commissioners rather than by an elected 
board of directors as is in place in Ontario?
<P>
	If the member does agree this should happen, can he offer any 
suggestions for making it happen quickly? If the hon. member 
feels that it should not happen, that farmers should not take 
control of their organization which they pay for, why not?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gallaway:</B> Mr. Speaker, what so often happens with 
members opposite is they give true meaning to the Latin term 
non sequitur. In any event, I would have to confirm first what he 
has had to say before I could really offer any comment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to thank the member for his every interesting speech on the 
petrochemical industry, something that I really do not know 
very much about. I do not have that industry in my riding.
<P>
	He mentioned the education of people working in that 
industry. Does he feel that our institutions are keeping up with 
that? Are they able to graduate the talent we need to be effective 
in the international marketplace?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gallaway:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not think there is any doubt 
that we are able to graduate the kind of talent necessary to 
operate. As I have mentioned, we have led the way in many 
respects in terms of gas technology and other facets of the 
refining industry which is part and parcel related to the 
petrochemical industry. We have led the way in that in terms of 
technology and in terms of costs of unit production.
<P>
	We are having problems with an aging workforce. The 
technology has changed so rapidly that it is sometimes difficult 
for that workforce to appreciate or to have a full understanding 
of what the science applied is at that particular given point.
<P>
	That is an industry-wide problem. It does not apply just to 
Canada. It is happening in the United States, especially in the 
gulf coast region where the industry must constantly upgrade its 
workforce, not because it is a poorly trained workforce but 
because the science and technology is changing to the point that 
these people cannot appreciate the complexities of the 
theoretical level of what is happening.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> It is my duty pursuant to 
Standing Order 38 to inform the House that the questions to be 
raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows: the hon. 
member for Regina-Lumsden-Taxation; the hon. member for 
The Battlefords-Meadow Lake-Government Appointments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is a privilege to speak to Bill C-57, a bill to enact 
the World Trade Organization agreement.
<P>
	Canada has been, is and I presume will be a trading nation. 
The part of the country that I come from, the west, was opened to 
European civilization through the act of trading; the traders 
from the Hudson's Bay Company and the Northwest Company. 
Their main purpose for exploring the west was on a trade 
mission. It has been a healthy environment for Canada whenever 
we have been able to trade freely and unhindered.
<P>
	I wish to speak today with regard to the issue of farm safety 
nets. They are also impacted by the legislation that we are 
dealing with today.
<P>
<B>(1645 ) </B>
<P>
	We have to understand that agricultural safety nets are really 
risk management policies. They are mechanisms to help the 
farmer manage risks associated with producing a valuable 
commodity, food. We all need it.
<P>
	The production and selling of goods such as food has a 
characteristic in addition to its value as a physical sustenance 
that makes it unique. That characteristic is perishability. There 
are unique risks associated with the provision to the world of a 
perishable commodity, that food that sustains us all.
<P>
	It is these characteristics of food and the accompanying risks 
that lead us to develop risk management programs or our farm 
safety nets. The basic responsibility for managing the risk falls 
to the farmer just as it does for any other businessman. Farmers 
accept the fact that there are unique risks in producing food. 
They try to make wise decisions and carefully manage the 
product through its life cycle.
<P>
	The other basic risk in farming in addition to this aspect of 
perishability is the highly fluctuating or uncertain income 
caused by forces over which farmers such as myself have no 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8449"> 8449 </A></B>
<P>
control. Those forces are natural hazards, market cycles and 
trade distorting influences.
<P>
	Therefore the risk management tools that farmers basically 
need are threefold: a crop or livestock insurance program to deal 
with the natural hazards, an income stabilization program to 
deal with market cycles and a trade distortion adjustment 
program to deal with trade distorting influences.
<P>
	My party, and I was pleased to be involved with that, was able 
to consult widely across Canada prior to the 1993 election with 
farmers to develop their thoughts on these matters. We are 
happy to see that the Liberals who did not campaign on a 
post-GATT platform begin now to recognize that the old farm 
safety nets are going to have to change.
<P>
	It seems rather odd that the Liberal Party, one of the oldest 
parties in Canada, did not start consulting with farmers earlier. 
In fact we are finding in this House that the Liberals are doing all 
their consulting after the election. I am proud to belong to a 
party that did its consulting before the election. I consider that to 
be one of the reasons why so many of us were elected. It also 
gives us great authority to speak on most of the issues that we 
address in the House, including this bill.
<P>
	What are some of the concepts that have led to the rules and 
conditions and definitions of what now have to be 
internationally accepted farm safety net programs? There has 
been much talk about improving agriculture policy related to 
farm safety net support in recent years.
<P>
	While the GATT talks have brought reform, there is still much 
to be achieved in practice. The organization known as the 
OECD, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and 
Development, consists of Australia, Austria, Canada, the 
European community, Finland, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, 
Sweden, Switzerland and the United States.
<P>
	In the OECD overall support from government budgets and 
consumers to agriculture production still accounts for well over 
40 per cent of the value of that agricultural production. In spite 
of some progress in tackling domestic farm programs, trade 
barriers remain stubbornly resistant to liberalization. Many of 
the alternative measures being put in place, including direct 
income support to farmers to replace subsidies, are still linked 
in some way to the production of agricultural commodities.
<P>
	With respect to rules based trade, the feeling is commonly 
held by a lot of farmers that lawyers and bureaucrats are going to 
spend huge amounts of time and money trying to figure out how 
to beat the GATT rules. We already know, for example, that the 
EEC has kept its sum total payment policy in exchange for the 
U.S. keeping its nationalistic farm policy.
<P>
	In other words, we are going to see a lot of wheeling and 
dealing and shifting and fudging of numbers in trade and support 
account columns. I suppose that such is the give and take of 
international negotiations but unfortunately farmers are the 
ones who are usually caught in the economic cross-fire.
<P>
	Currently in the OECD, there are different types of safety nets 
and support programs for agriculture. First, of the total support 
that comes from consumers and government budgets to the 
OECD agriculture, around 71 per cent is transferred by policy 
measures that raise market prices received by farmers for their 
produce and are paid by consumers for their food beyond those 
existing in the world market. These are commonly known as 
commodity price support systems.
<P>
	In Canada's case, the supply management system falls within 
this category. There are a lot of positive things that could be said 
about supply management but there are certainly a lot of 
negative things that have to be said about it as well.
<P>
	One of the great negatives of the supply management system 
is the interprovincial trade barriers that we have within our own 
country. It is rather ironic that today we are discussing 
legislation that breaks down international trade when we are 
such a poor example to our international trading partners with 
our domestic policy.
<P>
<B>(1650 ) </B>
<P>
	Whatever form our support takes, the real problem for 
farmers, as my hon. colleague opposite from Malpeque has 
often stated, is low, real net market income for food. Farmers 
simply deserve a fair return on their investment. They want to 
get paid what their product is worth just like anyone else. They 
do not particularly want to have a lot of subsidies and 
government support.
<P>
	I would suggest to hon. members opposite that the way to get 
more market income is to relax these types of price support 
policies that restrict the market forces. We need to trust a free 
and fair marketplace to bring the returns that we all want. I am 
happy to see that our rules based trading arrangements are 
addressing these type of subsidies and moving toward their 
elimination.
<P>
	Second, only 13 per cent of farm support given is in the form 
of direct payments to farmers from government budgets. Much 
of this is transferred to the farming sector by policies that raise 
prices received by farmers through subsidies based on output or 
production. Although such subsidies do not directly affect the 
market prices paid by consumers, most of these measures are 
production related. They take the form of deficiency payments 
which are payments that make up the difference between a 
guaranteed price per unit of commodity and the actual market 
price. Headage payments are payments paid on the amount per 
head of cattle or sheep, et cetera.
<P>
	The third type of support represents 16 per cent of the total 
and is largely made up of government's budgetary finance 
measures that are not targeted to specific farmers or 
commodities but to the agricultural sector as a whole. These 
include 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8450"> 8450 </A></B>
<P>
publicly financed infrastructure, research, inspection, 
information or education and training.
<P>
	We must note that the amount of support provided by these 
three different types of policy measures is very uneven across 
the OECD countries. Some countries give more weight and 
emphasis to the support of market prices, others to direct 
payments and yet others to non-targeted general support. 
Therein lies the problem of negotiation for rules based and equal 
treatment trade.
<P>
	Therein also lies the potential for a harmonized movement 
away from market distorting programs to a free and fair 
international marketplace where farmers can make a living 
providing one of the most important products to humanity, the 
food we eat.
<P>
	The pricing support programs and other subsidies I have 
referred to apparently cost consumers and taxpayers in OECD 
countries over $350 billion a year in higher food bills and in 
taxes. These policies distort trade patterns and heighten tensions 
between countries.
<P>
	At the OECD ministerial meeting in 1987 their governments 
therefore committed themselves to reducing total support and to 
moving away from production and output related subsidies to 
other policy measures. One of the programs considered by 
GATT to be green is direct income payment to farmers which 
comes under the second type of safety net or support that I have 
referred to, direct payments.
<P>
	I want to talk about the matter of direct income payments for 
farmers. We refer to it as an income stabilization program or ISP 
and that addresses the risk of market cycles. Direct income 
payments are literally that, explicitly budget financed income 
transfers made directly to individual farmers. Thus, they are 
distinct from the other policy mechanisms that transfer income 
to farmers indirectly either through commodity price supports 
which raise consumer prices or through lower input costs or 
through money spent on the farm sector as a whole.
<P>
	The main advantage of direct income payments is that they 
can be targeted to the specific farmers whose situations are 
deemed to warrant such payments. This is in sharp contrast with 
price supports that are targeted at commodities which thereby 
give most benefit to the largest producers who may not warrant 
such support.
<P>
	A commodity price support system such as our supply 
management also creates a prohibitive expense in its tool of 
production, the quota. It restricts farmer entrepreneurship 
because new entrants can only get in with large capital outlay 
through means such as large debt or a fortunate inheritance.
<P>
	As a regulated marketing mechanism it does not transmit the 
signals of the market back to the producers quickly enough and 
reduces the innovative abilities of the industry. Therefore, the 
supply managed system must speed up its adjustment to 
liberalized trade as it will be in its own best interest. I know 
some of the members opposite are beginning to agree with this 
certainty even if they do it with reluctance.
<P>
	Moreover, support to the income of farmers is more efficient 
than support to the prices of products. Price supports easily leak 
into the sectors upstream or downstream from the intended 
recipients or are wasted in competitive price subsidization 
between countries illustrating a phenomenon known as transfer 
inefficiency.
<P>
	Well targeted direct income payments have a high degree of 
transfer efficiency because nearly all of the transfer ends up 
where it is intended, supporting farmers' incomes.
<P>
<B>(1655 ) </B>
<P>
	Moreover, in case members opposite are still not convinced of 
a better way, let me offer another advantage of farmer income 
support as opposed to commodity price support. Since income 
supports are financed from national budgets, they are more 
transparent and can thus be scrutinized more easily than price 
supports which are hidden in high consumer prices.
<P>
	In all fairness and objectivity, we must admit that all 
measures of support including direct income payments will 
produce distortions to some degree. I am saying that those 
supports linked to pricing or production of specific commodities 
are the most distorting. Price supports are guilty, as I have 
mentioned above.
<P>
	Production support systems are faulty because they give 
incentives to over or underproduce certain commodities, thus 
creating a moral hazard or a situation called farming the system, 
or they encourage unfriendly environmental practices. All in all 
it should be obvious that moving away from price and 
production support and toward income support is the wave of the 
future. All would be well-advised to get on board.
<P>
	Direct income payments must satisfy two conditions in order 
to allow farmers to become more market reliant. First, the 
amount of payment should be generally fixed to a particular 
period of time and thus remain immunized from moral hazard. 
We do not want an income support program that would give an 
incentive to alter behaviour for monetary gain at the expense of 
environmental stewardship or fair business practices.
<P>
	Second, the amount of payment should not be determined by 
the volume of current or future production of specific 
commodities or inputs to avoid biasing farmers' choices 
between specific commodities or those production techniques.
<P>
	We must also continue to carefully define the objective of 
each type of direct income payment, whether it is income 
payment to help farmers adjust to alternative activities, a 
scheme to establish a minimum income, a measure to encourage 
environmental activities or a program to stabilize income be-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8451"> 8451 </A></B>
<P>
cause of market cycles. All these appear to be eligible under 
GATT. The situations for which direct income payments could 
be made available have to be very carefully specified to ensure 
there is the least distortion to the use of resources and to avoid 
back door channels of support to agriculture  commodities, 
which would undermine the current reforms taking place.
<P>
	How do we decide the amount of direct income payment? 
Basically there are two ways. First, we can assess the costs 
incurred by the farmer in undertaking activities for which 
payments are targeted. The second way is to evaluate income 
foregone by not undertaking an activity or measured against a 
predetermined base line such as loss of income due to market 
cycles compared to a recent income trend.
<P>
	The duration of direct income payment programs depends on 
the duration of the problem being addressed. As far as possible, 
market-based solutions should be encouraged because they are 
longer term and are likely to emerge as reform evolves.
<P>
	As I opened my comments I talked about the west being 
explored and developed because of free traders, because of 
people who wanted to go out, take some risks and try to make a 
few dollars. I suspect that as Canada moves into the global 
economy we can again expect to have some adventures, perhaps 
in a different situation, perhaps in the high tech civilization and 
society that we now live. It will be exciting for agriculture as 
well. There are great opportunities and this Bill C-57 is in a 
small way opening the door of opportunity.
<P>
	While this bill will not solve all problems facing world trade, 
certainly not all of the problems facing agriculture, it is a step in 
the right direction. Therefore we offer our support for the GATT 
agreement, for the World Trade Organization Implementation 
Act and we hope this is one move toward reducing government 
funding for not only agriculture, but many commodities. It will 
give an opportunity for the market to sustain our industries, 
including the agricultural industry, so that not only farmers but 
all Canadians will enjoy lower taxes, a strong economy, and 
have a bright outlook on the future.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Vic Althouse (Mackenzie, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member gave us a nice theoretical review of what would be nice 
if everybody agreed with the same kind of rules. We are debating 
though this world trade office which is international. It is not 
something we can control within the confines of one country.
<P>
	As an aside I would point out that this country has had 
provinces ever since its inception and those provinces have 
certain powers which the hon. member has chosen in his 
theoretical discussion to ignore. They have control over 
production within the province which is why the marketing 
boards operate the way they do.
<P>
<B>(1700) </B>
<P>
	However my question concerns the international aspects of 
the bill. I would urge the member to turn his mind to our 
relations vis-à-vis other countries, particularly as they apply to 
assistance to agriculture since that was the main theme of his 
speech.
<P>
	Since the negotiations began in 1986 I note that all countries 
made a verbal undertaking to start reducing subsidies and 
assistance to agriculture. I note that in the OECD countries he 
mentioned the aid to the agricultural sector has actually 
increased by 7 per cent in the past year over previous years. The 
trend is definitely not reducing assistance to farmers in OECD 
countries, with the exception of Canada which shows a decline 
of 12 per cent in the last year over the previous year in assistance 
to agriculture.
<P>
	We hear a lot of talk about level playing fields. As a former 
hockey referee, Mr. Speaker, I know you understand the 
importance of having the two teams relatively well matched in 
terms of equipment and so on. It seems to me that what we have 
achieved to date with the verbal agreements is perhaps a field 
that will be more level than it was. However players on the 
Canadian team have hardly any equipment and players on the 
other teams we are competing against are very heavily padded 
and ready to go with the full support of their fans, their local 
national governments.
<P>
	I read the documentation our country put together. I got it 
under freedom of information because it was not made available 
otherwise. I find it is the intention of the country under the 
Liberal government, and apparently supported by the Reform 
Party and others, to reduce the assistance to agriculture at an 
even faster pace than we have done to this point in time, even 
though the other countries are still a long way from catching up 
and taking off their special protections.
<P>
	It is to the point that by the end of the decade when the 
six-year implementation stage comes and we start on the 
seventh, which is supposed to be the achievement of the new 
world order, Canada will be paying its agricultural sector $1.5 
billion less than the agreement requires. We will be nice and 
squeaky clean. We will be out there playing hockey in our 
civvies while everybody else will have the same level of support 
they have now, with perhaps a few minor reductions.
<P>
	I am wondering how he could describe that as fair or 
something he would advocate in terms of our relations with all 
other countries. How could this approach be something that he 
would support?
<P>
	Mr. Hermanson: Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the comments of 
the hon. member for Mackenzie. I know he has a sincere interest 
in agriculture and a strong commitment to the industry.
<P>
	He spoke just in passing about marketing boards and the fact 
that the provinces have been given some jurisdictional powers in 
that area. The actual act is a  federal act and there have been 
some real discrepancies as a result of it.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8452"> 8452 </A></B>
<P>
	For instance, I wonder if the hon. member for Mackenzie 
supports the fact that the province of Quebec has a leg up on the 
rest of Canada as far as the industrial milk quota is concerned. 
Provinces such as our province of Saskatchewan do not have fair 
access to the industrial milk market because of the inequities of 
the interprovincial trade barriers within Canada. It is certainly 
an area we need to rectify. It is an intolerable situation. It has 
certainly hurt the agricultural industry in our province.
<P>
<B>(1705) </B>
<P>
	With regard to his comments about the level playing field and 
being equipped to play in the game, I share some of the same 
concerns the hon. member has expressed but I mentioned in my 
speech that we were comparing apples and oranges.
<P>
	I want to make very clear probably one of the most dastardly 
attempts at taking away the equipment we as Canadian 
producers need to play the game. It was the action undertaken by 
the minister of agriculture when he agreed to cut the export sales 
of durum to the United States by half. Certainly I would agree 
with the hon. member that actions such as that one when we have 
the trade agreements on our side are unacceptable.
<P>
	Export sales of Canadian durum to the United States were 
steadily increasing. In fact they were on an ascending rate, an 
accelerated rate. Just because Uncle Sam south of the border put 
a little pressure on the Canadian minister of agriculture he 
forgot about the rules. He forgot about the equipment. He threw 
it away.
<P>
	If we are talking about being out on the ice and playing the 
game, I do not think our agriculture minister has gone out on the 
ice yet. If he has he certainly has not gone across his own blue 
line. Perhaps he needs a penalty for not getting in the game. I do 
not know, Mr. Speaker, if you have ever called one of those but I 
think the agriculture minister needs one.
<P>
	We have the NAFTA. We have the GATT. If we are to 
voluntarily give up just because somebody puts a little pressure 
on us when the rules are on our side and the judgments are on our 
side, it is wrong and a disgrace to Canadian farmers. I would call 
upon the minister of agriculture-and I am sure the hon. 
member for Mackenzie would as well-not to strip us of the 
equipment that helps us to play the game.
<P>
	I am convinced that Canadian farmers, given a level playing 
field, will compete with any team. Just as we were able to 
compete with the Russians back in 1976, I am sure as agriculture 
producers and free traders we will be able to take on any 
competitor in the world and play an excellent game. I suspect 
when the final whistle blows and when the light comes on at the 
end of the third period we will win if the government does not 
get in the road and if our minister of agriculture pulls up his 
socks, grabs a stick and gets in the game.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Just to make sure the 
House is clear, the member for Regina-Lumsden will speak for 
approximately 15 minutes and the member for 
Regina-Qu'Appelle for 5 minutes, which will make a full 
complement of 20 minutes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it is my duty and my pleasure to speak in opposition to Bill 
C-57, the bill to enact the World Trade Organization legislation.
<P>
	There are many reasons we oppose the bill as New Democrats. 
Before getting into the reasons I want to make a comment or 
observation. When we have a bill that is supported and put 
forward by the Liberal government of about 250 pages dealing 
with an agenda the large multinational corporations want to see 
completed, that is supported by Bloc members in the House and 
is supported by the Reform Party, it seems to me Canadians 
should pay particular attention to the implications of the bill. 
When a bill is supported by the Liberals, the Bloc Quebecois and 
the Reform Party there has to be something peculiar, 
mysterious, suspicious and probably disadvantageous to 
Canadians.
<P>
	I challenge any member in the House to stand to say they have 
read the bill because I do not think they have. I do not think they 
understand the implications of the bill. However I have had 
occasion to read most of it. I have not read it all, but what I have 
read is unbelievable with respect to what the bill does to 
Canadian producers, agriculture producers, steel producers, 
sugar producers and other manufacturers.
<P>
	The reason I say that is that the bill does not stand up for 
Canadians. Members of the New Democratic Party, the member 
for Winnipeg Transcona, the member for The 
Battlefords-Meadow Lake, the member for Mackenzie and 
others, have stood in the House of Commons to say that they 
have major concerns about the bill. We have heard the concerns 
in agriculture. We have heard the concerns about child labour 
and important social equities with respect to Bill C-57.
<P>
	When I look at a bill I look at certain criteria the bill has to 
meet in order for me to support it. It has to be fair. It has to be 
equitable to those it affects. It has to be responsible. The 
government has to account for its actions with respect to the bill.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	In my observations of the bill I can only conclude that if the 
legislation does not meet the criteria I have set out as being 
acceptable to Canadians and to the people of Regina-Lumsden 
whom I represent, it cannot possibly go forward without 
comprehensive debate and amendment.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8453"> 8453 </A></B>
<P>
	As a result the New Democratic Party put forward 
amendments in the House to address issues of equity, fairness, 
responsibility and accountability. They were defeated by the 
government, by members of the Reform Party and by members 
of the Bloc Quebecois. This is very disconcerting to the people 
of Canada as well as to our caucus because we tried to inject 
some fairness.
<P>
	I want to make a couple of points with respect to the bill. For 
example, the WTO is a new constitution for the globalized 
economy written by and for multinationals, the transnationals of 
the world. The government has rejected a policy of developing a 
social clause to the WTO that would ensure multinationals 
recognize basic labour and environmental standards to prevent 
the race to the bottom.
<P>
	Even though the WTO supposedly offers a new rules based 
trading regime that will bring relief from trade harassment, 
American behaviour under NAFTA rules and evasive measures 
put into the American implementing legislation make it very 
unlikely that the Americans will play by the rules.
<P>
	In my remarks today I want to focus on the American 
legislation and how it protects American producers and 
American businessmen. The Canadian legislation we see before 
the House today does not protect Canadians in the same way.
<P>
	The biggest claim of WTO advocates is that it will inaugurate 
a new era of a rules based trading regime with enforceable rules 
regarding dumping and subsidies. The only problem is that the 
biggest single player, the United States, clearly has no intention 
of obeying the rules. We have already seen how under NAFTA 
rules the harassment of our trade in lumber and wheat has gone 
on unabated.
<P>
	The results of the recent congressional elections do not give 
Canadians much cause for hope that this behaviour will change. 
More important, the Americans have written into their 
implementing legislation a long list of provisions that 
effectively guarantee that no WTO will ever overturn an 
American federal or state measure. The Americans have given 
notice that they will treat WTO rules as they have treated 
NAFTA rules: to ignore if they go against perceived American 
interests.
<P>
	We in the New Democratic Party have proposed amendments 
that would have written into Canadian law exactly the same 
protection from WTO rulings the Americans have given to 
themselves. The government with typical gullibility about 
American goodwill chose to defeat our amendments. That 
reminds me: it is the same gullibility of the former Conservative 
Government of Canada. It bent over backward for the Americans 
and now we see the Liberals who were supposed to be different 
are not different. They are the same. They did exactly what the 
Conservative government did in the last Parliament of Canada. 
Liberal, Tory, same old story, I presume.
<P>
	In one sense we can look forward to the American sabotage of 
the new WTO rules in the way that they have sabotaged the 
NAFTA dispute settlement mechanism. To get these rules we 
have sacrificed a tremendous amount of sovereignty over 
investment policy and social security standards. With a rules 
based system imposed on American protectionism we can begin 
to rebuild a new constitution for the global economy that 
represents the interests of the communities.
<P>
	I share with members an incident that occurred involving 
myself and other members of the House of Commons last May. 
We are a member of the steel caucus. The steel caucus is 
composed of all parties with steel production in their 
constituencies. I am proud to say I have IPSCO, the 
Interprovincial Pipe and Steel Company in my district. It 
employs about 1,100 people. It is a very conscientious and 
environmentally sound corporation. It produces a significant 
amount of steel and pipe for the Canadian and American 
economies and for economies outside North America.
<P>
	We visited with American congressmen and senators on the 
issue of steel production. The reason we were there was that 
Canadian steel producers had been injured by anti-dumping 
claims of the American steel industry. We went there to talk to 
the legislators because they have legislation in effect which 
ignores NAFTA and which ignores the WTO that we have before 
the House today to protect their own producers.
<P>
<B>(1715) </B>
<P>
	If they believe, if it is perceived-it does not have to be 
proven-to injure their own industry, they can use whatever 
ability they have under the legislation in effect to deflect or stop 
trading nations from selling that product in their country.
<P>
	We have asked as a caucus to have this legislation amended to 
reflect the concerns of Canadian steel producers, our 
agricultural producers and others, including sugar, so that we 
are protected in the event that the WTO is injurious to Canadian 
producers. The government has defeated that. It ignored our 
requests and we are very concerned that as are the people in 
these industries.
<P>
	The Liberal member for Vancouver Quadra gave a historical 
perspective as to what he thought Franklin Delano Roosevelt 
intended in his trade negotiations. I want to throw a quote back 
to the member for Vancouver Quadra from Franklin Delano 
Roosevelt when he was president: ``The true test of progress in 
society is not whether we add to the abundance of those who 
have much but whether we provide enough for those who have 
too little''. That is a very important message that was relevant 
then, relevant now with respect to governments protecting the 
people in their countries from injurious economic initiatives 
from other countries regardless of world trade regulations.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8454"> 8454 </A></B>
<P>
	They are set up to set some standard and regulations to 
govern and trade by, to have economic interchange, but in the 
end the bottom line is that if it is injurious to your country a 
government is elected by the people for the people to protect 
the people.
<P>
	However, if you pass a law that does not provide that 
protection, you are giving up your obligation and right to govern 
the people you have been elected to govern. What the heck is 
going on here? I cannot understand this. I do not think anybody 
else in the country understands this either.
<P>
	What we have to do is point out to the Canadian population 
that Bill C-57 is injurious to the steel producers of Canada. It is 
injurious to the agricultural producers of Canada. It is injurious 
to the sugar producers of Canada and that means it must be 
injurious to much of Canada.
<P>
	If that is the case, why are they injuring our own people? We 
have enough competitors out there who are taking advantage of 
our country and our economy. We do not have to let the walls fall 
down and let our mechanisms of defence collapse and encourage 
outside countries to rape and plunder our economy further.
<P>
	The government is making a serious mistake with respect to 
passing Bill C-57 unamended. As a matter of fact, we have 
support from many people. I have a letter here from the sugar 
refineries. My former deskmate, a Conservative member, the 
member for Saint John, the former mayor of Saint John, has 
written to the Minister of Finance, pointing out what impact Bill 
C-57 will have on the sugar industry.
<P>
	I can get into that in a few minutes but I want to provide some 
evidence from the steel producers of Canada. They have made 
representations to the government, to the Standing Committee 
on Foreign Affairs and International Trade as late as November 
16 and they have indicated that Bill C-57 as proposed is going to 
be injurious to the steel producers of Canada. They document it 
in numbers.
<P>
	They say that because of the anti-dumping situations and 
charges, they have been victims of the American steel industry. 
It is costing them millions of dollars. They are saying that this 
type of anti-dumping initiative is injurious to their exporting 
and steel production.
<P>
	We are not dumping steel in the United States. We produce 
steel here and we sell it directly on a contract basis after winning 
a tender like any other producer would do in North America. Yet 
they single us out as being unproductive and as being overly 
competitive because they feel it is hurting their industry.
<P>
	The facts show and the truth is that is not the case. The steel 
producers of Canada want the government to make a couple of 
amendments on the following points. They suggested and we 
have put forward this proposal in the House that the Special 
Import Measures Act should be amended and should provide the 
Canadian international  trade tribunal with some authority with 
respect to injury on the steel exports in Canada.
<P>
<B>(1720 ) </B>
<P>
	Unlike the American implementing legislation, Bill C-57 
provides no guidelines as to what would be acceptable evidence. 
Without guidelines it would be very difficult for a Canadian 
company to know how to demonstrate a foreseen and imminent 
threat of injury. American companies will have an easier task 
under the legislation even though the same principle of the WTO 
is being implemented.
<P>
	The U.S. implementing legislation also provides that if 
dumping diminishes in reaction to the filing of a complaint, the 
ITC may discount evidence after the filing of its assessment of 
injury. This makes it easier for an injury charge to stick. There is 
no comparable provision in C-57.
<P>
	They go on and talk about a number of other issues. Bill C-57 
does not say anything about how the threat of injury should be 
interpreted at the time of review of an anti-dumping action. The 
American legislation does provide for these things.
<P>
	I could go on in detail about what the steel producers feel is 
injurious. The point is that every time they win a contract, 
export the steel to the States, even though NAFTA is in 
existence, even though the WTO is preparing to be in existence, 
the Americans can say because they have lost the contracts in the 
open tendering process: ``We are not going to let them take this 
contract because we are going to ask them for more 
information''. If they ask for all sorts of information it costs 
Canadian steel producers literally millions of dollars to gather 
this information which then makes their original bid more 
expensive and unprofitable. It also delays and is more or less a 
discouraging act on the part of the Americans. They have this in 
the legislation.
<P>
	If the Americans harass Canadian steel producers they have 
their law on their side and the Congress to provide them with 
that lever. Canadians and the Government of Canada are saying: 
``We are not going to be like the Americans. We do not want to 
provide protection to Canadians because we will be just like the 
Americans then''.
<P>
	Some things the Americans do are pretty smart. That is why 
they are the most successful business people in the world. That 
is why they have the most successful economy. They always 
undertake economic initiatives to the benefit of their country.
<P>
	New Democrats oppose Bill C-57 on the basis that it is 
injurious to the economy of Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simon de Jong (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in the time remaining I also wish to speak on Bill C-57. 
I wish to point out that as New Democrats we are not against free 
trade per se. We are in favour of a genuinely free trade on a level 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8455"> 8455 </A></B>
<P>
playing field. NAFTA, the  free trade agreement and Bill C-57 
do not lend themselves to a level playing field.
<P>
	The example the Europeans have with the European 
community is more to our liking as an example of where there is 
genuine free trade. The Europeans not only recognize that to 
bring down the customs barriers and allow the freer trade it is 
not just economics that are involved but also the social, 
environmental and labour standards.
<P>
	They have made certain that countries like Spain, Portugal 
and Greece that have traditionally low social, environmental 
and labour programs have implemented policies to raise them up 
so that there is a level playing field. All the industries from 
Holland, France and Germany do not go down into cheap labour 
countries such as Spain, Portugal and Greece. In other words, 
care and attention was given to implementing their free trade 
agreements. That is basically what we seek as well, a genuine 
playing field, to raise the bottom up rather than to bring the top 
down to the bottom.
<P>
	Canadian workers will suffer and government revenues will 
suffer. What we are entering into is a global trading pattern in 
which industries will find and locate where labour is cheapest. 
They will be able to get the resources at the cheapest possible 
price and locate their head offices where they pay the least 
amount of tax. It is smart business. If you were in business that 
is how you would set up your business arrangements. You would 
make certain that your natural resources were going to cost the 
least, that your labour would cost the least and that you would 
pay the least amount of tax. That is logical.
<P>
	These agreements are allowing them to escape any social 
responsibility, any economic responsibility to nation states.
<P>
<B>(1725) </B>
<P>
	Here we are living in a period in the evolution of the human 
race when through technological changes we can produce an 
abundance such as the human race has never seen before. Yet 
countries like Canada and the United States are declining further 
and further into poverty, into nations where there are fewer 
resources and less wealth to share and for their citizens to enjoy.
<P>
	We are seeing decreases in our standard of living in the midst 
of plenty. Is it not because of the way our economy is structured? 
The wealth that is produced is not being distributed. Large 
corporations are escaping their social responsibilities by 
locating their head offices offshore, which is allowed under 
these agreements, and so government revenues are declining. 
The nation states and the sovereignty and the sovereign power of 
the nation state are slowly eroding.
<P>
	That is why I am amazed to see the Bloc supporting this. By 
supporting this, even if Quebec-I hope it will not, and I suspect 
it will not-succeeds in establishing itself as a nation, by the 
time it gets there it will find that the nation will not have any 
power left at all. It will all have been given away through these 
trade agreements.
<P>
	We are talking about, this little corner of this House, the only 
voice of opposition to this massive change, is how we as a 
country and how our economy operates and how we regulate 
ourselves in the sources of revenue and jobs and wealth. What 
we are objecting to is the unfairness of it, how these trade 
agreements will benefit the few at the expense of the many, how 
as a country and as a sovereign nation we will suffer and we will 
decline.
<P>
	I implore the government, which paid lip service when it was 
in opposition and opposed NAFTA and the free trade agreement, 
which now seems to embrace these agreements, to maintain 
some social conscience, to demand that this government moves 
to implement into these free trade agreements social, 
environmental and labour components; to make certain that 
there is a genuine level playing field, to make certain that the 
progressive and historic gains that we have made in this country 
in our economy, in our wealth, are maintained and protected 
rather than being drawn down to the lowest common 
denominator.
<P>
	I appeal to the genuine Liberals to exert the influence in their 
caucus and on their government to make certain that the 
Government of Canada stands up for the workers and the 
ordinary people of Canada, not to sell them down the river like 
the previous Tory governments have done.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. It is almost 
5.30 but I think you might find a disposition on the part of the 
House to complete the debate on this important piece of 
legislation this afternoon. I believe you will find that there are 
two remaining speakers and if each were to be allotted 10 
minutes, both being members from this side of the House, 
without questions or comments, we could conclude the debate at 
5.50. At that time I think you would find also there would be 
consent to have the question put on the bill and the vote called at 
that stage.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Is there unanimous 
consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gurbax Singh Malhi (Bramalea-Gore-Malton, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to participate in the debate on 
Bill C-57, an act to implement the agreement establishing the 
World Trade Organization.
<P>
	I would like to reflect today on how important the adoption of 
this legislation is to the economy of Canada in general and to the 
economy of my riding of Bramalea-Gore-Malton in 
particular.
<P>
	In order for this government to meet its objective of creating 
jobs and improving the economy of Canada, it must enhance the 
ability of the nation to export to the rest of the world. The 
legislation before us will play an essential role in improving 
Canada's access to the ever-growing international markets. By 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8456"> 8456 </A></B>
<P>
creating a more open and stable international trading 
environment, the agreement establishing the World Trade 
Organization  will generate and increase Canadian exports and 
investments.
<P>
<B>(1730) </B>
<P>
	Canadian governments have long recognized the importance 
of efforts to liberalize trade. Canada ranks among the top trading 
countries in the world.
<P>
	Over the past two decades Canadian exports have grown 
faster than exports from Europe and at about the same pace as 
U.S. exports. The free trade agreement signed with the U.S. in 
1989 has resulted in an annual gain in real income in the range of 
2.5 per cent.
<P>
	Every region and every sector of the Canadian economy has 
benefited from the liberalization of Canada's trade with its most 
important trading partner.
<P>
	A recent study by the C.D. Howe Institute on the effects of the 
FTA concluded that Canada's exports to the United States over 
the first three years of the agreement performed the strongest in 
those sectors that were liberalized by the agreement, 
particularly non-resources based manufacturing.
<P>
	Bramalea-Gore-Malton is in a region of the country that 
depends most significantly on non-resource based 
manufacturing. Provisions of this bill dealing with agriculture 
are extremely significant in that for the first time the agriculture 
sector will be brought under the rules-based multilateral 
regime.
<P>
	The significance of these changes will be reflected in my 
riding in the improvement of market opportunities for processed 
foods. We must support this legislation to ensure that Canadians 
will be able to take advantage of improved access to markets.
<P>
	In the industrial products sector, for example, the Uruguay 
round agreement provides for reductions in the tariffs by 
one-third and tariffs in 10 sectors have been eliminated entirely.
<P>
	In terms of improving trade opportunities, Canadian exports 
to the European Union will benefit from tariff reductions of 
almost 60 per cent. Tariffs on Canadian exports to Japan will be 
reduced by 70 per cent.
<P>
	These tariff reductions will have a significant impact on 
companies in Bramalea-Gore-Malton that export to either 
Europe or the emerging markets of the Pacific rim.
<P>
	Better access, reduced tariffs and a competitive attitude 
recognizing the worldwide opportunities presented will be the 
cornerstone of growth in the future.
<P>
	This bill is also significant to my riding because for the first 
time trade in services and trade related intellectual property are 
brought within the framework of multilateral rules. These rules 
will provide a stronger basis for the development and transfer of 
technology.
<P>
	The agreement promotes continued liberalization of trade in 
services and intellectual property in an area estimated to be 
worth some $2 trillion annually. Increased growth in this sector 
is anticipated and in fact corporations within my riding are well 
placed to benefit from expanding opportunities in these sectors.
<P>
	It is significant that the negotiations leading to the 
establishment of a World Trade Organization benefited greatly 
from the process of consultation that has taken place.
<P>
	The business and agricultural communities, as well as the 
provinces, were closely consulted throughout the course of the 
negotiations. The fact that prior consultation was designed into 
this process means that the results reflect the realities of doing 
business in all regions of the nation.
<P>
<B>(1735 ) </B>
<P>
	The legislation before us is extremely important as the World 
Trade Organization will replace the existing GATT. The World 
Trade Organization along with the World Bank and the 
International Monetary Fund will now operate in concert as the 
foundation of a worldwide financial and commercial structure. 
The significance of this should not be underestimated as the 
development of new global trade rules and negotiations aimed at 
furthering liberalization of trade worldwide will now be 
provided with a forum.
<P>
	My support of this bill reflects not only the benefits that will 
accrue to my riding, but the benefits that Canada as a nation will 
no doubt enjoy. I urge my fellow members to support Bill C-57 
and swiftly move to the establishment of the World Trade 
Organization.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Middlesex, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to take part in today's debate on the third 
reading of Bill C-57, an act to implement the agreement 
establishing the World Trade Organization. The main aim of this 
legislation is to establish the new World Trade Organization 
which will administer the recently concluded general 
agreements on tariffs and trade signed by 123 governments in 
Morocco in April of this year.
<P>
	This bill will set the stage for a new era in international trade, 
making Canada a full participant in the most comprehensive 
trade agreement in history. Bill C-57, the implementation 
legislation, will modify existing legislation and contains only 
those changes required to meet Canada's obligations under the 
international agreement.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8457"> 8457 </A></B>
<P>
	Canada and a host of other nations went through seven and 
one-half years of difficult, often very frustrating, multilateral 
negotiations with the Uruguay round of GATT. Throughout the 
negotiations, Canada aggressively pursued an agreement to 
pave the way for expanded trade and investment worldwide. We 
certainly did not get everything we wanted, but that is the 
nature of most negotiated settlements.
<P>
	I intend to offer my support to this bill, although I must admit 
my support is tempered by cautious optimism. There are so 
many unanswered questions associated with what can or should 
be achieved in this new era of global trade. Until we become 
familiar with the ways and means of this new trading 
framework, uncertainty is bound to linger.
<P>
	The Uruguay round covered 15 different trade areas including 
services, government procurement and a new set of trade dispute 
rules. We all know how close we came to not having an 
agreement at all. Had Canada and other nations not signed this 
trade deal it is open to question where we would have stood. It is 
possible that business would have continued as usual, but very 
unlikely.
<P>
	Several very serious trade disputes had been piling up 
between the United States, the European community and Japan 
and were put on hold pending the outcome of the Uruguay round. 
As a middle economic power, Canada often found itself in the 
crossfire between these formidable trading blocks and our 
interests suffered as a result. To that end Canada was forced, 
after standing completely alone, to abandon its primary aim, the 
strengthening and clarification of article XI, and instead was 
compelled to protect its supply managed products by an initial 
level of high tariffication rather than quotas.
<P>
	I should state that as member for Lambton-Middlesex the 
primary industry in my riding is agriculture. Statistics show that 
nearly three-quarters of a billion dollars worth of farm products 
are produced each year in the counties of Lambton and 
Middlesex. More than one-half billion dollars worth of farm 
supplies and equipment are purchased.
<P>
	To say that my constituents are concerned about what lies 
ahead of them would be an understatement. Frankly, I do not 
blame them for being concerned as we embark on a brand new 
era in global trade, where to a certain extent a large degree of 
blind faith is required. As parliamentarians I believe our main 
challenge, given the kind of financial straits in which we find 
ourselves and given the international obligations under which 
we are now operating, is to search for a proper balance between 
the rigours and the power of the marketplace and the 
establishment of a greater degree of fairness to farmers in the 
farming community. A farming community is worth preserving 
and I cannot overstate the need to use and develop our talents in 
doing so.
<P>
<B>(1740) </B>
<P>
	It would be a serious mistake for Canada to become 
complacent now that 10 years of trade negotiations, starting 
with the Canada-U.S. free trade agreement, have finally ended. 
The globalization of large corporations means there is a whole 
host of problems around which we have to get our minds.
<P>
	International trade is no longer among nations but among 
highly organized transnational corporations which have 
operations around the world. That means there must be 
international rules on such things as government regulations, 
competition laws, industrial standards and even rules governing 
labour markets. The World Trade Organization represents just a 
beginning in this process.
<P>
	For example, members of the House should know that only a 
handful of companies control the processing of Canada's 
agricultural products. If we do not address this reality, then I am 
truly afraid for the future of Canada's farmers. If there is no 
incentive to farming then our sons and daughters will choose not 
to carry on. If a country cannot feed itself then it becomes a 
beggar in the world economy.
<P>
	There are things we do right in Canada, that are the envy of the 
world. Internationally Canada has a reputation as a reliable 
supplier of some of the safest and highest quality, most 
diversified and unique agri-food products of any country in the 
world. Canada's agri-food industry accounts for 8 per cent of 
the GDP, over $15 billion in annual export sales, 40 per cent of 
Canada's positive balance of trade, two million jobs or 15 per 
cent of all jobs and $70 billion worth of goods produced each 
year.
<P>
	We are told that the World Trade Organization will remedy 
such things as export enhancement subsidies and unilateral 
trade sanctions, that it will command sufficient confidence in its 
impartiality and efficiency, that it will uphold multilateral rules 
in the face of powerful protectionist interest groups and national 
governments.
<P>
	I am gratified that there is a growing consensus in Canada that 
we have to develop our own strategies in dealing with the new 
realities that confront us. For example, I am very impressed with 
the work being done over the last six months by the Standing 
Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food.
<P>
	Since May the committee has embarked on an ambitious study 
on the future of agriculture in order to evaluate present 
agri-food objectives and modify them for the year 2000 and 
beyond. Using the criteria of fairness, sustainability and 
efficiency, the committee is examining the agri-food sector role 
in rural life and in the Canadian economy and is involving 
producers, processors, consumers and other interested parties in 
developing a long term national strategy for agriculture.
<P>
	Taken together, these components will constitute an overall 
farm policy that will take the Canadian agri-food sector into the 
<P>

<B><A NAME="8458"> 8458 </A></B>
<P>
next century. It is precisely grassroot  efforts like these that will 
prepare Canadian agriculture for the challenges before us.
<P>
	I would like to take this opportunity to salute the agriculture 
committee and its efforts and I have every confidence that it will 
be successful in its endeavours. Hopefully, the Uruguay round 
will be the last marathon bargaining session.
<P>
	I believe there will be a preference instead for more limited 
and focused negotiations on a variety of sectors and that is as it 
should be. Canada has in the past invested significantly in 
agricultural research and has achieved one of the highest 
international annual growth rates of agricultural production 
over the past two decades.
<P>
	Here is a case in point. Canola, developed in Canada by the 
federal government researchers, grew from a zero dollar per 
year industry in 1974 to an estimated $9.35 billion per year 
industry in 1994.
<P>
	Tragically Canadian investment in growth enhancing 
measures such as research and market development in the 
agri-food sector has steadily declined in recent years. We must 
reverse this trend precisely because we will find ourselves in an 
even more competitive marketplace under the auspices of the 
WTO.
<P>
	Let me say in conclusion that we must develop a strategy for 
agriculture between the various levels of government and the 
private sector, including the various farm organizations. This 
need is even more acute within the highly competitive global 
marketplace and it involves three inter-related components.
<P>
	We must remain committed to agriculture and agri-food and 
other natural resource sectors which are the cornerstone of 
Canada's economy.
<P>
	We must strengthen our investment in agri-food research. We 
must ensure that the farmers of this country who produce $70 
billion worth of goods each year get a fair share of the 
agricultural dollar.
<P>
	Using these criteria once we have recommitted ourselves to 
building a solid domestic foundation in Canada's agricultural 
sector, I truly believe that we will be able to compete with 
anyone in the world.

	He said: Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to have the opportunity 
to debate my private member's motion M-290 which seeks to 
address the current inadequacies and shortcomings surrounding 
the turnover of assets and inventory by defeated MPs to their 
successors.
<P>
	Currently volume 2 of the member's manual of allowances 
and services, chapter G-3, is the only reference to the turnover 
of constituency assets of the House of Commons. The closest 
and most direct statement referencing the turnover is as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A member who stands for re-election but is not re-elected is required to 
vacate the constituency office within 30 days of the date of the election. Thus 
the essential costs of maintaining the office for the 30-day winding up period, 
(e.g. office supplies, telephone rental, telephone answering service, utility 
bills, furniture and equipment rental) may be charged against the members' 
office budget.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This is the only reference to a time line, a 30-day winding up 
period, and it is not specific as to transfer of assets.
<P>
<B>(1750 ) </B>
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I think it is important to read into the record the 
text of my motion. However, you have just done that.
<P>
	I welcome debate, input and suggestions during this allotted 
hour and following on how to improve the transition for 
incoming MPs, particularly as this motion directs office 
inventory and assets.
<P>
	The public has high expectations of its new MPs after an 
election. The goodwill component which is now the driving 
philosophy behind the orderly and timely turnover of assets can 
and has led to political abuse and interruption of the political 
and constituency response process.
<P>
	I know this first hand. I know I am not alone, particularly after 
the last election which saw over 200 new MPs elected, 200 eager 
MPs who wanted to get down to business at the constituency 
level and in Ottawa but were precluded by outright refusal by 
some losing candidates who procrastinated in turning over 
government assets or in extreme cases could not be contacted at 
all or refused to return calls. Such was my case. Ultimately my 
entire office inventory was not in place until January. If it had 
been one day later it would have been February, more than three 
months after election day.
<P>
	The House of Commons materiel management group could 
not account for the inventory and was unable to locate the 
inventory because of its inability to locate the outgoing MP, 
because it was unaware of two of the four constituency office 
locations which he utilized, and because the MP had placed 
assets in storage facilities  without notifying materiel 
management-totally stealthy and irresponsible behaviour on 
the part of an outgoing MP who refused to show goodwill, 
inconveniencing not only me but the constituents of North 
Island-Powell River.
<P>
	Allow me to elaborate on the saga of my misfortune by 
quoting from my constituency assistant, my second employee at 
the constituency: ``On my first day of work, December 1, 1993, I 
walked into an office that was sparsely appointed with borrowed 
furniture. Not one piece of equipment belonged to the 
Government of Canada. I brought my own computer from home 
so that we could reply to correspondence''.
<P>
	My staff frustration grew daily. My staff paid a visit to the 
office of my predecessor. It was locked and no staff was around. 
A call to Ottawa to materiel management proved fruitless. It 
also had no idea where the assets were and was spending 
considerable effort tracking down the MP without success.
<P>
	Essentially, the problem could be summed up by the House of 
Commons materiel management official who stated that there 
were two MP phone numbers, each with an answering machine 
referring the caller to the other telephone and no returned phone 
calls. At this point I purchased a photocopier. I knew that an 
effective MP had to possess some investigatory skills. This was 
ridiculous.
<P>
	Materiel management representatives indicated they were 
getting nowhere with the former MP and their hands were tied 
because they lacked power by statute or by decree to do 
anything. They floated the scenario at this time of trying to 
access the MP and influence his behaviour through the party 
constituency association or his party leader.
<P>
	On December 8, 1993 my constituency office received a call 
from the House of Commons to say that the furniture and office 
possessions were located. Delivery was promised to my main 
office. On December 13 some basic furniture arrived. On 
December 17 more furniture arrived, but no sign of computers or 
photocopiers as listed on the inventory list. My office continued 
to supply the personally owned computer and borrowed a fax 
machine.
<P>
	At that point considerable correspondence and filing had 
accumulated, not a good beginning on response turn around 
time.
<P>
<B>(1755) </B>
<P>
	On December 20 the House of Commons called to say it had 
no idea where the computers were. I decided at that time to 
purchase two computers from my member's office budget. The 
former member had four constituency offices, so possessions 
belonging to the government were scattered. We located some 
more inventory in storage with over a month owing on their 
storage because the former MP had paid for two weeks storage 
and indicated the House of Commons would pick up the 
remainder of the tab without further instruction and without  
informing the House. Again, not all the computers were present 
at this storage site.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8460"> 8460 </A></B>
<P>
	Also I quickly found that the fax machine we located was in 
poor repair, forcing me to purchase a new one. I received further 
inventory on December 24, 1993. On January 5, 1994, I received 
delivery of a new fax machine. On the same day I took 
possession of two new computers, more than two months after 
the election.
<P>
	On January 7, I found the inventory from the previous 
member's Sechelt office, far from complete after reconciling 
the inventory list. Computers again were missing. Included was 
a 386 and a lap top. With rent still owing to the storage facility of 
the Sechelt inventory, I personally paid the amount to solve the 
operator's frustration with the position he had been placed in.
<P>
	On January 22, I received information that more inventory 
had been located in a Campbell River storage facility. The 
missing computers with the exception of the lap top were in the 
room. They were of the older 286 variety. On January 31, I did a 
formal reconciliation, the 286 lap top never did show. In May I 
was informed that it had been returned to Ottawa damaged and 
unusable and materiel management informed me that the former 
MP had been requested to pay and had paid for the lap top.
<P>
	The sleuthing around by me, my staff and House of Commons 
staff was bad enough in order to locate government inventory. 
Because Parliament had not been in session for about seven 
months previous to the election, there was a large pent up 
demand for service and reasonable expectations by deserving 
constituents for attention to their needs.
<P>
	The fact that I was without assets was a major distraction for 
me in fulfilling my duties as an MP. The previous member had 
been in office for 14 years. As a green MP and with the residual 
effects of a contested campaign still fresh in my memory, I did 
not want to go public with the inexcusable behaviour of the 
previous MP because I had taken the high road consistently 
when others had not and I did not want to appear somehow 
affected by my win.
<P>
	The events I have described should not be allowed to reoccur. 
These assets had been bought and paid for by the taxpayers of 
Canada and we need better ground rules than currently exist. 
Materiel management did all it could do at long distance within 
it mandate. Even with that my staff was instrumental in its 
sleuthing and finding where some of the inventory was stored. 
Members can appreciate that my staff could not view the items 
once located in storage without authorization from the House of 
Commons. Even this was awkward and so was not done, adding 
further to our delay in reconciling our inventory.
<P>
	We would all be much better off with clear lines of authority 
and responsibility to effect the transfer of assets. In my view the 
withholding of the entire office inventory was punitive and 
retributive and I should have had some recourse beyond good 
will to pursue the  matter. I was the last member of Parliament in 
Canada to receive my assets. I know I was not alone in my grief 
and frustration and that is why I feel so strongly about my 
motion.
<P>
<B>(1800 ) </B>
<P>
	Similar activities as perpetrated by my predecessor would be 
tantamount to theft in the private sector. We must untie the 
hands of the materiel management people of the House of 
Commons and allow new MPs to do their job effectively. Good 
will is not enough. Accountability must be introduced. We must 
put teeth into the rules and procedures for the turnover of assets 
and initiate ramifications for those who do not prescribe to the 
rules.
<P>
	My motion calls for the involvement by the deputy returning 
officers at the constituency level. They would be charged with 
the responsibility of reconciling inventory of the former 
member and co-ordinating the transfer.
<P>
	In Ottawa the materiel management staff shall ensure storage 
and/or transfer in an orderly fashion. If the outgoing MP should 
fail to deliver, the shortfall value would be deducted from that 
former MP's pay or pension or compensation sought and, in 
extreme cases, criminal charges should be initiated.
<P>
	During my trial surrounding this debacle and the senseless 
behaviour exhibited by the former MP, various strategies 
emerged including, as I previously mentioned, contacting the 
former MP's riding association and party leader. The other 
option was to pursue the issue through the Speaker which was 
complicated because this was also a time of transition for that 
office.
<P>
	In the final analysis, materiel management of the House of 
Commons has no power to initiate the transfer of assets and in 
the final analysis again must rely on the good will of the former 
MP who in this case had none.
<P>
	My situation may be a dramatic example, but as my 
colleagues who will speak later will attest, I am not alone. If we 
do not do something about it now it will get worse. I will tell 
members why. Currently we are dealing with stable and existing 
ridings. We all know we are considering the adoption of a bill 
which would see ridings actually change their boundaries every 
five to ten years. Therefore, the frequency in which members 
inherit intact ridings is going to reduce and the frequency when 
they inherit changed ridings is going to exacerbate the problem. 
The new MP will not know which former MP or constituency 
office he or she will be inheriting because the boundaries will 
have been shifted.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8461"> 8461 </A></B>
<P>
	Clearly it is incumbent upon the House to take a look at the 
current turnover of assets procedure. We cannot have a situation 
where the legislators of Canada are found incompetent due to 
a lack of legislative authority governing their own activities in 
areas so common sense as transferring MP furniture, supplies 
and equipment. If the House allows this injustice and waste of 
taxpayers' dollars to continue it is not serving its function.
<P>
	I would like to submit one further option to make my case. 
While I have not spoken to the chief electoral officer, it may be 
that this individual through some amendment or addition to the 
Elections Act can be empowered by statute to initiate and ensure 
the turnover of these government assets in an orderly and timely 
manner.
<P>
	This is a serious issue and one I would implore the House to 
deal with even if I had not experienced this frustrating, time 
consuming delay. As it is now, the House is powerless, materiel 
management is powerless and sheer good will is not enough.
<P>
	I thank the House for the opportunity to debate my motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to have an opportunity to participate in 
this debate today because the hon. member's motion is a serious 
one.
<P>
	I want to point out that while I think he has raised a subject 
that is one we ought to discuss, I am not sure the solution he has 
proposed to the subject, laying criminal charges and getting the 
returning officers and elections involved, is a particularly 
helpful set of suggestions.
<P>
	I would like to deal first with those. Then I will try to say 
something constructive about what the hon. member has put 
forward because I know he has done it in all seriousness.
<P>
<B>(1805 ) </B>
<P>
	I also want to say that I do not think the experience he had is 
one that was shared by all members of this House. Most of us 
when we took over in the House after having been 
elected-mine of course was not in 1993; it was in 1988, but I 
took over from a sitting MP at that time-did not find the 
situation quite as bad as the hon. member has described.
<P>
	The outgoing members in most cases were very civil in their 
treatment of the newly elected members in that they handed over 
the office supplies that were there. I think also the hon. member 
might have sought greater assistance. It might have been 
available in a way that perhaps he did not appreciate at the time. 
He was seeking that assistance having found that most of the 
equipment apparently had disappeared.
<P>
	The difficulty that the hon. member's motion indicates in my 
view are twofold. First, he has suggested that the proper solution 
for this is to have, I think he says, the deputy returning officer 
look after this. I assume that he  means the returning officer in 
the constituency and not one of the deputy returning officers in 
one of the polls.
<P>
	If he means the returning officer in the constituency, he 
suggests this person go in and do an inventory as soon as the writ 
is issued. With all respect, the returning officer in the 
constituency has to get his own office set up within hours of the 
writ being issued. He has to hire all his staff to get the election 
machinery going. The time when that person is at his or her 
busiest moment is in the few days following the issue of a writ. 
To suggest that person ought to take time out of that schedule 
and drop around to the MP's office to have a look at the furniture 
is patently silly.
<P>
	If the hon. member thinks about that, he will realize it is not 
the place of the returning officer in an election to go around and 
see the MP's office equipment and conduct his own inventory. 
There are other reasons it is not a good idea that I will elaborate 
on in a moment.
<P>
	The second criticism I would make is that I am not sure the 
hon. member needs to have the deputy returning officer be the 
person that does it. There are dozens of deputy returning officers 
appointed in every constituency, one for every poll. In my 
constituency there are something like 240 polls. In other ridings 
there are more. Surely we do not have to wait until those people 
are appointed, which takes some weeks into the election period 
in the first place, then choose one that will be the person that 
runs about to the MP's office to inspect the equipment. I do not 
see that as necessary.
<P>
	I want to deal with the current arrangements that affect 
members' office equipment and how they are covered in fact by 
provisions currently existing in the Member's Manual of 
Allowances and Services. I am sure the hon. member has read 
the manual on allowances and services. It is entirely possible 
that when he got to the pages on materiel management he fell 
asleep. I have had this experience reading this manual. It is 
tough going. I do not suggest for a minute that the hon. member 
is negligent in his duties, but this manual is heavy duty stuff.
<P>
	In it there are all kinds of things that deal with members' 
equipment, budgets and so on. If the hon. member turns to 
section 7(1) of the bylaws-I think the bylaws are at the back or 
the front of the manual; there is a separate book that has them 
but they are also in the manual-it says:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Where an MP contravenes the bylaws of the House and the situation is not 
resolved to the satisfaction of the Board-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This means the Board of Internal Economy.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-the Board may order any amount of money required to rectify the 
situation to be withheld from any budget, allowance or other payment that 
may be made available to the Member-and</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8462"> 8462 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>c) -if the Board considers it necessary-the Board may order that any budget, 
allowance or other payment that may be made available to the Member be frozen for 
such time and on such other conditions as the Board considers necessary.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In addition to that the board has powers of enforcement using 
civil remedies. It can sue members of the House who have 
breached the provisions of the bylaws of the board. I want to 
make it clear that inventory of members' assets is not something 
that is done just before election time.
<P>
	The hon. member will discover there is an annual inventory 
carried out of the assets that are in his constituency office. My 
experience has been that the list is sent to my staff and I am 
asked to verify and sign a document that those items are in my 
constituency office. If the hon. member has a real problem with 
the conditions of the assets, that is if they were being destroyed 
and damaged by an outgoing member, which I heard by rumour 
may have happened in one instance but I do not know, the 
member can be asked when the inventory is done to comment in 
the inventory on the state of the assets over which he has control.
<P>
<B>(1810) </B>
<P>
	I frankly cannot understand why it would be a particular 
problem in almost every case for members to review this list of 
assets on an annual basis and pass their comments to the House 
officers in charge of this, materiel management, and have those 
reports made available. As the hon. member knows, they are 
made available on the election of a new member. This list is 
given to the new member and the new member is then told he can 
go to the constituency office and reasonably expect that the 
items on the list from materiel management will be available to 
him or her, as the case may be. I am of course referring to the 
hon. member who opened the debate with his motion in this 
particular case.
<P>
	I am not sure that we can do a great deal to prevent former 
members from making off with assets. It happens in various 
places around this country. As I have said, I think virtually all 
members have been quite honestly dealt with in this regard and 
they have received the things they ought reasonably to have 
received from the former member.
<P>
	I know the hon. member for North Island-Powell River has 
had his problems. I see from the scowls on the faces of hon. 
members opposite that some of them may have had a shared 
experience. But that has not been the experience of the vast 
majority of members in this House.
<P>
	I think to go on a witch hunt or come in with some draconian 
rules that are extremely cumbersome, awkward and expensive to 
administer for the sake of saving a few thousand dollars here and 
there on missing equipment is hardly worth the trouble that I 
think the hon. member for North Island-Powell River is 
suggesting we ought to engage in by this motion.
<P>
	I sympathize with the plight he described. I recognize that 
there can be cases of dishonesty and we all deplore that. But the 
law affords sufficient remedies. Where there has been 
dishonesty charges can be laid. We do not need a motion in the 
House to lay charges. That can be done where fraud has been 
established.
<P>
	On the basis of the annual review of assets that is conducted 
by materiel management and officers of this House and are 
signed for by members of this House when the review is 
complete, and is done on a regular basis, there is no reason in my 
view why that list cannot be accurate and up to date when the 
new member takes over.
<P>
	If that is the case, it seems to me it is unnecessary for us to get 
into a lengthy procedural arrangement whereby we have all 
kinds of people coming into MPs offices and inspecting this 
equipment day after day. It is a nuisance, it is expensive and 
unnecessary. I know the hon. member, being a member of the 
Reform Party, like us is much opposed to government waste.
<P>
	I suggest that some of the things he has put in his motion 
would lead to increased government waste.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to speak on this motion and to give the viewpoint of 
the Official Opposition on the motion of the member for North 
Island-Powell River.
<P>
	I want to say right away that we do support this motion. We 
support it because it involves taxpayers' money and also the 
proper management of the equipment made available to elected 
members.
<P>
	The motion presented by the member for North 
Island-Powell River refers to sound management, to transfer 
when an election is held and recovery if any furniture, supplies 
and equipment for which the member is responsible while in 
office and which belong to the House disappear. Remember that 
if it belongs to the House, it belongs to all taxpayers.
<P>
<B>(1815) </B>
<P>
	This motion reminds us of how difficult it is to draw up a 
permanent list of property for an institution such as the House of 
Commons where the political staff changes very regularly, every 
four or five years.
<P>
	Although an inventory for all office equipment belonging to 
the House has existed since 1977, according to information 
obtained from Materiel Management, more than 90 of the 205 
new members elected last fall reported significant discrepancies 
between the inventory report of what they should have received 
and what they actually received. It is disturbing that 90 of the 
205 newcomers do not have the equipment exactly as it is listed 
on the inventory. We are entitled to ask questions and the 
member for North Island-Powell River, who tabled the motion, 
is right to raise the issue.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8463"> 8463 </A></B>
<P>
	As early as April, several Canadian newspapers reported that 
equipment like video systems, televisions, faxes and furniture 
had disappeared from the House since the last election in 
October 1993. For example, <I>La Presse</I> for April 13 reported that 
Commons staff were trying to find television sets, VCRs, 
computers, cellular telephones, faxes and furniture belonging 
to the government, on the basis of information obtained directly 
from Materiel Management. We know that this includes 
equipment which is not easy to put in one's coat pocket.
<P>
	Nevertheless, we must not conclude too hastily that theft or 
fraud is involved, as some people might be inclined to do. 
According to our information, it is very difficult to prove that 
former members really intended to steal. As proof, almost all the 
missing items were recovered, the member will be glad to know, 
by the staff of Materiel Management and the non-recovered 
items were charged to the members who were responsible for 
them.
<P>
	There are many difficulties in drawing up a reliable inventory 
of House property and they have nothing to do with the honesty 
of members. For one, Materiel Management is not always 
informed promptly of changes to members' inventory during 
their term and also it is often difficult to transfer property from 
the riding office of a defeated member to the new member's 
office, given the rivalry between them.
<P>
	Also, some items from the riding office, including laptop 
computers, cellular telephones and video systems, are left in the 
defeated member's Ottawa office, no doubt in the belief that the 
newly elected member will occupy the same premises on the 
Hill, which is not necessarily the case.
<P>
	The honour system of assigning responsibility for inventory 
to members has its advantages but also disadvantages, let us 
admit. The Bloc Quebecois is fully aware of the importance of 
protecting all property, both in members' riding offices and in 
their Ottawa offices, since it belongs to the House of Commons 
and is paid for with taxpayers' money.
<P>
	With this in mind, we can only support Private Member's 
Motion 290, which suggests strengthening-do you agree?-the 
measures for auditing equipment inventories. I do not hear the 
member say that he agrees. Is something wrong? I was saying 
that the member's motion suggests strengthening the measures 
for auditing equipment inventories, furniture and so on, and the 
responsibilities of every member for this property-and it is 
important because we manage the taxpayers' money-in order 
to protect public property. We agree.
<P>
	Nevertheless, several of the measures suggested in the motion 
already exist, we must admit. For several years, a physical audit 
of all the premises occupied by members of Parliament in 
Ottawa has been done annually.
<P>
<B>(1820) </B>
<P>
	And an electronic inventory, which uses bar codes, makes it 
easier to control and protect this property. Until quite recently, 
always according to Materiel Management, there was a major 
problem, which has now been identified. It was the issue of 
furnishings in riding offices.
<P>
	We have to realize exactly where the problem is, and it seems 
it is particularly serious in riding offices. In fact, because of a 
lack of staff, Materiel Management was unable to check its 
inventories of furnishings in riding offices. I support the hon. 
member's motion, and I can inform government members that 
the problem has been identified. The problem was in the ridings, 
and there was not enough staff to keep track.
<P>
	Now that there is more staff, there is a more effective 
relationship based on trust and co-operation between Materiel 
Management and the riding offices. This is a definite 
improvement, and we appreciate the efforts of those concerned.
<P>
	A materiel policy is about to be put in place. It was in fact 
discussed on the Standing Committee on Procedure and House 
Affairs. The policy is almost ready to be implemented, and we 
are talking about the beginning of the next session. We hope it 
will be put in place by the Committee on Procedure and House 
Affairs, which discussed and approved the implementation of 
this policy.
<P>
	This policy on furnishings basically contains the main 
elements of the hon. member's motion, Motion 290, which asks 
us to be efficient, effective and responsible managers, because 
the furnishings and equipment we have are, in the final instance, 
provided by the taxpayers.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it is a pleasure to talk to a motion like this since I was one of 
those people personally involved in some of the bad dealings 
that happened after the election.
<P>
	Of course, the hon. member for Kingston and the Islands says 
these are only isolated cases so why bother. That is not what this 
is about. This whole issue is about accountability.
<P>
	I know that some members on the other side may have a 
problem with that issue. We do not have a problem talking about 
this in the House of Commons. Accountability is something 
everybody in this land has to live with, particularly members of 
the House of Commons.
<P>
	I wonder if the government members are going to listen to 
this. After all they do have a majority government. We found out 
today that the Bloc will support our member's motion, and I am 
sure the vast majority of colleagues, all of the Reform 
colleagues, will support it as well.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8464"> 8464 </A></B>
<P>
	In talking about accountability and assets belonging to the 
taxpayer the question is: When it comes to a vote next week 
on Wednesday or Thursday, how will the government members 
vote on this issue? Will they find a very small technicality? Will 
they find as the member for Kingston and the Islands says, that 
perhaps this is not really as bad as we think? Will they say that 
since it is not that bad they will vote it down? Or, will they say 
that perhaps there is an issue of accountability and perhaps 
therefore they should vote for it? That remains to be seen.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> It is not votable.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> That is right. There, they 
half shot my whole argument down. It is not votable, but will 
they support it?
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> We will support it, but it is not votable.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> There you go.
<P>
	The question is: Who owns government property? The fact is 
that the taxpayers own it. Regardless of which incumbent comes 
into the job, the facts are the equipment is only on loan. 
Although we purchase it doing our time or we may take some 
from a member who preceded us, it always belongs to the 
taxpayer. It is much like leasing property; it has to be given back 
in some shape or form.
<P>
<B>(1825 ) </B>
<P>
	In my case after I was elected I went with my predecessor to 
look at the inventory in the cold storage. I did not know whether 
it was the right or wrong inventory but I went through the 
facility. I said we would ship it out to my new office. It came a 
couple of weeks later. There was no problem at all. I opened the 
door to my new office. The fellows on the delivery truck came 
and I actually sent some of the equipment back. I said: ``This 
stuff is in terrible shape. Take it back and I am going to have to 
deal with it some other way, but bring in the television and the 
VCR. They look a little old but bring them in anyway. Bring in 
the old cellular phone and we will make use of that''.
<P>
	A while later I thought we should check off the inventory. As 
the member for Kingston and the Islands has said, an inventory 
sheet is given to us. I checked the VCR off, no problem at all. 
What bothered me was that the inventory list indicated that these 
were recent purchases and they were high dollar items. The 
amounts were in the several thousands of dollars, even for the 
television and the VCR but I would not have given very much for 
what I received. The value of those items I received might have 
been $200 or $300 in total.
<P>
	I thought that perhaps there was something wrong. Digging 
into it we did find that yes, all this new equipment was bought 
but it was not sitting in my office; it was somewhere else.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Shame.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> The Liberal member is 
saying ``shame''. Yes it is a shame. It is a shame they do not 
understand what accountability is and what the issue is.
<P>
	What happened was that the member had purchased the new 
equipment and kept it at his home and replaced that equipment 
with old stuff.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Wappel:</B> Shame.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> It took me quite a while to 
fight this. We finally did get it all back.
<P>
	The fact is there should be something in place to assure there 
is accountability.
<P>
	I understand the concern of these Liberals across here. It is all 
too often that we hear: ``Shame, shame, shame''. It is all too 
often that we hear: ``Yes, we should do something about it''. It is 
all too often that we know nothing is done. That is unfortunate.
<P>
	This is not an isolated case. This has happened time and time 
again. All we are asking in the House of Commons is that it stop, 
that something gets in place and we take care of it. That is not 
too difficult a thing to ask.
<P>
	It is not about trouble. This issue is not trouble. One member 
said just recently that the Reform Party was looking for a 
witchhunt in this motion, again my friend from Kingston and the 
Islands. I am not sure what the reference was to the witchhunt 
but again they have to get beyond witchhunts. They have to get 
beyond all of this lack of credibility in their statements and get 
on to what the issue is all about.
<P>
	I tell you what I would not do with the member for Kingston 
and the Islands. I would never let the hon. member run my store. 
The way it is described here is: ``Well, somebody is walking off 
with the equipment; somebody is walking off with my inventory 
but that it is okay. It is only a couple of people, so let us not 
bother with it''. It could be your whole profits going down in the 
store.
<P>
	We resolve this situation by taking a motion like this and 
saying that is the way to deal with it. Let us put it on the books. 
Let us dig in here and say even one instance like this is 
unacceptable because where there is one there are others. Indeed 
we have heard two of them today and there are more in line.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> If you can't deal with the little things how 
can you deal with the big things?
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, we are having 
fun in here today because those people over there do not 
understand what we are talking about.
<P>
<B>(1830 ) </B>
<P>
	The motion my colleague put before the House is a solid 
motion on accountability. It is really unfortunate that members 
over there do not understand about this stuff. We are trying hard. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8465"> 8465 </A></B>
<P>
Perhaps in the next three years we will teach them how to spell 
the word accountability,  will teach them how to think the word 
accountability and will even teach them how to act the word 
accountability because they really do not know what it is about 
today.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John O'Reilly (Victoria-Haliburton, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, although I am not scheduled, I keep hearing the word 
accountability from the member for Fraser Valley West. I wish it 
was question and answer period. Last summer I had the pleasure 
of attending the public accounts committee conference in 
Charlottetown. The total cost of my ticket was probably $700. I 
would like to ask the member for Fraser Valley West who flew 
from Vancouver with his wife-
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Who paid her way.
<P>
	<B>Mr. O'Reilly:</B> -to Charlottetown, then on to New Brunswick 
and then on to St. John's how much his ticket was. Where was 
his accountability? Talk about the pork barrel.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> It came out of his pocket.
<P>
	<B>Mr. O'Reilly:</B> I cannot believe this member could stand and 
talk about accountability.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a 
point of order. I would like the record to show that there is a 
cheque, not in the mail but deposited with the government, for 
my wife's portion of anything that was personal on that public 
accounts conference.
<P>
	By the way I take great exception to the accusation-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. Resuming debate 
with the hon. member for Athabasca.
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise on this issue because I have had the same 
experience as has been related by the other two members of my 
caucus. I take real exception to the cavalier attitude that has 
been expressed across the floor on the whole issue because even 
if only one member had this experience it is sufficient to warrant 
close examination and some real change.
<P>
	Before I was elected I visited the offices of the former 
member. They were very well appointed offices with good 
furniture. There were computers in both offices and were very 
well equipped. After I was elected and the inventory was 
transferred to my office I was surprised to find that some very 
meagre furnishings were transferred. My filing cabinets, two of 
which I received, were locked and appeared to have been rolled 
down the stairs. When I had a locksmith open them because the 
keys were not there, the hanging filing rails were not there. It 
took some time and expense. The computer that was inventoried 
and I was to receive was not there. Some old obsolete 
equipment, some home-built computers with no serial numbers 
and such, replaced the ones I was to receive.
<P>
	The member across the way says that an inventory is regularly 
sent out to every member. We are to examine our office 
equipment and verify with our signatures that the material is 
there. An inventory dated September 13, 1993 was received, 
reviewed and I presume signed by the former member. However 
immediately after the election the same former member came 
into materiel management and stroked off any number of pieces 
that he had a number of excuses for not being there. That is only 
one month and a little after he originally verified the contents.
<P>
<B>(1835) </B>
<P>
	Even if the rules are there they are certainly not being 
enforced. In my case it was very obvious. I really could not 
understand why. Immediately after my election when the 
material was transferred and all this equipment was missing, I 
approached materiel management people and talked to them. I 
sensed a real hesitancy to do anything about it.
<P>
	I could not get anybody to get excited. They told me: ``It is 
going to take months to straighten this out. You better go out and 
refurnish your office because you are not going to get this back 
in time''. I had all kinds of excuses.
<P>
	The member says that if there is fraud, the rules are there. It 
will be punished. It will be followed up. How can fraud be 
established if nobody will do an investigation of the whole issue 
in the first place?
<P>
	I pursued with great vigour the material that was missing and 
did eventually receive some of it back from the former 
member's home in undamaged crates. However when I uncrated 
them a laser printer, for example, was badly damaged. It cost the 
taxpayers of Canada some $800 to repair and to put back into 
working order.
<P>
	I could go on and on. It made me very angry and overall it 
ended up costing me personally some $500 in legal costs to 
defend myself against the former member's legal action for 
slander. I approached again the House of Commons to provide 
some assistance and some support in that area and was turned 
down.
<P>
	Clearly if the rules are there they are not being enforced. I 
could not understand it. The longer I am here, the more and more 
I begin to understand it. It is an attitude around this place.
<P>
	When I recently entered my building on Wellington Street and 
inquired of the security person standing there if I might do 
something-it was something to do with some guests who were 
arriving-he said: ``You can do anything, sir. You are God 
around here''. That is the problem around here. There is not any 
accountability. That is the attitude that caused the materiel 
management people to hesitate to investigate the charges I was 
making.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="8466"> 8466 </A></B>
<P>
	It is an attitude that has members of the House pass rules and 
regulations around here that are never enforced. Members can 
walk through any building on the Hill and, in spite of the fact 
a rule was passed by this organization that smoking is not 
allowed in the buildings on the Hill, there is blue smoke wafting 
out of the offices because we are God around here. I find that 
unacceptable.
<P>
	What I did find encouraging, however, from this whole mess 
and when I was finished was that the person in charge of 
members' services, Mrs. Edna MacKenzie, when we discussed 
the whole situation approached me and asked if I might help her 
to develop some kind of a system-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. I am having some 
difficulty hearing the member who has the floor. I wonder if I 
might ask for the co-operation of members on both sides.
<P>
	Sometimes the mood of the House can change very quickly. It 
can be very good humoured one minute, even one second, and be 
something quite different shortly thereafter.
<P>
	I just caution us on making sure that we conclude the 
proceedings today in good humour but in as vigorous a debate as 
any member may wish. Ultimately we should maintain and 
respect the decorum of this place and each and every member.
<P>
<B>(1840 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chatters:</B> Mr. Speaker, as I was saying, in the process of 
trying to solve the mystery of the missing office equipment, I 
had a discussion with the newly appointed head of member 
services, Mrs. Edna MacKenzie, who asked if I would help and 
get involved to try and develop changes to the system that might 
prevent this very thing from happening again. I was pleased to 
hear that.
<P>
	This may not be perfect but it is certainly an attempt to 
address some of those concerns. I see a willingness on this side 
of the House and I heard a willingness on the part of the staff that 
runs this organization. I think the only thing missing is a serious 
willingness on the part of the government to take the initiative 
and do something to stop that. I think it is an extremely serious 
matter. I do not care if it was something as little as the lack of a 
transfer of a flag and pole which every MPs office in Canada has 
standing in it, which I did not receive.
<P>
	All the consumable items that I did not get when added 
together are a considerable amount of money. I think it is very 
serious and I would hope the government will also take it 
seriously and that we might do something to remedy this 
situation so it will not happen again.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> Mr. Speaker, in terms of the debate we have 
heard, I think we are in general agreement on this motion with 
the exception of some of the debate from across the floor.
<P>
	I think you will find unanimous consent for the following 
motion:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the question of furnishings, supplies and equipment in the 
constituency office and in the House of Commons office of every member of 
Parliament be referred to the Standing Committee on Procedure and House 
Affairs for consideration.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Mr. Speaker, the member has spoken to me 
about this and we are certainly happy to have the standing 
committee undertake a review of this matter.
<P>
	I hope that hon. members who indicated they had a problem 
will come to the committee and tell the committee about their 
problems because the committee will be interested to hear them. 
If there is something that can be done to rectify the problem, I 
am sure the committee will make the appropriate 
recommendations.
<P>
	Motion agreed to
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The time provided for 
consideration of Private Members' Business has now expired. 
Pursuant to Standing Order 96(1) the order is dropped from the 
Order Paper.

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">ADJOURNMENT PROCEEDINGS</H2>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 
deemed to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="TAXATION">TAXATION</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the Auditor General reports that corporations owe $2.9 billion in 
unpaid taxes to Revenue Canada for 1993.
<P>
	He also states: ``Clearly, reducing deficits through more 
effective tax collection is preferable to raising taxes. Taxes 
receivable are an important national asset and leaving them 
uncollected has a serious impact on the deficit''.
<P>
	The burden on the deficit of unpaid taxes and tax expenditures 
is overly represented by corporations and large businesses. I 
raise concern to the fact that $2.9 billion in unpaid tax is owing 
to this government. The federal government has a responsibility 
to ensure that money is paid back to the treasury it is due. 
Corporations owe 32 per cent of the unpaid taxes. Another 12 
per cent of unpaid taxes are from employers, that is business, 
who have not paid their payroll taxes. According to the Auditor 
General, the vast majority of accounts in arrears are less than 
one year old.
<P>
	The federal government must work toward recovering these 
delinquent accounts. This is only the first step. The government 
has a responsibility to close the present tax breaks and the tax 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8467"> 8467 </A></B>
<P>
loopholes provided to corporations and higher income 
Canadians. Why is it that a Canadian  with an income of 
$286,000 can reduce their tax rate to less than 10 per cent, while 
middle and lower income Canadians experience tax rates of 
close to one-third of their income? The tax system gives 
corporations and the wealthy big tax breaks and some are still 
not paying what they owe. This must be corrected.
<P>
<B>(1845) </B>
<P>
	The government must stand up to tax cheats and close tax 
loopholes. It must also undertake tax reform during their budget 
deliberations, not just cut social programs.
<P>
	Our economy has just been through some difficult times but 
not all corporations were in financial trouble. Many have turned 
healthy profits but do not pay their fair share of taxes.
<P>
	In his reply the Minister of National Revenue stated that 
companies and individuals are ``having a tough time after the 
recession''. This sympathy was not extended to unemployed 
Canadians who saw their unemployment insurance benefits 
slashed. Unemployed Canadians were also victims of the 
recession, yet they did not seem to have the government's 
sympathy.
<P>
	The government needs to place a tax on profits so that 
profitable corporations pay their fair share of taxes at a time 
when they are able to pay. The Auditor General identifies $37 
billion in tax expenditures, of which only $15 billion is RRSP 
related. The majority of Canadians with RRSPs are average 
Canadians who are preparing for their retirements and are, in 
effect, deferring income that will be taxable in the future. The 
rest of the tax expenditures are corporate write-offs.
<P>
	Why is the government not looking at ways to increase its 
revenue by eliminating some of the corporate tax expenditures 
and putting a cap on RRSP contributions from higher incomes?
<P>
	The tax system is in desperate need of reform. Corporations 
are not paying their fair share of taxes. The Liberal government 
has made it clear that cutting the deficit is a priority, yet it has 
not taken a serious look at increasing revenue from profitable 
corporations.
<P>
	The government has instead chosen to cut back on social 
programs. It is raising university students' tuitions, cutting 
money to seniors and cutting UI payments before it even 
considers making profitable corporations and the wealthy pay 
their fair share of taxes.
<P>
	The government also continues to give away money to 
profitable corporations. As a former businessman I respect the 
company wanting to make a profit, but why are corporations 
such as Royal Oak Mines, Rolls-Royce Canada and Bombardier 
also receiving millions of dollars in grants? The Chamber of 
Commerce receives $2.1 million.
<P>
	I am asking the government to get serious with the deficit by 
collecting the money owed by corporations and to reform the tax 
system to make it fair.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Susan Whelan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of National Revenue, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for 
Regina-Lumsden has asked when Revenue Canada is going to 
start paying more attention to collecting the approximately $3 
billion of unpaid corporate tax. He will be happy to hear that we 
are paying attention and taxes owing are being collected.
<P>
	I would like to clarify the amount owing by corporations. The 
hon. member indicated that approximately $3 billion is owed by 
corporations. In fact, the amount as reported by the Auditor 
General was $2.1 billion. Another $.8 billion was owed by 
employers who are not always corporations.
<P>
	The hon. member should know that at any given time some 
proportion of taxes assessed by Revenue Canada is outstanding. 
These taxes are not lost revenue. They represent taxes that have 
been assessed but not yet collected. In many cases they are owed 
by honest taxpayers who intend to pay and by businesses who 
are trying to recover from the recession. They do not represent 
an untapped source of funds for the government to apply against 
the deficit.
<P>
	These are accounts receivable which are already part of the 
government's fiscal plan. These moneys will be collected with 
interest, except where there are legitimate reasons to adjust the 
assessment. Less than 1 per cent of total gross revenues will be 
uncollectable as a result of insolvencies and bankruptcies.
<P>
	I would like to add that corporations are not given special 
privileges. In fact, unlike most taxpayers, large corporations are 
subject to an accelerated collection procedure. The Income Tax 
Act prohibits the immediate use of enforced collection measures 
for most categories of debt for 90 days from the notice of 
assessment date, with the exception of large corporations who 
must immediately pay one-half of the amount assessed.
<P>
	Revenue Canada's enforcement programs are based on a 
comprehensive strategy to encourage voluntary compliance to 
maximize the efficient and effective use of our enforcement 
resources.
<P>
	All members of the House, including my hon. friend from 
Regina-Lumsden, will recognize that the results of this 
strategy are impressive: 95 per cent of taxes owing are paid 
voluntarily and Revenue Canada's mandate is to preserve the tax 
base. The department has always been and continues to be 
absolutely committed to the highest level of compliance 
possible.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="GOVERNMENTAPPOINTMENTS">GOVERNMENT APPOINTMENTS</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, on Thursday of last week I rose to ask the Deputy 
Prime Minister about two recent appointments to the Senate and 
<P>

<B><A NAME="8468"> 8468 </A></B>
<P>
to offer a suggestion about what she, the Prime Minister and the 
Liberal government might do about the Senate in the future.
<P>
<B>(1850 ) </B>
<P>
	My remarks and the focus of my question were prompted by 
the government appointments earlier in the week of long-time 
Liberals, Ottawa's Jean-Robert Gauthier and New Brunswick's 
John Bryden. While I indicated that both may very well be very 
worthy appointments, I wanted to suggest that there is much 
more to this issue than the worthiness of the candidates.
<P>
	Canadians are looking for a change in the Senate itself. 
Canadians are looking for the government to take the necessary 
steps to either abolish the Senate or elect its members so that 
Parliament's second Chamber is accountable to the people of the 
country and not just to the Prime Minister who made the 
individual appointments.
<P>
	As long as the Prime Minister continues to appoint senators, 
the same old charge of patronage can be made. For Canadians 
the government of the day is seen to be just like all those who 
have gone before it. Once again the Prime Minister has seen fit 
to ignore the calls for Senate reform and instead has done as 
Mulroney did before him. He appointed his friends and 
supporters to the upper house.
<P>
	The Prime Minister is missing a great opportunity to correct 
years of abuse. Something different must be done as quickly as 
possible and only the Prime Minister is in a position to act today.
<P>
	About two years ago I attended a constitutional conference in 
Calgary at which ordinary individuals as well as experts from 
across western Canada participated in a discussion about the 
Senate and the future of democracy. I listened to a lot of debate 
about an elected Senate and even about proportional 
representation as the basis for the election, not only of the 
Senate but of the House of Commons as well.
<P>
	I say this to indicate that I am already aware that there is a 
great wealth of knowledge around the country that can be called 
on by any Prime Minister who really wants to do something to 
address Canadians' mounting distrust of governments, 
patronage and the Senate.
<P>
	The existing appointed and unaccountable Senate must be 
abolished. I can add that I also support replacing it with an 
elected Senate which is given more specific responsibilities and 
is accountable primarily to the regions. I realize that any reform 
of the Senate as we know it would require a constitutional 
change, accepted not only by this House and the provinces, but 
also by members of the Senate. We saw in the Charlottetown 
accord how difficult this is going to be. Therefore, there must be 
more than one way to abolish the Senate. I call on the Liberals 
across the way to take a bold, new initiative.
<P>
	In addition, Canadians are concerned about the country's 
mounting deficit and the federal government's desire to cut the 
deficit by cutting spending. It seems unfortunate the Liberals 
are telling Canadians that our nation can no longer afford social 
programs, but we can afford to continue to fill the Senate with 
political hacks.
<P>
	Many jobs will be lost in the public service this year because 
of cutbacks. Many ordinary Canadians will lose their jobs and 
others will not find jobs because existing ones in the public 
service will not be filled when they become vacant. The Liberals 
should do to the Senate what it is doing to the public service. 
When a vacancy occurs in the Senate, the Prime Minister should 
resist the political temptation to fill it and instead leave the 
position vacant. Over time, by attrition, the Senate will slowly 
abolish itself. It is certainly a better idea than continuing to 
appoint the party faithful who have no mandate or commitment 
to reforming the system.
<P>
	I ask the Liberal government to be bold and reform the Senate 
through attrition of its members.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is interesting to hear the member change his tune on 
the Senate. I can recall in the last Parliament when the GST was 
being debated his party moved a motion urging the Senate to 
defeat the GST bill. He voted for that motion. Unless he was 
absent that day, I am sure he did. His whole party supported it. It 
supported the Senate. It abandoned its longstanding policy of 
abolition of the Senate. Now I hear two of the members from that 
party squawking and complaining that really is not their policy. I 
wish the New Democratic Party would make up its mind.
<P>
	I would like to deal on a more serious note with the issues 
raised by the hon. member. What he is asking the Prime Minister 
to do is frankly silly. He is asking the Prime Minister to ignore 
one of the constituent parts of Parliament. He knows that 
Parliament is composed of three elements: the Crown, the House 
and the Senate. He wants the Prime Minister to ignore the Senate 
and not fill it so the Senate is left as a sort of floating group of 
people that are there that were there before. Gradually it will 
diminish and become less effective simply because its members 
are not appointed any more and there are a whole bunch of 
vacancies.
<P>
	Those left are still able to carry out all the functions of the 
Senate. One of the functions the Senate has is the right to review 
bills that are passed by this House. Indeed its concurrence is 
required on all bills passed by the House. The hon. member 
seems to have conveniently forgotten that. He is asking the 
Prime Minister to let a Tory rump in the Senate tell the House 
what it can do with its bills. I do not think any responsible Prime 
Minister could agree with such a thing.
<P>
	The Conservative Party in the House of Commons, as he 
knows, was almost wiped out in the last election. It has but two 
members who are rarely here because they have  other 
responsibilities apparently to try to rebuild the party. We are left 
trying 
<P>

<B><A NAME="8469"> 8469 </A></B>
<P>
to run the Government of Canada dealing with a Conservative 
majority in the Senate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solomon:</B> Let us abolish it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> The hon. member says abolish it. He knows 
perfectly well that requires the unanimous consent of the 
provinces. He also knows perfectly well that some of the 
provinces, particularly in his part of Canada, are opposed to 
abolition of the Senate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solomon:</B> Not Saskatchewan.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> I am glad to hear that. I am told that is not the 
case in Alberta nor is it the case in British Columbia. If one 
province blocks it that is the end of the initiative.
<P>
	The Prime Minister made the very wise promise when he was 
running in the election campaign in 1993 that he would not 
tinker with the Constitution of Canada. Canadians were sick and 
tired of constitutional tinkering. It cost us. It has almost broken 
our country up because of the tinkering of the former Prime 
Minister and his bumbling in that field. This Prime Minister has 
promised that he will deliver to Canadians what they want and 
that is anything but constitutional reform.
<P>
	We will not get into Senate reform because it requires a 
constitutional change. To suggest that we should make the 
Senate a weak link in the parliamentary chain by refusing to fill 
the vacancies is silly nonsense.
<P>
	The candidates that were put in the Senate this week are 
excellent candidates. They have excellent qualifications. The 
hon. member does a disservice when he refers to them as 
political hacks.
<P>
	The former member for Ottawa-Vanier served a 
distinguished career as a member of a school board. He has been 
a chiropractor for many years, having received his doctorate in 
the chiropractic in 1953. He worked as a chiropractor for many 
years before he was elected to Parliament and did some during 
the time he was here. He has been an excellent MP and a leader 
in his community. Surely someone with those qualifications is a 
worthy appointee to the Senate of Canada.
