<A NAME="LINK3">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK4"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Martin Cauchon (for the Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration)</B> moved that Bill C-16, an act respecting Canadian 
citizenship, be read the second time and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK5"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am proud 
to have this opportunity on behalf of the Minister of Citizenship 
and Immigration to open debate on Bill C-16, the citizenship of 
Canada act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To me and to so many Canadians from whom I have heard, 
citizenship is about truly belonging to this society.  It is 
anchored in allegiance to the values which Canadians share.  It 
is a concept with real meaning and it is a proud celebration of 
what it means to be Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That makes citizenship far more than just a piece of paper, more 
than just some box to be checked off on a form, more than a 
convenience for international travel.  It makes the law on 
citizenship one of our most fundamental laws.  Our citizenship 
law sets the ground rules for those who can truly call themselves 
Canadian.  It captures the common understanding among Canadians 
about what it means to be one of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1947 a Liberal government introduced the status of Canadian 
citizenship in law for the first time.  It was a legislative 
initiative driven by the vision and energy of Mr. Paul Martin Sr. 
We were the first country in the Commonwealth to take that step. 
That 1947 act took us through a 30 year period of immense change 
in Canadian society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1977, with Robert Andras as Minister of Manpower and 
Immigration, the Liberal government implemented a new Citizenship 
Act.  That law reflected a growing sense of nationhood.  It 
reflected the growing equality of women under the law.  It drew 
on Canada's experience with our first Canadian Citizenship Act. 
That act has served us well over the past two decades of even 
faster evolution in our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the time has come for change, for modernization.  The 
time has come for an act that fully recognizes the impact of the 
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.  The time has come for 
an act that addresses the many legal questions and administrative 
issues that have emerged with experience over time.  The time has 
come for an act that reinforces the value of Canadian 
citizenship.  Bill C-16 does that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, let me point out that our core citizenship principles 
have stood the test of time.  What Canadians thought citizenship 
should mean in 1947 is substantially what Canadians still think 
today.  Children born in Canada will still be Canadian citizens 
automatically.  Children born in other countries to a parent who 
was born in Canada still have a right to Canadian citizenship. 
Those who come to Canada later in life must be permanent 
residents before they can apply for citizenship.  They still must 
prove their attachment to Canada.  They must prove their 
knowledge of our society and our values.  They must prove their 
knowledge of at least one of our two official languages. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would remind members that the former Minister of Citizenship 
and Immigration introduced Bill C-63 during the last 
parliamentary session. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1010"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT1"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was intended as both an attempt to modernize the Citizenship 
Act and to enhance the value of Canadian citizenship.  It died 
on the order paper when the House was prorogued, but not before 
being the object of much discussion in this House and in 
committee. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is substantially similar in its intent and its major 
provisions to Bill C-63.  It reflects the broad consensus that 
was clear in debate last time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, this legislation is not identical to the bill which was 
before us in the last session.  We have not simply slapped a new 
number on an old bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me cover some of the major changes.  For example, while we 
still intend to strengthen the residency requirement, we have 
identified room for change in how the residency requirement can 
be met.  Under this bill a permanent resident will have to be 
physically in Canada for at least three of the six years before 
applying for citizenship; not just an address, not visiting other 
countries for whatever reason, but physically present here. 
However, we have lengthened the period of time that people can 
use to count that physical presence from five years under Bill 
C-63 to six years in this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have also decided to reinstate a time credit for physical 
presence for people who had some other legal status in Canada 
other than that of a permanent resident.  For example, someone 
who was initially here as a convention refugee, on a minister's 
permit or as a visitor will be able to use half of their time 
under that status for up to one of the three years they need to 
meet the residency requirement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have already made it clear that we want to give children 
adopted abroad much simpler access to Canadian citizenship.  The 
courts have told us that we must bring down the disparities 
between adopted and biological children born abroad, and we want 
to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we also want to respond to concerns raised about 
previous proposals.  For example, we will clearly limit 
citizenship through adoption to minors only.  We will make new 
rules retroactive to 1977.  We will include a requirement which 
will ensure that an adoption is in the best interests of the 
child. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me turn to some other changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We still propose a new citizenship oath, slightly modified from 
the previous proposal.  New citizens will swear to respect our 
rights and freedoms.  They will promise to uphold the values of 
our democracy.  They will continue to swear allegiance to Canada 
and to Her Majesty the Queen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will alter the proposed powers of annulment and revocation. 
While we still want to be able to annul the citizenship of a 
person who uses a false identity or who is involved in criminal 
activities under our citizenship law, we have dropped the 
requirement in Bill C-63 that a person wishing to oppose the 
minister's intent to annul is restricted to doing so in writing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also intend to make it clear that we can only revoke the 
citizenship of a person who knowingly sought to deceive us. 
Moreover, we will not seek to revoke the citizenship of children 
at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all those significant changes it is important to underline 
that the major new directions to citizenship law that our 
government set out in 1998 are still valid.  They are still in 
this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We still intend to limit the number of generations of people 
born outside Canada who can claim Canadian citizenship and we 
still propose to clarify the conditions for those people to 
formally retain Canadian citizenship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We continue to believe that moving citizenship decision making 
from a quasi-judicial process to one that is administrative makes 
sense in every way.  We intend to support that change by the use 
of clear and consistent criteria and tests.  We intend to rely 
mostly on citizenship officials to carry out that process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see continuous roles for today's citizenship judges, men and 
women who, by this bill, will be known as citizenship 
commissioners. 
They will have an increased role in promoting active citizenship 
in the community.  They will advise the minister on citizenship 
issues and continue to preside over citizenship ceremonies.  They 
will be ambassadors of citizenship in their communities.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill retains the proposals for streamlined review processes 
for people who want to challenge decisions.  If the person thinks 
that there has been a simple error of fact, then he or she will 
be able to apply to the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration 
for a review of those facts in that decision.  If the person 
thinks there has been an error of interpretation under law, he or 
she will be able to apply to the Federal Court of Canada for a 
review. Under the new system a federal court judge can require 
that it be reconsidered. All those proposals are still in this 
bill because they are sound and appropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me conclude my remarks with these comments.  The history of 
citizenship in Canada is one of evolution and yet enduring 
principles too.  The 1947 act was anchored in its time. It 
reflected the relative status of men and women in those days. It 
reflected a world in which we saw our closest links to other 
lands in which people were British subjects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By 1977 the evolution of life in Canadian society meant it was 
time for modernization.  The 1977 act removed many inequities in 
the old act.  It brought in more consistent and equal criteria 
for citizenship.  It recognized that women deserved treatment and 
rights to citizenship that were no different from those enjoyed 
by men. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this new millennium we need an act that is even more 
modernized, more streamlined, clearer and more consistent. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill meets those requirements.  The new Canada Citizenship 
Act being debated today is going to enhance the value of 
Canadian citizenship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is going to modernize our Citizenship Act, modernize 
our processes.  It is going to integrate the changes our society 
has undergone, as well as our modern legislative framework and 
our governmental processes. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will remain true to the fundamental elements of what we 
understand citizenship to mean.  The principles at the heart of 
our citizenship law have endured over more than half a century 
since the Hon. Paul Martin Sr. brought in Canada's first Canada 
Citizenship Act in 1946. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the leadership of the Right Hon. William Lyon Mackenzie 
King, Canada had just proven its status as a country equal to any 
other on the globe.  Canadians had fought as Canadians to 
liberate Europe from the evil of Nazi aggression.  Other 
Canadians had fought in Asia and the Pacific to defend our values 
and our interests. Here at home Canadians had contributed in many 
ways to the war effort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The creation of a unique citizenship to call our own was a 
fitting way to capture what our country and our people had just 
accomplished.  It was a fitting way for Canada to give its people 
a sense of belonging rooted in this land and its people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians by birth and Canadians by choice all did their part to 
earn our place on the world stage back then.  They all became 
citizens of this great country in 1947 for the first time ever. 
Canadians by birth and Canadians by choice are doing the same 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The citizenship of Canada act will be about the values we share 
as were its predecessors. It will be a statement about belonging 
to this country as were its predecessors.  It will link us all, 
whether we are Canadian by birth or by choice. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some 350,000 babies are born in this country every year, and 
some 160,000 people apply for Canadian citizenship.  Our 
Citizenship Act enables more than half a million people to 
become part of the great Canadian family as equals, as 
Canadians. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A new citizenship law will be a fitting way to help celebrate 
the new millennium.  We look forward to the support of the House 
on Bill C-16.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am 
very happy to talk about Bill C-16 which will replace the current 
Citizenship Act, if and when it passes.  There are some things 
about the bill which I support and others which I do not and I 
will get into that during my presentation.  However there are 
other issues which have to be mentioned today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a clear error in judgment on the part of the government to 
bring in legislation to replace the current Citizenship Act 
before legislation which will overhaul the Immigration Act has 
been passed by the House. The government has been saying for the 
last four years in particular but really for the six years since 
I have been here in Ottawa that it is going to bring forward 
legislation which will provide a massive overhaul of the 
Immigration Act immediately, next year.  The government always 
says it will be later this year or next year but this has been 
going on for six years.  It has not happened and it is very hard 
to explain why. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Citizenship Act changes should not come in until the changes 
to the Immigration Act are made.  The Citizenship Act refers to 
the Immigration Act in several places. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will talk about the unfortunate order of events and why this 
has happened.  The government does not seem to be willing to make 
the necessary tough decisions to change the Immigration Act so it 
has gone ahead with changes to the Citizenship Act so it can say 
it has done something.  I understand that but I do not think it 
is acceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague opposite has said, citizenship is something we 
are all extremely proud of.  Canadian citizenship is seen by many 
people around the world as something they would like.  Many 
people cherish the thought of becoming a Canadian citizen. It is 
not only Canadians who see Canadian citizenship as something of 
great value, as I know all Canadians do; others would like to 
become Canadian citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we put in place a new citizenship act, which this bill will 
do, it is important that it is done right. The government 
presented Bill C-63 in the last parliament, which was its idea of 
doing it right.  The government dropped that legislation because 
it was so flawed and the government could not see putting it 
through. That became very clear in committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-16 is the government's response to the problems seen in 
committee.  This is good, except the government has not dealt 
with a lot of the problems which were pointed out again and again 
in committee.  I will talk about some of those things. I cannot 
pretend I am going to touch on all of them but I will focus on 
three or four of the main areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We went through the whole committee process on Bill C-63 in the 
last parliament.  Witnesses suggested many changes. Many 
excellent suggestions were made.  The government listened to a 
few but not nearly enough of them.  That is not acceptable for an 
act which governs something as important as citizenship, 
something which we are all so proud of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would love to see a citizenship bill which I could support. 
This is not it, unless changes are made at committee which would 
make it something Canadians and I could support. It is not that 
important what I support as one citizen, but it is important that 
the Canadian public generally support the legislation.  I do not 
believe this legislation is something that Canadians can support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is the second attempt and there have been some 
changes, a few changes which are beneficial but not that many. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With reference to the previous legislation, I want to make it 
extremely clear that it was not only witnesses but members of the 
immigration committee which reviewed that legislation who pointed 
out very strong concerns with Bill C-63, the predecessor to Bill 
C-16. They expressed their desire for change.

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few changes were implemented, but very few.  In fact, there 
were only three changes from Bill C-63 to Bill C-16, yet the 
government dropped Bill C-63 because it was flawed.  I do not 
understand why it did not fix the bill before it brought it back 
as Bill C-16.  The bill has been re-tabled, and I say re-tabled 
because there have been only three or four changes made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some good changes.  For example my colleague from 
Dewdney—Alouette can express some claim to victory for the 
change that was proposed at committee by the Mennonite community. 
It requested that the new law contain measures to facilitate the 
acquisition of Canadian citizenship for the people in its 
community who still wished to return to the country or who had 
already done so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In essence clause 57 allows a three year period for individuals 
born to Canadian parents outside of Canada between 1947 and 1977 
to acquire Canadian citizenship upon application.  Members of the 
Mennonite community explained that very well at committee.  It 
was supported by the member for Dewdney—Alouette.  That is a 
good change.  That is a committee working as it should. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One other change is that the part of Bill C-63 which allowed 
bureaucrats or the minister without approval of parliament to 
redefine spouse has been withdrawn from the bill.  A couple of 
weeks ago when I saw this bill I thought that was a positive 
move.  That was something my colleagues and I called for quite 
strongly during the debate on Bill C-63.  It was something some 
Liberal members on the committee called for.  It was withdrawn 
and I thought we had made some progress. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then last week Bill C-23 was tabled in the House but not in a 
way that is acceptable.  I then understood why that clause was 
taken out of the citizenship bill.  It was no longer required as 
a result of the omnibus bill which would give same sex benefits 
in several pieces of legislation.   The modernization of benefits 
and obligations act tabled by the justice minister amends 68 
federal statutes, affects 20 departments and agencies and extends 
benefits to same sex couples on the same basis as common law 
opposite sex couples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has chosen to extend benefits based on a person's 
private sexual activity while excluding other types of dependent 
relationships.  I fail to see why it would do that.  Why would it 
extend these benefits on the basis of sexual activity rather than 
on a relationship of dependency?  That is exactly what has 
happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The change was made to the citizenship bill which took the power 
away from civil servants or the minister to make a change.  That 
was the right thing to do.  The government has brought the 
changes it is proposing to deal with that before parliament, 
which is the right thing to do.  However it has been done in a 
way that is unacceptable to Canadians.  It has been done on the 
basis of sexual activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Former Liberal Prime Minister Trudeau said that the government 
had no place in the bedrooms of the nation yet that is what Bill 
C-23 does.  The official opposition believes that any discussion 
of extending benefits should be accompanied by an affirmation of 
the definition of marriage.

<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was no definition of marriage in Bill C-63.  Was that too 
much to ask for?  An opposition day motion was passed in the 
House with support from all political parties which ensured that 
the current definition of marriage would be retained, yet the 
government has not seen fit to have that included in this new 
act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point that out that the unacceptable part of the citizenship 
bill, the former Bill C-63, was taken out, but it has not been 
properly dealt with in this new citizenship bill.  It is way off 
target.  That debate is taking place in the House as we debate 
Bill C-23.  I will not go into it in any great depth.  The 
problem has not been solved.  It has been shuffled off to another 
piece of legislation and the response by the government has been 
inappropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues and I have talked and will talk about that in 
great depth as we debate that piece of legislation. That is a 
positive thing that is not included in this bill.  The reason for 
it not being included does not leave me with a very positive 
feeling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will get into more particulars about the bill, but I want to 
talk a little more about something I mentioned at the beginning 
of my speech. It is unfortunate that the citizenship legislation 
came before the House before those major changes were made to the 
Immigration Act.  It is clearly in the wrong order.  The changes 
to the Immigration Act may well require more changes to the 
Citizenship Act in the very near future. It is in the wrong order 
because the Citizenship Act does refer to the broader, more 
encompassing Immigration Act in several areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Beyond that, there are so many reasons that the Immigration Act 
changes should be before the House today rather than the 
Citizenship Act.  There are serious issues facing Canadians today 
regarding immigration. These issues have been pointed out by 
Canadians across the country, and certainly by us here, but there 
has been no response to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been recognized by various parties, including CSIS, the 
RCMP and American officials who recognize and talk about the 
problem, that Canada is a haven for terrorists and criminals and 
is a favourite destination for people smugglers.  Is that 
something that makes us proud to be Canadian?  I do not think so. 
It is something that points out the need for changes to the 
Immigration Act, changes which should have come before this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Polls show that immigration has become one of the top concerns 
for Canadians today.  They want it fixed.  Why is it not being 
fixed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farrell Research reports 71% of greater Vancouver residents 
believe the refugee system is too lax and 76% believe that Canada 
has been made an easy target for people smuggling.  That is no 
big surprise.  Canadians across the country feel like that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Additionally, in 1998 an Environics survey revealed that 69% of 
Canadians agree that many people seeking asylum in Canada are not 
real refugees.  That has been borne out by some of the things we 
have seen over the past year where even the refugee determination 
system has determined that many people making claims are not 
genuine refugees.  Unfortunately, many are finding their way into 
our country anyway.  Even if they are not accepted they are 
allowed to stay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our formal acceptance rate for refugees is 44% which is more 
than double and triple other countries that are comparable to 
Canada, like the United States, Australia and New Zealand. 
Forty-four per cent is high, but our acceptance rate is more 
like 80%.  I have explained that in committee and there is no 
argument, even from officials.  Only 20% of those who claim 
refugee status are actually ever known to leave the country. That 
means that the other 80% are allowed to stay. 
Many just abandon their cases, withdraw their cases or are 
refused status and just stay in the country.  The end result is 
the same:  They are allowed to stay in our country, illegally in 
many cases. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1035"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have an effective acceptance rate of 80%.  The 44% who are 
chosen through the system are, hopefully, genuine refugees. 
However, the other 36% who make up the 80% are not.  Clearly they 
are not because they have never been accepted.  Many have been 
rejected by our system and yet they are allowed to stay.  So in 
effect we have that 80%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The refugee determination system is badly broken.  Why was this 
not dealt with before the Citizenship Act was presented to 
parliament so the Citizenship Act would be based on and fit in 
with or mesh with an Immigration Act which has been overhauled? 
Canadians recognize the need for that.  The government recognizes 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For four years now the government has been saying “Maybe this 
year or next year we will bring in major changes to the 
Immigration Act. It has really been saying this for six years but 
it has been an open promise for the last four years.  Not one 
change has been made.  It is completely unacceptable that this 
would be put forward now before those changes are made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another side of the Immigration Act that demonstrates 
very well that our system is not working.  People who come under 
the independent categories have to wade through a bureaucracy 
that is unimaginable.  They have to go through a process that can 
take up to two and a half to three years, and many times much 
longer.  Often the process takes so long that people who are 
needed in this country by businesses and by the country, people 
who will add to our economy immediately, give up.   They go to 
the United States, to Australia or somewhere else because the 
process there works a lot better.  That is unfortunate because we 
are losing good people.  Why was that not fixed before we got to 
the citizenship bill?  It is very unfortunate that it was not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard dozens and dozens, probably hundreds, which is not 
an exaggeration, of heart-rending stories of families begging to 
be reunited that just cannot be reunited.  These are families of 
people who have qualified under the independent categories. They 
will add to our economy right away.  Of course they want to bring 
their husbands or wives and their dependent children.  Who would 
not want that?  Canada would expect that would happen.  Often, 
even after they are accepted, it takes years and years to reunify 
the family.  That is shameful.  It causes uncalled for pain. Once 
somebody is accepted as an immigrant, why on earth would the 
process to bring their families in not be almost immediate?  Why 
would it not be a matter of a few months not years?  Commonly and 
most often it takes years.  Why is that not fixed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at an example.  Let us talk about Leticia Cables, a 
nanny who was taking sanctuary in a church in Edmonton.  She is a 
Filipino nanny who worked hard and was honest but who is 
presently being deported by the government.  She is being forced 
out of this country by this government right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the one hand, we have an unquestionably hardworking and 
honest nanny who made a mistake but who will be given no 
consideration by this minister to allow her to stay.  That is 
shameful.  On the other hand, we have a Honduran who has been 
arrested 20 times for drug trafficking, as I have heard from the 
hon. member for North Vancouver, who is in our country illegally. 
He is allowed to stay and has been set free.  Does that make any 
sense? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where is the good management of this government?  Where is the 
good judgment of this government? 
This is the government that will not allow this nanny to stay. 
She admits that she broke a rule but that she did not know she 
had done wrong.  Why are we not giving her special consideration 
when 1,300 criminals in 1998 were granted ministerial permits to 
stay in this country?  Of those 1,300 criminals, 350 were violent 
offenders, murderers and rapists.  Those 350 criminals were 
allowed to stay under ministerial permit, but the minister will 
not give this nanny a permit to stay in this country.  She is 
chasing her out.  For what?  The nanny broke a rule.  I do not 
believe she knew she was breaking the rule.  She said that she 
was given the advice by one of her employers who was a lawyer and 
someone she trusted, yet this minister is chasing her out.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where are the precedents of the government when it comes to 
immigration?  Why does it not fix that up?  It could then fix up 
the Citizenship Act, because I agree that it needs fixing as 
well.  I cannot go on any longer about the problems with the 
Immigration Act as we are dealing with the Citizenship Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  More, more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit:</B>  Some hon. members call for more, 
Madam Speaker.  I could go on all day pointing out how 
nonfunctional our immigration system is in the area of refugee 
determination and in the area of independent immigrants being 
allowed to come to our country and reuniting very quickly with 
their families.  It is a broken system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will get back to the citizenship bill that we are debating 
today.  We should be debating changes to the Immigration Act.  I 
would be happy to do that.  I am ready for it.  Canadians think 
it is many years overdue, but here we are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will talk specifically about three different areas of the 
citizenship bill.  The first is clause 6(1)(b) in relation to 
residency.  This was an area where there were a lot of concerns 
expressed at committee.  I know my colleague, the hon. member for 
Dewdney—Alouette and my other colleague from Calgary, who were 
both on the committee at times throughout the debate on this 
bill, know that there was a lot of concern expressed about 
residency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The intent was good.  Bill C-16 defines the term permanent 
resident more concisely than does the current act. The existing 
legislation may be loosely interpreted.  Some individuals have 
been found to be residing in Canada because they have a bank 
account here or own property in the country without actually 
having ever lived in Canada.  Redefining that is good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-16 calls for 1,095 days, or three years, physical 
presence in Canada before someone is eligible to apply for 
citizenship.  However, Bill C-16 does not provide any mechanism 
for determining when applicants arrive in Canada or when they 
leave, nor is there any intention to develop one.  The proposed 
change is a good idea and I support that change, but there is no 
way expressed, or in fact even in testimony from the various 
civil servants who appeared before the committee, of plans to 
enforce the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is of great concern to me when the government puts forth law 
that cannot be enforced.  It admitted to that.  I have several 
quotes here.  I will not read them all because I have a few pages 
of quotes from witnesses at committee, including the civil 
servants who deal in this area, where they admit that, no, they 
cannot really enforce it.  One quote says that they will enforce 
it when they really want to.  In other words, this allows them to 
target people they want to target, but it will not ensure that 
people really have had physical presence in the country three 
years out of six.  A physical presence in the country for three 
years out of six is a good idea.  I think that is an appropriate 
goal, but that is all it is in here, a goal, because there is no 
way of really enforcing it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister of immigration at the time, on March 3, 1999, 
expressed the following: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our primary goal is to ensure that people who obtain Canadian 
citizenship have a deep commitment to their adopted country.  We 
believe that such a commitment is possible only if the person is 
physically present in the country. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that makes sense.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand that many newcomers need to travel extensively, 
either for business or personal reasons.  Many maintain strong 
economic and social links with their countries of origin and 
Canada benefits from these links.  That is why, in Bill C-16, we 
provide these permanent residents with the flexibility to travel 
outside the country by extending the period during which they 
need to meet the physical requirements.  It has been extended to 
six years now, three years out of six.  I believe that is a fair 
accommodation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is important because we are truly part of a global economy. 
That is a huge advantage for Canada because we have people from 
almost every country in the world who speak the languages of 
probably all countries on the face of the earth.  It is great for 
doing business.  They know the culture.  They can speak the 
language.  It gives us an incredible advantage over many nations 
that do not have that diversity.  This is a good change.  The 
intent is good, but why do we have a law that we cannot enforce? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This change is in response to a committee report from 1994. That 
is a six year time lag.  In the committee report of 1994 the 
government dominated Standing Committee on Citizenship and 
Immigration recognized the problem being dealt in this clause in 
point 6 on page 12 of the report where it says that residency 
should be defined in the new act so as to require physical 
presence in the country on an application for citizenship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, my main concern is that the very next recommendation in 
the same report, recommendation No. 7, states that measures 
should be introduced to enable accurate monitoring of the periods 
of time that permanent residents are absent from Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That government dominated report recognized not only the need 
for the change but the need to be able to enforce the law. 
Unfortunately it is not there.  I have pages of quotes.  I know I 
cannot go through them all today, but I have some quotes to which 
I will refer.  The member opposite has expressed an interest in 
hearing more, so I will certainly give a little more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Greg Fyffe, assistant deputy minister of policy and program 
development, when questioned by me and others at committee on how 
he was going to monitor the physical presence, said that it was 
obviously a serious concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Norman Sabourin, director of citizenship and citizenship 
registrar, during the same meeting agreed with Mr. Fyffe when he 
said that there was no question that without any regimented 
border controls in place in Canada there would always be a 
challenge in assessing whether or not a person was in Canada. Mr. 
Sabourin claimed that the department had developed a lot of 
expertise in assessing documentary evidence that supported and 
outlined whether or not a person was in Canada.  These include 
passports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of passports, how many people who cross the border, for 
example from Canada to the United States, ever have a passport? 
Of course a non-Canadian will have one, but how many have them 
stamped?  I have travelled to about half a dozen countries in the 
last four years and only once had my passport stamped, and that 
is when I asked to have it stamped.  The passport is not a very 
reliable document to use when trying to determine physical 
presence in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Sabourin went on to explain some other methods the 
department would require individuals to employ in order to verify 
whether they are physically present in Canada.  They include 
whether or not a person has been attending school or has been in 
a job, or whether or not someone can vouch for that fact.  There 
is some merit to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Sabourin, the departmental official, explained how they 
would monitor physical presence by saying that finally, and maybe 
the most important part of equation, they have in place a quality 
assurance program which allows them to verify the quality and 
integrity of information provided by applicants.  As part of this 
program they randomly target applicants to verify the information 
they provided and to explore in detail whether or not the 
information is accurate.   They are also able to develop profiles 
based on indicators of certain types of applicants who might be 
less enthusiastic than others in providing a complete picture of 
their presence in Canada. 
It concerns me that this clause will allow the department to 
target certain types of applicants.

<A HREF="#LINKT9"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It appears that the department will be picking the types, 
stereotyping, and relying on luck in many cases to implement the 
change which it feels is so important and which I believe is so 
important.  I contend that based on the promise of random quality 
assurances that nothing is in place to allow this physical 
presence to be properly monitored.  I have to skip over the rest 
of my commentary on that clause.  There are other valid points 
that should be made but I understand that time is limited. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another concern is the area of retroactivity.  People who have 
applied under the current Citizenship Act will be made to meet 
the law set out in the new citizenship act when it is passed. 
That type of retroactivity is not acceptable.  Subclause 55(2) 
stipulates that when the application has made its way to the 
point where a citizenship judge is considering it, the 
application will be considered under the old act.  The department 
has stated that processing time may vary between eight and twelve 
months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we have been informed that the real processing time is 
more like 17 months under the current act.  There should not be 
two different paths that applications follow depending strictly 
on the speed with which the department currently processes. 
People will be penalized if the department has stalled their 
application, or if it is moving slowly through the process for 
whatever reason.  People should not be penalized and made to 
qualify under the new act just because they have not reached the 
final stage where a judge is about to declare them citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is very unusual under law and I do not think it is 
appropriate under this law.  One Liberal member of the committee, 
the member for Scarborough Southwest, stated on April 28, 1999, 
in relation to this clause that he took the position of the 
traditional historic pattern of the Liberal Party of not having 
retroactive legislation.  If this citizenship law passes as it 
is, as he understood it, notwithstanding that someone has been 
making his plans in anticipation of the law as it currently 
exists he will lose his one year credit and will have to wait for 
no apparent reason other than the change in law to apply for 
Canadian citizenship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To him that is retroactivity; it is taking away from people who 
have relied on an existing law and it is un-Liberal, whatever 
that means.  That came from a member of the Liberal Party at the 
committee who showed great concern about this clause.  Generally 
the committee did not like it and here we have it again in Bill 
C-16. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other penalties which are of concern relate to bureaucratic 
delays as well.  This is the last point I will to talk about 
today because I see that my time is drawing to a close.  People 
being punished for bureaucratic delays concerns me.  It is 
something that is unacceptable.  It is something which is in this 
bill.  It is allowed to happen as a result of this bill in 
different areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Subsection 6(1)(b)(i) of the current act allows individuals who 
claim refugee status to count each full day of residency in 
Canada from the date of application as a half day toward the 
total needed for a citizenship application.  If there is a delay 
for whatever reason in getting the application through then a 
half day credit will be allowed toward residency in Canada.  That 
will be completely taken away under the current bill.  If there 
are bureaucratic delays, under the bill no time will be granted. 
People will be punished for the time it takes the civil service 
to deal with the application. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore refugees who want to become citizens will be punished 
because of the slow process of the bureaucracy.  Does that make 
any sense? 
We and several other witnesses have called for leaving in place 
something like what is under the current act.  If the process is 
slowed down by the bureaucracy, at least part of that time will 
be considered to be time when the applicant is physically present 
in Canada because the person is physically present in Canada. 
That makes sense.  Many witnesses said that it made sense, but we 
do not find that change in the legislation.  To me that is a 
great concern which must be fixed.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I have several other areas I will talk about in future readings 
of the bill.  My colleagues will talk about some of the changes 
they want to see in the bill.  We presented many of these 
arguments when Bill C-63 was before the House.  We heard many of 
the same arguments from witnesses at committee.  The government 
heard some of them.  It did not deal with them very well, 
particularly in terms of residency, but it heard them.  Maybe we 
can fix them in committee but many of them have not even been 
acknowledged by changes in the new piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For that reason I cannot support the legislation.  I cannot 
speak for all my colleagues, but I believe they are unlikely to 
support this piece of legislation unless we get some of the key 
changes required to make it a good piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want a new citizenship act.  The old one is outdated.  Does 
the new piece of legislation provide for a new citizenship act 
that will work for Canadians and for people who are aspiring to 
become Canadians?  No, I do not believe it does.  For that reason 
we will not be supporting this piece of legislation but I 
certainly look forward to the arguments, the discussion presented 
by all opposition parties and by the government in the House and 
at committee.  Hopefully we can make some changes that will make 
it work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what I am looking for.  It is not a bill that should be 
partisan.  I do not believe that it will be treated as a partisan 
piece of legislation.  We are talking about Canadian citizenship. 
We all feel the same about Canadian citizenship.  We take the 
same pride in Canadian citizenship.  We realize what a valuable

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Hélène Alarie (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, yesterday the 
Standing Committee on Human Resources Development and the Status 
of Persons with Disabilities made short work of the Prime 
Minister's simplistic line about the financial problem at Human 
Resources Development Canada being limited to $250. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why then did the Liberal majority not go along with the opposition 
parties' suggestions to call as witnesses Mel Cappe, the Clerk 
of the Privy Council; the President of the Treasury Board; Denis 
Desautels, the Auditor General of Canada; John Reid, the 
Commissioner of Access to Information; and Mr. Martin, the 
Director of Internal Audit at Human Resources Development 
Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the committee were unanimous that there should be an 
in-depth investigation into all grant programs at Human Resources 
Development Canada. Quite a comedown for the Prime Minister, who 
is irresponsibly suggesting that the crisis involves nothing 
more than a few small amounts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a shame that the Liberal majority refused to follow through 
on its logic and rejected the Bloc Quebecois proposal to call 
the Minister for International Trade and the Prime Minister as 
witnesses.  The biggest culprits are being allowed to wash their 
hands of the scandal for which they are responsible.

Mr. Speaker, this month I was a presenter at the prestigious 
O'Brien Awards for excellence in the sport of harness racing in 
Canada.  It once again showcased the superstars of our sport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the dust had settled, the lightning-quick Blissful Hall 
paced away with the Horse of the Year Award.  His outspoken, 
opinionated, colourful trainer, Ben Wallace, garnered a much 
deserved Trainer of the Year Award. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real story of the night was the emergence of a new superstar 
in the driving ranks.  Canada has produced the greatest drivers 
in the history of harness racing, from Joe O'Brien to Keith 
Waples to John Campbell, and now a new young lion called Chris 
Christoforou, who won over 600 races and over $6 million in 1999, 
both Canadian records.  Chris learned his lessons well from his 
father, Chris Sr.  Harness racing knows that this young man is 
ready, willing and certainly able to race through the home 
stretch to victory for the great Canadian sport of harness 
racing.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of many individuals in 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough who are concerned by the 
proposals being considered by the Department of Fisheries and 
Oceans to solarize lighthouses in the area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only is solarization expensive, unnecessary and ineffective, 
it begs the question, why convert cabled lighthouses to solar? 
We have already witnessed the removal of horns, buoys and backup 
diesel motor systems as cost cutting measures, to the detriment 
of ocean safety.  Blankets of fog in places like the Strait of 
Canso often render solar lighthouses ineffective.  A rush to 
alter equipment and automation is dangerous and haste could cost 
lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fishermen are deeply concerned with the prospect of losing these 
lighthouses by converting them to a solar operation.  The most 
immediate threat is to lighthouses in Cranberry; however, 
Whitehead and Eddie Point could soon be targeted upon the 
completion of the Cranberry transformation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans to seriously weigh 
the safety concerns of the fishermen most directly affected by 
these proposed changes.  I urge the minister to reconsider all 
plans to further downgrade and denigrate these historical and 
practical lighthouses in the province.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday when asked about $640,000 jobs grants in her 
riding in November, the HRD minister told parliament: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>...when I became Minister...I delegated the authority for 
approvals in my riding to my deputy minister. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet access to information reveals that in November the minister 
alone had authority for approvals.  I invite the minister to 
explain this latest discrepancy. 
<P><A NAME="LINK42"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to confirm again that I 
wrote to my deputy and indicated that she would be the sole 
decision maker in terms of projects that were approved in the 
riding of Brant. 
<P><A NAME="LINK43"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the minister is confirming that the information she 
provides through access to information is not reliable.  Can she 
tell the House why she does not provide reliable information 
through access? 
<P><A NAME="LINK44"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, what I can confirm is that I made it very 
clear I would not be approving grants and contributions in the 
riding of Brant.  I indicated that the deputy minister would be 
doing so, and I did that by letter. 
<P><A NAME="LINK45"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, there is a document which she provided to an access 
request headed “Delegation of Authority”.  There is a column 
that says approval of proposal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has full authority and everyone else listed in the 
column has no authority at all.  If the minister has evidence to 
show that this document is reliable then she should table it 
immediately, and I ask her to do so. 
<P><A NAME="LINK46"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, if it pleases the House, I would be glad, 
when it is translated and in accordance with the rules of the 
House, to table the letter to the deputy. 
<P><A NAME="LINK47"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, as my colleague has outlined, yesterday the human 
resources minister confirmed that the Canada jobs fund grants 
were approved for her riding last November despite the fact it 
did not qualify, and yet she said: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—what I will confirm is that when I became Minister of Human 
Resources Development Canada I delegated the authority for 
approvals in my riding to my deputy minister. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was presumably last summer.  The chart obtained through 
access to information by the official opposition clearly disputes 
this because it says that as of November only the minister had 
approval for those grants.  Why is there a discrepancy? 
<P><A NAME="LINK48"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, there are a number of things to which the 
hon. member makes reference.  Let me clarify that indeed the 
riding of Brant did qualify for Canada jobs funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things I would also like to do, perhaps at the end of 
question period, is table the terms and conditions of the two 
programs on which we have been focusing:  the transitional jobs 
fund which came into vogue in 1996 and ended in 1999 and the 
Canada jobs fund which began in 1999.  I think that would provide 
assistance to the opposition. 
<P><A NAME="LINK49"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, what we have here is a very clear discrepancy between 
what the minister said yesterday in the House and what she is 
claiming today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that she claims when she took over the job of the 
human resources development department, which was last summer, 
she instructed by letter, according to what she says today, that 
the deputy could approve those grants.  The information we 
received that was updated as of November clearly shows that only 
the minister could approve all the grants, including the ones in 
her own riding. 
Why does she instruct her employees in HRDC to respond to access 
to information requests with false information?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, an 
internal audit done in 1997 by Consulting and Audit Canada has 
confirmed what the Bloc Quebecois' analysis clearly showed— 
political pressure was brought to bear on the administrative 
staff of Human Resources Development Canada in order to speed up 
the grant approval process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the minister going to continue denying that the Liberal

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development,

the program that was done in the spring of 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me also confirm for the hon. member something he knows very

the minister understood French better, she would have known that 
I was talking about an audit.  Audit is part of the company's 
name.  In addition, if they injected money into a riding such as 
Anjou—Rivière-des-Prairies, it is because they thought they could 
wrestle the riding away from us.  My riding did not get one red 
cent. We may be naive, but we are not right out to lunch. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the minister going to continue to deny the evidence, when the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development,

review.  It talks about the role politicians play in the 
transitional jobs fund.  Indeed this is quite unique.  The review 
did not suggest in its recommendations that politicians, local 
members of parliament who have information and knowledge about 
their ridings, should not be consulted in this undertaking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact some of the other things the review said were quite 
positive.  It said that the approval process and criteria appear 
to be working.  It said that the transitional jobs fund was an

plan, which convinces no one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the minister acknowledge that this new overpowering bit of 
news revealed by the 1997 audit inquiry proves the offensiveness

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development,

absolutely untrue.  I would remind the House that it is this hon.

clearly because of the success he has had with getting grants and 
contributions in his riding there is no political undertaking 
here at all.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the minister not agree that, under the circumstances, the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development,

the facts again.  The transitional jobs fund and the Canada jobs 
fund were programs and grants to help communities of high 
unemployment and to provide opportunities for work for men and 
women in those ridings, and those ridings include ridings held by 
the New Democrats, the Reform, the Bloc, the Tories and the

</I></B></P><P align=left>What is very clear is that these undertakings have made a real 
difference in areas across Canada.  We on this side of the House

<P><A NAME="LINK61"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie—Bathurst, NDP): </B>Mr. Speaker, how is it 
that, in the riding of Vancouver East, money was available from 
the transitional jobs fund when there was a Liberal incumbent 
but it is no longer available with an NDP incumbent there.  They 
have received no money and are not eligible.  There is a double 
standard.

there were no further proposals after that.

the sliding scale of eligibility.  Could the minister explain why

</I></B></P><P align=left>It was an internal audit of the department that highlighted

</I></B></P><P align=left>For days the minister has dodged questions in the House and 
pointed the finger at officials, previous ministers and members

was an obvious effort to pad employment in her own riding.  This 
type of creative accounting has baffled Statistics Canada 
officials, MPs and Canadians generally.

were “more political than other programming”.

She made reference to an audit.  It was not an audit.  It was a 
review of the transitional jobs fund program, a very important 
undertaking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The recommendations in that review did not suggest that we 
should change the relationship we build community by community 
with local members of parliament.  Indeed it said they had a role 
to play. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the hon. member that something the review did say was 
that job creation under the transitional jobs fund tends to be 
more productive and uninterrupted than it is under any of the 
more traditional types of HRDC programs, especially where 
seasonal employment is common. 
<P><A NAME="LINK69"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley,

working on this project and we did that.  What it suggested is 
that we needed to have stronger administrative practices and we 
are improving them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I can say to the hon. member in the context of the broad 
issue of grants and contributions in my department is that we 
have identified that we have a problem.  We have a plan of action

analyzing the minister's responses, one can see she has a 
fertile imagination.  The computer system varies from one 
program to the other.  The rates used are for either 1995 or 
1997.  The bases for calculation are regional, provincial or

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development,

and conditions of the transitional jobs fund she will see that 
there is within those terms and conditions the opportunity to 
support areas with pockets of high unemployment in economic 
regions.  Not only was that done in the riding of Brant, but in 
the ridings of Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Kelowna, 
Kootenay—Columbia, Nanaimo—Alberni, Nanaimo—Cowichan, and 
Saint John.  There were areas where the unemployment level was 
less than 12%.  The program applied.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

fund.  It is part of the ordinary democratic process of 
governments past and present, federal and provincial, for 
ministers and members to attend sites of activities and events to 
show what the government is doing to help ordinary Canadians all

circulated to only a select group of MPs and what a surprise. 
What a surprise that only Liberal MPs and cabinet ministers got a 
copy.  That is a real democratic process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the Deputy Prime Minister acknowledge the obvious, that 
these grants were more about raising the profile of Liberal MPs

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

governments to let Canadians know what they are doing to help 
them have jobs, to help them have better communities and to ask 
their supporters, ministers and MPs, to be the vehicle for 
getting out this information.

cornerstone of our policy supported by the standing committees of 
both Houses of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I introduced Bill C-26 yesterday to restructure the airline

Canadians, recognizing that 85% or 90% of all fares that are used 
by Canadians are excursion fares.

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>All documents tabled in the House by a Minister or, as the case

<P><A NAME="LINK152"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
think there is a large difference between a minister bringing a 
document into the House to be tabled as part of the normal course 
of the minister's business and the minister quoting from a piece 
of correspondence that she happens to have received from someone, 
be it a constituent, a member of parliament or someone else, in 
only one language.  It is an entirely different situation, Mr.

more to official documents being brought in by ministers rather 
than something being quoted by the minister on a cursory basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I would not normally engage in debate 
on a matter of this kind.  However, I would also refer the member 
to page 518 of the same M and M work, which deals with the

</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has indicated that she is prepared to have the

so rule.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères—Les-Patriotes, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I would simply like to find out from you what criteria guided you 
in your decision to allow a question to be put to a minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prior to this week, we put a question to the Minister for 
International Trade on the Department of Human Resources 
Development issue, a question the Chair denied us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today a question was put to the Minister of Human Resources 
Development and was answered by the Minister for Veterans 
Affairs. Is there some reason why one minister can answer in a 
matter belonging to another and another minister cannot? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I believe that your 
interpretation of the rule, as I saw it being dispensed, is quite 
correct.  There are two different concepts here.  The first is 
that one may not ask a question of a previous minister or a 
minister who is no longer responsible.  That is in citation 410 
of Beauchesne's. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, it is also equally true that the government itself can 
decide that any minister can answer a question.  That is not the 
same proposition; it is a totally different one.  The two of them 
are very different and the Speaker was quite correct in giving a 
different decision in both cases because they are different 
propositions. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK154"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
on a point of order on the same matter.  In other words, if I 
understand correctly, one minister is not obliged to answer in a 
matter that is not his responsibility.  We agree on that. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1210"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT25"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are told that a minister cannot do that. Yet today we saw 
another minister answer a question when he should not have been 
allowed to do so. There is a problem somewhere. If a minister 
does not have the right to answer, then he cannot answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the government can decide that another minister will 
reply. This means that the government could say the minister 
does not have to answer, or does not have the right to do so 
unless authorized by the government House leader. Otherwise, how 
can we explain that another minister was allowed to answer, a 
minister who is not responsible for the issue, but who is a 
clever parliamentarian, who can give a good show in the House 
and who can save the minister who has problems answering 
questions? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, the Minister for International Trade does not 
have to answer, but if he wanted to do so, and had the courage 
to do it, he could. But he does not have that courage, as 
evidenced by the fact that the Minister of Veterans Affairs came 
to the rescue of the Minister of Human Resources Development on 
an issue for which he is not responsible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One cannot, in one instance, not have the right to do something 
and do it just the same and, in another instance, not have the 
right to do it and not do it. This does not make sense. I would 
like to know why the Chair prevents the minister from answering 
before the minister has even decided whether he will answer or 
hide behind the fact that he does not have to answer. I 
understand the principle, but it is not for the Chair to prevent 
the minister from answering right off the bat, since others just 
did it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Once again, I refer to the book by Marleau 
and Montpetit, not only to promote sales but also because I 
believe it contains some very relevant passages with respect to 
the matter raised by the Bloc Quebecois leader and the whip. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that the point made by the government House leader is 
correct. Let me quote from page 432 of the book: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Questions, although customarily addressed to specific Ministers, 
are directed to the Ministry as a whole.  It is the prerogative 
of the government to designate which Minister responds to which 
question.  The Prime Minister (or the Deputy Prime Minister or 
any other minister acting on behalf of the Prime Minister) may 
respond to any or all questions posed during Question Period. 
Only one Minister may respond to a question, and it need not be 
the one to whom the question is addressed who actually answers 
it. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The standing orders are very clear on this point.  The Chair 
recognized the minister who rose to respond to the questions. 
That is entirely consistent with the standing orders in our new 
book. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to be very sure I 
understand what you have just said.  I think it was very 
informative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, you are saying that the Minister of Veterans 
Affairs could respond today because the government allowed him 
to do so, but that the Minister for International Trade could 
not, because the government did not wish him to do so.  It 
prevented him from doing so, but it could have allowed the 
Minister for International Trade to respond to the question had 
it so wished. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that the government finds this annoying, but that would 
have been possible, right?  That is what you are saying? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I will read the last sentence of the 
paragraph I began earlier: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speaker has no authority to compel a particular Minister to 
respond to a question. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is clear.  These are the standing orders, and they have 
been adhered to all week during Oral Question Period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron :</B> Mr. Speaker, once again, we want to 
clearly understand the ruling you have just brought down.  You 
have responded to the hon. leader of the Bloc Quebecois by saying 
that the government could very well have allowed the Minister for 
International Trade to respond. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet the question I am asking you, which takes me back to the 
original one, is this: What does the Chair use as a guide in 
deciding not to allow the opposition's question? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A little earlier this week, the Speaker decided not to recognize 
a question because reference was being made to a prior 
responsibility of the present Minister for International Trade, 
whereas the government could have chosen to allow the Minister 
for International Trade to respond.  The Speaker is the one who 
prevented the government from making that decision.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I was not in the Chair yesterday.  If there 
was a problem yesterday, all that I can say is that the hon. 
member ought to have raised it yesterday after question period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not responsible for what has gone on in the House all week. 
I am citing the rules that apply to what happened in the House 
today, and I believe that is correct.  Yesterday I was not here 
and I did not see what occurred. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure that the hon. member could raise the matter with the 
Speaker when he is here next week.  I suggest that he do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> If this is the same point of order, I trust 
that it will be very brief.  I do not want to waste the House's 
time.  This is a matter that should be raised with the Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe:</B> Mr. Speaker, listening to your wise counsel 
is not a waste of time. I will seek it again. Do not tell me it 
is a waste of time to listen to you, it is informative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, you are in fact telling us that since you are the 
one in the Chair today, your situation is similar to that of the 
minister, in that you are responsible today, and you go by the 
standing orders. Today is today and yesterday was yesterday. 
Something happened today concerning the Minister of Veterans 
Affairs, and I am submitting the issue to you. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to know how we should put our questions and we want you 
to tell us what approach to take, since this is your role. You 
are at the service of all parliamentarians. Because the question 
was directed to the Minister for International Trade, you are 
saying the Chair could deem the question to be out of order 
because that minister is not the one responsible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To clarify, today the question directed to the Minister of 
Human Resources Development was answered by the Minister of 
Veterans Affairs. I wonder where the logic is; at any rate, that 
is what happened— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am sorry— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe:</B> Give me a moment to finish. Our question 
should have been worded as follows: “The question is either for 
the Minister of Human Resources Development, who is currently 
responsible, or for the Minister for International Trade, who is 
largely responsible for this mess”. The government would then 
have had the option of allowing the former minister to answer or 
of preventing him from doing so, as was the case today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did I understand correctly the conclusions you drew on this 
issue and your teachings to the House today? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> First of all, I suggest that all hon. 
members read chapter 11 of the book which looks at the rules 
governing Oral Question Period in this House.  It is very clear 
and very informative.  I will cite another paragraph from page 433: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members may not insist on an answer nor may a Member insist that 
a specific Minister respond to his or her question.  A 
Minister's refusal to answer a question may not be questioned or 
treated as the subject of a point of order or question of 
privilege. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is clear enough and very informative.  I suggest that the 
hon. member and all other hon. members read chapter 11 of this 
excellent book, which will enlighten everyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. leader of the Bloc Quebecois for a 
very, very brief comment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe:</B> Mr. Speaker, to make myself even more 
concise than usual, I understand that the minister may refuse, 
as you have just repeated, but that was not the question.  We 
want to know how the Speaker of the House may refuse, on behalf 
of a minister, who may or may not have had the government's 
permission to respond, but who still takes— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I again suggest that members read chapter 11 
and ask the Speaker questions next week, if they wish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is this still the same question? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron:</B> Yes, Mr. Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> We have done with this question for today. 
We have been debating it for 20 minutes and I clarified things 
as best I could. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank you sincerely for 
your indulgence but I want to make sure I understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You said a moment ago that, regarding the events of a little 
earlier this week, we should check with the Speaker who was in 
the Chair at the time. I understand that answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I come back to my original question.  Are there 
criteria under Marleau-Montpetit—or whatever its name is—that guide 
the Chair when it decides whether the House will deem that a 
question is in order?  It appears that earlier this week the 
Speaker did not admit it because—

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Chapter 11 contains a number of passages 
describing what is in order and what is not.  I suggest the hon. 
member and all the others read that, because it contains a lot 
of information.  It will help everyone plan questions and 
answers in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that puts an end to the debate.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The sovereignty of Quebec would temporarily upset the economy of

This is what was revealed by the <I>Globe and Mail</I> yesterday, after 
it managed, with great difficulty, to get its hands on secret 
studies commissioned by the Government of Ontario during the 
1995 referendum campaign, when everything seemed lost for the 
federalists.  According to these documents, Ontario felt at that 
time that the federal government was prepared to use military 
force if Quebec declared independence unilaterally.  The

I am not questioning your judgment, which we know to be sound, 
but my colleague from Saint-Jean had not yet asked for the 
unanimous consent of the House when you rose to ask if he had 
it.  He must have the opportunity and the time to seek it, 
before you ask whether he has it. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The Chair is given 
certain discretion and were the Chair to have to wait for the 
request for unanimous consent to come from the member, we could 
be here until tomorrow or the next day waiting for the member to 
ask that.  So it is understood why the member is reading from the 
document and therefore the Chair has exercised judgment, provided 
the opportunity for a succinct description of the document to be 
tabled and then to ask the House for its consideration.

very appropriate question, one that is often asked of members and 
one that Chair occupants also have to ask themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason is the authority vested in the Chair to maintain 
order, decorum and the smooth running of the affairs of the House 
to assure that all members of the House are given respect and the 
opportunity to make their case.  It is also to ensure that at the 
end of the day the affairs of governance are concluded or are 
able to reach conclusion in a fair and orderly manner.  The 
authority is not necessarily vested in a particular statute.  The 
authority is vested in the Chair after 500 years of parliamentary

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, for the 
purpose of this debate, I would like to table an article which 
was published in <I>Le Devoir</I> on December 4, about six weeks ago, 
and is still as pertinent today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This article was entitled “Quebecers do not want Ottawa to 
interfere”. Let me read the first paragraph of this excellent 
article: “If Ottawa proceeds with a bill on the Quebec 
referendum, the people from Quebec will not accept it, says 
premier Bouchard, who is also asking the Canadian Prime Minister 
to calm down. Before heading off for the capital city of Quebec 
earlier today, Mr. Bouchard said that his federal colleague is 
always looking for support, but mainly in English Canada.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think all this is pertinent. It is at the heart of the debate. 
I request the unanimous consent of the House to table this 
document that could certainly serve as food for thought for our 
colleagues opposite. It is just one more attempt by the Prime 
Minister, through his gofer, the Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs, to play petty politics on the backs of the people of

necessary for the Chair to recognize a member anywhere in the

the purview or the sight of the Chair.  It can be anywhere that 
the Speaker can see that the member is a sitting member.

Bouchard says he will not hold another referendum during his

sense.  In the existing law there is a provision that the judge 
who issues the warrant must be presented with the date of the 
search and seizure, a description of what was seized and the 
extent of the search.  This bill would add to that a report on 
any damage done for compensation purposes.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am extremely 
delighted today to have the opportunity to speak to Bill C-10, an 
act to amend the Municipal Grants Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not want to mislead the population. We talk about grants, 
but my colleague from Saint-Jean asked last week why we called it 
grants since they are basically payments of property taxes. As 
we used to say in law, and my colleagues who have studied in 
that field have heard it often enough “The King can do no 
wrong”. That is what is taught to law students on the very first 
lesson of their very first day in school. Then I could add to 
that saying that the King does not pay property taxes either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the reason why there is a little subterfuge and the act 
talks about grants instead of taxes. 
However, if we look at it more closely, it could very well be 
real grants. Usually, when we talk about grants, we talk about 
the discretionary power of a minister. The minister can decide 
to give or to refuse a grant. In this case, the title Municipal 
Grants Act is not misleading since the discretionary power of 
the minister is mentioned in clause 3 of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing more scary than the discretionary power of a 
minister. Seldom do we see a minister having discretionary power 
who does not end up dirtying his or her hands. We really do not 
see it often. We have a very good example right now with all the 
mess at HRDC involving two ministers, one who was there earlier 
but has left since then and the other one who was not there 
earlier but is in the middle of things right now. 
This shows what discretionary power can do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the discretion of the Minister of Human Resources 
Development, $500,000 was given to Wal-Mart. Poor Wal-Mart. It is 
sad how little money they have. And they are not alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Human Resources Development and her officials do 
have discretionary power, and I see the member opposite shaking 
her head, but it is really a discretionary power even if, under 
the legislation, the minister has the authority to give grants 
or to fund programs, there is a highly discretionary component 
to all these things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is an example. I know I am not a minister and I have no 
such pretension, but here is an example. 
Officials at Human Resources Development Canada divided my 
riding, the beautiful riding of Chambly—and I take this 
opportunity to say hello to the people of Chambly—into areas, 
such as area 37 or 38. For these areas to be eligible for the 
transitional jobs fund, their unemployment rate had to be over 12%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The county town of Marieville is located in my riding, in the 
middle of a vast countryside, a largely agricultural area, where 
of course there is practically no unemployment. You may have a 
father, a mother and even a son working on a farm, so no one is 
unemployed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The unemployed move to the county seat, the city of Marieville, 
which has high unemployment, in excess of 12%. For a year now, 
we have been asking the minister to transfer Marieville to the 
adjacent area, Chambly, so that it could qualify for grants 
under the transitional jobs fund, thus allowing people living in 
Marieville to benefit from this program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This request was made a year ago. It was made not only by 
myself, but also by the municipal authorities, by Sylvain 
Lapointe, the mayor of Marieville, whom I take this opportunity 
to salute and who does an excellent job as a mayor, by the 
chamber of commerce and by the MNA.

<A HREF="#LINKT39"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every stakeholder told the minister that it made no sense to 
include Marieville in a rural area, while this city which has 
between 5,000 and 6,000 residents and has high unemployment, but 
cannot benefit from the transitional jobs fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I learned, during oral question period, that the minister have 
given grants in her riding, where unemployment is clearly lower 
than 12%. It is not always true that the shoemaker's children 
are the worst shod, the minister's riding being proof of that. 
The minister gave transitional jobs fund grants, even though her 
riding does not seem to qualify for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To this she says “Yes, but in my riding, there are some pockets 
where unemployment is higher than 12%”. The law does not give 
her that authority. The law says that if in a particular area, 
which is clearly defined, the unemployment rate is below 12%, 
that is 11.99%, it does not qualify for transitory job fund 
grants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same applies to the riding of the Prime Minister, who used 
the same argument during oral question period last week or at 
the beginning of this week. He says that in his riding there are 
places—a street, a neighbourhood, a corner—where unemployment is 
over 12%. But this is not what the law says. It says that in the 
area as a whole unemployment must be 12% and above. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So members can see what discretionary power is. These people 
will stop at nothing to meet their ends. Fortunately, once in a 
while, they get caught, as it happened to the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do not ask me to show any pity, because what management at the 
Department of Human Resources Development did is really 
dishonest. I could give  many examples and my friend, the member 
for Trois-Rivières, has just as many of his own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Especially concerning her predecessor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel:</B> The current minister's predecessor is a 
sorry figure. He is the true culprit in this whole affair, but 
the minister is trying to cover up for him. As my father used to 
say “The one who is holding the bag is just as guilty as the one 
who is filling it up”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If discretionary powers do not offend these people any more than 
that, I will give them a few examples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A young nurse worked night shifts at the hospital, and when she 
did, she got a 35 or 45 cent an hour premium for an eight hour 
shift. She became unemployed, but she did not refuse any calls. 
From time to time, she got a call to come to work, and the young 
woman, who had just graduated from nursing school and who wanted 
to gain experience and eventually find a full time job, said 
yes. Whether it was a day shift, an evening shift or a night 
shift, she went to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When she filled out her employment insurance card, she reported 
working on that particular day. Her hourly wage at that time 
was, say, $15 an hour. She wrote on the card that on that 
particular day she worked an eight hour shift and earned eight 
times $15, or $120. 
Human Resources Development Canada realized that it was not 
true, that she did not earn $120 but $122 because she had a 
premium for working the night shift. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She received notices and was given fines. She had a public 
servant after her for six months and had to pay penalties. She 
was not given any chance even though the mistake was made in 
good faith and her hourly wage was indeed, say, $15, as it is 
generally the case for nurses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> They have quotas to meet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel:</B> These people have quotas to meet, probably 
like the minister responsible for administering this act. 
Perhaps he will be more generous with his friends than with his 
enemies. When the mayor of a nice town is a potential Liberal 
candidate in the next election, as was the case with some 
members now sitting in the House, then the minister can be more 
generous. 
That is what discretionary powers are all about, and that is 
what is dangerous in our system.

</I></B></P><P align=left>At second reading, and in committee, I recall that we asked for 
the discretionary powers given to the minister in this bill to 
be delineated. My colleague, also on the committee, went to 
speak to the Chair, no doubt to ask him to intervene, because 
they do not like to hear people say such things, to hear about 
abuse of discretionary powers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give another example.  In my riding there is a man who 
has worked on an on-call basis for many years.  He is a mover. 
When a strong pair of arms are needed, they call him up, because 
he is a pretty strong, pretty sturdy individual.  Sometimes he 
works a day or two, sometimes not at all.  Every two weeks he 
fills out his employment insurance card. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He made a mistake.  For one week, he marked that he had not 
worked Monday and Tuesday, and for the second week that he did 
work Monday and Tuesday, when he had not worked that week.  He 
simply reversed the two weeks— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mauril Bélanger:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order. Could the 
hon. member over there please tell us what this story he is 
telling us has to do with the bill we have before us? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> He is getting to it.  This is his introduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is not up to the member 
opposite to decide what I will say in my speeches.  I know he 
did not understand anything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am showing you the meaning of the abuse of discretionary 
powers and where it can lead.  For those who are not friends of 
the government, who are not members of the Liberal Party of 
Canada, it becomes dangerous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, my mover muddles his weeks.  He did not intend to do 
anything wrong and there is no benefit for him in doing so.  He 
says he did not work two days he worked, but he says he worked 
two days the next week he did not work.  It amounts to the same 
thing.  He was fined $800.  The cheque was recovered, interest 
was charged and the man was threatened with a charge of fraud. 
This is how the management of the Department of Human Resources 
Development dealt with him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> To give it to whom?  To Wal-Mart. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel:</B> To give it to whom?  To give it to Wal-Mart, 
to Bombardier, to Pratt & Whitney, to Vidéotron or other such 
companies under the transitional jobs fund.  Do you not think 
that is disgusting? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> It is scandalous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel:</B> A widow came to see me after her husband 
died.  The Department of Revenue had begun to bug him for some 
paltry amount, a pittance.  They went after her husband right to 
his grave.  He was dead, and the letters kept coming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am saying that it is not normal when you look into the system, 
and the Prime Minister wants us to believe there was only about 
$251 in fraud at the Department of Human Resources Development. 
It is totally criminal to change and alter truth like that: 
$251.50.  Are we a pack of lunatics here?  Tie up parliament for 
$251.50.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC)</B> 
moved: 
<A NAME="LINK218">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the Criminal Code or other 
appropriate federal statutes should be amended in accordance with 
Recommendation 73 of the Province of Nova Scotia's Public Inquiry 
into the Westray disaster, specifically with the goal of ensuring 
that corporate executives and directors are held properly 
accountable for workplace safety. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from 
Tobique—Mactaquac for seconding this very important motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Briefly, to recall, importantly of course, that on May 9, 1992 
an explosion occurred at the Westray mine in Plymouth, Nova 
Scotia, killing 26 men.  It was a horrible tragedy and one that 
was felt throughout the province of Nova Scotia, and indeed 
across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many Nova Scotians acted in a very heroic fashion that deadly 
day in May 1992.  To those creative draggermen who were so 
directly involved in the efforts to locate the 26 miners who lost 
their lives, we will be forever grateful.  Many of those 
draggermen came from across Nova Scotia, and indeed across the 
country.  They worked, sadly in vain, to rescue the 26 men. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Coal mining and the coal industry in northeastern Nova Scotia 
has been very important for generations.  <I>Pictou County 
Colliers</I>, by James Mr. Cameron, chronicles the history of coal 
mining in that part of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The devastation of the Mother's Day disaster at Westray mine 
nearly eight years ago has left a very long and painful memory in 
the hearts and minds of miners and people generally across the 
province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The explosion at the Westray Coal mine sent a very chilling 
message to people.  That message was that haste and financial 
gain can put individual lives at risk.  Many owed their 
livelihood, gave their lives and lost their lives underground 
during the past 150 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many in Nova Scotia, in particular, recall the bump at Spring 
Hill or the cave-ins and explosions in Pictou county and in Cape 
Breton.  Artists, such as Rita MacNeil and the Men of the Deep, 
have sung poignant songs in remembrance of those lost souls. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The death of the 26 coal miners came as very unexpected and very 
sad to the peaceful community of Plymouth, that, from the very 
second that those fathers, brothers and sons were taken away from 
their families, people were left immediately with having to come 
to grips with the tragedy, and a tragedy that could have been 
avoided. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why it is so incumbent upon us as legislators to ensure 
that there are safe working environments for all workers engaged 
in labour activity, whether it is a mine, a fish plant, an 
automotive factory or any other work environment.  It is 
incumbent upon us as legislators to move toward making those work 
places safe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Days after the Westray explosion, on May 15 the Government of 
Nova Scotia appointed Mr. Justice Peter Richard to act as the 
head of a commission to inquire, under the public inquiries act, 
into what took place at the Westray mine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The commission had a very broad mandate, so as to shed light on 
the explosion and all the related circumstances that led up to 
that tragic day. In fact, Nova Scotia's premier at the time, 
Donald Cameron, was very clear about that mandate.  He said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Justice Richard's inquiry will not be limited to the events 
of the early morning of May 9th.  Nothing and no person with any 
light to shed on this tragedy will escape the scrutiny of the 
inquiry. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The commission's work began almost immediately to prepare for 
the public hearings set to begin in October 1992. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Curragh Resources Inc. and Westray's management challenged the 
validity of the order in council establishing the commission of 
inquiry. 
This, as members can imagine, led to numerous legal proceedings. 
Because of the delays, the report from Mr. Justice Richard was 
tabled five years later, in November 1997.

<A HREF="#LINKT42"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was an incredible amount of wrangling that went on in the 
criminal courts and charges laid under the workers' safety act 
also led to much of the delay and much of the frustration that 
occurred as a result of the wranglings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very important matter for all and I would appreciate 
the attention of members who are in the Chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Westray story is one that is very complex and a mosaic of 
actions, omissions, mistakes, incompetence, apathy, cynicism and 
downright stupidity were viewed in context.  These seemingly 
isolated incidents constituted a mindset of operating philosophy 
that appeared to favour expediency over intelligent planning that 
trivializes safety concerns.  Indeed, management at Westray 
displayed a certain disdain for safety and appeared to regard 
safety conscious workers as wimps in the organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To its discredit, the management at Westray, through either 
incompetence or ignorance, lost sight of the basic tenet of coal 
mining that safe mining is good business.  These words came 
directly from the report of Mr. Justice Richard, a report that 
was entitled “The Westray Story:  A Predictable Path to 
Disaster”.  It contained 74 recommendations and concluded in its 
final analysis that the tragedy could have been avoided if 
minimal occupational safety standards had been adhered to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are always ways to prevent tragedies.  Sometimes they 
cannot be avoided, but there are ways to eliminate the risk and 
the environment which costs people's lives or often leaves them 
injured for the remainder of their lives.  There are ways to 
attach criminal responsibility to those actions that put people's 
lives at risk.  Sometimes corporations and those at the head end 
and the head office of these corporations should, I suggest, be 
brought into some degree of culpability and accountability by our 
legislation, particular in the criminal code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are ways that this can be done:  through amendments and 
through legislative initiatives. Some of those were proposed by 
Justice Richard.  One proposal in particular would be to create a 
new criminal offence that would impose criminal liability on the 
directors or those responsible for failing to ensure that their 
corporation maintains an appropriate standard of occupational 
health and safety in the workplace. This is precisely what this 
motion hopes to achieve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Nova Scotia mining is regulated by three pieces of 
legislation:  the mineral resources act, the occupational health 
and safety act and the coal mines regulation act.  Mr. Justice 
Richard in his report reviewed all of these provincial acts and 
concluded that the main purpose was to ensure safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately we have seen in recent years examples of 
occupational safety in the workplace taking second spot behind 
the bottom line, the financial line, which is especially true in 
the mining industry where the very nature of the work involves a 
great deal of risk and a great deal of danger just as a course of 
the type of work that is done underground. It is the duty of 
company officers to ensure that work is done in the safest of all 
possible conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to ensure that individuals inside and outside corporate 
Canada will be dealt with equitably and fairly under the law, but 
we want to ensure that there is that degree of accountability, 
that executives will not be able to hide behind the corporate 
veil and the job titles in the commission of their duties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Corporate Canada understandably has two related functions: to 
make a profit and to create jobs.  Profit is a good thing but the 
balance has to be struck between the profit and the cost that is 
sometimes incurred by reckless behaviour. There must be a balance 
between making a profit and the means by which to get there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 220 of the criminal code currently refers specifically 
to criminal negligence causing death and there are sections under 
section 234 of the criminal code pertaining to manslaughter. 
There may be a need to introduce amendments to these sections 
that would broaden the scope of culpability or perhaps even go so 
far as to make a specific reference to executives, directors or 
persons in management positions when pertaining to acts which 
result in the loss of life.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I brought this motion forward with the hope that the devastation 
of the Westray disaster will not be forgotten.  I can assure the 
House and Canadians generally that those in Pictou county and in 
all of Nova Scotia recall with horror that period of time between 
May 1992 and the current has left in the minds of all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is as important today to ensure that the recommendations of 
the inquiry are not forgotten.  Sadly, all Canadians have borne 
witness to reports that have been completed; the white papers 
that have been completed by royal commissions that have done 
their work.  These reports wind up on a shelve gathering dust 
with no action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Words are not enough when it comes to protecting lives in this 
instance.  It is important that we follow the recommendations of 
this report, that we actually act with a great deal of strength 
in responding to the work that has already been done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fundamental and basic responsibility of safe operation of an 
underground coal mine is an industrial undertaking that rests 
very much with the owners and the managers.  Westray management, 
starting with the chief executive officer, was required by law, 
by good business practice and good conscience, to design and 
operate a mine safely.  Westray management came under attack in 
the ensuing days after the explosion for being lax in that 
responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The significance of that failure cannot be overstated.  Simply 
because others were abdicating their responsibility is not a 
satisfactory response.  Shared responsibility can be said to be 
implicit in the recommendations that came from the report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only in the mining industry but also in any business 
venture, corporate executives sometimes seem less interested in 
the merits of workplace safety and simply in the pursuit of 
profit.  This is a very dangerous situation.  We must be mindful 
of the situation that can evolve and can result in tragedy.  This 
mindset itself is precisely what set the dangerous tone in the 
workplace of the mine at Westray. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Businesses must also ensure that their employees are adequately 
supervised and constantly updated as to safe work practices.  In 
the case of Westray, labour safety standards, particularly 
minimal safety standards, were not adhered to to the extent that 
they should have been. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Looking at this issue in the larger context, there must also be 
a recognition of the role of government to ensure that these 
proper standards are being met.  If they are not being met, the 
government must intervene through its inspectors and simply see 
that the workplace is closed until those minimal standards are 
adhered to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of Westray, many trades persons were prone to 
perform unsafe tasks and take shortcuts in their daily routines, 
never once being told by management of the dangers of such 
actions given that the mine was very gassy and potentially 
explosive, as the Foord seam has been known to be throughout its 
history.  In many cases there was no question that the management 
may have been aware or ought to have been aware that the workers 
were not performing safe mining practices underground. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As stated in Mr. Justice Richard's report, there was a strong 
indication that the Westray management was aware of the levels of 
methane underground, which the coal miners were exposed to, and 
that these levels of methane were very hazardous and potentially 
explosive.  Under section 72 of the Coal Mines Regulation Act, 
such conditions should have resulted in the workers being 
withdrawn from affected areas.  That, of course, was one method 
of preventing the tragedy that resulted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It stands to reason that when weighing business goals versus 
those of safety, sometimes businesses find themselves pulled by 
many factors.  They have to meet production deadlines, 
competition to out-perform bottom lines and, in this case, there 
were government moneys involved that increased the pressure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is where the human element of safety must also enter into 
the equation.  Far too often businesses, and indeed heads of 
corporations, may be tempted by that financial gain and put the 
safety of workers second.  That type of short term gain for long 
term pain, as we have seen in the Westray example, is something 
that we seek to avoid by this motion.  Of course, I speak to the 
injury of death that can result.  It is a sad, sad scenario that 
we should learn from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tough economic times that exist in the country put further 
pressure on workers.  This is why this motion, I suggest, is very 
timely.  The economic impact of having to shut down corporations 
inevitably affects everyone in that region. 
The employees, the management, the board of directors, anyone 
associated with that business feels the negative impact of an 
operational shutdown.

<A HREF="#LINKT44"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the cost of doing business.  If we have to shut down 
these businesses to ensure that lives are protected, that is what 
has to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Companies must do everything in their power, and I suggest that 
we as legislators similarly are mandated to do everything in our 
power to ensure that hazardous workplaces are dealt with in a 
proactive way as opposed to reactive, as we have seen in Westray. 
If companies have not acted properly, have not adhered to the 
legislation, both provincial and federal, there must be 
consequences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ethics and the results of this tragedy dictate that we should go 
further, that we have to now act, pick up the report and move 
this matter forward.  This is a very serious instance. Business 
executives find themselves in a position where they are insulated 
from the consequences of their potential negligence and potential 
lax control over what is taking place on the ground.  Business 
executives must promote and nurture safe work ethics and have an 
open and approachable attitude toward their employees.  No one 
ever wants to feel the effects of what took place in Plymouth at 
the Westray mine again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate the non-partisan tone that has taken place on 
previous occasions on the debate of this particular motion.  I 
would suggest that there is a great deal of impact that all 
members can have in this area.  We must hold to account 
individuals who behave recklessly and without conscience that 
results in lost lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are empowered here with the knowledge, the know-how and the 
ability to make legislation that can have effect, very real 
effect on workplace safety.  We are empowered as officials to 
exercise our discretion to ensure that those who are operating 
businesses and those who have the final say over what takes place 
in the work world are adhering to safe practice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate the support that all members thus far have shown 
for this motion.  I am very concerned that we are only paying lip 
service to this issue.  I very much look forward to the comments 
and the support of all members of the House to ensure that we 
move forward and do everything within our power to ensure that 
workplace safety is a priority in this country.  It is something 
that we in parliament are very concerned about and are prepared 
to take positive action toward improving. 
<P><A NAME="LINK219"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Maloney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to speak to Motion No. 79. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion from the hon. member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough recommends that this House 
express its opinion that the criminal code should be amended to 
address the issue of the criminal liability of corporate 
executives and directors. I commend the member opposite for again 
bringing this issue before the House.  It is one which requires 
our serious consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is evident that this motion has its origins in a tragic 
explosion in the Westray mine on May 9, 1992 in which 26 miners 
were killed.  The subsequent public inquiry set up by the Nova 
Scotia government clearly established that mismanagement created 
an unsafe working environment that was a direct cause of the 
disaster. Throughout the inquiry and the prosecutions that 
followed from the investigation into the tragedy the 
responsibility of Westray officers and the Westray Corporation 
itself emerged as important and contentious issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The inquiry, chaired by Mr. Justice Peter Richard, produced the 
four volume report “The Westray Story: A Predictable Path to 
Disaster”.  Judge Richard's report set out 74 recommendations 
aimed at improving mine safety so that such incidents never 
happen again, so that mining operations never again, in his 
words, go down that path to disaster. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to read into the record recommendation 73 of Mr. 
Justice Richard's report as it forms the basis of the motion we 
are debating today: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada, through the Department of Justice, 
should institute a study of the accountability of corporate 
executives and directors for the wrongful or negligent acts of 
the corporation and should introduce in the Parliament of Canada 
such amendments to legislation as are necessary to ensure that 
corporate executives and directors are properly accountable for 
workplace safety. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree there is merit in examining the criminal law as it deals 
with the criminal responsibility of corporations.  However, it is 
much more likely that we will need a combination of preventive, 
remedial and punitive measures in order to keep us from going 
down that path of disaster again. The solutions to the problem of 
corporate responsibility therefore will be found in a mix of 
criminal law, labour code regulation and the regulation of 
business activity.

<A HREF="#LINKT45"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I address the role of the criminal law in such a system, 
I will give an example of how preventive and remedial measures 
outside the criminal code can advance the objectives of workplace 
safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On October 28 last year the Minister of Labour introduced Bill 
C-12, a package of amendments to part II of the Canada Labour 
Code designed to improve workplace safety in industries under 
federal jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation expands the responsibilities of both employers 
and employees in creating a safe work environment.  It 
establishes three fundamental rights for employees:  the right to 
know about hazards in the workplace; the right to participate in 
correcting the hazards; and the right to refuse dangerous work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no point in having a right without a remedy. Therefore, 
Bill C-12 expands the role of workplace health and safety 
committees in inspecting workplaces and in investigating 
complaints.  Similarly when an employee refuses to perform tasks 
that are considered dangerous, the legislation will streamline 
the complaint resolution process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada Labour Code also makes it an offence to contravene 
any of these rules and creates sanctions in the form of fines and 
terms of imprisonment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can leave the debate on Bill C-12 to another day but I urge 
colleagues to keep in mind that initiatives such as Bill C-12 
serve many of the same objectives as the criminal law changes 
suggested by Judge Richard in the Westray report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion before us today does not actually identify a 
particular amendment to the criminal code.  Therefore, I would 
like to point out some of the factors involved in creating a 
criminal law sanction for corporate misconduct in the workplace. 
Any examination of the criminal law in this area must consider 
both the responsibility of a corporation itself and the liability 
of the people who are employed by that company. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the first point, it should be understood that under the 
current law, it is already possible to charge a corporation with 
a crime.  Section 2 of the criminal code includes companies in 
the definition of person and there have been instances where 
corporations have been charged with crimes.  In fact in the 
Westray case, charges of manslaughter and criminal negligence 
causing death were laid against Curragh, Inc., the owner and 
operator of the mine, as well as individual employees of the 
company. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also important to note that the Supreme Court of Canada 
held in a 1985 case that a corporation will generally be liable 
for a criminal offence if a corporate director or officer commits 
an offence for the benefit of the corporation in the course of 
his or her employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993 a subcommittee of the House Standing Committee on 
Justice and Solicitor General, as it was then called, issued a 
report on the recodification of the general part of the criminal 
code.  This is the part that deals with fundamental components of 
criminal offences such as culpability and defences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The subcommittee took the view that express rules on the 
liability of corporations should be added to the general part in 
a way that makes a sharper distinction between the company's 
liability and that of its employees.  The subcommittee 
recommended as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A corporation [should be] liable for conduct committed on its 
behalf by its directors, officers or employees acting within the 
scope of their authority and identifiable as persons with 
authority over the formulation or implementation of corporate 
policy, notwithstanding that no director, officer or employee may 
be held individually liable for the same offence. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we want to change the current law, there are other approaches 
that deserve consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Australian law makes it possible for a company to be charged 
with offences requiring intention, knowledge, recklessness or 
negligence.  The Australian statute focuses on actions by the 
company's board of directors and its agents that tacitly or 
expressly authorize or permit the commission of a criminal 
offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will turn briefly to the criminal liability of individual 
employees of a corporation as opposed to the corporation itself. 
As individuals the employees can be charged with any criminal 
offence they commit and for which they are morally responsible. 
Section 23 of the criminal code also creates criminal liability 
for anyone who is a party to an offence, which means doing or 
omitting to do anything for the purpose of aiding someone to 
commit that offence, or abetting that person in committing the 
offence.  Section 23 also makes it an offence to counsel another 
person to be a party to a crime.  Therefore, there is already a 
way of getting at individual employees whose misconduct in the 
course of their duties amounts to a crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These provisions in the criminal code are important because if 
the corporation has a general duty to comply with the law, 
individual directors and officers also have a duty to take into 
account interests beyond those of shareholders and beyond the 
balance sheet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand that in the aftermath of the Westray inquiry the 
attorney general for Nova Scotia requested that the Minister of 
Justice for Canada address recommendation 73 of the Westray 
report and that the minister has agreed to do so. 
This step having been taken, I would suggest that the motion 
before us today does not advance the process.

<A HREF="#LINKT46"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, criminal laws created by parliament should also 
recognize the role of provinces in the area of workplace safety. 
In this regard I note that the Westray report also recommends 
that the province of Nova Scotia undertake a review of its 
occupational health and safety legislation and take whatever 
steps are necessary to ensure that officers and directors of 
corporations doing business in the province are held properly 
accountable for the failure of the corporation to secure and 
maintain a secure workplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For these reasons I oppose this motion as it does not further 
the study of criminal law in this area.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich—Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I rise with pleasure to participate in this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have great respect for the member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough.  It is imperative that I read 
the motion followed by recommendation 73 from the Westray report 
which has precipitated the member's motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 79 reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the Criminal Code or other 
appropriate federal statutes should be amended in accordance with 
Recommendation 73 of the Province of Nova Scotia's Public Inquiry 
into the Westray disaster, specifically with the goal of ensuring 
that corporate executives and directors are held properly 
accountable for workplace safety. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recommendation 73 of the Westray inquiry reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada, through the Department of Justice, 
should institute a study— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I emphasize the word study. 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—of the accountability of corporate executives and directors for 
the wrongful or negligent acts of the corporation and should 
introduce in the Parliament of Canada such amendments to 
legislation as are necessary to ensure that corporate executives 
and directors are held properly accountable for workplace safety. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recommendation 73 clearly calls upon the Government of Canada 
through the justice department to institute a study to ensure the 
accountability of corporate executives.  I have no problem with 
this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take a closer look at this issue.  Motion No. 79 calls 
for immediate amendment to the Criminal Code of Canada or other 
appropriate federal statutes without first studying the 
parameters of corporate responsibility.  I say with the greatest 
respect for the member from Nova Scotia who I understand is very 
sincere in what he is trying to do that it is a bit premature.  I 
want to get into the specifics and I offer this as a constructive 
criticism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ramifications of the criminal code changes are immense and 
in many cases final.  My objection to the member's initiative in 
no way is meant to diminish what he is trying to do.  We cannot 
diminish the extent of this tragedy and the loss of 26 lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should follow the guidance of recommendation 73 before making 
that quantum leap to amend the criminal code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of corporate responsibility is a shifting paradigm. 
The composition of corporations and the roles of directors who 
sit on their boards are in constant evolution.  I am uncertain 
how much empirical evidence and resources are at our disposal to 
adequately understand corporate responsibility, specifically the 
role of accountability which we assign to directors.

<A HREF="#LINKT47"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The law has some guidelines and statutory parameters regarding 
business organization.  The corporate form of business 
organization is intended to protect shareholders from personal 
liability for civil debts of the corporation.  Executives, 
directors or other officers and employees of the corporation 
enjoy no special immunity from either criminal or quasi-criminal 
liability.  Such persons are legally accountable for their own 
personal wrongdoing and negligence.  Corporations can be held 
criminally liable in their own right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of offences of absolute or strict liability, a 
corporation is subject to penal liability for unlawful acts or 
omissions of the corporation per se or for those employees and 
agents in the context of corporate duties.  In the case of an 
actual criminal offence, corporations are liable for the acts and 
omissions of such persons who by reason of their relevant 
position or authority in the corporation may be said to 
constitute the “directing mind” of the corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the November 1997 report on the Westray disaster, Mr. Justice 
Peter Richard recommended that applicable federal and provincial 
laws should be reviewed and amended to ensure that corporate 
directors and executives are held properly accountable for 
workplace safety.  I do not disagree on the magnitude of this 
disaster and the 26 lives that were lost.  I do not want to 
diminish that, but it is important that when we make these 
changes we get them right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member's motion wants to go much further.  It would 
ostensibly make it easier to fix criminal liability on 
corporations by calling for a new criminal offence.  Mr. Justice 
Richard did not go that far.  He wanted to proceed in steps. 
Justice Richard called for a study of corporate responsibility, 
recognizing the shifting and evolving nature of corporations, 
their composition and the role of directors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Allow me to identify what I see as some of the real problems 
with this motion.  Corporations would have a major problem 
attracting viable candidates who want to sit on a board with such 
criminal code penalties affixed to them as called for in Motion 
No. 79.  I dare say no one would want the job but the 
implications for corporations without boards is obvious under 
commercial and corporate laws.  Smaller or struggling companies 
would be at a greater disadvantage if such standards for 
accountability were applied to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not saying there should not be responsibility and I am not 
saying directors should be able to hide from their duties and 
social responsibilities.  I do not want to see punitive and 
debilitating roadblocks to growth thrown in their path and 
consequently that of the corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I for one believe that the majority of corporations serve a 
social purpose and are concerned with workplace safety.  I say 
this with some credibility.  I was a safety officer for a 
forestry company in British Columbia and I can attest that 
although accidents happen they were taken very seriously.  I am 
sure they do not want to see accidents happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A blanket criminal code amendment would do little to foster 
economic growth and jobs.  There must be a balance between making 
a profit and operating as an ethical and socially responsible 
enterprise.  That balance can be precarious.  The impacts 
criminal censure can have must be weighed carefully. Furthermore, 
I have to ask what the responsibilities and consequences would be 
for shop stewards on the floor.  I am not suggesting by any means 
that we should be looking at imposing criminal sanctions on them, 
but they also play a very important role in workplace safety. 
This has to be evaluated at the same time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would further ask whether the member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough has given any thought to the 
responsibilities of federal and provincial labour inspectors. 
Motion No. 79 could have devastating consequences for doing 
business in Canada.  It would have a serious impact on investment 
and would add dramatically to operating costs and consequently 
the profits and the motivation to expand.  Employment levels in 
corporations would no doubt be reduced.  The less people, the 
less chance for accidents.  Would production levels not also be 
reduced? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be unreasonable to expect each and every director of 
every corporation to be cognizant of every aspect of health and 
safety within any given corporation.  It is very important to 
have every director involved in day to day operations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate in the example of Westray that obviously there was 
a massive problem.  Twenty-six lives were lost and I do not want 
to minimize that.  If every prospective member is expected to 
assume this type of responsibility there would be no candidates 
to sit on a board.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I concur with the member in his genuine concern for the welfare 
of the miners and in his hopes that such a tragedy will never be 
repeated.  However, despite the honourable intentions of this 
motion I fear he has not taken the full picture into account. 
Without question Westray was a reprehensible disaster.  No one 
can diminish the human tragedy that descended upon that community 
and its people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, it is important to recognize that the crown currently 
has powers under the criminal code to charge negligent mine 
managers who were on site and who were responsible.  Let us 
follow the direction contained in recommendation 73 of the 
Westray inquiry and review the responsibilities of directors 
before we move to criminal code amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, I am saying let us not make that quantum leap.  Let us 
do a very comprehensive study because it will have a serious 
impact on corporations across the country.  Let us make sure what 
we are doing is absolutely right.  There are provisions right now 
for the people in the day to day management positions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend the member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough for 
bringing the motion forward.  It is a very important one, but we 
want to make sure we get it watertight and we get it right 
because it could have some very negative consequences on the 
corporate and business communities of Canada.  This seems to be 
the direction in which the member for Erie—Lincoln was going as 
well.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or—Cape Breton, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am very proud to stand here today as a coal miner's 
daughter and as a coal miner's granddaughter to speak to this 
private member's motion.  It is a subject that is very close to 
my heart.   My colleagues in the New Democratic Party and I 
support the motion in principle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Halifax has a bill on the order paper, Bill 
C-259.  Its intent and purpose are the same as those of the 
motion before us today.  However it is more legal in nature and 
takes the intent of this motion one step further to legislate 
changes.  We in the NDP have long been involved in the process 
and in lobbying for that step. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would like to see the criminal code amended to ensure that 
corporate executives and directors are held properly accountable 
for workplace safety.  We in the NDP caucus have been actively 
involved with the United Steelworkers of America in its lobbying 
for accountability in workplace health and safety issues. The 
impetus for the work we have been doing with the steelworkers 
union was the tragedy at the Westray coal mine in 1992 that 
killed 26 miners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tragedy at Westray was caused by a spark from a continuous 
mining machine that ignited methane gas, which then caused a coal 
dust explosion.  Following this tragedy we in the NDP, our 
sisters and brothers in the United Steelworkers of America and 
the families of the miners killed in that explosion have worked 
to make the law clear and prevent deaths and injuries.  We have 
to send a message to decision makers that they will be held 
accountable for their decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I made very clear when I stood before the House to address this 
motion before, and I will make it perfectly clear again, that we 
have reached a stage of evolution in society.  We will no longer 
allow people to use the excuse that we were just following orders 
as a defence for knowingly and willingly causing harm of any kind 
to others.  We as a parliament must take our responsibility to 
ensure that we live up to the most basic foundation of law and 
order that people are responsible for their own actions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After the disaster at Westray a public inquiry was established 
through the efforts of United Steelworkers of America.  The 
inquiry was given a simple mandate to probe whether or not the 
explosion was preventable.  After 76 days of testimony over a 14 
month period the Westray inquiry, headed by Mr. Justice Richard 
of the Nova Scotia supreme court, released its report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report 
cannot be called anything less than a condemnation of the way in 
which Westray executives operated the mine prior to the 
explosion.  Mr. Richard was very clear in his report that the 
actions and attitudes of the management at Westray sent the 
message that worker safety was not a priority. 
The miners at Westray, including those who were killed in the 
explosion in 1992, were expected to produce coal at the expense 
of worker safety.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion is in essence to adopt recommendation No. 73 of the 
Westray report.  I would like to take the opportunity to read the 
recommendation to the House: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada, through the Department of Justice, 
should institute a study of the accountability of corporate 
executives and directors for the wrongful or negligent acts of 
the corporations and should introduce in the Parliament of Canada 
such amendments to legislation as are necessary to ensure that 
corporate executives and directors are held accountable for 
workplace safety. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The intent of Mr. Richard and the commission is clear.  As 
federal parliamentarians we must take the initiative and 
introduce changes to the criminal code to ensure corporate 
accountability in the workplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion allows us to try to rise above the daily hullabaloo 
of partisan politics of late.  If the motion is passed or adopted 
by the House, it would be the first step on the road to ensuring 
that those firms, mining or other, which run their businesses in 
a responsible way are rewarded.  Their reward would come from the 
punishment of those firms that run their businesses in unsafe 
ways in their shameful attempt to cut prices.  Those businesses 
that put their workers in danger would not be allowed to operate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in Cape Breton know only too well about these kinds of 
unscrupulous businesses.  We do not have to look much further 
than at the coal industry to provide what should be enough 
examples to give all my hon. colleagues in the House enough 
reason to adopt the motion and then go the next step and change 
the criminal code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me be perfectly clear.  This is not about bashing business 
but about legislating responsible business practice.  Responsible 
business practice means that employers, especially those who run 
businesses that involve elements of physical or mental risk to 
their employees, must be accountable if things go wrong.  That is 
precisely what Justice Richard, the families of the miners who 
died at Westray, the steelworkers and we in the NDP caucus have 
been trying to do:  legislate a framework for responsible 
business practices as it relates to health and safety of workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We as members of parliament must take the lead on this issue, 
which is why I commend my hon. colleague from 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough on his efforts to have this 
important motion brought before the House.  If we could then see 
our way to legislating the recommendation of Justice Richard's 
report, we could help prevent disasters like the one we saw at 
Westray from ever happening again.  It would also not just be in 
cases of such catastrophic events.  This type of legislation 
would help in creating safer and healthier working environments 
on a daily basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Westray's case, only two of the executives of the corporation 
ever appeared before the inquiry.  The other executives did not 
want to give evidence of their crime and resisted all attempts to 
get them to appear as witnesses.  Criminal proceedings against 
some of the executives had to be dropped because the lawyers 
concluded that there was no reasonable chance that a conviction 
could result. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was not that the lawyers found nothing criminal about their 
activities.  No, the truth was that the evidence was there but 
the laws were not.  There were no laws to prevent the deaths and 
injuries of the miners at Westray.  There were no laws to make 
the people who caused those deaths accountable to their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>May I say on a personal note that I am one of those family 
members who have lost a relative in the mines.  It is a sad state 
of affairs when we have our family members killed in industrial 
accidents, but may I say that what is more tragic in these deaths 
at Westray, and as was with my uncle's, is that he was sealed as 
some of the men at Westray were and will forever remain under the 
Atlantic Ocean. 
We have the opportunity to change all of that for miners' 
families, and today can be the beginning of that process.

Westray report.  Mr. Justice Richard was very clear in his intent 
when he wrote: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—in the Parliament of Canada such amendments to legislation as 
are necessary to ensure that corporate executives and directors

</I></B></P><P align=left>Recent events have shown that even in this House of Commons, 
where we sit to represent our constituents, it is difficult to 
achieve accountability and responsibility for one's actions. If 
it is difficult here, we cannot just expect it from private 
companies.  We must use this motion as the first step to 
legislating corporate responsibility so that we can prevent 
further deaths and injuries so tragically revealed by the Westray 
disaster, and we must do it now. 
<P><A NAME="LINK229"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Brent St. Denis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Natural Resources, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have 
the opportunity to speak to Motion No. 79.  I commend the member 
for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough for his comments as well as 
the member for Bras d'Or—Cape Breton for her thoughtful remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion states that we should amend federal statutes, 
including the criminal code, to address the issues of 
accountability and liability for safety in the workplace in 
relation to recommendation 73 of the province of Nova Scotia's 
public inquiry into the Westray disaster.  There would not be 
anyone in the House who would not share the member's concern for 
the victims and for the families of the victims of those who were 
so tragically affected by the Westray disaster. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Westray disaster was a tragedy that captured the attention 
of the whole nation.  Although it happened some time ago, it 
remains in our minds and underlines the need for all of us in 
public office to be sensitive to the concerns of workers and to 
the need to ensure safe and secure workplaces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Workers are the backbone of our economy.  Fatalities, injuries 
and illnesses in the workplace cause them and their families to 
suffer both in human terms as well as in economic terms.  It is 
estimated that on top of the terrific human cost the dollar cost 
to our economy is as much as $10 million a year.  These costs are 
too high and we need to look at ways to bring them down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion provides us with an opportunity to look at the 
situation of workplace safety in Canada and to consider what 
needs to be done by the federal government to provide safe and 
healthy workplaces for Canadians.  The motion before us proposes 
that we need a new legislative approach to workplace safety. 
Legislation is clearly one option, but so is education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having worked in factories and on a railway, I know how 
important it is that workers be secure in their knowledge of what 
are the best practices in the workplace as well as management. 
There are many experts in the field of occupational health and 
safety who feel that prevention through education and training is 
every bit as important as intervention through legislation. 
These people understand the value of promoting education and 
training in order to reduce the incidence of illness and 
accidents in the workplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A national day of mourning was held on April 28 last year and 
will be held again this year.  I am proud to say that in my town 
of Elliot Lake, in my riding of Algoma—Manitoulin, we honour our 
lost workers on this very special day each year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have asked Canadians to remember workers who were killed or 
injured as a result of occupational accidents or illness.  The 
Canadian flag was flown at half-mast on Parliament Hill in memory 
of those workers who lost their lives or who were injured on the 
job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also each year organizations throughout North America co-operate 
to hold North American Occupational Safety and Health Week.  This 
past year the North American Occupational Safety and Health Week 
was held from May 17 to 23, and I expect it will be again this 
year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As part of this occasion the Government of Canada joins with the 
governments of the United States and Mexico to promote awareness 
of workplace safety throughout North America.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, Canadian organizations such as the Canadian Society 
of Safety Engineering and the Canadian Centre for Occupational 
Safety and Health are working in partnership with the federal 
government and others in Canadian society to promote safe work 
practices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These organizations produce excellent material to help labour, 
business, governments and others interested in occupational 
health and safety to learn about working together to identify and 
implement new approaches to promote workplace safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The educational information they produce is distributed broadly 
to employers and employees, and the Canadian Centre for 
Occupational Safety and Health has created a very useful website 
that has gained an international reputation.  It is important to 
underline the importance of education as it relates to workplace 
safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The labour program is very supportive of these activities. 
Indeed, for the last several years the labour program has played 
a leading role in emphasizing education and awareness as a means 
of promoting better workplace safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thus there is a wide variety of initiatives under way, under the 
leadership of Canada's Minister of Labour, with the help of her 
parliamentary secretary, the member for Whitby—Ajax, which 
provide useful information to focus the attention of employers, 
employees and the general public on the importance of preventing 
injury and illness in the workplace through education and 
awareness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the motion does not talk about the use of information 
to create safer work environments, it is important to keep in 
mind that education and awareness are also important aspects of 
our existing approach to promoting workplace safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second part of the approach, of course, is legislative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was some 30 years ago that the federal government developed 
the first occupational safety and health legislation to cover 
employees and workplaces under federal jurisdiction.  Over the 
years federal legislation and regulations relating to 
occupational safety and health have been consolidated under the 
Canada Labour Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we consider the motion, we need also to consider what is in 
place under the Canada Labour Code, especially under part II of 
the code, because it is part II of the code which governs 
occupational safety and health for employees working in 
organizations under federal jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada Labour Code establishes three fundamental rights for 
workers:  first, the right to know about unsafe conditions; 
second, the right to participate in workplace decisions relating 
to safety; and third, the right to refuse dangerous work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The code also includes a set of occupational safety and health 
regulations that prescribes standards and procedures for both 
employers and employees to follow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Federal government inspectors visit workplaces, respond to 
complaints, conduct investigations, prohibit access to workplaces 
deemed hazardous and can impose fines for non-compliance.  In 
other words, with the Canada Labour Code we already have a model 
in place to cover the enforcement of safety in the workplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is that the Canada Labour Code covers only those 
employees who are working in industries or organizations that are 
subject to federal legislation.  That is only a small part of the 
working population of Canada.  Therefore, while we have an 
effective model in the Canada Labour Code, it does not cover the 
whole population of workers, most of whom are under provincial or 
territorial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The difficulty with the idea of extending the federal model to 
include workers outside the federal jurisdiction is that, 
constitutionally, workplace safety is also a provincial concern. 
Any moves at the federal level to encroach on provincial or 
territorial legislative turf, so to speak, on workers' rights may 
not be viewed positively by those other levels of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to find an approach that would accommodate 
federal-provincial interests and would also combine the 
educational and legislative approaches.  This issue requires 
further study by the Minister of Justice, as recommended by the 
Westray inquiry report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to emphasize a point made by my colleague, the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice, that 
corporate criminal liability is part of the larger goal of 
improving workplace safety.  Bill C-12, now before the House, 
amends part II of the Canada Labour Code to reinforce the 
obligations of employers and the rights of employees in respect 
of safety in federally regulated workplaces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the emphasis is on preventive measures, various 
remedies, including penalties, are provided for in the labour 
code for violations of standards.  Bill C-12 deserves the early 
attention of the House, while the government continues to examine 
potential legislative amendments to address corporate criminal

</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion, while extremely well intentioned, merely calls upon 
the House to support the idea of amending the criminal code, but 
does not specify what kind of amendment is needed.  As such, the 
motion does not advance significantly the study of the complex 
issue of corporate criminal liability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We on this side of the House support the idea of a study.  I 
believe that the member who proposed this motion, having done so 
with the best of intentions, fails to recognize the important 
jurisdiction the provinces have when it comes to workplace health 
and safety.  I encourage him to co-operate with the government. 
I am sure that the outcome of a study would be the best possible 
for workers from coast to coast.  We know that federal workers 
are well protected.  We would hope that our provincial 
counterparts will see the wisdom of participating in any kind of 
study to make things better for workers across the country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
having heard the hon. member from the government say that it is 
not interested in supporting this recommendation is 
disappointing.  It has thrown me off my remarks.  I really 
thought there would be broad interest and support for such a good 
motion and for the type of language that was put together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can tell members that Canadians were absolutely horrified when 
26 miners were killed at the Westray mine, but they were even 
more horrified when they discovered that the crown prosecutor for 
Nova Scotia had to stay the charges because, under the current 
criminal code of Canada, in spite of overwhelming evidence of 
gross negligence, he could not make those charges stick.  That is 
what Canadians were seriously horrified about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what led to Judge Richard making recommendations in the 
Westray report.  Recommendation 73 specifically called for the 
criminal code and other legislation to be amended to introduce 
the concept of corporate manslaughter or corporate murder.   Now 
corporations can be charged with a violation of the Canada Labour 
Code if workers' lives are put at risk through gross negligence, 
but they cannot be charged with manslaughter or murder because 
the current criminal code does not contemplate that.  That is 
what recommendation 73 called for.  That is what the motion from 
the member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough calls for.  That 
is what the private member's bill introduced by our leader, the 
member for Halifax, called for in a very specific way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would be able to criminally charge company owners, CEOs, 
members of boards of directors of any enterprise who knowingly 
risk workers' lives in the same way that we would be able to 
charge someone with criminal negligence who drank a full bottle 
of whiskey and then drove a car and killed somebody.  That person 
could be charged under the Motor Vehicles Act, but also under the 
criminal code because a person's life was put at risk through 
criminal negligence.  The same should apply to workplaces. 
Nobody should be injured, butchered or maimed on behalf of some 
arbitrary production schedule.  Canadians have matured far beyond 
that point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We still have startling statistics though.  Three Canadian 
workers a day are killed at work.  One thousand Canadians a year 
are killed on the job and hundreds of thousands of others suffer 
lost time due to injuries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have looked at the moral and ethical reasons why we have to 
stop this.  Let us now look at the financial reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every year in my home province of Manitoba 50,000 person days 
are lost due to strikes and lockouts, and the right wing of the 
chamber of commerce screams bloody murder that unions are causing 
a lack of productivity.  In the same period of time, 500,000 
person days are lost due to injuries, accidents, lost time, 
sickness due to injury, et cetera.  If we are serious about 
productivity, if we are serious about workers or profits due to 
productivity, the first place to clean up is the workplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are all kinds of good reasons why this particular motion 
should get unanimous support from the House.  Under the guidance 
of the motion we would go on to pass the private member's bill 
dealing with Westray, get it into the criminal code and amend 
part II of the Canada Labour Code.  No one should be injured, 
butchered or maimed on behalf of an arbitrary production schedule 
in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  When the motion next 
comes before the House the member for Winnipeg Centre will have 
six minutes for debate. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The time provided for the consideration of Private Members' 
Business has now expired and the order is dropped to the bottom 
of the order of precedence on the order paper. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It being 2.30 p.m., this House stands adjourned until Monday 
next at 11 a.m. pursuant to Standing Order 24(1). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(The House adjourned at 2.30 p.m.)
