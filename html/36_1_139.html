</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurbax Singh Malhi (Bramalea—Gore—Malton—Springdale, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the Canadian Space Agency has a walk-in 
type exhibit of the international space station on display on 
Parliament Hill until tomorrow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is part of Canada's ongoing celebration of National Space 
Day, held on October 16, which allows us to voice pride in our 
nation's achievements in space, as well as being a source of 
inspiration for our youth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1996 the space industry employed 5,000 across Canada, 
contributed $1 billion in annual revenues and enjoyed a 30% 
export ratio, the highest in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian space program provides countless opportunities for 
academic, economic and social growth.  In fact this industry is 
both directly and indirectly responsible for many high paying 
jobs in my riding of Bramalea—Gore—Malton—Springdale. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage all of my colleagues to visit NASA's educational and 
interactive display.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, last 
Wednesday I rode along with an RCMP officer of the Kelowna 
detachment.  First there was a security alarm at the superstore. 
Next he investigated a complaint from a woman who was being 
harassed by her ex-boyfriend.  Then there was a domestic dispute. 
“Oh no, but let's go”, the officer said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With gentle language yet firm authority and command of the 
situation the officers—we had backup—separated the disputing 
parties and restored peace at least for that night. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Next we picked up a man who was off his medication.  Earlier 
that night he had tried to enter a stranger's house.  We took him 
to the hospital. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We investigated a break and enter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was but a small sample of what our police officers do every 
night.  Our streets are safe because of the dedication and 
actions of these men and women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is too bad that the government has cut funding for the RCMP. 
Instead the government is wasting money on a useless gun 
registration program.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
on September 29, at the age of 84, Frank Dowling died at Credit 
Valley Hospital of complications from heart disease and cancer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Dowling was the first mayor of the town of Streetsville, a 
distinct community within my riding and the city of Mississauga. 
He lived in Streetsville all his life and served the community as 
an elected official and volunteer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First elected to the village council in 1948, he became the 
first deputy reeve in 1956 and then reeve in 1958.  When 
Streetsville became a town in 1962, Mr. Dowling was elected 
mayor. His efforts ensured that Streetsville maintained its 
unique character despite being amalgamated into the city of 
Mississauga in 1974. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Always the community activist, he served as president of the 
Streetsville Lion's Club and director of the Peel Children's Aid 
Society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Dowling was a compassionate and dedicated person.  He was an 
honest man who truly cared about others and his community.  He 
will be missed by many.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In recognition of this event I invite members of the House and 
all Canadians to celebrate the contributions of the men and women 
who have chosen co-operative enterprise as their way of promoting 
the social and economic well-being of Canadian communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some 10,000 Canadian co-operatives are a powerful social and 
economic force in Canada today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Co-operatives have proven themselves to be a major job creator. 
In 1996 they employed more than 151,000 Canadians and generated a 
combined business volume of $36.3 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to congratulate all those in the co-operative movement 
for their considerable achievements over the past year and I 
invite all Canadians to join in the celebration of co-ops in 
Canada.

yesterday I announced some good news for the economy, and I will 
again today.  This morning, Statistics Canada reported a 0.2% 
decrease in the consumer lending index for August-September, the 
biggest monthly drop in the past year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last Wednesday, the Minister of Finance announced that the 
Canadian Government had succeeded in having its first budget 
surplus in 28 years.  Our government is managing public funds 
cautiously and efficiently. 
Solutions like the ones certain opposition parties are calling 
for are out of the question.  They would put us all back into 
debt.  We have no right to betray the trust of the Canadian 
people.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, what is it about dealing with foreign fishing issues 
that makes our minister of oceans fold up like a deck of cards? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether foreigners are grabbing fish bound for Canadian waters 
on the west coast or engaging in a scorched earth policy on the 
east coast, the minister continues to put other fisheries ahead 
of our own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we find that the minister has given the Makah natives a 
licence to hunt grey whale in Canada with an illegal high-powered 
50 calibre weapon.  In effect he is helping to destroy the 
international ban on whaling, licensing the use of an illegal 50 
calibre weapon in Canada and putting Canadian lives in danger. 
Even the Humane Society is complaining.

Canada I would like to add my voice to those who support the 
initiative.  I believe that it is important to the young women of 
our country.  They need role models and mentors to meet the 
challenges of their adult lives with confidence.  What better way 
to learn than through the stories of their foremothers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As mathematicians, firefighters and astronauts, as lab 
technicians, architects and farmers, women are increasingly 
defying the stereotypes about what constitutes women's work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These women are following in the footsteps of trailblazers like 
Harriet Brooks, Canada's first woman nuclear physicist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By uncovering the often overlooked stories of women's diverse 
contributions to society we acknowledge women's role in history. 
We support a better understanding of what women do today.  We 
open up the future for young women.  More important than that, we 
change not only who but what goes into Canadian history books.

Speaker, many Canadian farmers are worried that they will not be 
able to feed their families or keep their farms.  Farm commodity 
prices have collapsed and many farmers' 1998 income will only be 
25% of what it was two years ago.  Yet the Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food and this government continue to say 
“Don't worry”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government refuses to acknowledge that there is a problem. 
The Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food continues to state that 
the net income stabilization account will be sufficient to 
address producers' concerns.  The minister must know that NISA 
accounts will not even cover farm expenses.  We must begin to 
discuss solutions to this emergency today.  We cannot afford to 
wait until producers are forced off the land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call on the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food to admit the 
problem and admit that his safety net program is inadequate to 
deal with this crisis.  I call on this minister to sit down and 
discuss real solutions to the emergency.  The minister can start 
tomorrow when we start considering international trade issues at 
the agriculture committee.

now has 500,000 more poor children than it did in 1989.  In

recent announcement by Volvo in Halifax of closure.  All these 
were done only in the name of preserving shareholder value. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance often lectures Canadians on their 
responsibility to seek work.  Does he not feel that corporations 
have a responsibility to maintain employment in this country and 
not lay off people permanently or otherwise simply to increase 
their shareholder value?  Is there not such a thing as corporate 
responsibility in this country?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the decisions that are taken by private corporations are 
decisions which reside within the capacity of those corporations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, I have said on numerous occasions that the 
downsizing which has taken place over the last two or three years 
in many cases is the equivalent of dumbsizing.  In fact, it leads 
to lack of employee loyalty.  It leads to absenteeism.  I do not 
think it makes a lot of sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not to deal with this particular issue, but it certainly 
deals with a movement that we have seen throughout North America.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the reason CN is a private company is that the treachery 
of the Liberal Party sold off the CNR and made it for all intents 
and purposes an American owned company that now operates without 
giving two hoots about Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the Minister of Finance not see that this was a mistake? 
Will he be speaking to CN about operating in the interests of 
Canada and not in the interests of its 60% American shareholders 
thanks to the Liberal Party of Canada?

Mr. Speaker, I am quite affronted.  The hon. member talks about 
treachery when he knows he is talking about a decision 
democratically taken by members of the House of Commons to 
privatize Canadian National Railways.  I think he should withdraw 
that slight of CN and members of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Minister of Finance has said recently there are some 
troubled waters.  There are ups and downs in the economy and what 
CN is doing is reflecting a downturn in revenues.

occurred on the Immigration and Refugee Board.  The commission 
chair—and I would remind the House that this commission is a 
quasi-judicial tribunal—requested an outside inquiry, which was 
carried out revealing no general problem within the commission. 
The individual in question offered an apology to the entire

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, we are 
aware of the apology but that is not enough.  The Immigration Act 
allows for a public judicial inquiry to investigate the need for 
disciplinary action against members of the refugee board. Instead 
of a public inquiry the same lawyer who is representing the 
government on APEC affairs was hired to do a report on the 
Frecker case.  The refugee board hears the cases of people 
fleeing genocide, murder and torture and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why was there no public inquiry into Frecker's actions.  Is this

my question is for the Minister of Transport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Smoke in the cockpits of airplanes continues to be a problem. 
The FAA just produced a study in the U.S. called “Aging 
Transport Non-Structural Systems Plan”.  It says that a more 
complete description of undesirable wiring system conditions is 
needed and that observations for chafing, broken clamps, sagging, 
interference, contamination, cracking and splitting need to be 
addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the Minister of Transport what actions have been taken to 
address these FAA concerns. 
<P><A NAME="LINK107"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, this is an issue that is concerning a lot of people 
in the wake of the Swissair accident. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The FAA last week made some comments and quoted some proposals 
about better quality of insulation in the interior of planes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Transport Canada as a regulator in Canada is working with the 
FAA in developing new standards.  That work is not yet completed. 
It would be premature to enact new standards or put new standards 
in place until we are absolutely satisfied that we have all of 
the information available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hope to be able to have some recognition of this work in the 
coming months. 
<P><A NAME="LINK108"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the FAA report goes on to say that current maintenance 
practices do not adequately address wiring components and there 
is currently no systematic process to identify and address 
potential catastrophic failures caused by electrical faults in 
the wiring systems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Considering that the FAA has determined that inspections do not 
address the wiring failures adequately, will the minister now 
appoint a group or committee to focus on this very issue of aging 
wires? 
<P><A NAME="LINK109"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, we do not have to appoint a committee to deal 
specifically with this.  We have working committees at Transport 
Canada engaged in all facets of airline safety, every day, every 
week of the year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Safety is the number one priority for Transport Canada. We are 
trying to ensure that all the planes that fly meet the safety 
standards.  We believe that they do.  That does not mean to say 
there cannot be new methods of insulation, or new wiring that 
would be better in newer aircraft. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the commercial aircraft that are flying in Canada today have 
been certified by Transport Canada, the FAA or other regulatory 
agencies.  They are certainly safe to fly in.

first of all, to protect, preserve and enhance the ability of 
Canadians to save for their retirement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we believe that truly is the purpose of the registered 
retirement savings plan and the RRIF, then I think we should 
support this bill.  It would give Canadians who have access to 
about 2% of capital markets in their own country a chance to 
spread their investment portfolios around. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, I point to a Conference Board of Canada study which says 
that Canadians would be far richer in their retirement savings if 
they had access to other markets around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I simply want to say that ultimately all of this money 
would come back into Canada when people dispose of their RRSPs. 
It would leave the Canadian treasury and Canadians, in general, 
better off.  Therefore, I seek the support of my colleagues in 
putting this forward.

C-68. It has 100 signatures from the citizens of my riding of

</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners are concerned with Bill C-68 for the following 
reasons.  Bill C-68 will do nothing to stop the criminal use of 
guns, it is not a cost effective way to control crime, it puts 
thousands of jobs in jeopardy and is opposed by police on the 
streets in Alberta, Manitoba, Ontario, Saskatchewan and Yukon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners call on parliament to repeal Bill C-68 and

</I></B></P><P align=left>My constituents believe that some of the greatest problems in 
our society are the problems surrounding marriage and family 
life.  As family life goes, so does the rest of society. 
Troubled families produce a troubled society which is what we see 
happening in our nation today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to protect the nucleus of society the petitioners call 
on parliament to enact Bill C-225, an act to amend the marriages 
act so as to define a statute that a marriage can only be entered 
into by a single male and a single female.  It is my pleasure to 
support this petition.

1,000 residents of Alberta and British Columbia who express 
serious concern about rampant human rights abuses in Indonesia 
and in particular about serious looting, rioting and the death of 
more than 1,300 people last May. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners note that hundreds of ethnic Chinese women were 
raped and they point out that there is a long history of 
discrimination against ethnic Chinese living in Indonesia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners call on Canada as a human rights leader to speak 
out on this and they urge parliament to appeal to the president 
of Indonesia to enact and enforce laws so as to protect the 
safety and rights of the ethnic Chinese, to bring those 
responsible for these atrocities to justice, to apologize and 
compensate the victims and to form an autonomous committee 
promoting racial harmony. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners call on Canada to modify our current immigration

signed by residents of my constituency of Burnaby—Douglas 
noting the concerns around the multilateral agreement on 
investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners point out that through this agreement the rights 
of Canadian citizens and the power of the Canadian government 
will be greatly suspended and superseded by those of foreign 
investors and multinational corporations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners therefore call on parliament to consider the 
enormous implications to Canada by the signing of the MAI and put 
it to open debate in the House and place it for a national

that Canada should declare Iran as an unsafe country and that 
government stop all deportations to Iran immediately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners ask this because in the last 20 years the 
Islamic republic of Iran has executed over 100,000 women, men and 
children in Iran and has assassinated hundreds of its opposition

transfer those accused of crimes of violence to adult court and 
publishing the identity of violent crime offenders. I am pleased

tribunal decision on pay equity that would see mostly low income 
female federal public servants be compensated for years of

Firearms Act, and redirect the hundreds of millions of tax 
dollars being wasted on licensing 8 million law abiding, 
responsible firearms owners and registering 21 million legally 
owned guns to real crime fighting measures. 
These 35,000 petitioners also provide the government with a list 
of higher priority criminal justice programs where these billion 
dollars of public money could be much better spent such as 
putting more police on the street and fighting organized crime 
and biker gangs.  Many people are appalled that the RCMP is 
cutting back on essential services while the government has 
wasted $200 million more on gun registration.

compensation.  They are concerned that there is nothing in the

laws which prohibit the ownership, use and enjoyment of their 
private property or reduces the value of their property.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CANADA CUSTOMS AND REVENUE AGENCY ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK199">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from October 1 consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-43, an act to establish the Canada Customs and 
Revenue Agency and to amend and repeal other acts as a 
consequence, be read the second time and referred to a committee; 
and of the amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK200"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is a pleasure to talk about Bill C-43, the Canada customs and 
revenue agency.  I want to talk a bit about revenues and how they 
are applied and a bit about the agency.  I also want to give a 
good example of application of revenues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government collects a lot of money and what it does with the 
money is important.  I want to make a point about the difference 
between collecting money and spending it wisely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recently wrote a letter to the solicitor general about how the 
government spends those revenues.  I want to relate a bit of that 
to the House.  My concern was that the government has actually 
been cutting back on the services of the RCMP in British Columbia 
by way of budget cuts amounting to about $8.5 million.  That does 
not seem like a lot of money, I suppose, in that the government 
takes in revenues of billions upon billions, $120 billion a year 
approximately, but it is a lot of money in British Columbia and 
it is a lot of money for the policing services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just recently members of the RCMP were advised that they had to 
eliminate their overtime and their training.  They had to ground 
their airplanes.  They had to stop running their boats.  These 
are pretty basic functions for the RCMP in British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The result of all this is that criminals have a free-for-all in 
some cases because the RCMP is not even available during the 
evening, after hours, to look at situations involving 
investigations of criminal activities in drugs.  British Columbia 
has a serious drug problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With that in mind I wrote to the solicitor general and said that 
it was rather ironic that the government had to cut back $8.5 
million in those operations but had a $3.5 billion surplus.  Let 
us put this $3.5 billion into perspective.  That is a three and a 
half thousand million dollar surplus, yet the RCMP has to cutback 
on its operations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said we should look at it again to see if there is anything 
the government is spending money on that is unnecessary and could 
have possibly been applied to the RCMP to help it continue to be 
efficient in its operations.  It took me about 10 minutes. 
I want to relate how some of our revenues are being applied.  For 
instance, we have a little bit of a debt of about $580 billion.

<A HREF="#LINKT19"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Forseth:</B>  A little bit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Yes, a little bit.  That should be 
challenged because it is a significant amount of money.  Around 
the world people would say Canada's debt ratio is the highest 
next to Italy's. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has the government done?  While we wallow in debt the 
federal government forgave some of the debt owed to it.  For 
instance, it forgave Colombia's debt of $2.8 million, El 
Salvador's debt of $2.7 million and Honduras debt of $3.3 
million.  It is ironic that we are forgiving the debt of some of 
these places.  It also forgave Nicaragua's debt of $900,000, 
Costa Rica's of $2.3 million and Egypt's of $9.6 million.  That 
is $21.5 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet the RCMP, which is fighting crime in British Columbia, has 
to cut out overtime and ground its planes because it has an $8.5 
million problem.  I wonder what it is that makes those folks on 
the other side think like that.  There must be some other 
perspective.  That must be wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has given out a bit of money this year.  It gave 
$120,000 to the Prisoners Support Action Network; $54,000 to the 
United Steelworkers of America; $49,000 to the Prison Art 
Foundation; $46,000 to the Canadian Atlantic Lobster Association; 
and $51,000 to the BCTF, the British Columbia Teachers 
Federation.  This amounted to $320,000.  Yet at the same time the 
government cut back on RCMP overtime, ground its planes and 
ditched its boats.  In a province rife with drugs we do not even 
have some drug investigations going on after hours.  Must be 
something wrong with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I looked a little further to see how the government spent a 
little more money.  It has given close to $1.3 million for the 
development of a more diseased resistant banana in the Honduras. 
Is it any wonder the average person including the police get 
quite appalled with a government that says “You have $8.5 
million problem so we are cutting back on all our services that 
protect the people in British Columbia, but we are going to give 
$1.3 million to find a better banana in the Honduras?”  Is it 
any wonder the average cop on the street sees the whole exercise 
as darn futile? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give members some other ideas.  The police know this 
because I have told them.  I mailed a letter to them.  Members 
ought to see the responses.  They are appalled that this kind of 
money is being spent, this revenue taken in from the taxpayer is 
being spent this way, and much less small amounts are being taken 
from the RCMP to protect our citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did the government fund any conferences?  It took about two 
minutes to look it up.  Sure, it did.  It gave the International 
Conference on Visual Poetry, $10,000; the annual meeting of the 
Renaissance Society of America, $10,000; Ukraine and the New 
World Order, $9,000; Canadian Association of Irish Studies, 
$8,700; Canadian Society for the Study of Names, $3,900; and the 
Society for Socialist Studies, $12,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I showed this to the police they asked who were the rocket 
science people across the way who thought this stuff up and cut 
us back.  Who are these people?

<A HREF="#LINKT20"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There must be something else.  Maybe I should look at 
publications.  I say to the RCMP that the government spent 
$90,000 on the Canadian Business Economics publication, $37,000 
on the Canadian Journal of Law and Society, $28,000 on the 
Dalhousie Law Journal, $57,000 on the Osgoode Hall Law Journal 
and $45,000 on the Professional Regulation of Accountants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us put this in perspective.  These amounts of money are 
being spent but it is cutting back all overtime of the RCMP. It 
is grounding the RCMP's planes, boats and all its training.  The 
RCMP cannot investigate drug investigations after hours.  We have 
a 9 to 5 police force in British Columbia.  Is there no 
perspective here? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I looked a little further.  The Department of Agriculture 
developed an information kit for the 300 MPs in the House.  I do 
not even know where it is, but it spent $200,000 developing it. 
Yet the government has the unmitigated gall to cut back on the 
services of the RCMP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must be getting close to the end.  However the government 
likes to poll and find out attitudes about matters, perhaps APEC 
and the country's attitude toward pepper spraying students.  The 
government spent $622,000 for one company to poll.  The Angus 
Reid group received $688,000 and Ekos Research $1.3 million for a 
total of $2.6 million, which is more than 25% of what it took 
away from the RCMP which fights crime in British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It gave $1.4 million to professional and technical support for 
municipal authorities in Czechoslovakia.  It gave $473,000 for a 
grant to reintegrate Malayan soldiers back into their society for 
a total of $14 million, which is more than the whole problem in 
British Columbia.  It gave a grant to provide Canadian built 
locomotives to Senegal.  It gave $2 million in a grant to promote 
the use of electrical energy in Brazil and $450,000 in a grant to 
establish the Lebanese parliamentary institute.  The Minister of 
Canadian Heritage gave $15 million for free flag handouts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us put this into perspective.  I come from a province which 
depends on the services of the RCMP, not a 9 to 5 operation. When 
the government cuts back on that money to spend on these 
projects, there is something seriously wrong in the House of 
Commons.  There is something seriously wrong with the government 
putting things into perspective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How much time do I have, Mr. Speaker?  I am splitting my time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  You are splitting your time.  There are 
eight and a half minutes left.  Perhaps you would like to wrap up 
and we could go to your colleague. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  I would like my colleague to 
participate.  I guess it is time.  I wish it was election time 
because I know the RCMP is damn sick of what is going on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Maybe darn sick.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
in speaking to Bill C-43 one of the things that I have a deep 
concern about is the present power of Revenue Canada. I do not 
see anything in the bill that would do anything to restrain the 
power of Revenue Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to refer to tax cases where in my judgment Revenue 
Canada has been excessive and has been punitive toward people in 
my constituency.  In January of this year I asked for a meeting 
with the revenue minister. 
It took until April 30 to arrange that meeting with him 
unfortunately.  What is even more unfortunate is that since April 
30 I have not been directly contacted by the minister on this 
issue.

<A HREF="#LINKT21"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it very difficult as a member of parliament to truly 
represent the people of Kootenay—Columbia. I should be able to 
have access to the revenue minister, particularly on important 
issues for my constituents.  I have a meeting and he does not 
respond to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is this case?  In my constituency there are many people who 
have ranches, farms and rural property.  On those ranches, farms 
and rural properties there are trees which in many cases can be 
selectively harvested.  In 1993, 1994, 1995 and through to 1996 
there was a demand for timber, softwood lumber. Manufacturers 
have been looking for a source of timber.  They have come to 
these ranchers, farmers and rural property owners and have made 
deals with them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people all independent of each other went to their 
professional accountants, whether they be CAs, CGAs, CPAs or 
whatever the professional designation.  Their accountants either 
checked directly with Revenue Canada or went on the standing 
practice of Revenue Canada that these logs, because they do not 
form part of the normal income of the ranches, farms or rural 
property, would be treated as capital gains. After they had 
received the revenue from the softwood lumber manufacturers, 
these people went to their accountants, received professional 
advice, and paid their taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What appears to have happened is that the tax department in 
Kelowna looked at these returns and said that there were enough 
of these things happening, that this was something new and it was 
going to reassess on the basis of those trees and the income from 
those trees as being part of those people's ordinary income. It 
is not part of their ordinary income.  In fact, this is just 
found income on the part of my constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My point is that tax practices cannot be changed retroactively. 
If Revenue Canada in 1996 when it woke up to the amount of money 
that in its judgment was being left on the table, had sent a 
bulletin to all of the accountants and affected people not only 
in my constituency but indeed throughout the interior of the 
province of British Columbia that this was going to be the 
practice from now on on their future income, I could accept that 
within reason. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The difficulty is that all of these people, and I have at least 
a dozen cases in my office and more are coming in every day, at 
least a dozen of my constituents in good faith went to a 
professional accountant, received advice and paid their taxes. 
When Revenue Canada realized that this was something new that was 
happening within my constituency and within the interior of the 
province of British Columbia, it decided retroactively that it 
was going to go after these people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is involved here?  In some instances my constituents are 
retired people.  This was a portion of money.  To quantify this, 
their income could have ranged anywhere from $10,000 to $400,000 
from the sale of these logs from their property.  In many cases 
these are retired people who then took that income, paid their 
taxes and then made other investment decisions.  In fact, in the 
case of a couple of my constituents, they actually gave their 
money away to their families.  In other words, the money is gone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now all of a sudden Revenue Canada, with a retroactive tax grab, 
is coming around and saying “Oh well, now we will just bill you 
another $8,000, $9,000, $50,000, $80,000 in taxes because we have 
decided that we are going to change our way of assessing”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real injustice is that these people cannot even deduct their 
farming expenses, if they have expenses, against this income, 
because it is not a standard form of their income.  Yet Revenue 
Canada is calling it a form of their income.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has happened?  One of my constituents took it to a tax 
court for review and he won hands down.  There was absolutely no 
question about it.  Revenue Canada has in turn taken it one 
ratchet up with the tax money from our pockets and these people's 
pockets.  It is going after these people in tax court.  In the 
very vague possibility that this higher court rules in favour of 
Revenue Canada, Revenue Canada will reap the benefit of all of 
the interest or penalty accrued on the money it says these people 
owe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My specific concern is that I do not see anything in this 
legislation that gives me any feeling of comfort that we are 
going to end up with a fairer jurisdiction.  I realize that to a 
certain extent the United States IRS has been mythologized.  The 
problem is the agency has the probability of becoming a fierce 
tiger, as fierce a tiger as the United States Internal Revenue 
Service which is one of the most feared bureaucracies in the 
country south of the 49th parallel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation is seriously flawed if it does not stop Revenue 
Canada from retroactively grabbing money out of the hands of 
people like my constituents, honest, law-abiding, taxpaying 
Canadian citizens who pay what is rightfully and justly owed to 
Revenue Canada.  It is my responsibility to speak on behalf of my 
constituents.  I do so.  The people in the constituency of 
Kootenay—Columbia have to know that as their member of 
parliament I am going to continue to push this issue as hard as I 
possibly can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have one little story which has been bubbling along for a 
short period of time, perhaps a year to 18 months.  In that 
period of time I or my office assistant have asked some of these 
taxpayers if they would permit us to publicize this matter so 
that we could expose what Revenue Canada and the revenue minister 
are doing.  They were scared.  They were afraid that if they 
permitted this matter to publicized, that if their names became 
part of this whole process, Revenue Canada would come down on 
them on other issues in future years.  That is shameful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We understand the necessity of collecting revenue.  We 
understand the necessity of collecting taxes.  When the people of 
Canada are scared of Revenue Canada and the potential for the 
auditors to come down on them, I say shame on Revenue Canada, 
shame on this minister, shame on this government for not doing 
what is right.  Give a proper balance to the rights of Canadian 
taxpayers.  Change this legislation so it does that and then 
perhaps we can support the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Just as the hon. member was running out of 
time, I knew he would come back to the bill and to the body of 
it.  I knew he was going to get there. 
<P><A NAME="LINK202"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, as I speak to this legislation, to my colleagues, 
parliament and the people of Canada, I will briefly outline an 
initiative I took awhile ago.  As I describe it I will relate it 
to the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A couple of years ago I asked an independent lawyer for an 
analysis of the bills that were before the House of Commons.  I 
requested an examination of the bills before the House to 
determine which pieces of legislation were taking power away from 
the people of Canada through their elected representatives and 
giving it to the bureaucracy. 
What bills before parliament were enhancing or reducing 
accountability to the people of Canada?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members may find this very, very interesting because it relates 
directly to what we are doing in parliament this afternoon and 
the member's speech which just took place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I put the question forward because many people were coming to me 
expressing concern that the government was out of control, that 
it was growing bigger and bigger and becoming less accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As was mentioned previously, Canadians are afraid of the tax 
department.  They are afraid of Revenue Canada.  Why?  Because 
the bureaucracy wields great power and the ordinary citizen feels 
quite helpless before it.  It appears to extract the maximum 
amount of money from them without informing them of their rights 
or the minimum amount that would be payable. The Income Tax Act 
is overly complex, as we know, and it is intimidating. The key 
point is that Canadians would rather have a thief break into 
their house than deal with the tax department.  People have told 
me that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My point is that this bill will only make things worse.  There 
will be less accountability.  I can only support this initiative 
if there is a built-in structure.  I would like to ask for the 
member's comments with regard to the proposal I am putting 
forward. There should be a built-in structure that protects 
taxpayers and those importing goods into Canada or exporting 
goods out of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to look at what happened with harmonization in eastern 
Canada.  Has it improved efficiency?  Not that I am aware of.  In 
fact, I understand there are provinces that want to pull out of 
it, like Nova Scotia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need an agency to protect taxpayers, one that will make sure 
they are treated fairly and justly and not in an arbitrary 
manner.  We need an agency that will help resolve disputes or 
problems with Revenue Canada. I think before we can support this 
bill, we have to have that agency in place.  I would like to know 
if my colleague has any comments in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, yes I agree completely with 
the comments of my colleague.   As the House may know, the Reform 
Party has the objective of protecting the rights of Canadians. 
With that, we desire to put forward an office for taxpayer 
protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly, part of this legislation must be the protection of the 
taxpayer.  We cannot allow ourselves to slip into the Internal 
Revenue Service model that there is in the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation is grossly inadequate in that respect. 
Therefore there is no way we could possibly support it in its 
present form. 
<P><A NAME="LINK203"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have 
a quick question for the member for Kootenay—Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was listening to his comments about cutting the timber on the 
ranches and the very real fear among constituents straight across 
this country from coast to coast to coast of capital gains. There 
is a misunderstanding of the whole problem of dealing with 
capital gains and income within a family for future generations. 
The understanding is that all this capital gains has already been 
taxed, that we have paid tax on everything we have acquired 
throughout a life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Very quickly, I think part of the problem especially in forestry 
issues is that there is no way the Income Tax Act can accommodate 
the growth of capital in forest land prior to the 40, 50 or 60 
years it takes to produce that fibre.  All of a sudden there is a 
windfall profit and it cannot be claimed in the ensuing 10, 20 or 
40-year period after it has been acquired. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I understand there is 
current legislation that applies to official woodlot operations. 
Those are commercial woodlot operations that will probably have 
some kind of a sustainable cycle within the production of wood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think what the member is referring to and certainly what I am 
referring to is where there is timber available and a 
desirability on the part of the lumber producers to buy that 
timber, how is taxing the revenue from that timber handled?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The decision that was a standing decision by Revenue Canada was 
that log would be valued on the basis of capital gain as opposed 
to income because we could not write off expenses against that 
log. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was the way these people paid their taxes and I submit that 
because there was so much revenue left on the table according to 
Revenue Canada when it looked at all these returns, Revenue 
Canada simply retroactively said it is not going to do it that 
way, has gone back to them and is trying to extract money after 
the fact by retroactively changing the law.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia—Matane, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
carefully to my colleague and I realize that, when there is a 
real problem, the government comes up with an agency or 
committees.  It always puts the problem off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion, governing means having the courage to introduce 
effective things and not to try to double or triple certain 
organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the subject of the agency.  I would ask my colleague how it 
could do better and how it should be set up so that it will be 
really effective, not for the government, but for our fellow 
citizens. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I suggest within the 
legislation as it is presently written there is the possibility 
for improvements on what is presently going on with respect to 
the fact that we have such a giant bureaucracy and it comes under 
the public service rules and so on and so forth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see some light in this legislation.  The legislation is not 
all dark.  But the difficulty is that if we are going to go ahead 
and proceed to pass this legislation, as I am sure the government 
will, we have not done away with the threat, and I use that word 
advisedly, to ordinary citizens and ordinary law abiding 
taxpayers who feel threatened by Revenue Canada.  These citizens 
are going to feel equally if not more threatened by this agency 
because the government has not corrected the problem.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise to speak to Bill C-43 at second reading.  This 
bill creates the Canada customs and revenue agency.  What is 
this bill all about? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Revenue is proposing to change the existing 
structure of the Department of Revenue and make Revenue Canada 
an agency that is quasi independent of the government.  It would 
have the job of collecting taxes, and not only for the federal 
government.  The government is also proposing that this new 
customs and revenue agency negotiate agreements to collect taxes 
of all sorts, including sales and real estate taxes, with the 
provinces and even the municipalities, which, it must be pointed 
out, come under the provincial governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government wants to create—Revenue Canada is already an 
imposing structure—a bureaucratic monster whose tentacles will 
extend as far as municipalities.  It does not, first of all, 
make any sense to create this sort of bureaucratic world.  It is 
worthy of the fertile imagination of senior Revenue Canada 
officials, who want to keep, and not only keep, but increase 
their power at the expense of a minister, who is malleable and 
weak and who allows senior officials to do his job and make his 
decisions for him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The creation of this agency is also an act against the unions 
and the workers of Revenue Canada.  The transfer of Revenue 
Canada's responsibilities to a quasi independent agency would 
displace 40,000 workers, or some 20% of the public service. These 
workers would no longer be protected by the Public Service 
Employment Act. And so, within two years, these workers could be 
the victims of the senior officials.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These senior government officials have already been awarded wage 
increases of 19% while public service employees had their 
salaries frozen for several years. Wage cuts were even imposed 
in some cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this agency, 14,000 workers are excluded from the Public 
Service Employment Act, while Revenue Canada tycoons—that is 
the senior officials, as the minister has hardly any say left in 
the matter—are given the power to treat these workers as they 
see fit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do you have any idea of the huge amount of confidential 
information that will be processed by this agency operating 
almost at arm's length from the government if such a 
bureaucratic monster is established to collect all the taxes it 
wants from the provinces and municipalities? Knowing that the 
confidentiality of information, an issue to which Canadians are 
very sensitive, is jeopardized by the fact that various 
databanks change hands to accommodate the changing needs of 
companies, one can wonder what will become of data 
confidentiality with an agency like this one, which will be less 
accountable to Parliament and to the minister than Revenue 
Canada currently is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada Customs and Revenue Agency is a flagrant example of 
senior officials' thirst for power. 
As I recall, less than three years ago, the auditor general 
revealed a scandal that we in the Bloc Quebecois had denounced 
in the 1993 election campaign: the family trust scandal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>About three years ago, the auditor general indicated that, on 
December 23, 1991, around midnight, without consulting their 
ministers or even being accountable—no need to establish an 
agency for that purpose—senior officials from Revenue Canada, 
Finance Canada and Justice Canada decided to transfer $2 billion 
in family trusts to the United States without collecting a penny 
in tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the senior bureaucrats at Revenue Canada, at the Department 
of Finance and at the Department of Justice were able to do that 
under the existing framework, you can imagine what would happen 
with this Canada customs and revenue agency, with a 
quasi-independent body that would not be accountable to 
parliament. Members should ask how many such cases would go 
unnoticed, without parliament being informed of these scandals 
and of these decisions by senior bureaucrats, who would then 
control the collection of taxes and all the data bases 
containing confidential information on Quebeckers and Canadians. 
It makes no sense at all to delegate so much power to 
bureaucrats. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where is the support for this agency? The government should 
table, along with the bill, the agreements signed with provinces 
and municipalities. No such agreements have yet been signed. The 
government is creating a bureaucratic monster. 
There are no agreements to implement, but hundreds of public 
servants have already been assigned to work on the new agency 
and design the new system that the Minister of Revenue wants to 
impose on us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation has no support. Quebec and Ontario have opposed 
the bill. Even the western provinces which, at first, seemed 
lukewarm to the idea, are now opposed to the establishment of 
the agency. Where is the support? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the same thing in the private sector. The Canadian 
Federation of Independent Business opposed the creation of a 
quasi-independent Canada customs and revenue agency. 
The Canadian Federation of Independent Business indicated that 
40% of the businesses that participated in a study sponsored by 
Revenue Canada and conducted by the Public Policy Forum see no 
point in having this agency, while over two thirds of these 
businesses feel that, with such an agency, the costs relating to 
their dealings with the department would be higher than they are 
under the existing structure, or similar. In other words, things 
would not change, except perhaps for the worse. The bill also 
provides for the establishment of a board of management.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be in addition to the existing structure of Revenue 
Canada.  It would be transferred to the agency.  An additional 
level of administration is thus being created.  It also gives 
the Revenue Canada mandarins the freedom to pay themselves 
salaries comparable to those in the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are given this latitude by clause 30.(1), which reads as 
follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>30. (1) The Agency has authority over all matters relating to: 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(a) general administrative policy in the Agency; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(b) the organization of the Agency; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(c) Agency real property [—] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(d) personnel management, including the determination of the 
terms and conditions of employment of persons employed by the 
Agency. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without consulting the Minister of Revenue, they will be free to 
determine the terms and conditions of employment of the 40,000 
workers who will be exempted from the Public Service Employment 
Act.  They will also be able to pay themselves astronomical 
salaries comparable to those in the private sector.  What fun 
they will have, our mandarins.  They will increase their powers 
for the personal satisfaction of having complete control. 
Clause 30.(1) also leaves them free to give themselves salary 
increases.  This is ridiculous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, by creating a quasi-independent agency, the 
government is increasing the chances of fraud and the risk that 
confidential information will be sold. 
There is a lucrative market for such information right now in 
the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are no benefits to creating such an agency.  We do not 
understand why the Minister of Revenue and the Liberal 
government are so bent on going ahead with this plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, we will continue to oppose the creation of this 
agency, because it makes no sense.  It offers nothing, but may 
well carry a very high cost for taxpayers, especially when it 
deprives them of their democratic right to have a minister 
accountable to Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When there are problems, as there often are in our ridings—my 
Bloc Quebecois colleagues have encountered them, as have I in my 
own riding—problems having to do with the administration of 
taxes, or incorrect rulings on the part of Revenue Canada, we 
will no longer be able to question the minister. 
He will reply that the agency is calling the shots, that it is 
quasi-independent.  He will no longer have any say, and democracy 
will suffer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Service to Quebeckers and Canadians will be weakened by a puppet 
minister, one with no powers and no backbone, trying to stand up 
to the Revenue Canada mandarins.  They want the power, the money 
and the power that that money brings.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am glad 
to have the opportunity to speak to Bill C-43, a bill which I 
believe will have profound effects of my community of Dartmouth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill will convert Revenue Canada, a government department 
accountable to parliament through a minister, to a separate 
agency with authority which for most other departments and 
agencies is vested in Treasury Board and the Public Service 
Commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This to me is another example of this government's determination 
to privatize public services. We have seen the Department of 
Transport privatize airport services, we have seen the 
privatization of ports, of services in our military, of training, 
of postal services. The government now wants to privatize the 
collection of our taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Generally speaking I reject the notion that the private sector 
is somehow better than the public sector. There is no proof to 
that contention and it just does not make much sense to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently I had the opportunity to meet with representatives of 
the workers currently in Revenue Canada who represent the union 
of taxation workers.  They were in my office in Dartmouth last 
week.  They presented me with some material which was quite 
disturbing and very educating on this issue.  I am a firm 
believer that many of my best ideas I hear from my constituents 
and I would like to put some of this background material on the 
record: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the notion of the Canada customs and revenue agency was 
first mentioned in the 1996 Speech from the Throne, it was 
presented as a cost effective, more efficient vehicle for 
improving service to the public.  With the primary mandate to 
assume tax administration and collection functions from 
provincial and municipal governments, it was also touted as a 
means of strengthening the Canadian federation and contributing 
to national unity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We submit that the events have overtaken the agency concept to 
the point that it fails to meet its stated objectives.  The 
agency cannot now be justified on the basis of either 
bureaucratic efficiency or cost effectiveness.  Its original 
business plan is in tatters.  Its supporting arguments are 
riddled with contradictions, misstatements of fact and flimsy 
rationalization.  The concept of the Canada customs and revenue 
agency is bad policy and should be stopped before it starts.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Their document continues to discuss how the original idea for 
the agency was to implement the HST across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know about the public attitude to the HST, which people in 
Dartmouth still call the BST with a heavy emphasis on the BS. The 
size of the 1998 Nova Scotia Liberal caucus shows strongly how 
Nova Scotians feel about this tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the fact that there is no mood for expansion of this 
tax in this country, nor is there a single agreement with any 
other province for the implementation of this mother of all 
taxation agencies, shows how far the government has misread the 
country on the question surrounding Bill C-43. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the government doing it?  I think it just likes to 
privatize.  It thinks it pleases its business friends.  However, 
in this case even that call seems to be the wrong one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Going back to the same document, I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The business community was supposed to be the biggest beneficiary 
of the new Agency.  However, doubtless to the dismay of the 
Agency's bureaucratic backers, the response has been ambivalent. 
Small business organizations—such as the Canadian Federation of 
Independent Business—are particularly leery of the massive, 
centralized power the Agency would possess. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A full 40 per cent of business respondents to a Public Policy 
Forum study, commissioned by Revenue Canada, saw no advantage to 
the Agency.  More than two-thirds thought it would either 
increase or maintain their costs of dealing with the Department 
as currently structured! 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The administration of tax, an ancient right which has 
historically led to events such as the Magna Carta and the 
American revolution, will be hidden away in a separate agency 
which a minister will be responsible for sort of.  After all, he 
does not run the agency and does not manage it on a day to day 
basis, so his accountability will be indirect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is bad enough to have witnessed the solicitor general 
recently covering for the Prime Minister about APEC, but if Bill 
C-43 passes we will see the Minister of National Revenue covering 
for an agency which is run by a board of directors that he does 
not even select. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliamentary democracy is based on ministerial accountability 
to parliament.  However, with the Liberals' obsession to grab 
more power another principle is expendable.  If this bill is 
passed it will be five years before this House will look at it 
again.  A lot can go wrong in five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Nova Scotia rejected the government in a rather 
absolute fashion in the last election and one of their main 
concerns was the HST.  The fact that the government would bring 
in this bill, partly based on the theory that the HST will become 
a reality in all provinces, suggests that this bill is fatally 
flawed from its conception. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other very sneaky parts to this bill which must be 
mentioned and must be put into context with other power-grabbing 
Liberal policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This new agency will have the power—in fact one could see this 
as a responsibility—to impose user fees on Canadians who use tax 
services.  They could start charging us a user fee to obey the 
law and pay our taxes.  This is a ridiculous notion.  It is also 
a mean notion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This Liberal government did away with our universal safety net 
when it abolished the Canada assistance act.  As a result of this 
action and the deliberate underfunding of health, post-secondary 
education and social assistance transfers to the provincial 
governments, means testing has become an increasing fact of life 
for the increasing multitude of poor in our country.  To be 
eligible for many provincial programs, catastrophic prescription 
drug programs, student bursaries and some welfare services, the 
applicant must produce their tax records from the previous year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It may come as a shock to the cabinet, which seems to see the 
world through corporate eyes, but poor people do not have 
accountants. One of the few things Canadians can still get from 
their federal government without charge is their tax assessment 
from the previous year.  They just go into the office, show their 
SIN card and great public service employees give them great 
service.  They then can go to their underfunded provincial 
programs to receive basic services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that under the new agency proposed in Bill C-43 poor 
Canadians will be asked to pay for their tax records, a charge 
some will be unable to pay.  This will place their access to 
other programs at risk and make life even more difficult for them 
and their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality of the Liberal government is that it believes 
Canadians are best served by quiet cabinet orders, by a 
contracted out public service with no regard to actual service to 
the public. 
That is what Bill C-43 is all about.

independent and well-loved agencies like the CBC and the NFB, 
placing them under direct cabinet control as proposed in Bill 
C-44. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will candidly say that Bill C-43 is flawed, as the overall 
thrust of this government is flawed.  On behalf of the thousands 
of citizens and their families in my riding who work for Revenue 
Canada I will oppose this bill.  I believe it is a wrong-headed 
bill.  I would like to see it defeated.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure today to speak in the House not necessarily about some 
of the provisions that are in in Bill C-43, but rather the lack 
of provisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-43 would establish the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency 
and would amend and repeal other acts as a consequence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a myriad of things that could be done to improve the 
taxation system in Canada.  Every member has a list of grievances 
from constituents as long as their arm.  They stretch from some 
of the more mundane things, such as HST taxation in Nova Scotia, 
which is very important to those constituents, or the GST, all 
the way over to tax free electronic transmissions which amount to 
trillions of dollars per day throughout the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps this bill should not be thrown out entirely, but there 
are huge pieces that should be rejected because of what it does 
not do.  I am not proposing that we throw the baby out with the 
bathwater; I am proposing that we take a look at really doing 
something with taxation in this country that would benefit 
individuals, the men and the women who elect us to represent them 
in this House of Parliament of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to speak directly to one issue mentioned earlier by 
the hon. member for Kootenay—Columbia.  That issue brought a 
little relevance to this discussion.  It is the issue of capital 
gains. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I rose earlier in this House and reported to members that 
capital gains is a very unfair tax because we are taxed on income 
that we have worked all our lives for and we have already paid 
tax on.  I find capital gains to be despicable.  That is the only 
word I can use to fully explain it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a lack of direction.  We have put questions in the 
House to the Minister of Finance on capital gains taxation on 
private woodlots in Canada.  Those questions were simply put 
aside as if they were of no importance.  They are of importance 
to the more than 450,000 private woodlot owners in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Private woodlot taxation has never been looked at as any type of 
issue in Canada.  It has never been looked at in a realistic way 
to, first, improve revenue on woodlots for the people who own 
them and, second, to actually generate, in the long term, more 
revenue by producing more jobs, thus producing more revenue for 
the Government of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a real problem with capital gains taxation on private 
woodlots which take 40, 50 or 60 years to grow.  It is beyond the 
realm of this government and many governments before it to 
imagine the scope of it.  Unfortunately, most politicians think 
from election to election and do not look at the future.  We try 
to encompass that once in awhile.  Sometimes we are partially 
successful in doing it.  But we do not do a good enough job at 
it.  Capital gains taxation on private woodlots is one way we 
could come to grips with some of the issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it takes 40, 50 or 60 years to grow a woodlot in this 
country, in many instances there is no income derived from that 
woodlot for 40 years.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of a sudden the woodlot owner finds himself or herself with 
a windfall gain against which they do not have the opportunity to 
claim any, or very little expense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unless they are a farmer they do not have the option of taking 
the $500,000 capital gains exemption.  They have the same capital 
gains exemption of $100,000 that every ordinary citizen in Canada 
has.  It is inadequate.  It does not cover the cost of fibre on 
the woodlot today, which has increased dramatically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A private woodlot of approximately 125 acres, or 50 hectares, 20 
years ago might have generated $80,000 or $90,000 worth of 
stumpage.  Today that might generate $500,000 worth of stumpage. 
There is no comparison.  The government may as well wake up now 
and find a way to accommodate that in our taxation laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There should be a method, there should be some utilization of 
that income, where it can be put back into the ground, the 
forest, the farm, the woodlot and the expenses that will be 
incurred over a period of perhaps 20 years after harvest will be 
incorporated into that tax gain over time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That has not been approached.  I have certainly discussed it 
directly with the minister.  There has been no attempt to 
accommodate anything like that.  The Canadian Private Woodlot 
Owners Association and certainly the private woodlot owners 
association in the Atlantic provinces have lobbied the minister 
very diligently to do something positive about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are facing all kinds of crises in our forests.  We have WTO 
obligations that we have to live up to.  We have unfair trade 
practices going on in the U.S. and discrimination against 
softwood lumber products.  We have ISO 14000 certification.  We 
have the stewardship of forests in Canada certification. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of these things are being put on the shoulders of private 
woodlot owners and forest companies in Canada and the government 
is refusing to allow any kind of a tax break to deal with them. 
It is refusing to back down on its capital gains for private 
woodlot owners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to certify a property and have sustainable forest 
management, how can that be done as a woodlot owner in any 
province of Canada?  If the woodlot was inherited or purchased 
30, 40 or 50 years ago and now has a harvest of timber that will 
probably be valued in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, there 
is no way to claim that.  There is no incentive for the owner to 
put anything back into the forest.  That man or woman is facing a 
discriminatory tax regime against progressive forest management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is like a cat or a dog chasing its tail.  It goes around and 
around and around.  Somehow, some way, we have to get the message 
through to the government that it needs to deal with the issues 
of the day, the issues that are important to all Canadians, the 
issues that create jobs in the country and not simply go off on 
some tangent and revise the entire financial act or the entire 
Revenue Canada act.  There are other ways to do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not proposing for a moment that the system we have is the 
best system we could have, but these changes do not incorporate 
the very real changes that are needed in order to produce income, 
especially for private woodlot families, farm families and 
individual investors in this country, so that they could put 
money back into their woodlots and have a sustainable forest to 
meet the ISO 14000 guidelines, to meet the forest stewardship of 
Canada guidelines and to continue to export lumber as we have 
done for 500 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish for just a brief moment that the government would look at 
some of the possibilities that are in front of it instead of 
going off and trying to write the map from scratch.  It is not 
dealing with the issues.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Mercier (Terrebonne—Blainville, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Canada Customs and Revenue Agency is not the first agency the 
federal government has set up to take over its responsibilities. 
There have been a number of others, and we end up wondering why 
exactly Ottawa created these agencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To get to the bottom of the matter, I would like to cite a 
number of other recently created organizations Ottawa has 
delegated its responsibilities to, and by trying to find out 
what these creations have in common we may perhaps discover the 
profound reasons for the government's creating them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of them is Aéroports de Montréal.  ADM, we will recall, 
decided to move international flights from Mirabel to Dorval, 
thus shelving a public investment of $2 billion and throwing the 
regional economy into chaos.  The status of ADM is such that it 
has never had to publicly justify its decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked the minister about this, and he said, in substance, 
although not in these terms, naturally, “I wash my hands of the 
matter”.  This is the Pontius Pilate type response so perfectly 
offered by the Prime Minister when he said “We can drop one of 
the two airports, this is not going to cause me to lose any 
sleep”.  Obviously, had ADM not been created, the Minister of 
Transport would not have been able to treat the matter so 
offhandedly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nav Canada, another creation by Ottawa, is another private 
organization, which manages aids to navigation. 
Nav Canada does not have to justify its decisions either. If, 
some day, Nav Canada decided to remove the control tower at an 
airport, it would not have to justify its decision, even though 
public interest would be involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, in that particular case, if the federal government had 
retained its powers, it would not be so flippant in its answers 
and it would have to justify its decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another good example is the millennium scholarship fund. As we 
all know, the federal government reduced its transfers to the 
provinces, including those for education, and it used the money 
saved to establish this millennium scholarship fund, obviously 
for political visibility. Here again, the body that will manage 
the $2 billion in public money will not have to justify any of 
its decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These three initiatives are similar in that the federal 
government can act like Pontius Pilate, not provide any 
explanations and avoid the obligations it had in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The customs agency seems to be structured along the same lines. 
It will not be accountable, even though we are told the minister 
will remain in charge, or that he will at least have the right 
to question its management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that, by creating this agency, the federal 
government is avoiding responsibilities that it would otherwise 
have, as evidenced by clause 8 of the bill. Under this 
provision, public servants will not be governed by framework 
legislation such as the Public Service Employment Act. This 
means that 40,000 public servants, or 20% of the federal public 
service, will be at the mercy of the agency's board of 
management. The directors of the agency will certainly earn more 
than the department's senior bureaucrats currently do, but who 
will pay for this? 
It is the support staff, the record processing workers and 
others, in fact the majority of employees. The government is 
privatizing part of the public service.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the minister is asked about this, he will say “I wash my 
hands of this.  It's the agency, not me”.  It is all very well 
for the minister to say he will retain a degree of control over 
the agency, but the same bill also states that the minister may 
authorize the commissioner or any other person employed or 
engaged by the agency to exercise or perform on the minister's 
behalf any power, duty or function of the minister under any act 
of parliament, with the exception of making regulations.  In 
other words, this is an agency within the hands of a 
super-bureaucrat who is neither elected nor accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot really see what the public stands to gain from the 
creation of this agency.  We do, however, see what those in 
power hope to gain from it. 
Once again, an opportunity to wash their hands of something. 
Once again, an opportunity to slough off any obligations for 
transparency they would have otherwise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, as well, an opportunity to play their favourite game 
of finding jobs for cronies, because clauses 15, 22 and 25 
create a 15-member board of management.  These, with the 
exception of the chair, the commissioner, a deputy commissioner, 
are appointed for three years from a list of recommendations. 
The chair, commissioner and deputy commissioner are appointed by 
the governor in council for a term of five years.  Great jobs 
for political staff. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are no longer any limits to the Liberals' arrogance.  They 
are side-stepping obligations which any normal government assumes 
and preserves, since they are almost royal in nature.  This 
federal government, however, is side-stepping them for the 
reasons I have given. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To be objective, however, I must state that there is one 
advantage to this bill.  That advantage is that it will be even 
more help than ever in convincing Quebeckers that the only 
solution for getting out of such a rotten regime is sovereignty.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise this afternoon to speak on Bill C-43, an act to 
establish the Canada customs and revenue agency and to amend and 
repeal other acts as a consequence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just to set the tone for my remarks, I want to read from a 
letter which was sent to me by one of my constituents: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“Dear Mr. Earle: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a public servant with Revenue Canada.  I am writing to you 
to voice my concern with the proposed Canada customs revenue 
agency. As an employee of Revenue Canada, I have a vested 
interest in the department as it exists today and may be greatly 
affected if the intended changes to the agency status are 
implemented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“If Bill C-43 is passed, I feel that the new agency will be 
less efficient than the status quo.  The agency would also 
threaten the personal privacy of taxpayers. Finally, I feel that 
the agency would not deliver promised cost savings and may even 
lend to the imposition of user fees by both business and the 
general public for the privilege of paying taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“In closing I ask that you review in depth the proposal for the 
Canada customs revenue agency.  I do not feel the changes will be 
in the best interests of myself, the provinces and the people”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is one letter of many that I received from people in my 
constituency. All the letters I received had the same kinds of 
concerns expressed.  Some have gone even further to indicate: 
“The fact that my position will be guaranteed for only two years 
after the agency commences as well as a threat to my negotiated 
benefits greatly disturbs me.  I also find it difficult to trust 
an employer who has allowed our collective agreement to expire 
over a year ago”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although I have many points that I could speak on, I want to 
speak briefly on a few that have been raised by people within my 
constituency, concerns that have been expressed about this new 
creation that will take place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first is that the agency will become a mega taxman, and the 
term mega is being used a lot nowadays.  We hear about it in 
terms of the proposed bank mergers, megabanks, and for some 
reason people, the government in particular, seem to feel bigger 
is better. But I am reminded of an expression that my mother 
taught me many years ago which was that good things come in small 
packages. 
We all must appreciate that small things are very important and 
have their place.  For example, a big vehicle can come to a stop 
because of a very small micro computer chip or a very small part 
in its engine.  So bigger is not always better.

<A HREF="#LINKT32"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is concern that this new agency will become a very large 
agency. We realize there are over 40,000 employees with Revenue 
Canada and $2.2 billion in revenue will be transferred to this 
agency.  It proposes to administer everything from provincial 
sales taxes to gasoline taxes to liquor taxes.  The vision would 
see a mega taxman who would offer even services to the 
municipalities. Do we really want Ottawa involved in our property 
taxes and things like that? Do we really want to put this much 
power in the hands of a government agency? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A second concern that has been expressed is that the agency will 
reduce accountability to the public and to parliament.  This has 
been expressed by my colleague who spoke earlier and by others. 
We know that Revenue Canada as it presently exists is accountable 
through a minister, but with the creation of a new kind of arm's 
length agency there will be less and less accountability.  As 
envisaged, this agency's enabling legislation will permit a full 
parliamentary review only five years after it has begun 
operation.  We know a lot can happen in five years. That has been 
stated already.  A lot can go wrong in that period of time. We do 
need to be concerned about the accountability function that will 
be sorely lacking if this new bill is passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another important concern is the agency could jeopardize 
personal privacy.  The aspect of personal privacy was one of the 
themes that rang throughout the many letters that came to my 
office in the constituency. We know we live in an electronic 
world today where there is more and more information about 
ourselves and our families being quite often sold by various 
companies, by private sector organizations all the way from 
credit card companies to charities to consumer goods and 
companies.  We realize that our personal privacy is a very 
important feature today.  We can see what is happening when we 
look at the APEC inquiry and the concern that is coming forth as 
we see documents being tabled which show that there have been 
security investigations and for whatever reason people's names 
being placed on lists without their knowledge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the kind of society we live in today.  There is a great 
concern about this new agency becoming a big brother where there 
will be a great deal of financial and other information about 
citizens available through this agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even internal memos in Revenue Canada have acknowledged: “There 
are privacy concerns among some stakeholders related to the 
creation of a big brother.  Everyone should share these 
concerns”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will mention another concern that was raised which was spoken 
of earlier.  It is the effect of harmonization of the GST and the 
provincial sales tax beyond the maritimes. This was something as 
we know that started out with the government's intention of doing 
this right across the country.  Originally this idea was to make 
sure that all provinces had a harmonized tax system but it only 
went as far as the maritimes.  People in the maritimes have 
spoken loud and clear about how displeased they are with that 
effort in their area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people might say there is an advantage to a combined 
administration.  You will not have to deal with two taxes. You 
will have to deal with only one.  But we know that one tax 
extends further and further into the lives of ordinary citizens 
causing them to pay tax on things they normally would not have to 
pay tax on and creating a great deal of hardship for lower and 
middle income people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This concept of the blended sales tax is something we should be 
very careful of and the intent of this new agency will probably 
carry it beyond what we see even today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather than go on at some length about the many disadvantages of 
this new agency that will be created, I conclude with a few 
remarks in a letter from another constituent. These remarks hit 
the nail on the head about the kinds of things we should be 
concerned about with respect to this bill: “How will the agency 
be accountable to us?  By our MPs at present, when the 
organization is no longer a government department?  If the 
government is looking for something to spend millions of dollars 
on, here is an idea, our health care system”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That constituent makes a very real and important point that we 
should get our priorities straight and in order. She says “As a 
voter and taxpayer I am taking this moment to let you, my 
representative in parliament, know that I want this tax monster 
stopped and that we the taxpayers are tired of the government 
wasting tax dollars on things that are redundant and not 
necessary”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that says it all.  With those remarks I would say that 
we are opposed to the bill.  We trust the people of Canada will 
express their concern and that members of the House will express 
the same concern and not support the bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réjean Lefebvre (Champlain, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to rise today to speak on Bill C-43, to establish the 
Canada customs and revenue agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the agency is, first, to provide programs and 
services in a more efficient and cost-effective manner, through 
greater autonomy and flexibility; second, to improve services 
and reduce the cost of administering revenues and enforcement by 
working with the provinces to eliminate duplication and overlap; 
third, to strengthen the effectiveness of the Canadian 
federation and foster national unity by making the agency 
responsible for providing federal, provincial and even municipal 
services to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third objective mysteriously disappeared when the second 
progress report was tabled. None of the provinces has agreed to 
enter into an agreement. The provinces, with the exception of 
Manitoba, remain unenthusiastic about the establishment of such 
an agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the face of this opposition, Revenue Canada's spokesperson, 
Michel Cléroux, explained that the provinces had not said no. 
That is not a very good explanation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agency will not produce the promised savings. Its promoters 
recognized from the start that the greatest savings would come 
from harmonizing taxation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we all know that the extension of the harmonized or 
blended sales tax flew like a lead balloon. In addition, the 
proposed agency will not require the provinces to pay for tax 
collection and treatment when the provincial program is fully 
harmonized with a federal taxation program. This free service 
does not represent a cost reduction but a cost increase for the 
agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agency's status will also enable its executives to pay 
themselves salaries comparable to those of business leaders in 
the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regardless of the position one adopts on this matter, one must 
recognize that it constitutes a new item of expenditure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Coming at a time when the morale of public servants who are not 
in executive positions is suffering seriously after a six-year 
freeze, it must not be lost sight of that, since April 1, the 
present government has awarded its executives raises of up to 
19%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agency has already cost the taxpayer rather dearly. 
Thousands of departmental employees have been involved in design 
teams and other internal exercises aimed at turning the dream of 
senior management into reality. A good part of the focus of 
Revenue Canada has been turned away from more important and more 
pressing matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give an example. You will recall a CBC program which 
reported that, according to Department of National Revenue 
documents, over 500 of the 1,500 auditor positions in the 
Toronto region were vacant. This situation would mean a 
shortfall for the federal treasury in this region of over $500 
million in 1997. 
We estimate the loss would be over $2 billion for all of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agency would be a less effective solution than the status 
quo. The myth surrounding the agency is that it could provide 
tax services more cheaply and more effectively. However, the 
structure proposed for the new agency adds another level of 
bureaucracy in the form of an appointed board of management, 
which would have nothing more than a supervisory role. 
Nevertheless, time, money and staff must be provided for the 
board and its staff. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency would 
report to Treasury Board on administrative matters, such as its 
activity and human resources plans.

<A HREF="#LINKT34"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agency would upset the balance between tax policy and tax 
collection. There is, at the present time, a healthy balance 
between the structure and tax policy, which should be left up to 
the department and the Minister of Finance, and enforcement of 
this policy, which is the responsibility of the Minister of 
Revenue and his department, the Department of National Revenue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agency's status would upset this balance. The agency's 
bureaucrats would inevitably launch into a turf war with their 
Department of Finance counterparts. This would be a costly and 
unproductive exercise that would serve the interests of no one 
but the mandarins. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agency would open the door to bureaucratic patronage and the 
abuse of power. 
In practice, the agency would have carte blanche with respect to 
contracts, and with respect to the management of property, 
materiel, information and technology. With limited outside 
scrutiny, the risk of favouritism and abuse of power by 
bureaucrats is very, very high. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agency would pose a threat to taxpayers' privacy. If the 
agency were actually to achieve its objectives, personal 
information would be concentrated in a large organization not 
directly overseen directly by Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, internal departmental documents indicate that the 
creation of a “big brother” raises concerns among some of those 
involved with privacy issues. We share those concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do the experts and the business sector have to say  about 
this agency? Nothing good. 
In his report of December 1997, the Auditor General of Canada 
voiced concerns about the accountability of the proposed agency 
by asking:  “What assurance will the people of Canada and 
parliamentarians have that the public interest is protected?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, a Public Policy Forum, or PPF, study commissioned by 
Revenue Canada reported that Canadian business had serious 
reservations about the creation of this agency.  The PPF report 
referred to the agency's objective of rationalizing and 
simplifying tax collection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, 40% of the businesses the PPF surveyed saw no advantage 
to a single national collection agency and 68% felt that such an 
agency would add to their compliance costs, or have no effect 
whatsoever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we have seen, then, the promise of a single tax collection 
agency did nothing to bring about the harmonization of taxes in 
all provinces. For all these reasons, the Bloc Quebecois and I 
will be voting against the bill. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK211"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to take part in the debate this afternoon and to remind 
viewers that we are dealing with Bill C-43, which is an attempt 
by the government to repeal the Department of National Revenue 
Act to convert Revenue Canada from a fully accountable government 
department to an autonomous arm's length business oriented agency 
with broad management authority over national revenue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in this caucus will oppose the bill on principle.  We are 
aware that some 40,000 employees in Revenue Canada now make up 
about 20% of the federal public service.  The move would involve 
the transfer of more than $2 billion in annual parliamentary 
estimates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is glorifying the role of private sector 
appointees and seems to think that the public sector can only run 
on private sector principles.  What is at stake here is a move 
toward an independent agency without the support of major 
provinces.  Nor does it seem to have the support of the majority 
of workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are at least three provinces firmly opposed.  Two other 
provinces have not endorsed the concept.  I think it is fair to 
say that all provinces generally see the agency as an intrusion 
into provincial jurisdiction.  Not only the provinces and the 
workers but Canadian businesses have major reservations about the 
proposed agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The public policy forum study commissioned by Revenue Canada 
found that among the businesses surveyed some 68% believed a 
single tax collection agency would either increase their 
compliance cost or have absolutely no impact whatsoever.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The commissioner of customs and revenue instead of a deputy 
minister would become the chief executive officer of the agency 
responsible for its day to day operations.  According to the 
proposed bill, the governor in council would appoint the chair of 
the board, the commissioner and the deputy commissioner for a 
term of five years.  The agency will still be subject to the 
access to information and privacy acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is claiming that the agency will provide better, 
more cost effective service to the public, to business, to the 
provinces and territories by bringing about tax harmonization 
with the provinces and therefore huge tax savings resulting from 
the elimination of such things as duplication and overlaps in tax 
administration among various levels of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A second point it advocates is that it promotes a stronger 
partnership with the provinces and territories which, the 
government believes, may then hire directly this new agency for 
the delivery of programs according to service levels and 
performance targets specified in the contract. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an aside, I suggest that the government should consider how 
the Atlantic provinces of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and 
Newfoundland have fared under the ill fated and loathed HST to 
see whether they think it is something that should be transposed 
on the rest of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another point the government argues is that it creates a leaner 
and more efficient delivery of tax services to be achieved 
through the agency's enhanced operational flexibility and 
autonomy inspired by the business culture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government believes the agency will combine the best of both 
worlds.  It will make the organization more accountable to its 
clients and partners and set high private sector standards while 
ensuring that the current powers of the Minister of National 
Revenue and accountability to parliament will be protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We oppose the bill, as I indicated, on a number of different 
grounds.  First we oppose it for some philosophical reasons.  I 
have talked about the 40,000 employees, the $2 billion transfer 
and annual parliamentary estimates that would be at stake. The 
government glorifies the role of private sector appointees and 
seems to think the public sector can only run on private sector 
principles.  The government would certainly take credit for 
slashing expenditures by $2.2 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is frankly appalling that the control of tax collection, 
which is a historical prerogative of the state, is about to be 
abandoned, if the government has its way, almost by stealth to 
the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a whole history of economists over the last 200 or 300 
years who may have been absolutely firm in terms of free 
enterprise and the like.  They firmly believed, nevertheless, 
that the collection and control of taxes was a prerogative solely 
of the state, so important that it should remain completely in 
the hands of the state. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can think in our own time that even such advocates of free 
enterprise and the market as the former prime minister of Great 
Britain, Margaret Thatcher, and the recently deposed chancellor 
of Germany, Helmut Kohl, never went so far in their drive to 
privatize as to contract out, in effect, the collection of taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, we oppose it for political reasons.  We believe the 
government in its move toward an independent agency is doing so 
without the support of the provinces.  The major stakeholders 
simply are not buying.  They have run this one up the flag pole 
but few, if any, are saluting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have mentioned that the provinces are opposed, specifically 
Ontario, Quebec and Prince Edward Island.  B.C. and Saskatchewan 
refuse to endorse the concept.  Alberta supported the concept 
probably for ideological reasons but pointed out that members 
needed to be reminded that Alberta does not have a sales tax and 
administers its own program.  There is fading possibility that it 
might sign over any day soon the administration of its provincial 
income tax to this federal agency.  I have also mentioned the 
reservation of Canadian businesses and the study that public 
policy forum conducted with those businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We think for ethical reasons we should look at what happened in 
the United States, specifically with the Internal Revenue 
Service.  In the evolvement and development of the IRS there are 
dangers for us in an non-controlled agency. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1700"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The IRS is a government department and not a fully independent 
agency.  It has extensive powers and operates under stringent 
private sector performance standards similar to those that would 
be entrusted to the agency by Bill C-43. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Historically the powers conferred to the IRS resulted from 
pressures from the Federal Bureau of Investigation on Congress 
for the creation of an independent agency to fight corruption and 
organized crime back in the Al Capone days of the twenties and 
thirties.  These powers were then used to arrest some of the most 
dangerous leaders at that time, including Mr. Capone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On one hand the Liberal government affirms that the controls of 
the agency will be the same as the controls over any other 
government department.  On the other hand, it would then turn 
around and stress the need for independence.  If the controls of 
the agency will be the same as the controls over Revenue Canada 
or any other government department why bother?  Why transform a 
government department into an agency which is not independent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agency will have more power because it will be more at arm's 
length from parliament.  Using corporate performance standards 
will undoubtedly lead the agency to set up a system of tax 
assessment quotas, performance and pay bonuses.  These standards 
have precisely led the aforementioned IRS to abuse its power over 
taxpayers and at times use harsh and excessive collection 
methods.  The likely misuse of new powers and standards would 
therefore turn the agency into a taxpayer predator. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the auditor general, the Liberal government lost a 
potential $2.5 billion and $3 billion in revenues since 1995 
simply because it refused to pay adequate salaries to attract 
highly trained professionals required to perform complex audits. 
These auditors are necessary to ensure compliance by foreign 
multinational corporations operating in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the problem the auditor general has been flagging is 
that Revenue Canada acknowledges that it has been unable to hire 
staff up to the limits authorized by parliament simply because 
qualified auditors working in the private sector are not 
interested in taking a 50% pay cut for Revenue Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think those are the types of things this government should 
clean up and hire the number of auditors necessary to do the 
proper job rather than contracting out this agency.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Serge Cardin (Sherbrooke, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
rise in this House today. Since this is my first speech here, I 
would like to thank the residents of Sherbrooke for the 
confidence they put in me on September 14, when they elected me 
to represent their riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to reiterate my firm resolve to represent all the 
citizens of the riding of Sherbrooke in my daily work, whether 
in Sherbrooke or in Ottawa. 
I intend to work hard, along with my staff, to improve the 
situation regarding employment, community life, the employment 
insurance program, older workers and pay equity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I read Bill C-43 carefully, and also the speech made by the 
Minister of Revenue on October 1, 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was struck by this urgency to take action, so as to achieve 
certain objectives, namely to ensure quality services at a lower 
cost, fair administration, confidential service, modern and 
effective management and, above all, parliamentary 
accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was also struck by how easily the minister is prepared to 
abdicate his political responsibility and let an independent 
agency assume all the responsibilities that a government has. 
I realize the minister must redefine methods and procedures in 
order to achieve the objectives that I just mentioned.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister reminds me of someone who is having mechanical 
problems with his car and thinks that changing driver or doing 
some bodywork on the car will make it run better. Well, it will 
not. What the car needs is a good tune-up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebeckers and Canadians have the right to expect the minister 
to put his head under the hood, to replace defective parts and 
to make the necessary adjustments so he can get back on the road 
safely and reach the efficiency goals that the public expects in 
terms of service delivery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On September 29, the auditor general tabled his report. 
As a member of the public accounts committee, I had the 
opportunity to read Chapter 15, which deals with integrity at 
Revenue Canada and where it is revealed that 285 incidents of 
theft, fraud, abuse of power and conflict of interest were 
reported over a period of 18 months. The auditor general said, 
and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bearing in mind that Revenue Canada has approximately 40,000 
employees, 285 incidents in 18 months may not seem like a 
particularly high number. At the same time, academic studies of 
other segments of society strongly suggest that the number of 
incidents of misconduct that are reported is much lower than the 
number of incidents that actually occur. The nature of Revenue 
Canada's operations makes it more vulnerable than many other 
departments. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because Revenue Canada is vulnerable, as proven by the incidents 
that occurred in 1997, the department must remain vigilant. One 
of the minister's five principles is that people want the 
government to be accountable to them. In that regard, he said, 
and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Questions are often asked in the House of the minister. The 
power of the minister to inquire into these matters and respond 
to the House will be maintained under the new agency. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will recall that, on September 30, I did ask a question 
of the minister in this House. This was the question: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general reports that the government is already 
having a hard time assuring security and integrity within the 
department of revenue, with all the bribes, leaks, abuses of 
power and everything else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What should we think about a 
government that is now contemplating giving tax collection over 
to an independent agency, which would have even less 
accountability than Revenue Canada? 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members will remember the answer I was given; it was sheer 
nonsense. The minister told me that if I really wanted to look 
at problems in revenue, I should look at Revenue Quebec, where 
the real problems were. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to hide from the public his inability to get his house 
in order and hide the real reasons why he wanted to set up this 
independent agency, he referred to the mote in his Quebec 
neighbour's eye, but did not say a word about the beam in his 
own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister thinks that setting up an independent agency will 
make it easier for him to reach the goals I have already 
mentioned. I do not believe it, and several people agree with 
me. But there is more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For more than two years now, the minister has been working on 
this agency. Instead, he should have worked on the restructuring 
and the re-engineering of his own department. We would already 
have better services, a fairer administration, modern and 
efficient management practices, but mostly a structure more 
accountable to parliament and taxpayers through a modern and 
efficient department of revenue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, that has nothing to do with the real reasons why this 
independent agency is being established. The real reason is 
because the minister does not want to be held accountable. 
It will act as a bulwark against having to account for tax 
collection.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through its centralizing vision, the government wants to stretch 
its influence and control to provincial, municipal and local 
governments. It wants to have 15 extra positions to which 
friends and defeated candidates can be appointed. It also wants 
to exclude more than 20% of its officials from the application 
of the Public Service Employment Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this whole enactment, there is one important objective I 
support, and that is to avoid duplication, and I agree with the 
need to improve and simplify the administration of tax 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec collects all provincial income and sales taxes. It would 
be no problem to consolidate all provincial and federal tax 
collection activities in Quebec. In fact, Quebec is prepared to 
do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To conclude, the Bloc Quebecois is opposed to the establishment 
of the Canada customs and revenue agency and urges the members 
of this House to support the motion moved on October 1 and 
seconded by me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another perhaps less obvious reason to oppose the establishment 
of the agency is what I consider to be some kind of plan B. It 
is well known that the government is trying to stretch its 
tentacles to the municipal and local level. Luckily for 
municipalities, they fall under provincial jurisdiction, and I 
do not think the federal government will be able to get them to 
do business with the agency, even with the lure of substantial 
savings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There would be a problem. The same way that a private business 
partitions services within its operations and contracts out, 
there are cities in Quebec considering partitioning, and a tax 
relationship could be established between municipalities and the 
federal government through the agency. I view this whole tax 
agency business as part of a plan B. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois and I are against the agency. 
<P><A NAME="LINK213"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to rise in this House to speak to Bill C-43, introduced by the 
Minister of Revenue, which aims at nothing less than the 
creation of a coast to coast Canada customs and revenue agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the Bloc Quebecois recognizes the need to improve the 
administration of tax laws and to simplify their application, we 
find fault with four points of the government's vision in trying 
to have this legislation passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, we find fault with the bill's centralizing vision in 
creating this agency.  We also criticize the delegation of the 
minister's responsibilities, which are his under the terms of 
Revenue Canada measures.  We must also criticize his weakness 
with respect to senior Revenue Canada officials and the anti 
union attitude taken in creating this agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First off, we should explain to our viewers what the Canada 
customs and revenue agency constitutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On June 4, 1998, a week before the long summer recess, the 
Minister of Revenue tabled Bill C-43 in this House.  It concerned 
the establishment of a Canada customs and revenue agency.  When 
we look more closely at it, we see the bill was mentioned in the 
February 1996 speech from the throne, when the Liberal 
government announced its intention to set up a national revenue 
recovery agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In reality, this monster will be nothing less than the 
transformation of the present Department of Revenue into an 
agency independent of the government, which will have a mandate 
to negotiate an arrangement with the provinces and the 
municipalities so interested for the collection of taxes in 
Canada.  According to the minister, the creation of this agency 
will change absolutely nothing, but we are not so sure about that. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1715"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT40"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT40"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1715

<A HREF="#LINKT39"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the minister, departmental responsibility and 
parliamentary control will be maintained in their entirety and 
the Minister of Revenue will remain entirely responsible for 
administering legislation relating to taxes, customs tariffs and 
trade exchanges. He also says that the Public Service Staff 
Relations Act, the Access to Information Act and so on and so 
forth, will still continue to apply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the minister says is that nothing will be any different 
after this agency is created.  The Auditor General of Canada 
will continue to examine the agency's operations and report on 
them to parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We say that this is wrong, It is a sneaky manoeuvre, and nothing 
could be further from reality than the minister's predictions 
that this nothing will change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to be realistic.  If the minister were being truthful, 
one would have to wonder why he was putting so much effort into 
converting an entire department which employs one-fifth of the 
employees in the public service into an agency. Why, when it 
comes down to it, expend so much effort if nothing is changed? 
Why not leave things as they are? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The answer is clear, and comes right from the mouth of the 
President of Treasury Board: “Creation of the Canada Customs and 
Revenue Agency is an essential component of the government's 
commitment to modernize the federal public service”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we can see, the cat is out of the bag.  While claiming its 
purpose is to modernize the public service, the government's 
real intent is to privatize it. 
The Liberal government is claiming to promote a modern public 
service, but it is in fact trying to have public servants 
excluded from the scope of framework laws such as the Public 
Service Employment Act. Such is the minister's objective, such 
is the goal being pursued in creating this agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada customs and revenue agency will hire 40,000 public 
servants. This means that 20% of the federal public service will 
then be at the mercy of the agency's board of management. The 
agency's directors will certainly earn more than the 
department's senior officials currently do, but it will be at 
the expense of support staff, file processing clerks, and in 
fact most of the employees, because they will not be protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The concerns that we just raised are based on a number of 
reasons. 
Let me point out some of the numerous inconsistencies found in 
Bill C-43. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agency is under the authority of the Minister of Revenue. 
However, under clause 8, the minister may authorize the 
commissioner or any other person employed or engaged by the 
agency to exercise of perform on the minister's behalf any 
power, duty or function of the minister under any act of 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, this means that the agency will be in the hands of a 
super-bureaucrat who will be neither elected nor accountable to 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make a comparison with the millennium scholarship 
foundation. As members know, Bell Canada's chief executive 
officer, Mr. Monty, was appointed as head the foundation. He 
will manage a budget of $2.5 billion, to be distributed to 
students in the form of scholarships and loans, and he will not 
be accountable to the House as to how the money will be managed. 
The government is trying to pull the same stunt again by 
creating this agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agency has authority with respect to general administrative 
policy, organization, real property and determination of the 
terms and conditions of employment.  It is clear where the 
problem arises and this is where money will be saved; on the 
backs of front line workers in order to pay the higher ups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agency must develop a program governing staffing, including 
the appointment of, and recourse for, employees, but no 
collective agreement may deal with matters governed by the 
staffing program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the fate the federal government has in mind for one 
fifth of its current employees.  Obviously the agency is nothing 
more than an attempt to crush unions.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am having trouble making myself heard and I hope that those 
listening at home can hear me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While it is true that the bill promises a certain flexibility in 
subsequent clauses, once the harm is done and duly done, the 
government will wash its hands of the whole affair.  Who will be 
responsible? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are looking at a government that refuses to assume its 
responsibilities.  We are also looking at a minister whose 
complacency is equalled only by his government's lack of 
responsibility.  We are looking at a government that is striking 
an unprecedented blow to unions. 
We are dealing with a government driven and blinded by a 
centralizing vision which has not been seen since the worst 
years of the intellectual mentor of the current prime minister, 
namely Pierre Elliott Trudeau. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all the reasons I mentioned, the Bloc Quebecois will not 
support Bill C-43. We have no amendment to suggest. Rather we 
demand that the bill be withdrawn or that every clause be struck 
out. Quebec has always opposed the federal government's desire 
to centralize all activities linked to tax collection within one 
Canadian agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have our own revenue ministry which collects all provincial 
taxes in the province, on top of looking after the federal GST 
since 1992. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore we suggest that all activities related to tax 
collection in Quebec, either federal or provincial, be 
transferred to the Quebec Ministry of Revenue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember our first electoral campaign. We were fighting 
against overlap, duplication and federal centralization and we 
won. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We say no to this bill. 
<P><A NAME="LINK214"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Bonaventure—Gaspé—Îles-de-la-Madeleine—Pabok, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, first of all, we must excuse the members who may 
have been a little bit too loud during the good speech made by 
my colleague from Quebec. Maybe it was because they found that 
speech most inspiring. We know how it is to work in this House. 
Sometimes members do get carried away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to add my voice to that of my colleague from Quebec 
who concluded her speech by reminding everyone that, since it 
came to this House, the Bloc Quebecois has worked to help Canada 
move forward. It has worked to send the message that duplication 
must be avoided. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Quebec mentioned that we worked hard in the 
area of manpower training. 
We were the first provincial government—I say we because I come 
from Quebec and I have a lot of sympathy and affection for the 
Quebec government, the Parti Quebecois government. It was a 
sovereignist government in Quebec that succeeded in concluding a 
historic agreement with the federal government to harmonize the 
collection of the GST, the infamous tax that forced the former 
deputy prime minister to seek re-election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say all that because the new Liberal leader in Quebec, Mr. 
Jean Charest, is claiming that Quebec would be better protected 
and would be able to reach all kinds of agreements if he were at 
the helm. There are still three areas where it is the Bloc 
Quebecois in Ottawa that helped things move forward, which 
allowed for a certain degree of harmonization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us come back to the bill before us, Bill C-43, which creates 
a super agency that will allow Revenue Canada and customs 
services, whose staff represents about 20% of the entire 
Canadian public service, not to be governed by the rules of the 
public service.

<A HREF="#LINKT41"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I reread the bill, when I try to understand what it is all 
about, I see that this is one of its only functions, one of the 
only things that this agency will achieve, besides being able to 
create cozy, well paid jobs, to which the minister will be able 
to appoint friends of the government, of the members opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting that each time the government tries to hide or 
to avoid answering questions from the public, it creates a 
commission, a super agency. This happens frequently right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it does not want to answer questions from people who want 
to express themselves publicly—which is the right to free 
speech—I am talking about the infamous “peppergate”, what 
happens? 
It refers the issue to a commission. Yes, we are told the 
commission has been in existence for a long time, at least 10 
years. However, it forgets to give some tools to people who must 
use this commission to get information. It forgets to give them 
some tools, for example, lawyers who also are well paid to 
defend them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say well paid. I will not argue about the definition of well 
paid or about who should be and who should not. I am in favour 
of people being paid for the fair value of their work. The 
government should at least give these students the means to 
defend themselves against the big machine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A small group of students were sprayed with pepper, while the 
minister is trying to estaablish— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Kilger:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hesitate to interrupt my colleague, but I would ask we keep to 
the business of Bill C-43.  I am wondering about the relevance of 
his remarks.  I expected he would ultimately bring his speech 
around to the subject of Bill C-43.  But, it is a question of 
relevance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> The government whip is 
right.  Perhaps the member for 
Bonaventure—Gaspé—Îles-de-la-Madeleine—Pabok could address 
the bill currently before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Bernier:</B> Mr. Speaker, excuse my outburst, but when one 
is trying to get the government's attention, one has to spice it 
up a little. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> With salt and pepper, like your hair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Bernier:</B> Quite right, but I notice that the hairline 
of the gentleman who made the remark starts a little further 
back than mine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was trying to draw a comparison between Peppergate and the 
creation of a super agency;  in the opinion of the Bloc 
Quebecois, the agency will break the direct link between what 
the public is entitled to know and Parliament's oversight of 
government. This link will be broken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How will the public be able to control this new super agency? 
I want to get the attention of the public and of the government 
so that a second monster is not created and we are not 
pepper-sprayed again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the agency's purpose is truly to generate savings, to avoid 
duplication, there is no need to create a monster agency with 15 
mega-commissioners at the helm.  It is a simple matter of getting 
10 premiers around a table and making a proposal.  Quebec will 
be able to administer its share of federal taxes within its 
jurisdiction.

</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK217">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK218"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Portage—Lisgar, Ref.)</B> moved that 
Bill C-283, an act to amend the Canadian Wheat Board Act (audit), 
be read the second time and referred to a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, it is pleasure to rise in the House on my 
private member's Bill C-283, an act to amend the Canadian Wheat 
Board Act.  It would allow the auditor general to audit the books 
of the Canadian Wheat Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will have a new board of directors of the Canadian Wheat 
Board.  It would be a tremendous asset if these directors had 
some guidelines to follow to know that the CEO of the board was 
performing his job properly or whether amendments could be made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To have an independent audit of a board that is a monopoly is a 
tremendous asset.  Up to now private auditors have done the 
audit.  They probably have done a good job, but no one really 
knows because there has not been an independent look at the books 
to see whether they are in order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the past couple of months the auditor general has come out 
vividly in favour of having some auditing done.  He agrees that 
it is time because the government guarantees that he should have 
a look at the board's books to see whether there are good 
internal operations of the board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Deloitte & Touche did an independent assessment of the board in 
1992.  That internal audit was never released to the public or to 
farmers.  We do not have an idea of how critical the report was. 
The facts released after the audit were critical of how the board 
operated.  They did not criticize the way the board marketed 
grain, but they criticized its business plan, how it operated and 
other mechanics of the board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I became interested in how the Canadian Wheat Board operates 
when farmers came to me with concerns in 1994, shortly after I 
was elected.  In 1992 Saskatchewan farmers suffered from the 
effects of a huge frost.  In 1993 Manitoba farmers suffered from 
the fusarium outbreak because of excess moisture in wheat. 
Because the board in 1993-94 put out a notice that it would not 
be purchasing any of the fusarium wheat that had more than 5% 
fusarium it was unmarketable.  Some farmers burnt their crops 
because there was no market for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The majority of farmers felt that if they harvested their crop 
they could somehow clean it up and use it as feed or in some 
other way.  Some farmers were using it as fuel in their furnaces. 
Then some innovative farmers found a market in the United States 
for it.  They had found a way of cleaning up that grain and were 
quite willing to accept it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some farmers along the border started exporting this grain and 
found out they needed an export licence.  They went through legal 
procedures to get export licences for grain that was not 
marketable, which was not a big concern to farmers.  They thought 
they should have had the right to sell the grain at the price 
they could get and keep the money in their own pockets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The board created a buy-back program so the farmers had to pay 
the board first.  They had to sell the grain to the board, buy it 
back at a higher price, and then market it themselves.  Farmers 
were not even opposed to that idea because they had a pooling 
system. 
If everybody was treated equally the moneys they were charged 
would go into the pooling system and they would then share in 
those funds.

the pooling price had been paid out, some of the farmers started 
getting bills for storage of grain that had sat in their bins 
until they exported it to the U.S.  This grain had never entered 
an elevator.  Because they had signed a contract to export it and 
the U.S. elevators were full, it could not be delivered at the 
time and they were charged storage for having the grain in their 
bins. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When they came to me with these documents I discovered they had 
been charged storage, freight, elevation and cleaning to Thunder 
Bay, and the wheat had been in their bins all the time.  I then 
started to investigate further and found out when they bought the 
gain back the grain companies or the wheat board charged the 
farmers as much as $1 a bushel more than they sold it to the 
grain companies that exported the grain.  They were getting 
hammered double and that is where the M-Jay Farms class action 
suit started. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The board had no way out.  It could not defend itself.  Its only 
defence was to say that it had no mandate to sell their grain for 
the best price possible.  The only mandate the board had was to 
sell the grain in an orderly fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have sold grain in an orderly fashion for 45 years.  In 
western Canada today we see that the orderly fashion is fast 
disappearing because farmers cannot survive any longer.  This is 
why I have been pushing for the last three or four years to get 
an accountable board that will work for the farmers, not for the 
corporation itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To show why it is so important, Mr. Beswick, one of the chief 
commissioners of the board, resigned in 1994-95 over the issue of 
feed barley being sold below cost price or below what the price 
should be.  He came out in public and said “We have cost farmers 
this last year probably $180 million by underselling that feed 
grain”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In western Canada $180 million is a lot of bucks to farmers. Not 
only is it a lot of bucks to western Canadian farmers, but they 
are lost tax dollars to the government or to the taxpayer. 
Whatever the loss is in terms of the taxes farmers would have 
paid on the grain, it has to be picked up by the ordinary 
taxpayer and somebody loses.  It is important that we have a 
wheat board which extracts the maximum amount of grain, not just 
for the benefit of farmers but for the economy and taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give just a few examples because I want to share as much 
time as I can with my colleagues on this issue.  In March 1993-94 
when the first farmers started shipping some of their 1992 crop 
year grain which had been impacted by frost in some areas, U.S. 
No. 1 wheat sold for $3.99 a bushel.  The Canadian export price 
for No. 1 feed wheat was $109 a tonne.  During the summer the 
prices of wheat in the United States increased by $1 a bushel. By 
September the wheat was worth $4.93 cash at Minneapolis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The wheat board raised the export price of No. 1 feed wheat to 
$116, a difference of $9 or 25 cents a bushel when the wheat was 
worth at least $1 U.S. more in the United States.  That meant 
farmers were losing at least $1 a bushel because of the failure 
of the wheat board to raise the export price.

<A HREF="#LINKT44"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was not the end of the story.  By December the price of 
wheat increased another $1 a bushel and we had American milling 
wheat selling in Minneapolis for $5.73.  Does anyone know what 
the Canadian Wheat Board did?  It lowered the export price for 
No. 1 wheat to $104 a tonne from $116 a tonne.  Did that make any 
sense?  We knew that because of the fusarium our feed wheat that 
year had protein of 14.5% to 15%, some of the highest protein 
wheat that we had ever grown, and the Americans cleaned it up and 
used it for milling wheat.  The loss to our farmers was huge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the research I have done, on the 2.2 million tonnes that 
went into the U.S. as feed wheat, not durum or milling wheat, 
farmers lost at least $150 million.  The spread between feed 
wheat in 1992-93 was $60 a tonne.  The spread between feed wheat 
and milling wheat in the U.S. in 1993 was $130 a tonne.  That is 
about a $4 a bushel spread.  It did not make any sense.  The 
wheat board refused to look into the issue when farmers phoned 
them and told them what the wheat was worth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why it is important for the Canadian government to 
insist that the auditor general takes over the books, not just 
audit them to see if the prices are right but to see whether the 
board is running efficiently and for the benefit of the country 
and not just for the benefit of the board itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing I would like to raise may be just as important as 
what I was saying on feed wheat.  In 1995-96 when American grain 
prices were the highest in history wheat sold for $7.25 American 
a bushel.  Corn sold for $5.25 to $5.50 a bushel.  Our wheat 
board refused to sell grain into that market.  Instead of selling 
the 1.5 million tonnes allowed by the Americans into their 
market, it only sold 750,000 tonnes.  It cut the sales by half. 
The board would not allow farmers to export their own grain 
because it set the buy-back price at $9 and something a bushel 
just to eliminate the competition.  I call that robbery. It was 
devastating to our farmers in western Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only that, the following winter was one of the toughest in 
western Canada.  There were transportation problems.  An extra 
million tonnes of grain was carried over.  It was more than in 
previous years.  We refused to sell because of the board policy. 
It does not make sense.  Now when we see we are to get an elected 
board of directors maybe we will have some changes.  That is why 
it is so important for the auditor general to have control of the 
books. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had 11 elected advisory board members for the last 10 to 12 
years who were supposed to guide the board along.  These advisory 
board members had the right to look into every portion of the 
audit and into every detail.  They never once told farmers what 
was happening to their grain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Six months before the commissioner of the board, Bill Smith, 
accidentally passed away he told a group of farmers “If I could 
walk out of this place today and tell you what is happening to 
your wheat or your grain it would be astounding, but I have two 
more years to serve before my term has ended and I can retire. I 
have to follow secrecy.  I cannot divulge what is happening in 
the board”.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Harvard (Charleswood St. James—Assiniboia, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to speak today on 
private member's Bill C-283, a bill that would require the 
accounts and records of the Canadian Wheat Board to be audited 
annually by the Auditor General of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the hon. member is no doubt aware, Bill C-4, an act to amend 
the Canadian Wheat Board, received royal assent in June of this 
year.  One of the amendments to that legislation, passed by the 
other place, relates to the financial accountability of the 
Canadian Wheat Board to the farmers it serves.  That amendment, 
endorsed by the government, the BQ and the Progressive 
Conservatives in a vote of 197 to 60, allows for the Auditor 
General of Canada to conduct a one time audit of the accounts and 
financial transactions of the Canadian Wheat Board and report the 
findings to the producer controlled board of directors and the 
minister responsible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A major thrust of Bill C-4 is to give farmers control of their 
marketing agency by establishing a 15 member board of directors 
with 10 of those positions, a full two-thirds majority, to be 
filled by producer elected directors.  The board of directors 
will be in charge of overseeing Canadian Wheat Board operations. 
These directors will have access to all information and facts and 
figures regarding Canadian Wheat Board operations, including 
selling prices for grain. In other words, Bill C-4 has put 
producers in the driver's seat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation the member for Portage—Lisgar is proposing 
would take the keys away from farmers and give control back to 
the government.  The government believes that with the full 
knowledge of the inner workings of the Canadian Wheat Board the 
directors are in the best position to assess what information 
should be made public and what, for commercial reasons, should 
remain confidential.  They will be in the best position to assess 
Canadian Wheat Board operations.  The recent changes to the 
Canadian Wheat Board Act will give the producer controlled board 
of directors the power to make changes to these operations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government recognizes that producers are entitled to know 
how their marketing agency is working for them.  The Canadian 
Wheat Board works for them, not the other way around.  Therefore 
how it conducts its business is their business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members must bear in mind, however, that the Canadian Wheat 
Board is a major competitor in international grain trade.  With 
$6 billion a year in sales, it is Canada's fifth largest 
exporter. It markets wheat and barley on behalf of western 
Canadian grain producers to more than 70 countries around the 
world.  In other words, the Canadian Wheat Board is a big player 
in international markets. Grain trading on this scale is a highly 
competitive business where information is king and 
confidentiality is paramount to ensure the highest possible 
returns to farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who is selling to whom and for how much is highly guarded 
commercial intelligence that in the hands of its competitors 
could jeopardize the wheat board's ability to extract premiums 
from the marketplace.  That in turn would affect the bottom lines 
of more than 110,000 prairie grain farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously then a balance is needed between transparency and 
accountability to producers and ensuring that Canadian Wheat 
Board operations and records are not subject to significantly 
greater levels of public access and scrutiny than the private 
sector grain companies it competes against.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is very important and it is important to understand that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With that in mind and to enhance the transparency and 
accountability of the wheat board the government supported the 
amendment to the legislation to allow a one time audit of the 
accounts and financial transactions of the Canadian Wheat Board 
by the auditor general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, and this is important to understand, the general 
intent of this private member's bill is already incorporated in 
the new law. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK220"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Hélène Alarie (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, as I did in 
previous discussions on Bill C-4, I have to admit from the outset 
that, as a Quebecker, it is hard for me to feel deeply concerned 
about Bill C-283, An Act to amend the Canadian Wheat Board Act 
(audit), because those affected are mainly the grain producers 
in western Canada. I will be brief, and all the more so because 
the remarks of my Reform colleague have set the tone of the 
debate on his bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my party's critic for agriculture, my concern should be to 
examine whether most farmers or the agricultural industry as a 
whole can benefit from the bill before the House. 
In my humble opinion, the amendments in this bill deserve a good 
discussion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed amendment to subsection 8.1 (1) on auditing reads 
as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>8.1 (1) The accounts and records of the Board shall be audited 
annually by the Auditor General of Canada and a report of the 
audit shall be made to the Board and the Minister. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This clause modifies an amendment, made by the Senate and passed 
by the House last June, which is included in Bill C-4. This bill, 
which has been enacted, provides that “Within two years after 
the day this section comes into force, the Auditor General of 
Canada may commence an audit of the accounts and financial 
transactions of the Corporation for such fiscal years as the 
Auditor General considers appropriate and a report of the audit 
shall be made to the Corporation and the Minister.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no need to amend this clause, since such an audit is 
already being carried out, and the best time to undertake an 
audit should be left to the discretion of the auditor general. 
Also, the accounts are audited every year by a well-known 
independent accounting firm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Subsection (2) reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(2) The Minister shall cause the report made under 
subsection (1) to be laid before each House of Parliament on 
any of the first fifteen days on which that House is sitting 
after the report is received by the Minister. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a common procedure for when such a report is made to the 
Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other amendments put forward by the hon. member are 
well-intentioned. 
Some people might find it normal for a board financed by farmers 
and whose initial price and line of credit are guaranteed by the 
government, to report to the minister responsible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This ensures transparency. It would look bad if the Liberals in 
this House were to disagree with that. The proposed amendment 
would replace paragraph 9(1)(<I>c</I>) and allow the minister to follow 
up each month on the board's: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—purchases and sales of all grain during the month and the 
quantities of grain then held by it, the contracts to take 
delivery of grain to which it is then a party, all securities 
then held by it and the financial result of the Board's 
operations. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, these good intentions pose a great risk to the Canadian 
Wheat Board. 
To provide this information in a written report would be to tell 
competitors all there is to know about the board, including its 
sales engineering and contracts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In today's competitive world, this might condemn to a slow death 
an institution that should be considered as a business or 
company that ought to be profitable for its investors, that is 
the producers and the government, basically everyone in the 
country. It is likely to take the wind out of its sails during 
future negotiations. We must bear in mind that the grain market 
is not an easy market and it is an extremely competitive one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the proposed amendment to paragraph 9(1)(<I>e</I>), it would 
allow the minister to get an annual report on the Canadian Wheat 
Board's activities.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My previous comment still holds. There is risk of disclosing the 
methods used for the purchase, movement and marketing of grain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, when it was introduced in November 1997, the 
auditor general review clause had not yet been added to Bill 
C-4. The legislation now in force contains this safeguard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, the Bloc Quebecois agrees, but only in principle, 
with this bill, as it forces the Canadian Wheat Board to be 
transparent in reporting its activities to the minister 
responsible. However, inherent to these amendments are risks 
that must not be overlooked. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK221"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I too am 
pleased to speak to Bill C-283, an act to amend the Canadian 
Wheat Board Act.  I listened with interest to the member for 
Portage—Lisgar as he spoke on the differentiation in prices 
between American and Canadian grains over the last number of 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not challenge the numbers at all but I wonder if another 
interpretation can be made rather than one that condemns the 
Canadian Wheat Board for the apparently lower prices.  I wonder 
if it is not higher subsidies in the United States. Higher 
subsidies, whether in the U.S. or anywhere else, tend to depress 
the international market.  I say with some regret and a lot of 
concern that we are seeing more of it in this country. We are 
seeing more disparity with the Americans having recently passed a 
huge farm aid package. Yet we seem to be saying that we have NISA 
and crop insurance and that we are well served.  Everybody who 
lives in western Canada these days knows that is just not 
correct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Bill C-283 the hon. member for Portage—Lisgar is asking that 
the accounts and records of the Canadian Wheat Board be audited 
each year by the Auditor General of Canada.  He is further 
requesting that the auditor general make this audit available to 
the wheat board minister and that the minister table the report 
in the House of Commons within 15 sitting days of receiving it. 
These are the main provisions in Bill C-283 although the hon. 
member makes several other requests as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not be supporting this bill.  I will outline some of the 
reasons why.  I believe the hon. member's requests in Bill C-283 
have largely been overtaken by events over the past year. It 
seems that what he is requesting is already in the process of 
occurring under the terms of Bill C-4.  This bill was first 
introduced in November 1997, almost a year ago, when the debate 
on Bill C-4 was perhaps at its highest flashpoint in and around 
this Chamber.  That legislation was subsequently passed last June 
which means, as has been pointed out, that there will be 
significant changes in the way the wheat board will operate in 
the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-4 as amended and proclaimed allows the auditor general to 
scrutinize the books of the CWB.  The wheat board legislation 
received intense scrutiny.  It was referred to the agriculture 
committee in the first week of the 36th parliament.  It was 
debated fully in this House and the Senate agriculture committee 
held public hearings across western Canada last spring. Following 
those public hearings the Senate agriculture committee 
recommended that the board's books be opened to the auditor 
general on request.  The wheat board minister accepted this 
recommendation word for word and it has become section 8.1 of the 
amended bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Senate committee's report took note of the fact that the 
wheat board would be holding elections for a board of directors. 
Those elections are occurring through a mail preferential ballot 
as we speak and will be finishing next month.  It is worth noting 
what the committee actually said about its recommendations 
regarding the auditor general's reviewing the books of the 
Canadian Wheat Board.  I quote briefly from that report of last 
May: 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1800"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT49"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT49"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1800
<A HREF="#LINKT50"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT48"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“All directors of the proposed board would have access to all 
Canadian Wheat Board facts and figures, including the fully 
audited financial statements.  The minister has suggested that, 
with this full knowledge of the CWB and its competition, the 
directors would be in the best position to assess which 
information should be made public and which should remain 
confidential for commercial reasons”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As has been pointed out by the member for Charleswood St. 
James—Assiniboia, international grain trade is a very 
competitive business.  The wheat board is a $6 billion a year 
operation with customers around the globe.  Not surprisingly, the 
board's clients are sensitive about the release of information 
that might apply to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe fully that the board has to strike a balance between 
openness and confidentiality in the commercial information that 
it releases and I believe that, by and large, it has been 
successful in striking that balance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any event, my first point is that much of what the member is 
requesting will become reality when the new board of directors is 
in place in 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure the amended Bill C-4 which contains the 
recommendations referred to regarding the auditor general will 
not be enough to appease the hon. member or his party.  We know 
that the Reform Party and the National Citizens' Coalition have 
been unremittingly hostile to the existence of the Canadian Wheat 
Board.  Their allegation, which is repeated regularly and 
constantly, is that the board is a dark, dank and secretive 
organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talked a lot about that in committee.  We spoke about it 
during the debate on Bill C-4.  I think it is important that we 
separate the wheat from the chaff on this issue.  I believe that 
the board is, by and large, a remarkably transparent organization 
compared with its competitors in the international grain trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As has been acknowledged even by the member for Portage—Lisgar, 
the board's books have been audited for years by the well known 
Canadian firm of Deloitte & Touche.  The most salient points of 
the audit are included in the wheat board's annual report which 
is public information and available to anyone who wants to read 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, there is a synopsis for those who prefer to read 
the short version as opposed to the full report.  As well, the 
board regularly holds public meetings throughout the countryside 
to discuss its operations with Canadian grain farmers.  This kind 
of openness and information sharing is hardly the trademark of a 
secretive, dark organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that the Canadian Wheat Board probably provides 
at least as much, and likely more, information as other Canadian 
grain companies involved in the grain trade, including the United 
Grain Growers and the various prairie pools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The wheat board's international competitors, companies like 
Cargill, which are privately held, do not provide nearly as much 
information as the wheat board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us lay to rest, once and for all, this mantra because there 
is no foundation to say that the Canadian Wheat Board is not an 
open organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, for the reasons outlined, I will be voting 
against Bill C-283. 
<P><A NAME="LINK222"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to speak on behalf of the Progressive Conservative Party 
and our wheat board critic, the hon. member for Brandon—Souris, 
in support of private member's Bill C-283. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must begin by saying that the bill put forward by the member 
for Portage—Lisgar addresses some of the most paramount concerns 
farmers have with the Canadian Wheat Board, which are 
transparency and accountability.  As in any crown corporation or 
mixed corporation Canadians expect no less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Wheat Board was incorporated by the Canadian Wheat 
Board Act in 1935 to market interprovincially and to export 
Canadian wheat and barley for producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The wheat board is a monopoly system.  If a producer wants to 
sell wheat or barley outside the CWB he must apply for an export 
permit.  This means he sells his product back to the CWB, obtains 
the permit, buys the wheat back from the CWB and then sells it on 
the open export market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He has to go through the wheat board.  He cannot market his 
wheat without going through the wheat board, a wheat board that 
generates sales of wheat and barley in excess of approximately $6 
billion annually. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point I am getting at is that farmers do not have a choice 
but to market through the wheat board and there is a lot of money 
at stake for the producers.  Therefore, why should the Canadian 
Wheat Board not be accountable and transparent to those very 
producers?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been a lot of changes to the Canadian Wheat Board 
over the years.  It was originally intended by the Right Hon. R. 
B. Bennett's Progressive Conservative government that the 
Canadian Wheat Board be a voluntary institution with a mandate to 
operate in the best interests of producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unfortunate that the wheat board no longer operates in the 
way it was originally intended.  It eventually became a monopoly 
and a means of controlling wheat prices for the federal 
government during World War II. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Its main aim was to limit grain price increases so as to 
safeguard the government's wage and price controls and control 
the cost of mutual aid to the allies during the war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1967 the Liberal government of the day made the Canadian 
Wheat Board's monopoly permanent, a truly sad day for the 
majority of farmers who today want a voluntary wheat board. 
Furthermore, when Bill C-4 was passed last June further changes 
were made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the first time in history 10 out of the 15 board of 
directors were going to be elected by producers.  The elections 
are being held this fall.  Hopefully the newly elected board of 
directors will have some say in the future of the Canadian Wheat 
Board and will be able to make the necessary changes to ensure 
that the board truly evolves in the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, somewhere along the way the farmers started to 
mistrust the agency that was supposed to represent their best 
interests.  They started to question its monopoly and their 
returns compared to a fair market value, and rightly so.  They 
saw farmers south of the border getting more per bushel of wheat 
than they were receiving for the same grade through the wheat 
board.  In some cases the farmers' suspicions were not unfounded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, most farmers in western Canada do not want to 
eliminate the wheat board, they just want the wheat board to be 
more accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is no different than the constituents that each individual 
member of parliament in this House represents.  Canadians expect 
accountability.  The last time I checked they expected a lot of 
accountability and I would suggest that members on the other side 
of the House take a long hard look at accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can tell members on the other side of the House who want to 
enter this debate that accountability will stick to them like 
scum on a pond and it will not be easy to get off.  Canadians 
expect accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I firmly believe that the bill before us today will only add to 
the accountability through the transparency of an annual audit by 
the auditor general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must also say that this is an issue that is not new to farmers 
in western Canada or to this House.  During the debates and the 
committee hearings on the bill previously known as Bill C-4, 
which eventually passed last June, members of this House 
questioned the government as to why it was not willing to put 
forward legislation that would make the Canadian Wheat Board more 
open and more transparent.  In fact, my colleague, the member for 
Brandon—Souris, put forward similar amendments at the committee 
level during the study of Bill C-4 that would have given the 
auditor general the power to audit the Canadian Wheat Board. 
Unfortunately the Liberal majority of the committee did not 
recognize these concerns and the amendments were subsequently 
voted down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the member for Brandon—Souris did not stop there.  He 
pushed for more amendments with his Senate colleagues and 
eventually the Senate put forward several reasonable amendments, 
one of which allowed the auditor general to audit the Canadian 
Wheat Board's books within the first two years after the bill 
takes effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The audit is provided to the board of directors and to the 
minister.  This amendment, along with other Senate amendments, 
including the elimination of the contentious inclusion clause, 
were eventually passed when the bill received royal assent June 
11, 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This adds further transparency to the Canadian Wheat Board, but 
there is still an opportunity for more transparency, and I 
believe we have that opportunity with Bill C-283. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members on the government side will argue that due to 
international market sensitivities the government should not 
reveal the wheat board's secrets.  My gracious.  That is quite a 
statement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government will also say that there is an annual audit. 
When the Canadian Wheat Board releases its annual audit, if 
members opposite actually look at the annual report, they will 
realize that it has as much depth as the government's vision of 
Canada.

<A HREF="#LINKT50"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government will also say that the professional accounting 
team of Deloitte & Touche currently audits the wheat board. Yet 
when my colleague, the hon. member for Brandon—Souris, requested 
a 1992 managerial audit by the same company he was told it could 
not be released.  He was told it was confidential. That answer is 
just not good enough for Canadians.  They want transparency in 
their publicly funded institutions and they expect no less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, the U.S. government formally requested an audit 
of the wheat board over six months ago.  In fact, the Toronto 
<I>Star</I> reported on January 14, 1998 the federal agriculture 
minister warning “The U.S. government is poised to demand an 
audit of the Canadian Wheat Board because American grain growers 
fear they are victims of unfair trade practices”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If other foreign governments can request audits of the wheat 
board it would only make sense that the people of Canada, the 
farmers whom the wheat board is supposed to represent, are 
afforded the same rights.  The unfortunate thing is that common 
sense does not always prevail in the benches opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was probably put best in a January 1998 <I>Globe and Mail</I> 
article that said “Farmers have no way of knowing whether the 
wheat board is doing its job, because it operates in secret.  And 
they have no other recourse, such as a mediator or an ombudsman, 
against apparently incompetent, abusive and fraudulent actions”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again it would only stand to reason that the Canadian Wheat 
Board be accountable to the farmers it is supposed to represent. 
It would only stand to reason that an annual audit be allowed to 
ensure that the Canadian Wheat Board is indeed accountable and 
transparent to the farmers it is supposed to represent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Conservative Party will support this bill and 
looks forward to reviewing it when it is sent to the Standing 
Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  As hon. members 
know, the last five minutes of the debate goes back to the mover 
of the bill.  But we have three members in the House who have 
advised the Chair that they would like to speak.  That would give 
each member about four minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is there a consensus to divide the remaining time between the 
three members:  the member for Selkirk—Interlake, the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, 
and the member for Yorkton—Melville? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK223"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I support the member for Portage—Lisgar in putting 
forward Bill C-283. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to clarify the position of the Reform Party and 
myself with regard to the Canadian Wheat Board.  We support the 
Canadian Wheat Board in its operation as a voluntary marketing 
agency.  That should clarify NDP and Liberal statements which say 
that we are dead against it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Charleswood St. James—Assiniboia said that the 
Canadian Wheat Board is a competitor on the world stage.  This 
competitor has to have the trust of the producers who supply it 
with product.  That is where the current Canadian Wheat Board, 
with its single desk selling, falls down:  basic trust. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The position of the Canadian Wheat Board, which is in essence 
the position of the current government due to the fact that it 
appoints so many people to the Canadian Wheat Board, is that it 
needs to keep prices, contracts and other assorted information 
secret.  That may very well be true.  Certainly Cargill, ADM, 
Sask Pool and the other big grain companies would also want to 
keep some of the information secret.  The wheat board says that 
if it did not keep it secret it would not be able to extract 
premiums from the marketplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is where the distrust comes in.  How does the farmer know 
that in fact the premium is being extracted?  This is where the 
socialist-type politicians represented by the NDP and the 
Liberals differ from myself and the Reform Party.  We say that if 
the farmer wants to determine where the best price is, he goes to 
Cargill, he goes to the Canadian Wheat Board, he goes to UGG, he 
goes to Sask Pool and AgriCorp and they start giving him prices. 
“I will give you $4 for your wheat.  I will give you $4.50.  I 
will give you $4.75” and so on.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The farmer is no dummy.  He is going to take the highest price. 
He does not need to know that the premium was extracted in Korea 
for instance.  The point we have to make here is the information 
this bill would bring out would be a first step in attempting to 
get information so that farmers would trust the Canadian Wheat 
Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the little time I have remaining I would like to comment on 
the Canadian Wheat Board elections that are coming up in a very 
short time.  In the latest information we see that 33 of the 65 
candidates are running on a voluntary wheat board platform. We 
will see that the vote will also reflect in an unofficial way a 
referendum on the support for a voluntary marketing board for 
Canadian wheat and barley.  At the present time a price of 86 
cents a bushel is being received in the west. That is clearly not 
good enough.  Farmers need a choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With that I await the day when we have a voluntary wheat board 
and farmers can market their grain where they want. 
<P><A NAME="LINK224"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I take great 
pleasure in speaking to the bill proposed by the member for 
Portage—Lisgar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member went to great length in his remarks about cash prices 
in the United States, price spreads and so on.  However he failed 
to mention the times over the whole year that the Canadian Wheat 
Board returns to producers, to farmers, more dollars in their 
pockets than the American system returns to the pockets of its 
farmers.  That is a fact.  It has been shown over the history of 
the Canadian Wheat Board.  All studies have shown that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1995-96 annual report of the Canadian Wheat Board states “A 
performance evaluation conducted during the 1995-96 crop year 
showed Canada ranks highly with its customers in such areas as 
quality of product, customer service, technical support and 
dependability of supply”.  The most important point is that 
another study conducted by three economists showed that the 
Canadian wheat board single desk system generates an additional 
$265 million per year in wheat revenue for farmers. That is what 
the Canadian Wheat Board does.  It enhances Canada's 
competitiveness.  The study also showed that the Canadian Wheat 
Board provides a low cost marketing service to farmers. That is 
performance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anyone who watches the market knows that at any given time we 
can pick a higher price here and a lower price there, but when we 
really do a study we find the facts are there.  The Canadian 
Wheat Board with its single desk selling system returns more 
money to primary producers than what that dog eat dog system in 
the United States does for its primary producers. One of the 
reasons the United States Congress is having to pump subsidies 
into the farm community in the United States is that the 
Americans do not have a Canadian Wheat Board which can maximize 
returns to producers in the marketplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to be misinterpreted. Given the world situation 
and the way the United States and Europe are undermining prices 
in the world, our producers are finding it very tough. Thank 
goodness they have the Canadian Wheat Board to maximize the 
returns that are in fact in that marketplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the intent of the member for Portage—Lisgar is to try to 
assist producers. In the very short time I have left I will deal 
with the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we were in hearings in western Canada the producers 
indicated that they wanted the wheat board to have accountability 
and transparency. 
And of course we on the government side listened.  We did provide 
that accountability within the board's structure.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When they are elected, the board of directors will have access 
to all Canadian Wheat Board operating data, including the prices 
at which grain was sold, the price premiums realized and the 
operating costs.  They will be in a position to review the wheat 
board's operations.  They will have the power to make changes 
that are in the best interests of farmers.  In other words, the 
directors will be able to ensure that farmers are getting fair 
value for their money from that system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government made those changes and we stand by them.  The 
board is there for farmers and we want to see it remain a single 
desk selling agency.  We do not need this bill. 
<P><A NAME="LINK225"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I cannot believe what we have just heard from the 
Parliamentary Secretary for the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans. 
He lives in Prince Edward Island.  He knows that the Canadian 
Wheat Board applies only to the provinces of Alberta, 
Saskatchewan and Manitoba and does not allow the people in those 
provinces to market their grain freely.  He knows that he does 
not have to comply with the wheat board yet he sits there 
defending it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He probably does not even know what the initial price of wheat 
is right now that the wheat board is handing out.  That is why we 
have a farm income crisis on the prairies.  It is about time this 
government started to listen because it is a very serious 
problem.  It is because grain prices are so low and farmers do 
not have the choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I sit here and listen to the debate in the House in Private 
Members' Business, one thing occurs to me.  Probably what is 
being debated after hours in the House of Commons is more 
important to the people of Canada than the bills that are being 
introduced by this government all day long. Private Members' 
Business probably addresses some of the key concerns that 
Canadians have.  This is one of those concerns. There are major 
concerns out there with regard to the Canadian Wheat Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do we need to have more transparency?  A free, open and 
democratic society needs to have transparency in its 
institutions, especially if an institution is a monopoly.  If we 
have a government granted monopoly and we expect people to comply 
with it willingly, that monopoly, that organization, the Canadian 
Wheat Board, needs to have the confidence of the people who must 
comply with the monopoly powers of that agency. That is why this 
whole discussion is so important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many reports that the Canadian Wheat Board is dumping 
grain on the international market into the U.S., that it is 
selling grain below its competitors on the Minneapolis Stock 
Exchange.  We have no way of knowing if those reports are true. 
That is why we need someone who can go into the books and report 
to the farmers who must comply with that agency as to whether or 
not that accusation is true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether we like the agency or not, we still need to have that 
transparency.  Without that, it is going to have serious 
problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I took the amendments to Bill C-4, the Canadian Wheat Board Act 
brought forth by this government to the farmers in my riding.  I 
took a survey and used several different instruments to find out 
what farmers thought.  One of the things I found was that over 
80% of the farmers in my riding, and this is probably 
representative of farmers in the three prairie provinces, 
supported the idea that is being proposed here, that the auditor 
general be allowed to look at the books. Yet that government over 
there is defending this abhorrent situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time the people of Canada came to the rescue of farmers 
and helped them out in this situation.  If over 80% of farmers 
want transparency and they want the auditor general to look at 
the books and report as to whether they are doing a good job, it 
is time we listened because they are forced by this government to 
comply.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Portage—Lisgar, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is always a pleasure entering a debate on the 
Canadian Wheat Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest the auditor general should not audit books just of 
government agencies but also the common sense of the Liberal 
government.  The auditor general would have a very small job.  It 
would not take him very long. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I hear members on the government side saying look at what 
the wheat board is doing, let the members opposite tell me why 
every farmer is growing more canola than the previous year.   The 
farmer is growing more lentils, more navy beans and more hemp. 
The Liberal government supported the growing of hemp.  If the 
wheat board is doing such a good job with their grains why do we 
need all these other crops?  Why can these crops work on an open 
market? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We sold our canola at an average of 30 bushels an acre for an 
average of better than $8 a bushel.  My neighbour is selling 
barley for 11 cents.  Good lord, how is my neighbour supposed to 
grow the bloody stuff?  He cannot even drive it to the fields to 
sow it for that price. This is the job the wheat board is doing 
for us? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A commodity broker phoned me about two weeks ago and asked why 
he cannot buy durum from Canada.  He said he bid $20 a tonne over 
asking price at Thunder Bay for a unit train of durum and he 
cannot buy it, but on the world market they are selling the same 
bloody durum for $20 under the asking price.  He says every 
trader on the floor knows this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are the Americans upset over the Canadian Wheat Board 
dumping grain?  Why is this government putting at risk $1.73 
billion worth of livestock going into the U.S. because it will 
not have a transparent wheat board?  This government will not 
allow people to look at what it is dumping into the U.S. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are setting the stage for a depression in western Canada if 
we do not get transparency.  The American farmer is quite willing 
to compete with the Canadian farmer but he is not willing to do 
it at the risk of having Canadian products dumped into their 
market at half price.  The Americans cannot subsidize their 
farmers enough.  The Europeans cannot subsidize their farmers 
enough to keep up that kind of marketing system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need co-operation between Americans and Canadians to fight 
the Europeans who are our enemy but common sense on that side of 
the House tells us no, let us play politics with this issue.  Let 
us do exactly what we have been doing for the last 45 years.  Do 
the politicking on the backs of Canadian farmers.  Let them 
suffer.  The farmers cannot put food on their own tables and this 
government does not have enough common sense to have the books 
audited by the auditor general, the most accountable, the most 
respected person in this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that is anything less than a little common sense what do we 
expect of our government?  What will we expect of it next? 
Protest signs coming down and pepper spray.  What are we going to 
do to the farmers so they keep selling grain through the wheat 
board, water cannons, pepper spray or what? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this rate farmers cannot afford to grow this grain anymore. 
When we get 11 cents for barley, $2 for number one high protein 
milling wheat it does not work to pay for a $250,000 combine.  It 
does not pay to pay our property taxes on the land.  We cannot do 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this government does not smarten up and get realistic and put 
some the money into wheat board grains we are not going to have 
farmers left.  All we are going to have is some hobby farmers who 
are working for the government or some other agency to put enough 
money up so they can afford to truck their grain to the field, 
sow it and then truck it off and give it to the wheat board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot afford to live without a profit.  The only profit in 
the Canadian farm scene today is special crops and this 
government knows it. This government has been supporting the 
industry of special crops or it would not have put the motion on 
the floor to grow hemp. 
These people have been smoking something and I do not know what 
it is.  We cannot get it through their thick heads that 
competition sets the price in the world today, competition drives 
the markets, competition will be there and it will make farmers 
profitable.
