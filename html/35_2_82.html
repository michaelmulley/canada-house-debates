	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should not spend any more 
public money on non-parental day care initiatives at this time, and any existing 
expenditures for child care should subsidize financial need, not the method of child 
care chosen, and further that the program subsidize children and parents, not 
institutions and professionals.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to introduce a 
motion which the Liberals were so afraid to debate that they 
refused to make it votable. As a consequence, this debate is limited 
to just one hour. What will be confusing for so many Canadians is 
that the Liberals are restricting debate on an important promise 
they made during the 1993 election campaign.
<P>
	The Liberal promise for a national day care program was so 
important that it takes up almost two and half pages in the Liberal 
red book-pages 38 to 40 for those government members who are 
now running for their red books.
<P>
	The Liberal broken promise on child care states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In each year, following a year of 3 per cent economic growth, a Liberal 
government will create 50,000 new child care spaces to a total of 150,000.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Guess what? Economic growth using real GDP measured 4.6 per 
cent in 1994. According to the red book promise the Liberals 
should have created 50,000 new child care spaces in 1995. How 
many did they create? None that I know of. On page 39 of the 
Liberal red book, they promised to spend $120 million in 1995-95 
to create 50,000 additional child care spaces. How much did they 
spend? Nothing that I am aware of.
<P>
	The red ink book promised a total of $720 million in federal 
funding for a total of 150,000 new day care spaces. Another Liberal 
broken promise.
<P>
	On January 24, 1994 the Deputy Prime Minister repeated the 
Liberal promise in the House of Commons. She said: ``As soon as 
the economy has grown by 3 per cent we plan to open 150,000 new 
day care spaces within three years. That was clearly indicated in 
our red book and there is no doubt that the Prime Minister will 
fulfil the promises made in that book''. Oh, really? We will see how 
prominent the Liberal red book is during the next election 
campaign.
<P>
	In December 1995 the government's first minister of human 
resources promised $630 million to expand and improve day care 
spaces, but he made the offer conditional on the participation of the 
provinces. On March 8, 1996 the Secretary of State for the Status of 
Women, in response to a question in the House of Commons 
regarding the government's support for a national child care 
program, said: ``Everything she quoted in the red book is true. It 
was true then and it is true today''.
<P>
	In June 1996 the new minister of HRD promised the provinces 
just $250 million over three years. Again the provinces were 
reluctant partners.
<P>
	Now the broken election promise will be defended with the 
excuse that the provinces are to blame, not the Liberals in Ottawa. 
However, the reason I point out so clearly another broken red book 
promise is not that I am attempting to pressure the government to 
spend more tax dollars. I bring it up to illustrate how out of touch 
Liberals are with reality, to demonstrate how out of touch Liberals 
are with the real priorities of parents, how out of touch Liberals are 
with the real priorities of Canadian taxpayers. You cannot believe 
their promises.
<P>
	The other reason I bring up the Liberal broken promise is to 
illustrate a serious flaw in the democratic and parliamentary 
process. How can the government go about offering $720 million, 
$630 million or even $250 million to the provinces for a national 
day care program when the matter has not even been debated in the 
House of Commons?
<P>
	Let us get to the real reason for the debate today. If we are going 
to have a national day care program then the matter has to be 
debated in public and in the House of Commons. Frankly, I 
disagree with the federal government spending any money on a 
national day care program, and that is what the debate is about 
today.
<P>

<P>

<P>
	The Liberal government should be embarrassed that it has to be a 
Reform MP who has to bring this issue on to  the floor of the House 
of Commons as a private member's motion rather than as a 
government legislative initiative for a measure it promised in the 
1993 election campaign and repeated in the Speech from the 
Throne.
<P>
	The Liberal government should be embarrassed that it limited 
debate on this important issue to just one hour by deciding not to 
make this motion votable when it passed all 12 criteria for 
determining if an item will be votable in the House. It passed all 12 
of the government's own guidelines.
<P>
	I believe my motion is self-explanatory but when we deal with 
this government, nothing can be left to the imagination.
<P>
<B>(1110)</B>
<P>
	My motion states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should not spend any more 
public money on non-parental day care initiatives at this time, and any existing 
expenditures for child care should subsidize financial need, not the method of child 
care chosen, and further that the program subsidize children and parents, not 
institutions and professionals.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	My motion is based on longstanding Reform blue book policy. 
Reform's blue book is distinctly different from the Liberal red 
book. Reform's policies are made by our members in a democratic 
process that is open to all members of our party and voted on by 
delegates at our assemblies which, according to our party's 
constitution, are the highest authority and supreme governing body 
of the party.
<P>
	Here is where Reformers stand on a national day care program. 
Reformers support child care programs that subsidize financial 
need, not the method of child care chosen, and that subsidize 
children and parents, not institutions and professionals. That is our 
policy.
<P>
	Reformers oppose state run day care. Reformers support 
government regulation of day care standards by respecting 
provincial jurisdiction in this matter. Reformers support a system 
of flat rate taxation with continued recognition of the costs 
associated with the care of children. Until such a time as a system 
of flat rate taxation can be implemented, Reformers support the 
concept of income splitting between legally married couples to 
support and nurture families. Those are our policies.
<P>
	Reformers believe, fundamentally, that the care of children is the 
domain of families and that parents must have full responsibility in 
Canadian society to nurture and provide for children.
<P>
	Current federal programs are intrusive and restrict choices that 
parents may make in deciding on the best type of care for their 
children. We believe that the appropriate role for government is to 
provide a fair tax and benefit system that provides parents with the 
opportunity to properly care for their children in a manner of their 
own choosing, not the government's  choosing. Government must 
uphold the exclusive authority and responsibility of parents in the 
area of raising children. The only acceptable role for government is 
as an intervener to protect children in cases of abuse or neglect.
<P>
	Day care is a service that private organizations, families and 
individuals can provide efficiently and effectively. Because of this 
it is unnecessary for government to provide state run day care.
<P>
	The provinces currently set their own regulations for day care 
and there certainly is not any reason for the federal government to 
set up another bureaucracy in Ottawa to duplicate work already 
being done by the provinces, nor does the federal government have 
the constitutional authority to intrude into yet another area of 
provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	Currently federal program spending in child care creates a 
system of incentives that favours institutionalized day care to the 
detriment of home care. This occurs through government subsidies 
for day care, financed by higher taxes on stay at home parents and, 
through the child care expense deduction, allowed only to parents 
with children in receiptable day care institutions, thereby creating 
further inequity and a clear bias in favour of institutional day care.
<P>
	Another key point I would like to make in my speech today is to 
inform members of the House about the negative effects that 
institutionalized day care or, as my motion says, non-parental day 
care, has on the lives and future development of children. What 
effect does separating a baby from its mother for long periods of 
time have on the future development of the child? The answer to 
this question is truly alarming and proves beyond any doubt that 
institutionalized day care is a recipe for disaster.
<P>
	Here is the proof. In February of 1995 I had the honour of 
hosting a news conference on Parliament Hill with Dr. Mark 
Genius, executive director of the National Foundation of Family 
Research and Education. At the news conference Dr. Genius 
released the findings of two extensive studies regarding the 
influence of regular separation from parents on young children.
<P>
<B>(1115)</B>
<P>
	Dr. Genuis said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Research collected over the last 40 years on non-parental care demonstrates 
clearly that prior to five years of age, regular separation from parents results in an 
unmistakably negative effect on emotion and behavioural development in children, 
as well as a hindering effect on the security of the children's bonds to their parents. 
Further studies have linked children's insecure bonding with parents to clinical, 
emotional and behavioural difficulties, including youth crime.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Dr. Genuis continued:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The research demonstrates definite risks to the emotional health and behavioural 
adjustment of children when they are  separated from their parents on a regular basis, 
most noticeably for periods of 20 or more hours per week. Further, improved cognitive 
skills have been argued by some as a reason for increased use of regular non-parental 
care. This is not supported by the research. In fact, the results indicate a minor negative 
effect for those children raised in regular non-parental care of more than 20 hours per 
week. There is also no scientific support for the claim that high quality day care is an 
acceptable substitute for parental care.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5137"> 5137 </A></B>
<P>
	Dr. Genuis had this recommendation to the government:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Any program facilitating regular separation of children younger than five years of 
age from their parents, such as the government's present plan, will contribute to a 
destructive cycle within Canada. Canada's citizens will feel the effect through higher 
taxes, emotional distress, increased crime, lower work productivity and higher 
business costs due to mental illness and personal and family stress. The information 
now available to us in the area of regular non-parental care compels the government 
to reconsider its present plan. Further, based on the information that is now available, 
we recommend that the federal government give serious consideration to plans that 
would better enable families to take care of their own children.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I would like to clarify for the benefit of all members that Dr. 
Genuis' research involved a comprehensive analysis which 
combined and standardized the findings from all the studies 
conducted on day care since 1957 from throughout the world. All 
the problems identified by Dr. Genuis' research were not because 
day care institutions are bad places but a direct result of insecure 
bonding between the children and their parents caused by long 
periods of separation.
<P>
	This is an impressive research effort and the findings are 
difficult, if not impossible, to refute. This is not to say that Dr. 
Genuis and his research have not come under attack; they have, but 
I might add that neither has been successfully challenged. No doubt 
my Liberal colleagues will have read articles and columns in the 
country's left-wing newspapers which regularly try to extol the 
virtues of institutionalized day care.
<P>
	A study released this spring by the U.S. National Institutes of 
Health concluded that children's attachment to their mothers need 
not be harmed by as much as 30 hours a week of non-maternal care, 
the exact opposite of Dr. Genuis' exhaustive research. How can this 
be? I have to thank <I>Financial Post</I> columnist David Frum for 
pointing out the serious flaws in the study conducted by the U.S. 
National Institutes of Health and reported on so favourably by the 
country's so-called national newspapers. I will quote directly from 
Mr. Frum's column published May 4, 1996:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>When asked by a <I>New York Times</I> reporter why the National Institutes of Health 
team had found that children were less harmed by day care than previous researchers 
had found, the study co-ordinator replied that one explanation might be that previous 
studies focused on child care centres, which were found to provide the lowest quality 
of care. For a child to be spared the ill effects of separation from the mother, the 
National Institutes of Health team agreed it needs high quality care, which the NIH  
team found means care by fathers, or relatives or in the home by a caregiver. In other 
words, it does not hurt babies to be separated from mom, provided they are cared for 
by dad, grandma or an in-home nanny.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Mr. Frum also pointed out an obvious flaw in the National 
Institutes of Health study. It tracked the effects of day care only up 
to the age of 15 months. Mr. Frum also reported: ``Even the authors 
of the National Institutes of Health study conceded that their results 
are as yet so provisional and tentative that it would be irresponsible 
to put too much weight on them''.
<P>
<B>(1120 )</B>
<P>
	On the other hand, Dr. Genuis' research on the negative effects 
of institutionalized day care are conclusive. What is amazing is that 
the Liberal government would propose spending almost 
three-quarters of a billion dollars without knowing exactly what the 
effects of institutionalized day care are on the future of our 
children, our families and our country.
<P>
	By their actions the Liberals have proven they are prepared to 
take the latest left-wing fad and run with it, spending hundreds of 
millions of taxpayers hard earned dollars in the process without 
having any regard for the consequences. In light of the evidence, I 
would call the Liberal policy on day care as reckless disregard. 
Liberals obviously live by the credo of old style politicians: If the 
promise sounds good and will help us get elected, let us run with it.
<P>
	The referendum on the Charlottetown accord proved that 
Canadian voters are smarter than the elitist politicians run by 
backroom bureaucrats and slick pollsters. Canada's political 
system is undergoing a major overhaul. It started in the kitchens, 
living rooms and coffee shops across the nation. People are paying 
very close attention to what politicians say, what they promise and 
more important, what they do when they get to Ottawa. Those 
politicians who become arrogant and out of touch, politicians who 
disregard the opinions of the silent majority do so at their own 
peril.
<P>
	This is what the silent majority is telling the government about 
institutionalized day care. Liberal MPs should pay close attention. 
The people are trying to tell them something about their policies.
<P>
	In the 1991 Decima poll, 70 per cent of women surveyed said 
they would prefer to stay home to care for their children, if they had 
a choice. The Angus Reid group confirmed these opinions in the 
April 1994 survey which found that 68 per cent of Canadians 
agreed and 58 per cent strongly agreed that the traditional two 
parent family with one parent at home is the best type of family to 
raise children. Amazingly, even 68 per cent of single parents also 
agreed with the statement.
<P>
	Reformers are listening very closely to the people. That is why I 
introduced Motion No. 101. That is why I  encourage everyone 
present in the House, including the hecklers across the way, to 
listen to the scientific evidence I have introduced. I introduced 
Motion No. 101 and I encourage everyone present to support a full 
and open debate on the day care issue before we compound our past 
mistakes by committing more money to build more day care 
bureaucracies across the country.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5138"> 5138 </A></B>
<P>
	Institutionalized day care is clearly a big mistake, a very big 
mistake. Taxation has put extra stress on children because both 
parents in some households must work to keep afloat financially. 
Children in day care are more at risk and institutions cannot solve 
the problem, no matter what the quality of care is.
<P>
	The fact is that institutionalized day care creates more problems, 
increased costs to justice, increased costs to education. In the 
process, it undermines the very fabric of society. The transmission 
of values from one generation to the other is seriously put at risk.
<P>
	In conclusion, I ask the Liberals to honour their promise to make 
private members' business subject to free votes. Consequently, I 
ask for unanimous consent of the House to make Motion No. 101 
declared a votable item at this time.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The House has heard the request of the 
hon. member. Is there unanimous consent to make this motion 
votable?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I hear a no. Accordingly, the motion is 
not a votable item.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robert D. Nault (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I welcome 
the interest of the hon. member in the child care issue. It is a matter 
of great concern to all parties in the House. Whatever our political 
stripes, many of us have had to confront the challenge of assuring 
quality care for our own children.
<P>
<B>(1125)</B>
<P>
	For all his concern, I cannot support the member's motion which 
suggests that the government should not spend public money on 
non-parental day care initiatives. This measure would restrict 
rather than improve child care choices for Canadian families. Such 
a proposition is not only unreasonable but unrealistic in today's 
world. I emphasize unrealistic. It seems to me that the member and 
his friends are still operating as if they were in the 1950s and not in 
the world that we live in today.
<P>
	Before debating the merits of this motion I am obliged to point 
out that the delivery of child care services as well as the regulation 
and licensing of child care falls under provincial jurisdiction. The 
federal government indirectly funds social service programs such 
as child care through the Canada health and social transfer.
<P>
	Unlike its predecessor, the Canada assistance plan, the CHST 
does not attach conditions about the way those  federal funds are 
spent. Each province has the discretion to determine the level and 
nature of funding for child care. Most provinces ensure that 
subsidies are directed to those in greatest need, particularly low 
income families.
<P>
	Federal involvement in child care includes: the child care 
expense deduction; under the Employment Insurance Act part II, 
funds can be directed toward supporting child care expenses; the 
First Nations and Inuit child care initiative; and finally, the child 
care visions research and development program.
<P>
	In areas where the federal government does have influence, it 
has taken a very flexible approach. Canadian parents are able to 
decide how best to meet their individual family needs. This 
government strongly supports parental choice, not some sort of 
weird interest in telling people that they have to stay at home 
whether or not they would like to. If that was their choice, a lot of 
people would, but obviously in today's environment that is not 
always the case.
<P>
	The family of the 1990s is very different from the traditional two 
parent, stay at home mom variety many of us grew up with. Clearly 
a one size fits all approach to child care could not begin to meet the 
many demands facing dual income families, single working parents 
or adults trying to move off social assistance and into the labour 
force. Accessible and affordable quality care outside the parental 
home is crucial to these people.
<P>
	This government recognizes the challenges facing Canadian 
families. That is why there are no stipulations as to the type of care 
that can be declared under the child care expense deduction. 
Families can claim any form of non-parental child care so long as 
they provide receipts for their expenses.
<P>
	The federal government has introduced a number of new 
measures that support families with children. Changes to child 
support regulations in the Income Tax Act will protect the interests 
of children by ensuring that non-custodial parents live up to the 
responsibilities and provide child support payments.
<P>
	The maximum annual level of the working income supplement 
designed to help low income parents meet the extra costs related to 
working will double over the next two years from $500 to $1000. 
Starting on January 1, 1997, an innovative family income 
supplement will increase employment insurance benefits for low 
income claimants with children. These measures complement the 
child tax benefit which is specifically targeted at low to middle 
income families.
<P>
	Nowhere, and I stress nowhere, is the need for federal support 
greater than among Inuit and First Nations families. The 
Government of Canada is providing $72 million over three years 
for the First Nations and Inuit child care initiative which will lead 
to the development of 6,000 new or improved spaces in these 
communities.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5139"> 5139 </A></B>
<P>
	We have also invested another $18 million over three years in the 
child care visions research and development fund. This fund will 
seek new solutions to balancing work and family responsibilities 
by supporting studies into the adequacy, outcomes and 
cost-effectiveness of child care practices and offering insights into 
the most appropriate types of care.
<P>
	No one denies that in an ideal world probably the care of 
children would take place by one parent in the home. In reality that 
is not always possible. I stress reality.
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
	In 1993, 70 per cent of families have two earners compared to 30 
per cent 20 years ago. Labour force participation of women with 
children under six has increased from 47 per cent in 1981 to 63 per 
cent in 1993. Whether by choice or of necessity, these women and 
their families depend on having access to quality, affordable care 
for their children outside their homes.
<P>
	These parents want the assurance that they are putting their little 
loved ones in the hand of trained child care providers who can 
nurture the social, physical and emotional development of their 
young children.
<P>
	Reformers would like to turn back the clock but we cannot. In 
1950 just 30 per cent of couples with children were in the 
workforce. By 1990 the number of families with both parents 
working had increased to 70 per cent. This is today's reality. The 
majority of Canadian families want and need access to quality child 
care, often community based centre care or regulated home care.
<P>
	I suggest to the hon. member that what is really important is not 
who is getting paid, but ensuring that whoever provides the care is 
offering the best quality of care for Canada's children.
<P>
	At the first ministers' meeting last June there was broad support 
for governments to work together to develop a national child 
benefit. The federal government is collaborating closely with the 
provinces to determine how such a benefit might be implemented.
<P>
	I hope the hon. member will be a part of this important process. I 
encourage him to set aside his unnecessary motion and instead 
work with the government as we try to improve the well-being of 
Canadian children.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to take part in this debate this morning. Before I begin, I 
must clarify the motion of my Reform colleague. On the one hand, 
the Reform party wants the government not to spend any more 
public money on non-parental daycare, in other words to keep the 
funds earmarked for it at the same, limited, level. We must bear 
this point in mind. On the other hand, they want all of the existing 
expenditures for child care to be used to  subsidize parents rather 
than institutions and professionals.
<P>
	As for the first aspect, all provinces will agree that the money 
currently being spent on daycare is insufficient. Now that we are 
aware of the situation families are facing, these sums ought to be 
raised considerably in order to provide quality services. Most 
definitely, choices must be made. Should this money go directly to 
parents, or to a daycare system that is already in place and 
monitored?
<P>
	We in the Bloc Quebecois feel that, at this time, the daycare 
system already in place-which is of course, as I have said, 
under-funded-ought to be improved. This is the way to go to 
provide better services to children.
<P>
	I will take a closer look at the concept of having child care 
funding go directly to subsidize parents, rather than to institutions 
and professionals. My Reform colleague may think that this motion 
is the solution to all of the problems of insufficient daycare spaces. 
Not so.
<P>
	Even this government, the Liberal government, managed to sell 
the public during its 1993 campaign on its plan to increase the 
number of daycare spaces, a promise they have not yet been able to 
keep-nor will they before the next elections.
<P>
	Proposing such a motion indicates a very poor understanding of 
the problems faced by parents who have to work.
<P>
<B>(1135)</B>
<P>
	The problem will not be solved by giving the money directly to 
the parents. On the contrary, I think this would only make the 
problem worse. At this time, our child care centres are effective 
and provide an important service to parents who rely on them to 
care for their children.
<P>
	There are different types of child care. There are both public and 
private facilities, as well as small centres caring for fewer than nine 
children in residential neighbourhoods in each of our 
municipalities. These centres offer an ongoing presence and 
promote child development. In fact, their activities are focused on 
the social development of their small charges.
<P>
	Child care centres do not serve only the parents who, for various 
reasons, choose to send their children there. They also help other 
parents who must turn to them on a periodic basis because they 
work or go to school, or because of illness in the family.
<P>
	In Quebec, this is an area of provincial jurisdiction. As we know, 
the federal government transfers money to Quebec so it can run the 
child care network. The hitch in all this is that, in transferring this 
money, the federal government sets certain conditions the Quebec 
government must meet.
<P>
	As you probably guessed, I would like the federal government to 
completely withdraw from this area of  jurisdiction and authorize 
the transfer of tax points directly to the provinces, which will then 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5140"> 5140 </A></B>
<P>
be able to set up the system they want. If the federal government 
insists on continuing to transfer money without giving us the tax 
points, it should stop imposing so-called national standards that 
simply confuse the issue.
<P>
	To help parents and the child care network, the Quebec 
government gives the money to the child care centres themselves 
for certain reasons. First, it helps preserve the quality of services. 
This approach assures parents their children will be in an 
environment that will allow them to develop normally.
<P>
	Quebec's child care centres must meet certain standards and 
undergo inspections by a monitoring agency to ensure that these 
standards are being maintained.
<P>
	If, as the Reform motion suggests, the money were given 
directly to parents, would the exact same level of service be 
provided? Of course, it is another option, but would controls be 
available? Why change something that is working well as it is?
<P>
	If we really want to make child care more like that provided by 
the parents, we could draw inspiration from the child care project 
underway in my riding, where a not-for-profit organization offers 
home day care services in rural areas. The services are provided 
under the supervision of an agency which, as I just said, is a 
not-for-profit organization. The purpose is not to make money, but 
to make sure the services parents are entitled to are available 
everywhere. Visits can be made to these homes to ensure the 
children are receiving the services they are entitled to. As I said 
earlier, existing day care centres promote the social development of 
children. They do more than that: they teach these children how to 
live in society.
<P>
<B>(1140)</B>
<P>
	As we all know, today, families have few children, often a single 
child. In this context, daycare centres will a void. They focus their 
action on the modern family concept.
<P>
	I think that the social integration of children should be fostered 
from a very early age and that daycare centres are one way of 
achieving this. This is a place where young children can prepare for 
entering the school world. If we think back to this time of our lives, 
we will remember that it was not always easy. Daycare centres play 
a role in helping children and, indirectly, their parents. As far as I 
am concerned, daycare centres are useful, efficient and necessary.
<P>
	The problem, of course, is the lack of day care spaces. Unable to 
meet the promise it made in 1993 to create day care spaces, this 
government will have to review its position on this issue as well as 
on social housing. In fact, it has taken the same approach to day 
care as it did to  social housing, completely withdrawing financial 
support. There is indeed a need for daycare centres.
<P>
	My hon. friends from the Reform Party are headed in the wrong 
direction with this motion we have before us today. There is also a 
danger. Subsidizing parents could create a new problem: parents 
could use the money for themselves, as it will certainly happen. 
Not everyone will do it, but some parents might use the money to 
hire people who are not always qualified for this type of work. Such 
an arrangement would also promote moonlighting. As we know, no 
level of government can currently afford such schemes. 
Governments are trying to stop clandestine work in other areas, but 
to bypass the daycare structure would actually open the door to 
such activity.
<P>
	Hiring a good person to look after the children is probably a 
parent's primary concern. Sometimes though, mistakes can be 
made. Sometimes, people do not have the proper qualifications to 
do the job. People who work through the daycare system are, of 
course, paid a salary. This salary is taxed, which means it is easier 
to monitor the situation.
<P>
	Moreover, daycares often provide support for single-parent 
families which, as we have often said it this House, are usually 
headed by the mother. Whether we like it or not, the fact is that, 
more often than not, these women have to rely on social assistance. 
Therefore, they must have access to quality services.
<P>
	However, I think there is room for improvement in daycare 
services. A lingering problem in my region is that few daycares 
take into account the needs of parents who work in the evening, at 
night and on weekends. We must absolutely look at this issue and 
provide services seven days a week, 24 hours a day. This is an 
improvement that must be made as quickly as possible.
<P>
<B>(1145)</B>
<P>
	As I said earlier, Reformers are again headed in the wrong 
direction, because daycares come under provincial jurisdiction. If 
the Reform Party wants to do something about this issue, it should 
team up with the Bloc Quebecois to ask the federal government to 
completely withdraw from this area, and to pay fair compensation 
to the provinces. The federal government is far from taking this 
position.
<P>
	During the federal-provincial conference held in September 
1995, the federal minister even went so far as to say he was 
prepared to co-operate with the provinces, provided that-

his time is up.

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sharon Hayes (Port Moody-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak to Motion No. 101.
<P>
	The motion presented by my Reform colleague from 
Yorkton-Melville has three main points to which I will speak 
today. First, the government will not provide any more public 
money on non-parental day care initiatives. Second, existing 
expenditures should go to the needs, not the method of care. Third, 
the subsidy should be to the parents and children, not to institutions 
and professionals.
<P>
	The Reform policy is described in the blue book, which my 
colleague from Yorkton-Melville has explained. There is so much 
I could say on this issue but I will not repeat much of what he has 
said.
<P>
	However, this week is most appropriate to address matters 
relating to the family as this is national family week. Families do 
not exist separately from government policy. The government 
attitude to the importance of family is reflected in its attention to or 
its neglect of families in its policies.
<P>
	I will look briefly at the Liberal government's record and its 
shabby treatment of families in its public policy. This government, 
that spends tens of millions of dollars every year on gender issues, 
billions of dollars on children's issues, seems to have a very 
myopic, shortsighted vision of a stronger country through stronger 
families.
<P>
	The legacy of this myopia is seen in the record of the last quarter 
century, which has been controlled by the old vision of old 
governments, the legacy of the failure of the Liberal vision, of 
more taxes, more government in the lives of Canadians and quite 
frankly, the wrong priorities in public policy.
<P>
	The first statement in this motion is that government should not 
spend any more public money on non-parental day care initiatives. 
The plain truth, which I can say quite briefly, is that the 
government is now bankrupt both of ideas and of money. The 
government has been forced lately, with the help of the Reform 
Party, to start to put its House in order. However, we still need a 
clear statement of deficit elimination because sadly we are still 
digging that debt hole.
<P>
	The legacy of the government's spending will add within its 
mandate $100 billion to the national debt. The interest alone on that 
increased debt will be paid every year even when the budget is 
balanced. If we stop to think for a moment, the interest only on that 
increased debt courtesy of the present Liberal government would 
be enough to pay 100,000 families in excess of $70,000 every year 
from now until forever. Let us decide right now that we do not need 
increased government spending.
<P>
	The second point in my colleague's motion is that existing 
expenditures should go to need, not to the government's prescribed 
method. When families are looking for solutions to their problems, 
do they need to go first to government, particularly the federal 
government? Would I want a federal bureaucrat coming  to my 
kitchen table and saying to me: ``I am here from Ottawa, I came to 
help?'' Hardly. Le probléme c'est Ottawa.
<P>
	Where has this brought us, this feeling that Ottawa can solve the 
problems of this country? Child poverty in the last 20 years has not 
been brought under control by government policy. In fact it is more 
of a problem now than it used to be. Youth and child crime are 
epidemic. Teen suicides have grown in epidemic proportions. Our 
families are disintegrating around us. Just last week we heard that 
teen pregnancies, the greatest precursor of poverty in our society, 
will be more of a dilemma for the next generation than it has been 
for this one. They have gone up 20 per cent since 1987.
<P>
<B>(1150)</B>
<P>
	The history of the involvement of government in people's lives 
has been costly, has been through misdirected social policies and in 
fact, as we have already heard, it parallels the growth of duel 
income families.
<P>
	Do families today have the choice? Hardly. As my colleague 
stated, 70 per cent of women with preschool children told an Angus 
Reid poll recently that they would remain home if they felt they 
could afford to do so. However, the government has removed that 
choice from them. In other words, misdirected government 
spending eventually translates into greater demand for the 
programs set up by the government to deal with those problems. 
How convenient for a Liberal minded government that simply 
wants an excuse to justify programs and to continue its existence in 
the future.
<P>
	The history of government in the involvement of private affairs 
of law-abiding families is a history of greater and greater intrusion, 
a vicious circle which can only be alleviated when the government 
withdraws its meddling hands from the lives of Canadian families 
and when it allows them to keep more of their hard earned income 
rather than taking half of it.
<P>
	This is the product of the old vision for a Canadian society which 
still grips the hearts and the minds of those who are determining 
government policy on that side of the House. Government 
programs must be directed to need. Government programs must not 
create greater dependency and thus create a greater problem for 
society.
<P>
	There is not a need for dependence in our society but a need for 
empowerment through a recognition of wise choices, not 
government choices, and of faith in Canadians and a faith in 
Canadian families.
<P>
	The third point in my colleague's motion bill is that the 
government's interest should be in a subsidy to parents and 
children and not institutions and professionals. I often hear the 
mantra from the Liberals concerning the best interests of the child. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5142"> 5142 </A></B>
<P>
They would translate that into a saying that the best interests of a  
child are more government programs, more government spending.
<P>
	I question their child care expense deduction. In fact the Liberal 
member mentioned that. Right now that program is only of benefit 
to those who can present receipts. How in the world can a parent at 
home present receipts to a government and yet that care is valid. In 
fact that care is preferred by the majority of Canadians.
<P>
	We talk about the best interests of the child, Liberal style. In fact, 
it is the worst interest of the future of our country. As I have said on 
the expensive programs, those very children as adults will be 
passed the bill for the very programs that supposedly were for their 
good. That debt is passed on with interest over the years and it is 
the children who will be paying that. Their jobs and their security 
will be at risk because of it.
<P>
	As my colleague mentioned, studies such as the 40-year study 
compendium put forward by Dr. Genius of the National Foundation 
for Family Research and Education said non-parental day care of 
more than 20 hours a week in early childhood posed a significant 
risk factor in developing insecure bonding with parents. Once 
established, that insecure bonding is a central factor in social and 
behavioural development.
<P>
	That has been ignored by the other parties as they have talked to 
this bill. In 1993 there were 2,232,250 children in licensed day care 
in Canada. That is not the choice of parents but courtesy of 
misdirected government policy. There are other problems as well. I 
speak today of the spread of disease and the long term 
complications both to individuals and society because of that, the 
long term risk of overuse or early use of antibiotics and that 
overuse to public health.
<P>
	Today I have brought a few clippings from June 9, 1996. The 
number of recurrent ear infections, the bane of preschool children 
and their parents, rose 44 per cent in the 1980s. This increase was 
blamed largely on the earlier entry to child day care and exposure 
to germs. Also I have an article by Dr. Harrison Spencer, chief of 
parasitic diseases at the Centres for Disease Control in Minnesota. I 
quote: ``Day care children are at risk anywhere from 2 to 18 times 
as much as non-day care kids for certain infectious diseases that 
run the gambit from diarrheal diseases to respiratory and flu like 
illnesses''.
<P>
<B>(1155)</B>
<P>
	As well, Winnipeg disease expert, Dr. Ron Gold says: ``The 
200,000 plus Canadian children in day care are twice as likely to 
get sick as those cared for at home. There is a horrible litany of day 
care related diseases, as they are called. Over 70 per cent of clinical 
cases of hepatitis A can be traced to a day care setting'', and on it 
goes.
<P>
	The Liberal response to these problems presented by day care are 
that they would choose their well-funded feminist agenda that state 
funding of day care is a priority and that women must be in the 
workplace.
<P>
	I recently received a letter from a constituent which reflects the 
priorities of the government and refers to parental care and its 
priorities in the taxation system. The letter actually states that the 
government rejects a certain method of taxation because it can 
involve work disincentives for the second spouse to enter the 
workforce, that is, the government has said that it rejects a certain 
taxation system because it might stop the second spouse from 
working. Does this not reflect a bias toward having both parents in 
the workforce? This is full in the face of evidence which says that 
children need their parents at home and many parents would prefer 
to stay at home.
<P>
	The government's social engineering policies have been 
tremendously effective. In the 15 years from 1977 to 1992 the 
number of mothers with children under the age of six who were in 
the workforce grew from 38 per cent to a full 63 per cent. But this 
choice, as I said before, was not made freely.
<P>
	There is a new vision required for children in Canada, a vision 
that requires aid to those who are truly in need, a vision that 
empowers people instead of fuelling institutions-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am sorry to tell the hon. member that 
her time has expired.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke-Lakeshore, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to respond to the motion of the hon. member 
for Yorkton-Melville. Though well intentioned, the motion is 
misdirected. Imagine bringing forward questionable research to 
support arguments.
<P>
	Few issues matter more to the millions of parents in the country 
than ensuring that their children have every opportunity to play and 
learn in safe, nurturing and healthy environments. I am surprised 
that the member, who travelled with the human resources 
development standing committee, who listened but really did not 
hear the voices of the parents who appeared before the committee 
on this subject. Assuring the welfare of our children is critical to 
this country's future. Quality care provides the foundation for 
lifelong learning and increases the employability of the next 
generation.
<P>
	Happy, well adjusted children today will go on to lead 
productive and rewarding lives as parents, workers and taxpayers. 
While I am sure that we all agree on that, I am convinced this 
motion will not advance that objective.
<P>
	Motion No. 101 seems to be based on a number of incorrect 
assumptions. As my colleagues have already noted, the delivery of 
child care services as well as their regulation and licensing comes 
under provincial authority. The federal government only indirectly 
funds social service programs such as child care through the  
Canada health and social transfer. This provides maximum 
flexibil-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5143"> 5143 </A></B>
<P>
ity to provinces, allowing them to design and deliver their 
programs according to their priorities and to suit the needs of their 
communities.
<P>
	The changes suggested by the hon. member's motion would 
require revisions to the CHST, changes that would be unwelcomed 
by provinces and in fact would be contrary to the spirit of the 
speech from the throne.
<P>
<B>(1200 )</B>
<P>
	The Government of Canada has stated that it will not use its 
spending powers to influence how provinces provide social 
services, including child care. I am sure that the hon. member 
supports this position.
<P>
	I would like to remind the House that at last summer's first 
ministers meeting, the premiers and the Prime Minister agreed that 
more effort should be directed to improving the well-being of 
Canadian children. The government is currently discussing a 
possible national child benefit program with the provinces.
<P>
	The federal government is investing $90 million over three years 
in two initiatives alone. The government already provides support 
to families and children through such initiatives as the child tax 
benefit, which is targeted to low and middle income families; 
increases in the working income supplement; the child care 
expense deduction; changes to the child support regulations in the 
Income Tax Act; funds which can be directed toward child care 
expenses under the Employment Insurance Act; the First Nations 
and Inuit child care initiative; the child care visions research and 
development program. There are many programs totalling millions 
of dollars. This is a reflection of the importance we attach to this 
issue.
<P>
	These programs highlight the legitimate and appropriate role of 
the federal government in fully addressing the needs of families 
and underscores two important points. The first is that the federal 
government supports parental choice. I think this is lost on the 
members of the other party. This especially applies to aboriginal 
communities. Child care there must reflect the unique traditions 
and circumstances of First Nations and Inuit families and must be 
sensitive to their cultural priorities.
<P>
	The federal government is concerned that Canadian families 
have access to quality child care. Ideally, parents should have 
reasonable and affordable alternatives, whether found in 
community based centres or regulated home day care.
<P>
	Women particularly could be penalized by this motion which 
might severely limit rather than strengthen their child care choices.
<P>
	Women's participation in the workforce is increasingly 
important to family incomes and women's career aspirations. 
Many families now need two incomes just to  make ends meet. 
Today almost two-thirds of women with children under the age of 
six work outside the home. I am sure that the hon. member 
recognizes that our economy depends on the contributions of 
women in the workplace.
<P>
	We also know that accessible and affordable child care can help 
more mothers move into the labour force and off social welfare 
rolls. Being able to leave their children with qualified care 
providers can mean the difference between dependence and 
self-sufficiency for these women. They must have child care 
choices that will allow them to enter or re-enter the workforce and 
provide for their families, something which Motion No. 101 could 
restrict.
<P>
	The second key point I want to make is that we are beginning to 
understand the factors that go into assuring quality care. That is 
why the child care visions emphasis on research and evaluation is 
so important. The hon. member's motion rests on the assumption 
that parental care in the home is always the best option. Doubtless 
in the vast majority of cases this would be true if working parents 
had the choice.
<P>
	No member in this House today would argue that the best setting 
for young children is at home in the care of a loving parent. 
However, this is not a viable choice for an increasing number of 
parents who must work, take training or who, for other reasons, 
cannot remain at home. The facts are that more and more children 
are spending longer hours each day in the care of adults other than 
their parents. This fact cannot be denied.
<P>
	Is it not, therefore, incumbent on all levels of government to 
ensure, to the degree possible, that children receive quality care not 
only for their safety and well-being but also to contribute to their 
healthy development? It is not enough to assume that child care is 
just child minding and that anyone can do. Do we not want the very 
best for Canada's children?
<P>
<B>(1205)</B>
<P>
	There are no easy answers to the child care question. Canadian 
parents are often confronted with difficult choices. That is why it is 
essential we increase and improve their options, something this 
motion clearly would not do.
<P>
	I urge the members of this House to bear in mind that we should 
not play politics with something so precious as our children. This is 
why I urge them to defeat Motion No. 101.
<P>
	What really matters is doing what is best for Canada's families. 
Let us work together to ensure that we do precisely that.

of Private Members' Business has now expired. The order is

	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. In light 
of the fact that this is the beginning of national family week and in 
light of the fact that I have heard some speeches from both sides of 
the House over this very debatable item of universal day care, with 
the confidence that the government has that it is doing the right 
thing, I believe this item deserves full debate.
<P>
	I would ask, on a point of order, that each member of this House 
carefully consider taking this item and moving it to a votable 
motion in the sense that it is an extremely important one. The 
Canadian people deserve their say and the way they will have their 
say is through the votes of their members. I encourage them to do 
so as I make that motion.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The notice had already been read that the 
matter had expired because the hour had expired. Although, in 
fairness, the member gave me prior notice of that, his point is not 
really a point of order. As he knows, the matter was raised earlier 
by another member. The House was asked to express its view on 
that about a half hour earlier.
<P>
	He is on the record, but the Chair cannot rule that is a proper 
point order and cannot, therefore, ask for unanimous consent.

	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (on behalf of the Minister of Fisheries 
and Oceans, Lib.) </B>moved that Bill C-26, an Act respecting the 
oceans of Canada, be read for the third time and passed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have the great 
pleasure of leading off this final debate in the House of Commons 
on the oceans act, which confirms Canada's role as a world leader 
in the management and protection of oceans and marine resources. 
It is a bill in which I take a great interest because of my training in 
international law, including the law of the sea.
<P>
	The bill being presented to Parliament is an extremely important 
one for two reasons. First of all, this bill confirms Canada's role as 
a world leader in the management and protection of oceans and 
marine resources. Second, this bill is proof that our Parliamentary 
process can work in the best interest of all Canadians.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The bill which was introduced June 1995 was very good 
legislation. The bill we have before us today, however, is much 
better legislation. The Standing  Committee on Fisheries and 
Oceans under the chairmanship of the hon. member for Dartmouth 
and then under the chairmanship of the hon. member for Egmont 
has demonstrated the thoughtful, practical and far sighted vision 
Canadians expect from members of Parliament.
<P>
	Last September the former minister of fisheries and oceans told 
the House of Commons we want the strongest possible bill that can 
be provided. In doing so, he called the members of the standing 
committee the conscience and the voice of the oceans.
<P>
	The standing committee conducted an exhaustive and pragmatic 
review of the bill. There were and there are some disagreements, as 
there almost always are, on the details of comprehensive 
legislation. Those differences were aired in a spirit of honesty, and 
an earnest exchange of views between committee members and 
witnesses allowed for some common ground to be found.
<P>
	When the former minister had the chance to appear before the 
committee, the opposition members gave him a fair hearing. The 
hon. member for Gaspé, representing the Bloc Quebecois, showed 
a keen interest in this bill as he provided his views and concerns 
with the bill. These issues were thoroughly discussed and debated 
at that time, and some consensus was reached despite his very 
profound differences on other issues of national importance. And 
the Reform Party represented by the hon. member for Skeena 
showed a commitment to put the well-being of our oceans above 
the well-being of our respective political parties.
<P>
<B>(1210)</B>
<P>
	Indeed it was the member for Skeena who stated at the 
committee: ``I would like to say that the principle of the bill is valid 
and it is past time that Canada should adopt such an act''.
<P>
	The legislative process, the committee process, has worked 
partly because the government has responded positively to 
suggestions made by members of Parliament. The real success, 
however, comes from the fact that the standing committee listened 
attentively to the recommendations, a wide range of witnesses and 
then acted on those recommendations by suggesting improvements 
to the bill.
<P>
	Jeremy Bentham recognized that law is not made by judge alone 
but by judge and company. The member for Dartmouth put it this 
way at committee: ``People outside of the ministry and outside of 
senior advisors to ministers actually have a role to play in ensuring 
that there is better legislation''.
<P>
	The witnesses making valuable contributions to this bill ran the 
gamut from the Canadian Nature Federation to the Naval Officers' 
Association of Canada, from the Snow Crab Fishermen's 
Association to the Inuit Tapirisat, from the Newfoundland Oceans 
Industries Association to the Pacific Fishermen's Alliance.  
Canadians 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5145"> 5145 </A></B>
<P>
spoke, the standing committee acted, the government acted and 
now Parliament is acting.
<P>
	The oceans act accomplishes three key legislative ends. It stakes 
out Canada's jurisdiction over 6.5 million square kilometres of 
ocean areas. It establishes the framework for proactive oceans 
management strategy based on collaboration among all Canadians. 
It gives authority to the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans to act as 
the federal lead in ocean related policies and activities.
<P>
	The basic principles underlying the bill are quite 
straightforward. The first principle is that we must ensure the 
sustainable development of our oceans. The economic and 
environmental actions we take to meet our needs must not 
compromise the ability of future generations to meet their needs.
<P>
	The second principle is the need for integrated management of 
activities in our marine coastal waters. For too long we have 
allowed our actions to be thought of sector by sector. We cannot 
afford to compartmentalize ocean activities, because each of these 
activities can have a profound impact on the health and wealth of 
the oceans as a whole.
<P>
	The third principle is the need for a precautionary approach to 
oceans management. We must choose to err on the side of caution. 
We cannot take the risk of destroying our oceans ecosystems 
forever because we took a gamble today.
<P>
	This bill has been a long time coming. Over 70 per cent of our 
planet is covered by oceans. Canada's oceans have shaped us a 
country and defined us as a people. Our oceans have long served as 
beacons of hope for individual success and collective prosperity. 
Our Arctic, Pacific and Atlantic waters make Canada the only 
country in the world with three distinct ocean ecosystems. Our 
country has the world's longest coastline.
<P>
	The simple fact is that Canadians, whether we live along the 
coast or thousands of kilometres inland, have long had a love affair 
with the oceans. We have long shown strong international 
leadership on the protection of ocean resources. It is time to turn 
those noble sentiments into wise policy. It is time to back up our 
strong global voice in ocean resources with strong domestic action.
<P>
	Canada has never had a comprehensive co-ordinated blueprint 
for responsible management of our three oceans and the renewable 
and non-renewable resources they contain. It is time to lead by 
example. It is time to respond to changes in international law and to 
advances in environmental understanding. It is time to end what the 
former national advisory board on science and technology, now the 
Advisory Council on Science and Technology, called our 
haphazard and ad hoc approach to ocean policy.
<P>
	The World Commission on Environment and Development and 
the Rio summit both called for actions taken in this legislation. Our 
experience from resource crisis and the turbot dispute calls for the 
actions undertaken by the bill. Our oceans are deeply important to 
Canadians. We need to exercise jurisdiction over those oceans not 
only in the interests of Canadians but in the interest of the wonders 
those oceans contain.
<P>
	The national advisory board on science and technology 
specifically called for an oceans act. At the meeting in 
Charlottetown last November provincial and territorial fisheries 
ministers publicly endorsed the intent of the oceans act. At 
hearings across the country during the last year, Canadians from 
every sector and every community overwhelmingly urged the 
adoption of an oceans act.
<P>
<B>(1215)</B>
<P>
	Bill C-26 will formally define for the first time in Canadian law 
a 12 nautical mile contiguous zone and also an exclusive economic 
zone that stretches 200 nautical miles from our coasts. In the 
contiguous zone, Canada will have new powers to enforce our 
customs and tax laws. In the exclusive economic zone, Canada will 
control the management of all resources. What is most important is 
that this new jurisdiction enables Canadians to apply the same 
environmental laws to our oceans as we apply in the rest of Canada.
<P>
	Having staked out that jurisdiction, Bill C-26 establishes the 
basis for an oceans management strategy. This will allow 
Canadians to develop and implement high standards for ocean 
stewardship, high standards for partnership and co-operation and 
high standards for meeting national goals based on regional and 
local needs.
<P>
	The foundation of the new strategy will allow Canadians to 
accept shared responsibility for ocean knowledge and 
understanding, marine resource management, marine 
environmental management, coastal economic development, ocean 
safety and continuing international leadership on ocean issues.
<P>
	Bill C-26 obliges the federal government to rationalize and 
modernize its own ocean policies and programs.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	At the present time, management responsibilities for oceans and 
marine resources are handled by 14 government departments and 
agencies. The oceans act clearly designates the Department of 
Fisheries and Oceans as the primary federal body with 
responsibility for these areas.
<P>
	This means the elimination of overlap and duplication. This 
means a considerable increase in federal government 
accountability. The Minister of Fisheries and Oceans will not pass 
on to others the responsibility of taking action where oceans are 
concerned.
<P>
	The debate on this bill has raised certain concerns that I feel 
deserve our attention.

<P>
	There have been some fears raised that the oceans act may 
somehow be a means to deal indirectly with fisheries licensing and 
allocation issues. This bill is not about the setting of fish quotas or 
privatization of fisheries. This bill is not a fisheries management 
act. It is an oceans management act.
<P>
	Parliament will be dealing with a new fisheries act. When it is 
debated I am certain it will spark, to put it mildly, lively debate. I 
trust though that members of Parliament will not delay the oceans 
act because of disagreements they may have over the future 
fisheries act. That would be a very unfortunate undermining of the 
really good work we have accomplished on the bill currently before 
the House.
<P>
	Another concern raised about the oceans act is that it may lead to 
more bureaucracy and higher spending by the Department of 
Fisheries and Oceans. We want to guarantee to Canadians that the 
reorganization of the Department of Fisheries and Oceans has 
resulted in significant spending cuts. Following the merger of DFO 
and the coast guard, the total reduction in net spending will be 
about $500 million by the year 2000.
<P>
	The final concern raised by Bill C-26 is that it might give 
jurisdiction to the federal government at the expense of the 
provinces and territories. Let me make it as simple as possible: 
There is zero impact on the jurisdiction of the provinces or 
territories. This is not a bill about taking power from other 
governments; it is about bringing governments and people together 
to manage our oceans with intelligence, innovation and consensus.
<P>
	In fact, I think it is fair to say that the legitimate reservations 
anyone may have had about this legislation were thoroughly 
considered during the committee hearings and thoroughly 
addressed through the valuable amendments made to the bill. The 
preamble to the bill is considerably stronger than it was only a few 
months ago.
<P>
	The final bill underscores that our three oceans are the common 
heritage of all Canadians and that conservation based on an 
ecosystem is essential to the diversity and productivity of those 
oceans. The preamble now contains a clause which states that 
Canada will promote the application of the precautionary approach 
in order to protect resources and safeguard the ocean environment.
<P>
<B>(1220 )</B>
<P>
	The preamble also highlights the point now made repeatedly 
throughout the bill. The Minister of Fisheries and Oceans will work 
with provincial and territorial governments, aboriginal 
organizations and bodies established under land claims 
agreements, as well as other federal ministers, boards and agencies 
to develop a comprehensive oceans management strategy for 
Canada. It emphasizes the important function of other levels of 
government and aboriginal people in assuring that a national 
oceans policy truly serves all Canadians.
<P>
	The improved bill strengthens both the power and the fairness of 
enforcement procedures. The Government of Canada now has clear 
authority to prevent the entry to Canada of any person in the 12 
nautical mile contiguous zone who is likely to commit an offence 
in Canada. The law now authorizes search and seizure and arrest 
powers in the contiguous zone if there is reason to believe that an 
offence was committed on Canadian territory.
<P>
	The bill has been substantially strengthened by obliging the 
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans to show leadership in the 
establishment of marine protected areas. As amended, this bill 
enables the establishment of marine protected areas for a variety of 
purposes. These include: the conservation and protection of 
commercial and non-commercial fishery resources including 
marine mammals and their habitats; the conservation and 
protection of endangered or threatened marine species and their 
habitats; the conservation and protection of unique habitats; the 
conservation and protection of marine areas of high biodiversity or 
biological productivity; and the conservation and protection of any 
other marine resource or habitat as is necessary to fulfil the 
mandate of the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.
<P>
	The standing committee has made it clear that the Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans may recommend regulations on zoning or the 
prohibition of activities within marine protected areas in order to 
protect fish and marine mammals, endangered species and their 
habitats, and any marine areas of high biodiversity or biological 
productivity. This is a major step forward in assigning 
responsibility and power for the creation of a national policy for the 
establishment of marine protected areas. The standing committee 
also amended the bill to give the minister emergency powers to 
protect any marine resource or habitat which is deemed to be at 
risk.
<P>
	The original version of the bill authorized the minister to set 
marine environmental quality guidelines. The new version 
authorizes the minister to give those guidelines the force of normal 
regulations and also gives the minister the authority to set the 
duties of officers designated to enforce those regulations.
<P>
	Once again, these amendments illustrate that the Standing 
Committee on Fisheries and Oceans is the conscience and the voice 
of the oceans.
<P>
	It could have been tempting for members of Parliament from 
coastal communities to water down environmental provisions of 
the bill in order to ensure short term economic gains for their 
communities. They have done exactly the opposite. They have 
toughened up the environmental provisions of the bill. They have 
strengthened the provisions to guarantee sustainable development, 
integrated management and a precautionary approach to oceans 
issues. They have made the substance of the bill reflect the 
preamble of the bill.
<P>
	The standing committee has also toughened up the requirements 
on the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans to  show leadership, to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5147"> 5147 </A></B>
<P>
seek consensus, to take action and to be held responsible for his 
actions. This same spirit of political accountability is found in 
amendments which make the minister, not senior officials, 
responsible for coast guard services and hydrographic services.
<P>
	The minister will be ultimately responsible for federal policies 
on the safe, economical and efficient movement of ships, including 
aids for navigation, pleasure craft safety, and marine pollution 
prevention and response. The minister will be responsible for 
setting hydrographic standards and for providing hydrographic 
advice, services and support to other governments and international 
organizations.
<P>
	The bottom line is that the standing committee has amended the 
bill to give the minister more powers to do the job of protecting 
Canada's oceans. The bottom line is also that the committee has 
amended the bill to make certain that the minister cannot hide 
behind public servants or cabinet colleagues in carrying out those 
powers.
<P>
	There is one more amendment which deserves special praise. 
Clause 42 of the bill has been expanded to permit conducting 
studies to obtain traditional ecological knowledge for the purpose 
of understanding the life and the mysteries of our oceans. That is a 
very smart move. The people who for generations have survived by 
and on the oceans have enormous knowledge of currents, tides, 
temperatures and marine organisms. They more than any of us 
appreciate both the fathoms of the ocean and what is unfathomable.
<P>
<B>(1225)</B>
<P>
	When you live by the sea, you learn to revere the sea. I am 
certain all of us have much to learn from that hard won and time 
honoured knowledge. The truth is of course that Canadians have 
been learning about the oceans ever since the first inhabitants of 
our far north crossed over the Bering Strait from Asia thousands of 
years ago.
<P>
	The oceans act is the modern day expression of what we know 
and what we do not know, where we are and where we must go. For 
all the accumulated wisdom, for all the international calls to action, 
for all the hard work by researchers, environmentalists, businesses, 
fishers, aboriginal peoples, governments, coastal residents and 
others, we are still only at the stage of saying it is time to claim full 
jurisdiction, time to get the federal government's oceans 
management structures in order and time to pull together on 
devising a long range oceans management strategy.
<P>
	We are not yet at the stage of having a complete oceans strategy 
in place. The bill does not attempt to do that. Effective strategy can 
only come about through the formation of collaborative 
agreements among all Canadians and the acceptance of 
responsibility by all Canadians.
<P>
	This bill provides the mandate and the basic tools to develop the 
strategy but it is only a beginning. Leadership by the federal 
government is important but we will only make the best decisions 
with local leadership, community involvement and an ongoing 
willingness to create a collegial, collaborative, holistic, 
cross-sectoral, cross-country approach to the management of our 
vast and diverse ocean resources. That is the new pluralism in our 
federalism and federal government.
<P>
	This bill sets the stage but it is up to Canadians now to write the 
script and play our roles. Planning for the ocean jobs of the future is 
not a one day nor a one person operation. Decisions that affect our 
children's future and our grandchildren's future require the input, 
the initiative and the involvement of us all.
<P>
	We do know that this bill may need to be revised in the future, 
that we may need to hold ourselves to account. To reassure those 
who worry that we may not have crossed every <I>t</I> or dotted every <I>i</I> in 
this bill, there is a critical and democratic improvement 
recommended by the standing committee. The amended bill now 
requires a review of the administration of the oceans act within 
three years by the Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans. 
Parliament will have the right and indeed the duty to ensure that 
both the provisions and the operation of the oceans act meet the 
desires of Canadians and the needs of our oceans.
<P>
	We all know from our contemporary history that Canadians have 
an enormous capacity to come together in order to defend the 
interests of our ocean resources internationally. It was two years 
ago that Parliament passed Bill C-29, an act to amend the Coastal 
Fisheries Protection Act, and Parliament passed it in two days. We 
know that Canadians will come together to support our global 
oceans conservation measures and that they will put aside partisan 
differences to do so.
<P>
	Canadians all agree on the need to rally in support of the wise 
and prudent precautionary management of Canada's oceans and 
ocean resources. The bill before Parliament calls upon us to rally 
domestically for our oceans in the same way we are willing to rally 
internationally. The organisms of our oceans would not know one 
politician from another. We know however that unless we act to 
protect those organisms, they may not survive and we will all be 
the losers.
<P>
	It has been 50 years since the Right Hon. Lester Pearson called 
upon Canadians to demonstrate international leadership through 
national commitment on the law of the sea and the oceans. It has 
been nearly 40 years since the Right Hon. John Diefenbaker 
ensured that Canada took a position at the vanguard of the first UN 
conference on oceans. It has been nearly 30 years since the Right 
Hon. Pierre Trudeau and our current Prime Minister as one of his 
colleagues acted to protect Arctic waters from pollution 
prevention. It has been  nearly 20 years since our current Governor 
General asserted Canada's 200 mile fishing zone.

<P>
	As members in this House, we do not, perhaps, have the vision of 
Mr. Pearson and of Mr. Diefenbaker. What we do have, however, is 
the common ability to work toward the achievement of their vision 
of a responsible country that undertakes to do what it can to resolve 
the major issues facing this planet.
<P>
	We have in common the ability to introduce an oceans act, which 
marks a step ahead in meeting our own needs, while respecting 
those of generations of Canadians to come.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This is a good bill and it has been made much better by the 
diligence and the energy of a broad array of Canadians and by the 
very effective efforts of all members of the Standing Committee on 
Fisheries and Oceans.
<P>
	We encourage members of Parliament to pass this bill with 
enthusiasm and with optimism for the future.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, unlike my 
colleague across the way, the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, I must admit that I am not 
necessarily enthusiastic about speaking to this bill on ocean 
management.
<P>
	I must start out by indicating that the Bloc Quebecois disagrees 
with the government on it, and I will take the next few minutes to 
explain why.
<P>
	The lengthy efforts put into it by the standing committee have 
been referred to, and I must acknowledge that, indeed, much work 
has been put into it, and the parliamentary secretary is the one who 
deserves all the credit. However, all partisan feelings, which may 
be present in this House, aside the ideas and principles defended by 
the Bloc Quebecois during the committee stage were put forward 
precisely in order to ensure a better basis for participation by the 
various provinces in this strategy.
<P>
	This concept of partnership is necessary if the strategy the 
Government wants is to work properly. Since the Government 
has-pardon my expression-closed its ears to those proposals, the 
Bloc Quebecois finds itself forced to vote against the bill in 
question.
<P>
	I must also make it clear, for the benefit of all environmental 
groups in Canada and Quebec, that the Bloc Quebecois is not 
opposed to the form and principle of an ocean management 
strategy. No one can be against virtue. But, precisely in order to 
ensure that this virtue serves a purpose, we wanted to ensure that 
the proposals contained in this bill could be implemented in 
practice.
<P>
	The partnership of trust required to implement this strategy had 
to be reflected in the bill, and it was the duty of everyone to get 
involved in it with honour and enthusiasm. We did not see that 
notion of partnership in the bill, nor in the final version we have 
here before us. Nor do we see the attitude that was reflected in 
committee. It is absent from the bill.
<P>
	Under these circumstances, people will therefore understand that 
the Bloc Quebec would be in favour of an ocean management 
strategy if it were efficient, supported by everyone, and reflecting 
the views of everyone. Everyone would recognize their rights, and 
more important, their obligations, as things are not as clear as they 
seem. This is why the Bloc feels obliged to oppose the bill for the 
moment. I will therefore have an amendment to propose at the end 
of my speech, when you indicate to me the point at which I will be 
able to table this amendment.
<P>
	As my colleague across the way has just pointed out, Bill C-26, 
the Oceans Act, contained three parts.
<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
	Part I recognizes Canada's jurisdiction over its ocean areas. The 
content seems to be similar to that of the convention on the law of 
the sea as drafted by the United Nations and, so far, we have no 
problem. However, I do not see the need for Parliament to pass a 
specific piece of legislation since we are only dealing with adapting 
the vocabulary.
<P>
	Part II-I will go back over each part later in my 
speech-mentions a legislative framework to develop a national 
ocean management strategy, and that is the rub. This is where the 
Bloc Quebecois is telling the government side that there is a major 
flaw, something is very wrong, because the foundation, namely the 
relationship between partners, is not defined in a satisfactory way 
for the partners, I will discuss this later in greater details.
<P>
	Part III, last but not least, deals with the powers, duties and 
functions of the minister, in other words his power to set fees with 
regard to marine sciences and the coast guard. First, I will say that 
the fact that the minister intends to grab increased powers in this 
area does not augur well, it is not reassuring for the Canadian 
people since, in the absence of regulations, he has already gone 
ahead this year with making changes to the coast guard fees for 
navigational aids, against the wish of stakeholders in this area. This 
does not augur well. I will deal in greater detail with the three parts 
later on, explaining why the Bloc Quebecois cannot support this 
government bill.
<P>
	To amuse this assembly before dealing with part I, I would like 
to share with parliamentarians part of the preamble to the bill. It 
makes me smile. I smiled when I read this part. The third paragraph 
of the preamble states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Whereas Parliament wishes to affirm in Canadian domestic law Canada's 
sovereign rights, jurisdiction and responsibilities in the exclusive economic zone of 
Canada;</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5149"> 5149 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier (Gaspé):</B> I am happy to see that the Liberal 
members are quite alert on this Monday morning, but here is the 
rest of my comment. The last time I heard the former minister of 
fisheries and oceans, Brian Tobin, pronounce the word sovereignty, 
it was automatically associated with separation. Big question. Will 
I read somewhere, or expect the United Nations to declare, that 
Canada wants to separate from the rest of the world? I see the 
Liberal members are awake, and I am not sure that this is what they 
want to do.
<P>
	Let me seize this opportunity to make an instructive comment: 
beware people of Canada, sovereignty does not mean separation. 
Sovereignty means sovereignty in the text you have here; it means 
the Government of Canada is acting like someone who owns the 
place and, accordingly, it lays down the rules and takes all the 
necessary measures to reach its goals. I am happy to see the 
maturity of Canada in this aspect. When, in a near future I hope, we 
can talk to each other as mature people, we will remember the 
meaning of the word sovereignty.
<P>
	What is also amusing, even though I do not want to insist on this 
point, is that, at the end of the preamble they say:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of 
Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:</BLOCKQUOTE>
	So first they speak of sovereignty and then they refer to Her 
Majesty. Excuse me, but I see some inconsistency there. The way I 
see sovereignty, once you are sovereign, you decide by yourself 
and you do not necessarily refer to somebody else. This is all I 
wanted to say about that excerpt. I only wanted to shed some light 
on this morning's debate.
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
	Now that everyone is wide awake thanks to the quality of my 
introduction, let me go on to part I, which follows the preamble. As 
I mentioned, part I only reproduces the text of the United Nations 
convention on the law of the sea. I do not necessarily see any 
problem with this definition.
<P>
	However, despite the fact we proposed amendments to ensure 
the terminology was correct when we talk about definitions relating 
to the law of the sea, these amendments were not accepted. The 
parliamentary secretary held out his hand to us by saying the 
Canadian government had no intention of infringing upon the 
rights of the provinces and other parties to this bill.
<P>
	Since this is probably the last time I have an opportunity to talk 
about Bill C-26, I must remind the House that the amendments 
tabled by the Bloc Quebecois and, unfortunately, defeated were 
aimed at clarifying the scope of the powers and rights of the 
provinces and the federal government, to ensure everything was 
very clear in order to establish the partnership relationship right at 
the beginning.
<P>
	As these amendments were not passed at the rewriting of the bill, 
allow me to remain sceptical about what the government really 
wants. When it is said on one side that it will not hurt and we 
propose a way of doing things to ensure it will not hurt us and our 
proposals are refused, I have some difficulty following.
<P>
	As I mentioned, part II of Bill C-26 provides a legislative 
framework. This legislative framework is inappropriate since there 
are still many grey areas in federal responsibilities concerning 
ocean management. I repeat, the amendments we had tabled were 
aimed at clarifying the powers and rights of the provinces and the 
federal government.
<P>
	To this day, we have received no guarantee there would be no 
federal intrusion in the powers of the provinces. There are issues 
where, even before the inttroduction of Bill C-26, there were grey 
areas. The environment, for instance.
<P>
	Since environmental law is a relatively new concept, it has some 
flaws. I understand how important it is to discuss this concept in 
developing a management strategy. Since this is recognized as a 
relatively new area of law, now is the time to look at potential 
impacts and reassure the partners we will have to deal with. I can 
see no reference to this in the bill.
<P>
	Odder yet, and more embarrassing I might add, is the fact that, 
regarding all the dealings the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans is 
required to have with his colleagues from the various departments 
in matters relating to the environment, because this must all be 
done in conjunction with other federal ministers, the respective 
powers of the fisheries minister and the environment minister have 
not been delineated.
<P>
	It is somewhat amusing, in developing an oceans management 
strategy, not to clearly define what the relationship should be 
between two brothers from the same party, the government party. It 
takes some gall, on the government side, to tell us how to run the 
strategy when they have not even established what relationship 
should exist between themselves to begin with.
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
	As I said earlier and contrary to what some of the Liberal 
members who got up this morning may think, the Bloc Quebecois 
is not against what is right. I repeat again, we are always prepared 
to discuss a management strategy, but it must be a consistent 
strategy that will provide for the provinces' active participation. I 
emphasize again the fact that the success of this strategy rests on 
partnership because, if the hon. members opposite tell us that this, 
that and the other needs to be done in terms of oceans management, 
not having defined  from the start their own roles and responsibili-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5150"> 5150 </A></B>
<P>
ties, it will be difficult, first, to establish this policy and, second, to 
implement it.
<P>
	I also mentioned earlier that the amendments put forward by the 
Bloc Quebecois were only designed to specify and delimit the 
scope and legal significance of the federal government's authority 
in relation to possible encroachments. We just had a referendum 
campaign, during which promises were made for a renewed 
Canada, new things and a new attitude. I was expecting greater 
attention would be paid to sparing feelings. Unfortunately, I can see 
none of that.
<P>
	Regarding the management strategy and the whole legislative 
framework around it, two things have happened since report stage, 
last June. Things have happened regarding the partnership I insist 
is required, the significance of which is still unknown.
<P>
	I must first congratulate B.C. members for their premier's 
initiative in walking out of last June's first ministers' conference 
because he did not feel he was being listened to. He went on to 
say-as I understood from the interpretation into French-that he 
felt he was wasting his time. Imagine, wasting his time at a first 
ministers' conference. That is saying something.
<P>
	So you can understand how an opposition backbencher like 
myself who is trying to talk some sense into other members of this 
House who, in my opinion, are full of common sense, at least on 
this side, can be very sceptical.
<P>
	What I want to bring to other members' attention is that the 
federal government, the minister of fisheries himself stepped in, 
probably at the urging of the Prime Minister of Canada, who told 
him: ``There is an urgent need for you to go to B.C. because there is 
trouble brewing in that province. I got the door shut in my face. 
They want to talk about fisheries and I did not know what to say 
about it. Can you go and find out what it is they want?'' The 
premier of British Columbia asked that the impact of the salmon 
fishery streamlining plan on that province be reviewed because no 
one in B.C. agreed with the plan put forward by the minister of 
fisheries. Yet, the minister in Ottawa kept on saying: ``Yes, that is 
what we should do and it will be done''. So the premier had to get 
involved.
<P>
	What I want to stress is the fact that-and, if I may, Mr. Speaker, 
I would like to read from the press release: ``This agreement in 
principle is aimed at reviewing the respective roles and 
responsibilities of the federal government and the province in 
managing the Pacific salmon fishery and reviving this industry. 
The review will be conducted by DFO in co-operation with an 
interprovincial team''.
<P>
	What we must look at is mentioned at the end of the press 
release: ``The responsibility review will be completed in February 
1997''.
<P>
	We are four months away from that date. The results may be 
published a little later, but what I want to draw your attention to is 
<P>
this: the elements to be reviewed include, but are not limited to, 
resource management and conservation, licensing, fleet 
management, resource allocation, habitat rehabilitation and 
clean-up, the reduction of administrative overlap and duplication, 
and the improvement of client services.
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	This is precisely what the Bloc Quebecois sought for all the 
provinces: to be able to discuss ocean management on an equal 
footing with the federal government.
<P>
	I will not mention other related points which have to do with the 
quantities that can be fished and the available quotas, since another 
bill was introduced in the House and will be reviewed. The press 
release refers to an agreement in principle between the federal 
government and the Government of British Columbia, precisely to 
review the issues of resource conservation and habitat cleanup. 
These issues concern all the oceans and relate to Bill C-26, which is 
currently before us.
<P>
	I still believe that the rights of the provinces are not respected 
and that the obligations of the federal government toward the 
provinces are not fulfilled. This was evidenced by the fact that, 
when it came to finding out who would do what and how, a 
provincial premier had to slam the door behind him during a first 
ministers' meeting before the issue was taken seriously.
<P>
	It is very important to specify this aspect in today's bill and to 
give it this spirit. Otherwise, will other premiers have to do the 
same thing every time? Here is a trick for the other provincial 
premiers: when you see that the federal government will not budge, 
slam the door and leave. Then the federal government will propose 
to negotiate an agreement in principle, in which your rights will be 
taken into consideration.
<P>
	Come on. We, as parliamentarians, must show a little more 
maturity and realize there is a grey area that must be defined.
<P>
	This issue deserves some attention. We must review the content 
of these clauses, without obviating the need for a commonly 
developed management strategy. I want such a strategy to be 
developed. I do not want a situation where every province will have 
to bang the door. I want us to clearly define how things will be 
done.
<P>
	Another point, and I do not want to belabour it, is that the 
management strategy lists the partners. What I wanted was for the 
provinces to clearly define all this, and we would list the other 
partners that needed to be included and with whom we had to work.
<P>
	I must say at the outset that I am for the notion of a law-abiding 
society, a democracy, and that, when the democracy turns to its 
judges for a ruling, perhaps their word should be followed. I refer 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5151"> 5151 </A></B>
<P>
to the most recent  Supreme Court ruling, handed down last Friday. 
I do not yet know what the impact of this ruling will be.
<P>
	In line with the spirit of the Sparrow ruling, which has been the 
precedent for some time now, concerning fishing and subsistence 
rights for native peoples, the most recent ruling refers to the fact 
that native peoples would be entitled to fish without permits, for 
their subsistence, throughout the province of Quebec. Will this also 
apply to all other provinces in Canada? I do not know. I do not want 
to get into the merits of the ruling, but I would like to remind the 
minister immediately that the order of precedence will now have to 
be borne in mind.
<P>
	Account will have to be taken of how cohabitation will be 
managed, because it is now no longer just a question of divvying up 
fish, but also of isolating responsibilities, or at least of knowing 
what they think of it, what they can do with us. Without wishing to 
go into more detail, I think that this is something that Canada has 
been refusing to look into more deeply for too long now, and I think 
it would be a good idea, as I will mention a bit later one, to 
postpone passage of Bill C-26, precisely so that this can be 
examined more fully, I will therefore limit my remarks in this 
regard for the time being.
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
	I will now take a look at part III of Bill C-26, which sets out the 
general powers, duties and function of the minister, followed by his 
powers, duties and functions with respect to the oceans and Coast 
Guard services.
<P>
	I will begin by repeating, because I have probably already said 
this at the beginning of my speech, that it worries me to see that 
they are now increasing the regulatory powers of the minister. The 
minister did not have these powers last June. What happened?
<P>
	I will take the example of the services provided by the Coast 
Guard. When they talk about navigational aids, they are talking 
about the presence of buoys. The minister's intention was to charge 
duty every time a ship went through our Canadian waters, but look 
out, this bill, as it stands, applies only to Canadian ships. I did not 
see, in the description of the minister's functions, the possibility of 
imposing this tax on all ships.
<P>
	Lacking the regulatory power allowing him to charge for 
navigational aids, the minister has decided, at the last minute, to 
circumvent publication in the Canada Gazette because, usually an 
order such as this must appear in the Canada Gazette within 30 
days. But, instead, he took the other route, which allows him to 
appear before a Cabinet committee and get approval in one 
afternoon. One day for publication, and bingo, we have to pay.
<P>
	What you have to know is that the industry did express its 
opposition to this bill, not because it refused to pay, but because it 
wanted to know if these navigational aids are used efficiently, if the 
fees requested are right and, more importantly, what would be the 
impact on the Canadian industry in terms of shipping and, also 
what  would be the impact on the people who use shipping services.
<P>
	The minister chose to ignore all of this, to ignore the 
recommendations. He went even further stating: ``There is a second 
part coming up, but I will play fair and wait for the impact study 
before implementing it.'' Despite the lack of regulatory power to 
everything, the minister was able to find a way to go ahead, which 
is far from reassuring, because once he has full power within a 
much simpler process, he might do worse yet. Do you understand 
now why we are worried and why this piece of legislation does not 
really set our minds at ease.
<P>
	There is another small point I want to make, also about the Coast 
Guard. The Coast Guard is made up of two divisions. There are the 
people who deal with shipping, with the huge vessels, and there are 
the people who deal with smaller, recreational boats.
<P>
	When they saw that the people who deal with the larger vessels 
could get a minor regulation passed and make shipowners cough up 
$20 million, the Coast Guard people dealing with the smaller boats 
probably told themselves: ``We will try to do the same.'' They 
made some representations and held consultations last June.
<P>
	Their objective was to set some kind of registration fees for 
small boats. For a rowboat, for a pedal-boat, for any kind of craft, 
the fees would vary from $5 to $35. They decided to travel 
throughout Canada to find out what the people thought about their 
idea. That kind of behaviour is worrisome. Where was the feedback 
process in all of this? The Quebecers and Canadians who were 
consulted said: ``No way, what is wrong with you people this 
morning? You would have me pay $5 for my rowboat. Who would 
control all of that? What will it cost?''
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	So they backed off a bit. It is a good thing that the minister did 
not yet have the regulatory powers that would have made it very 
easy for him to implement such a scheme. If this bill had been in 
force in June, would the coast guard have acted so cautiously? 
Would it have not gone ahead with its plans? Its unstated objective 
was to recover $14 million by charging these fees. This bill needs 
transparency. We need a way to be sure that there will be 
co-operation.
<P>
	I just mentioned two instances where the coast guard used its 
powers to impose its will and people are not about to forget that. 
We are not off to a good start. It is not reassuring for people to work 
with the coast guard. Each time they take part in a consultation 
process, when they think their views are really being taken into 
account, they realize it was not the case at all.
<P>
	I even heard the former commissioner-it seems that he has 
gone to another part of the department-say that there could be a 
consultation process but the legislation would still be in place by a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5152"> 5152 </A></B>
<P>
certain date. That shows a flagrant lack of respect for the people 
who pay the government officials' salaries.
<P>
	People expect us, as parliamentarians, to analyze the pros and 
cons. When decisions regarding a bill are unilateral and, I would 
say, arrogant without regard to those who will suffer their 
consequences, the bill cannot be said to be created with honour and 
enthusiasm. We have re-establish the notion of relationship.
<P>
	Again with regard to part III, which deals with the minister's 
powers, I would like to mention that the government ignored 
amendments concerning an information feedback mechanism. We 
are told that the minister will consult with such persons or bodies as 
he or she considers appropriate to consult-that is how it is 
defined. What kind of transparency is the government displaying to 
Quebecers and Canadians?
<P>
	The bill also says further on that any other regulations or 
modifications do not have to be published. I do not want to start the 
debate on the amendments all over again, but I just want my fellow 
parliamentarians and the people who are watching us on television 
to realize that we are not headed in the right direction.
<P>
	We also talked about the way fees for services are set. I 
remember the amendments proposed by the Bloc and by the 
Reform Party called for more transparency in that respect. We 
asked if we could come back to this subject. A three hour debate to 
determine new Coast Guard fees is not much. I think these fees 
should not be determined in one party's back rooms. The issue 
should be discussed right here, because all Canadians will be 
affected.
<P>
	I cannot remember which of my colleagues made that request, a 
fair and reasonable request, but it too was rejected. As far as I 
know, the government party has a majority. If a request is made to 
have a bill referred back to committee, well they have a majority in 
committee too. They can place a limit on discussion, but at least we 
can discuss it and report to the House. And they have a majority 
here too.
<P>
	Once the bill is passed, we know for sure there is no way we can 
repeal it. We would like to be able to use our right as 
parliamentarians to express the views of the people on these fees. 
After hearing all points of view, the government will be able to 
make a fair and informed decision. But when certain facts are 
ignored on purpose, the decision will be lacking, in certain 
respects.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	I talked to you then about what the Coast Guard had done 
concerning navigation aids. I also talked about potential fees and 
about studies on fees that could be levied on recreational boaters. 
There is nothing very encouraging about all of that.
<P>
	That is why we, the members of the Bloc Quebecois, would like 
to move an amendment. My amendment deals with the following 
three points, if I were to sum up my  remarks. First of all, the 
concept of partnership with the provinces does not seem to be clear 
enough as it stands now. I referred to an agreement in principle, a 
report that should be made public by the end of February involving 
B.C. and the federal government.
<P>
	I think we must take into account the spirit in which Canada 
signed with British Columbia and let the bill reflect that so no other 
provincial premier is forced to slam the door in order to bring this 
to the attention of the government.
<P>
	I must say that I put this amendment forward because there are 
still grey areas in the text, which will hinder the implementation of 
the strategy. I am still talking of the provinces, of communications 
between provinces, environmental matters, which are grey areas. 
There are grey areas even in communications between the fisheries 
minister and the environment minister at the federal level. This is 
one more reason to consider the amendment which I will table.
<P>
	Finally, I put this amendment forward because part III of this bill 
increases the powers of the minister concerning the fees charged 
for services and because there is a lack of transparency and 
feedback on the efficiency of the services and the price-setting 
process.
<P>
	Most hon. members would be well advised to think twice before 
opposing this amendment, which we want to table, since, as I 
remind them, the Bloc Quebecois is for virtue, that is to say that it 
agrees with the establishment of an oceans resource management 
strategy. We believe, however, that such a strategy should be 
consistent and efficient, which it will be when the three points I just 
mentioned will be taken into account.
<P>
	Therefore, I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the motion be amended by deleting all the words after the word ``That'' and 
substituting the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``Bill C-26, An Act respecting the oceans of Canada, be not now read a third time 
but that it be read a third time this day six months hence.''</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I submit this amendment, which is seconded by my colleague for 
Chicoutimi. I hope that the hon. members who are now here will 
remember that, with this amendment, the Bloc Quebecois wants to 
further the spirit of partnership, that the Bloc Quebecois does not 
want to hinder the establishment of an oceans resource 
management strategy for partisan purposes, but wants to make sure 
that such a strategy is efficient and effective.
<P>
	I will wait to hear about the admissibility of my motion and I 
will follow gladly the debate on this bill, hoping that most of my 
colleagues will have understood that the Bloc Quebecois is 
promoting the cause and not partisan quarrels.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Cummins:</B> Mr. Speaker, as this House gives consideration 
to Bill C-26, the oceans act, I would like to make reference to the 
statement of the chair of the fisheries committee when the bill was 
initially before his committee:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Many times a piece of legislation is passed, and for the people who sit around this 
table it's clear as crystal. Then two years later, when regulators get at it and they start 
reinterpreting it, it's not in the same interpretation. It's not interpreted in the same 
way as it was meant when it was debated in the House-.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That's one of the problems when language is unclear, and that is really one of the 
reasons the legislative process-[is] so important.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The members of the fisheries committee from both sides of this 
House made improvements to the original bill and should be 
congratulated for their work. Work by my colleague, the member 
for Skeena, was most notable. He made several amendments during 
report stage which attempted to ensure consultation and strict 
adherence to the user pay, user say principle.
<P>
	He insisted that fees be implemented only after a full 
socioeconomic impact analysis had been carried out, that fees 
reflect the level and cost of a specific service and that they be 
implemented in a fully transparent manner with full ongoing 
consultation with affected resource users. The amendments he 
proposed endeavoured to accomplish these goals. Unfortunately 
our amendments were not accepted and as a result the ocean act 
remains unchanged in this regard.
<P>
	Reformers view full and ongoing consultation with resource 
users and grassroots Canadians as essential to good government. 
Implementing marine service fees without first completing a 
socioeconomic impact analysis is what this Liberal government 
stands for and what we oppose.
<P>
	I would like to address what are for me several key aspects of the 
bill. With the exception of Australia, Canada is perhaps more 
affected by oceans than any other nation. When I first looked at the 
oceans act I assumed it dealt equally with the waters on our three 
coasts. Unfortunately that is not the case. Perhaps a third of the 
waters of Canada are in the area adjacent to the Nunavut land 
claim. Nunavut waters do not come under the act in the same way 
that the waters off Nova Scotia do.
<P>
	When this bill was before the committee, the main Inuit 
organization in the Nunavut territory advised the committee that 
certain sections of the bill were ultra vires given the Nunavut land 
claims agreement.
<P>
	For instance, the Inuit organization suggested that the bill be 
amended to acknowledge that the governor in council could not 
make regulations under the act unless they were approved by the 
Nunavut land claims authority. Clearly the Nunavut interpret their 
treaty as limiting federal authority over legislation affecting Arctic 
waters within the Nunavut settlement area.
<P>
	The response of the government was to acknowledge that federal 
authority in Arctic waters is limited by the land claims agreement. I 
quote from section 2.1:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>For greater certainty, nothing in this Act shall be construed so as to abrogate or 
derogate from existing aboriginal or treaty rights of the aboriginal peoples of Canada 
under section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Section 36.1:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Governor in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Fisheries and 
Oceans, may make orders exercising any power under section 35 on an emergency 
basis where the Minister is of the opinion that a marine resource or habitat is likely to 
be at risk to the extent that such orders are not inconsistent with a land claims 
agreement that has been given effect and has been ratified or approved by an act of 
Parliament.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is to say, the government has conceded that land claims 
agreements may constrain the ability of the Government of Canada 
to protect a resource owned by all the people of Canada.
<P>
	The implications for British Columbians are significant. Land 
claims agreements when negotiated are likely to cover virtually the 
whole of the west coast. The Nisga'a land claim agreement was 
only the first. The wording of land claim agreements has 
diminished the authority of the federal government in an area 
completely under its control.
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	This bill simply acknowledges what the government and its 
officials have negotiated and continue to negotiate away. Land 
claims must never again be rushed through Parliament. They must 
receive thorough review and debate on the implications of their 
entrenchment within the Constitution.
<P>
	When land claim negotiations are complete in the Arctic and 
Pacific coasts, the applications of the Oceans Act to these waters is 
likely to be greatly diminished. A patchwork application of 
Canadian marine and environmental law to Canadian waters does 
not inspire me with confidence. While this bill would give the 
minister of fisheries and cabinet broad powers to manage and 
protect Canada's marine resources, the government has decided to 
cut the coast guard on the west coast by one-third.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5154"> 5154 </A></B>
<P>
	I want to quote from a department of fisheries document written 
in early September which details the folly of these cuts at a time 
when the government is asking for more authority to manage and 
protect the marine environment. The document was discussed 
earlier last week by my colleague from North Island-Powell 
River, therefore I will not give the whole document but I would like 
to mention some points.
<P>
	The cuts will have an impact on our ability to manage the 
resource. For example, Canada is required to collect data and 
enforce provisions of specific fisheries agreements in the Pacific 
salmon treaty. The data is critical to stock assessment biologists in 
Canada. Canada and the United States have agreed to provide 
specific levels of enforcement patrol of shellfish closed areas to 
protect consumers from contaminated and toxic shellfish. The 
United States provides the largest market for British Columbia 
commercial bivalve fisheries.
<P>
	Will this cut to inspection hurt our sales in the United States? 
What happens if an outbreak of shellfish contamination occurs? 
Surely the U.S. market will dry up overnight if it is undetected.
<P>
	The ability of vessels to remain away from home on a regular or 
sporadic basis is critical to both fisheries enforcement and 
management. Coast guard currently plans to replace vessels in 
Tofino and Bamfield with a 47-foot class lifeboat with no 
accommodation for crew or shore based fisheries officers. This 
demonstrates an expectation that there will be little opportunity to 
participate in fisheries patrols in remote areas.
<P>
	Another matter that these cuts are going to affect is this. 
Uncertainty about vessel support from multi-tasked vessels or 
insufficient vessels will result in fewer fisheries. The new 
initiatives implemented to rationalize the salmon fleet, the Mifflin 
plan, will be compromised.
<P>
	There is currently a demand for increased habitat investigation 
and monitoring of projects in remote areas as a result of the Oceans 
Act, which we are discussing today, the Canadian Environmental 
Assessment Act and agreements made with First Nations by 
Aboriginal Fishing Strategy and land claims initiatives. Yet the 
cutbacks will impact on the ability to live up to obligations.
<P>
	Fisheries notes that developing a highly motivated and effective 
marine fleet is essential for fisheries patrol. A marine enforcement 
program within the coast guard has the potential to boost 
enforcement capability in specific areas. Current tasking and 
restrictions on fleet movement will limit the overall effectiveness 
of this part of the coast guard program. It is not likely that priority 
areas for fishing enforcement will always coincide with search and 
rescue zones.
<P>
	Again, this is how these cuts will impact and this is the direction 
this government is taking. I doubt very much it will be able to live 
up to the commitments under the Oceans Act.
<P>
	There is a huge list of deficiencies and ways in which the cuts 
will impact on the ability to manage the fisheries. The one to which 
I would like to refer is the ability to act under the Oceans Act.
<P>
	What if a major emergency like the one that nearly occurred last 
August near Campbell River occurred? The issue to which I am 
referring was the near collision between a passenger ship and a 
barge loaded with propane and dynamite. Currently we lack the 
ability to respond to such a disaster, and yet the government is 
imposing even further cuts on the coast guard. It is horrifying to 
imagine the implications of these cutbacks.
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	Furthermore, international boundary enforcement patrols are of 
significant concern and the reduction in patrol capability will limit 
DFO's ability in the area. The international grey zone in the lower 
straits and in the north are of particular concern to us.
<P>
	The language of Bill C-26 gives the minister and the cabinet the 
power to legislate. They will write the oceans law and policy under 
the regulation making power in the bill.
<P>
	For many years after Confederation legislation typically defined 
not only the objectives and principles of government policy in a 
particular area, but also the precise details. This is true of the 
current Fisheries Act. For example, section 28 states that no one 
shall hunt or kill fish or marine animals of any kind by means of 
rockets or explosive materials. Section 29(1) states that no one 
shall erect, use or maintain any net, weir or other device which duly 
obstructs the passage of fish. The current act states in section 32 
that no person shall destroy fish by any means other than fishing. 
Section 33 states that no person shall purchase, sell or possess any 
fish that has been caught in contravention of this act or the 
regulations.
<P>
	It is clear. The fine tuning is in the regulations but the law is 
clear in the act. The oceans act lacks such clarity in what is 
prohibited. Everything is up to the minister, even the generality of 
oceans law and policy.
<P>
	It has been said that the present practice is for legislation to 
outline the policy to be followed in an area and to delegate the 
authority to prescribe the details of the law to the cabinet or the 
minister.
<P>
	The bill would, for example, in part II, the oceans management 
strategy, mandate the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans to develop 
and implement an oceans management strategy. The bill does not 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5155"> 5155 </A></B>
<P>
say what the oceans law is to be, it says that the minister has the 
authority to write one after he consults a long series of groups 
which may have an interest in oceans law. The writers of the bill 
obviously do not know what the law or policy ought to be, only that 
it is needed and that it ought to have the force of law once the 
minister decides what it ought to be.
<P>
	If this were a bill for the Minister of Finance it would 
undoubtedly authorize him to set tax rates after he had consulted 
various groups. If it were taxes we would instinctively know that 
the bill was ridiculous. If the Minister of Finance wants a new tax 
he must come to Parliament to obtain specific authorization.
<P>
	I would have preferred to have seen some detail in the oceans 
act. What is the oceans law and policy which the minister wants to 
implement? Under this bill Parliament effectively loses control of 
lawmaking. In effect, the government is given a free hand to do as 
it sees fit in the realm of oceans law and policy.
<P>
	Such problems are not new. A very distinguished former 
member of the House, Stanley Knowles, gave a caution that is even 
more valid today in regard to the oceans act than it was when 
initially spoken in the House. He stated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It is our experience in Parliament time and time again to think we know what we 
passed when we gave final approval to a piece of legislation, only to find months 
later that things were being done or restrictions being imposed of a kind we did not 
believe appeared in the bill at all. We try to find out what happened, and we discover 
that we had given authority to the Governor in Council to make regulations for the 
carrying out of the purposes of the act and that under this authority restrictive 
regulations were passed, or restrictive definitions introduced of such a nature as to 
produce quite a different result from the result we thought had been intended.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1325 )</B>
<P>
	The aboriginal fishing strategy is clearly an unexpected and 
unintended policy created by regulation under the Fisheries Act. 
Even though the Fisheries Act is, for the most part, very traditional 
legislation with a fair amount of detail, the government has been 
able to twist the meaning of the act to create a native only 
commercial fisheries law as regulations under the act.
<P>
	The native only commercial law stands against 150 years of 
Canadian history and law. The Supreme Court this year in the Nikal 
decision held the policy of the crown, both before and after 
Confederation ``was to treat Indians in the same manner as 
non-Indians with respect to the allocation of fishing grounds for 
commercial use''. The native only commercial fishery law has 
wrecked havoc on the west salmon fishery.
<P>
	If the courts ever get the opportunity to consider the native only 
commercial fisheries regulations I believe they are likely to strike 
them down as being incompatible with the intentions of Parliament 
when it wrote the act.
<P>
	If the government can get away with native only commercial 
fishery for fours years, we can only guess what will happen with a 
very open-ended act like the oceans act. Virtually anything could 
be done.
<P>
	Some legislation in only a shell that enables the cabinet to write 
its own laws. In the past bills were substantive and the regulations 
involved only technical standards, such as the size of a net or the 
variety of fish. Sadly we often find that it is the regulations where 
substantive law is found.
<P>
	In 1993 in the last Parliament a subcommittee of finance, the 
then subcommittee on regulations, spoke with clarity about the 
problem that occurs when parliamentarians demand too little and 
give too much in legislation they approve. I commend the members 
of this House who in the last Parliament wrote this report.
<P>
	The subcommittee noted the ``tendency, beginning with energy 
legislation in the early 1980s to enact framework legislation, 
leaving substantive provisions to be set out by regulations. The new 
regulations often affect the rights, duties and obligations of 
citizens. This contrasts with the more traditional approach under 
which only technical standards and details tended to be left to 
regulations''.
<P>
	In the first chapter entitled ``Inadequate Legislative Overview'' 
the report reminds us that ``under our system of government, 
Parliament is supreme, subject to limits imposed by the 
Constitution. In concrete terms this implies that the cabinet cannot 
raise taxes that Parliament has not sanctioned, or spend money that 
Parliament has not approved''.
<P>
	It goes on to warn ``that regulations promulgated by government 
departments- have the force of law just as primary legislation 
does. They can be promulgated lawfully only if appropriate 
authority has been delegated under a statute that Parliament has 
passed. However, when the delegated authority is broad and use of 
that authority is not adequately supervised by Parliament, the 
implied parliamentary control is absent and the supremacy of 
Parliament is undermined-The cabinet's formal accountability to 
Parliament for regulation making amounts in practice to a dead 
letter''.
<P>
	The oceans act is a shell. It authorizes the minister and the 
cabinet to write their own law after they have decided what it is 
they want. It would be better parliamentary practice, I submit, if 
after the government decides what it wants for an oceans law and 
policy for it to come back to Parliament and submit a bill to 
Parliament.
<P>
	I am anxious to get good environmental legislation on the books. 
But is this good environmental and oceans law or is it just another 
Canadian Environmental Protection Act? What ought to have been 
our basic environmental law has left the development of the law to 
the government to be done through regulation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5156"> 5156 </A></B>
<P>
	Let me tell members from firsthand experience in Delta why I 
have some doubt about this approach. The Tsawassen Indian Band 
in my riding has developed a condominium project in an 
environmentally sensitive area. As of late it has also built a sewage 
plant on an intertidal marsh, class 1 habitat.
<P>
	When the sewage project was under consideration, I hoped that 
our basic environmental law would require that an environmental 
assessment be done. Lots of games were played but no real 
environmental assessment was done. We were told that since no 
government money was directly involved, none had to be done. 
Perhaps no government money in the bricks and mortar of the 
condo project, but lots of offshore money. So much for what 
environmentalists and others had called our foremost piece of 
environmental legislation.
<P>
<B>(1330)</B>
<P>
	With regard to the sewage project, the Minister of the 
Environment in a letter to me dated July 17, 1996 acknowledges 
the weakness of the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act. He 
said: ``My department has no decision making responsibilities that 
would require it to initiate an assessment in accordance with the 
act''.
<P>
	In the same letter the Minister of the Environment admitted the 
involvement of his officials was through the Fisheries Act, not the 
Environmental Assessment Act. He stated: ``Given the shared 
responsibilities between environment and fisheries with respect to 
the Fisheries Act, officials from my department are working with 
the Department of Fisheries and Oceans on this review''.
<P>
	Let me read from fisheries documents that I received under the 
Access to Information Act: ``We are concerned there will be a 
sewage discharge into what is a very ecologically important 
habitat. This project has the potential to adversely affect an 
internationally important area for migratory birds, particularly 
migrating and over wintering waterfowl and shore birds. Intertidal 
habitats can be extremely sensitive. There is insufficient 
information provided to demonstrate that fish protection 
requirements will be met''.
<P>
	There was a hole in the law, a loophole so big that the law, we 
were told, did not apply on Indian reserves. Why? Because the 
regulation affecting reserves had not been written yet. Now who 
would have thought that the law did not apply to all of us equally 
and that the minister could write a separate law for natives? How 
did this happen? Because the legislation was deliberately vague. It 
did not say what was prohibited. It left it to the discretion of 
cabinet. It encouraged behind the scenes influence peddling.
<P>
	When the band went about bulldozing an environmentally 
sensitive area to make room for the sewage plant for the condo 
project, I did not spend much time on the Environmental 
Assessment Act. I went to the  Fisheries Act. I went to the kind of 
environmental legislation that works, that has teeth. When we read 
it, we knew where we stood. We did not have to check to see if the 
minister has made a policy statement or what the regulations say as 
there is nothing much in the act.
<P>
	I complained to the fisheries department that someone was quite 
possibly breaching the act by destroying environmentally sensitive 
fish habitat. The department did its job, though not before some 
environmental destruction had occurred.
<P>
	I am concerned that the same hole exists in the oceans act with 
regard to environmental issues, especially if natives are involved. 
Let me show one reason why the Fisheries Act worked and why the 
oceans act will not and why the Environmental Assessment Act 
does not.
<P>
	Section 35 of the Fisheries Act does not say that the minister 
may make regulations or make a policy after consulting everything 
that moves. Instead it says: ``No person shall carry on any work or 
undertaking that results in the harmful alteration, disruption or 
destruction of fish habitat''. How is that for clarity? No 
mumbo-jumbo, no weasel words. Destroy fish habitat and the act 
kicks in. No special exemptions for environmental destruction by a 
province or native bands. The act leaves an out. The minister can 
authorize the destruction of habitat. If not, the law has been broken.
<P>
	As an aside, some would trash the Fisheries Act and the fisheries 
department and turn the job of fish habitat protection over to the 
environment department or the province. I am not one of them. The 
Fisheries Act and the fisheries department can, when push comes to 
shove, do what needs to be done. I would say to those in Victoria 
and Ottawa who would trash the fisheries department authority to 
protect fish habitat: You are no friend of fish. If it works do not 
trash it.

<P>
	We as parliamentarians can do better. We must demand more. 
We receive poorly written shells masquerading as potential 
legislation because we have demanded too little and the 
government has been allowed to safely ask for too much authority.
<P>
	<B>Mr. George S. Baker (Gander-Grand Falls, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, listening to the members from the Reform Party and the 
Bloc, one would think that this was a terrible piece of legislation 
we have before us. One would wonder why the Government of 
Canada would introduce such a terrible piece of legislation 
according to the official opposition.
<P>
	The fact is that the bill before the House today is the first of its 
kind. It is a historic event in the House of Commons because 
Canada for the first time in its history will actually pass a law, if the 
majority of the people in the Chamber vote for it, to put into law 
that Canada has an exclusive economic zone.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5157"> 5157 </A></B>
<P>
	It took the present Liberal administration under our Prime 
Minister to bring in this act. The act was brought in by the minister, 
the MP for Bonavista-Trinity-Conception in Newfoundland, a 
rear admiral, a man who knows more about the ocean than perhaps 
any other member of Parliament knows. The Minister of Fisheries 
and Oceans represents a riding that perhaps has more fishermen 
than any other riding in Canada has.
<P>
	As well, the parliamentary secretary is a learned and extremely 
well educated colleague. I do not know of anybody ever in the 
Chamber who has received the education that the Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans has. He has a 
masters in law. He is on the judicial committee at the Hague. He 
knows international law inside out and upside down.
<P>
	The Minister of Fisheries and Oceans is bringing in this bill, 
which the opposition does not want to praise him on because there 
is too much in the bill that is good politics, good for Canada and 
good for our fishermen. Where else would we find such terms as 
contiguous zone, Canadian waters, continental shelf, exclusive 
economic zone, territorial sea?
<P>
	Never before have we ever seen that in legislation before this 
Chamber. Why is that? The reason is quite simple. Never before 
have we had a government that has brought in a piece of legislation 
that outlines two things, one of which is conservation and the other 
of which is proper management.
<P>
	The Bloc stood in the Chamber today and put on the record how 
bad the management of DFO has been over the years and how 
terrible it is that it has not been able to manage the resource 
properly. I suppose one could agree with that statement if one 
looked at what happened under the previous Tory government.
<P>
	There was no logic behind the management decisions made by 
that government. It led to the destruction of the northern cod stock 
off the east coast of Canada. It led to the destruction of the fish 
stocks that the northern cod stock fed on. It led to the destruction of 
the pelagic resources of our oceans. It led to the destruction of 
some of the greatest spawning grounds for fish in the entire world.
<P>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
	I remind the hon. member who spoke for the Bloc to look at the 
great spawning area for mackerel off Quebec's coast, the greatest 
spawning area perhaps in the world. For year after year after year 
when those mackerel at the end of May were trying to get in from 
the ocean to the Gulf of St. Lawrence to go to those great spawning 
areas, the Government of Canada, then led by the Tories of course, 
assigned foreign quotas to block the migration of those mackerel 
into their spawning grounds off the coast of Quebec. That was done 
simply because of  poor management decisions by the Government 
of Canada.
<P>
	However, under this legislation and under the actions of this 
government, the minister and the parliamentary secretary in 
bringing this legislation forward, that will no longer be possible to 
do. In other words, for the great resources of the fishery off the 
coast of Quebec, especially along the north shore of Quebec where 
the great spawning areas are for those fish that were blocked from 
their migration pattern on to those spawning grounds, never again 
will there be quotas assigned. Quotas were assigned under the 
previous Tory administration to Norway, to Sweden, to Denmark, 
to Cuba, to Japan, to the Russian states, in order to block that 
migration on to the coast of Quebec.
<P>
	It is a two-way street, is it not? Not only did the mackerel 
disappear from the coast of Quebec where they spawn, but they 
disappeared as well off the coast of Nova Scotia where they were 
on their way into the spawning ground. They disappeared along the 
coast of Newfoundland and Labrador because that is where the 
mackerel go after they spawn at the end of May. It takes them until 
about September to become eight or nine inches long as they travel 
up around the coast of Newfoundland and Labrador and go out into 
the ocean again.
<P>
	That migration was prevented. It was stalled. It was stopped by 
those quotas to foreign nations in Canadian waters, assigned by the 
Tory government. That is perhaps the blackest mark we have on our 
fishery. It was poor management.
<P>
	Under this legislation the minister and the parliamentary 
secretary are bringing forward today, fisheries management takes 
top priority. Conservation becomes the most important thing in the 
decision of quotas and the assigning of them.
<P>
	As well, it operates both ways for the fishermen of Quebec. The 
hon. member representing the Bloc should remember that the squid 
disappeared in the early eighties off the Quebec north shore. The 
reason they disappeared was that the squid which are prevalent on 
Canada's east coast are not born like the mackerel are along the 
coast of Quebec. They are born way down in Florida. Their 
migration path is almost like the Trans-Canada Highway of the 
squid. They go up past the east coast of Nova Scotia.
<P>
<B>(1345 )</B>
<P>
	What was happening there under the poor management of the 
previous administration, the Tory governments of this country? We 
had vessels from Cuba, Japan, the Soviet Union and from other 
nations with licences from the federal government to block that 
annual migration of squid in the month of July.
<P>
	All of a sudden the squid did not show up on the coast of Quebec 
or on the coast of Newfoundland or on the  coast of New Brunswick 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5158"> 5158 </A></B>
<P>
or Prince Edward Island. Why? It was poor management, poor 
decision making. That would not be possible under the legislation 
passing this Chamber today. Why? The Minister of Fisheries and 
Oceans is bound to consult and not only consult, but the fishermen 
themselves and the industry itself will have to have an input.
<P>
	On the same argument, as far as the Quebec coast is concerned, 
at the same time in the early eighties there was the tragic 
disappearance of the capelin, a very tiny fish that does not spawn as 
the mackerel does on the coast of Quebec, as the squid does down 
in Florida; it spawns off the coasts of Nova Scotia and 
Newfoundland and off the south coast of Labrador.
<P>
	Due to poor management, because it did not have an act of 
Parliament like this at the time, what did the previous Tory 
administration do? In 1980 the Tory government gave a quota to 
the Soviet Union for over 100,000 tonnes of capelin. That is more 
than has ever been caught in any one year in Canadian history by all 
Canadian fishermen put together. Why? The Government of 
Canada was not bound by an act like this. The Government of 
Canada was not bound by these regulations.
<P>
	I point out to the member from the Bloc what has happened in 
the past under previous administrations because they did not have 
this bill. They did not have the Liberal government we have today. 
They did not have that before, and what happened to his shore, his 
coastline, was that yes, the mackerel were prevented from going to 
their spawning ground at the end of May; yes, the squid 
disappeared at the end of July and were not seen anymore after 
1980 because of the decisions of the federal Tory government at 
that time; yes, the capelin that spawn off Newfoundland and 
southern Labrador and Nova Scotia were never seen again because 
all of their biomasses were practically eliminated by overfishing 
licences given by the federal government.
<P>
	There is a reason I mentioned those three species of fish for the 
benefit of the hon. fisheries critic for the Bloc. Those are the three 
fish that form the main food supply of what the hon. member has 
been so concerned about, codfish. They are the main food supply of 
the cod.
<P>
	One would think that if we catch the food of the cod we would 
actually affect the codfish. According to the scientific evidence that 
was available at the time the Tories were in office, that conclusion 
could not be drawn. This was the reason they claimed it could not 
be drawn. They said we would have to have fishing of this food for 
about a year and then non-fishing, fishing of that food stock and 
then non-fishing, to be able to compare it year after year. A 
common sense thing like that. That is why this bill allows the 
minister to take certain measures in consultation with the 
fishermen and the industry to ensure this does not happen.
<P>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
	The main food supply of the cod was destroyed through 
mismanagement under the previous Tory administration. With this 
bill we 
<P>
will have brought in a measure by which the Minister of Fisheries 
and Oceans will be able to step in to prevent that from happening in 
the future.
<P>
	The other point which the hon. member from the Bloc did not 
consider was that the bill will also allow the minister, more than 
ever before, to step in as far as types of fishing gear are concerned.
<P>
	We could imagine the effect of factory freezer trawler dragging 
the bottom of the ocean, ripping through a spawning area where 
fish accumulate at a certain time of year to reproduce. Imagine the 
effect that would have on the fishery. Imagine the common sense 
which went into the decision which said ``yes, you can use that type 
of equipment''. Where was the common sense? It just was not 
there.
<P>
	This bill will enable the minister to make decisions based on 
consultation with fishermen. They would never allow that to 
happen. It amazes why this problem was created in the first place. 
When we look at all the scientific evidence which is available on 
how codfish and groundfish spawn it is amazing that the Tory 
government would ever have allowed those types of licences to be 
issued.
<P>
	The scientific studies all point to the same thing. They say that 
during that four week period when fish are in the process of and 
preparing for their spawning season that even a little food cannot 
be dropped among them because they will disperse. There were 
studies done which used gigantic fish tanks to examine the 
spawning habits of various types of groundfish. When the studies 
reached that four week period the fish could not be fed. No food 
could be dropped into the tanks during the four week spawning 
season. Why was that? The fish would then swim at such a speed 
they would collide with the sides of the tank. If we disturb a 
groundfish in the process of spawning it will not spawn.
<P>
	This bill will enable the minister and any future minister of any 
future federal government in Canada to look first and foremost to 
conservation and then to management. There must be management 
committees. They must consult with the fishers, as it is stated in the 
bill and as my learned, educated and civilized friend, the 
parliamentary secretary, pointed out a few moments ago.
<P>
<B>(1355)</B>
<P>
	The hon. member for Vancouver Quadra has written 23 books 
and co-authored another couple of dozen, all concerning an aspect 
of this bill, international law, the law of the sea.
<P>
	The Speaker is telling me I am out of time.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Actually, my colleague, you had about 15 seconds 
left. I was worried you were going to start using that act as a prop of 
some kind. I have never known you to use props in this House

brief question before we go to Statements by Members.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I note that the 
hon. member for Gander-Grand Falls is in his usual fine form this 
morning.
<P>
	He has given us a brilliant lecture on the food chain. I would 
even add, although I have said I was going to attempt to be 
non-partisan, that-and I shall offer him a pun in his own 
language-to listen to him, one would believe that the mother of 
the cod is a Grit.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Ah, ah.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier (Gaspé):</B> What I wish to emphasize here, and what 
I have already stated this morning, is that, with respect to part II of 
this bill, I am in agreement with the creation of an ocean 
management strategy. But-and I shall be as brief as possible here, 
returning after the question period-in order to protect against the 
return of the Conservative party, may I just ask the hon. member 
for Gander-Grand Falls whether he remembers how the Liberal 
premier of Newfoundland and the Conservative Prime Minister in 
Ottawa used to be at each other's throats?
<P>
	When Brian Peckford made his pilgrimage to Ottawa, no one 
would listen to him. How will things be any better for his 
successor, if the powers of the provinces are not protected in this 
bill? That is the question.
<P>
	We are very much aware of the situation with the capelin, and the 
mackerel, that the cod are after them, but what are you after?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleague, I know if I could ask for a yes or a 
no answer, I would be all right. However, I want to give you every 
opportunity to answer this member. We will now go to statements, 
but if you will only come back after question period, I will stay 
here to see what you have to say.

annual conference of the Transportation Association of Canada is 
to be held in my riding.
<P>
	Delegates arrived in Charlottetown yesterday for the conference, 
which continues until Wednesday. This year's theme is cost 
effectiveness through innovation. I find it very fitting that this 
conference is taking place on the island.
<P>
	As many already know, the fixed link, which has recently been 
named Confederation Bridge by the hon. minister, will 
significantly alter the transportation industry of Prince Edward 
Island.
<P>
	As an island, P.E.I. is greatly affected by any small change in 
that industry. Further to next year's opening of the bridge, islanders 
are analysing the situation surrounding our four major seaports in 
light of legislation before this House.

	<B>Mr. Gérard Asselin (Charlevoix, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, this past 
July, several areas of Quebec, including the Charlevoix region, 
were struck by torrential rains and unprecedented flooding.
<P>
	Thousands of people had to be evacuated, some as a preventive 
measure, and others because their lives were really in danger. A 
number of lives were lost in this tragedy, and many saw what they 
had worked for all their lives carried away by the wild flood waters.
<P>
	There has, however, been other devastation as well. A number of 
seasonal workers face significant reduction in their chances of 
drawing employment insurance, in some cases, their chances are 
nil.
<P>
	I am requesting, personally and on behalf of the Bloc Quebecois, 
that the new Minister of Human Resources Development proceed 
as quickly as possible with measures to make employment 
insurance more flexible for workers in the regions affected by the 
disaster of this past July 19 and 20.

	The justices ruled that the right to sell fish can only be extended

	The new act allows the minister to defy the Supreme Court of

<P>
	The new act allows the minister to continue racially divisive 
native only commercial fisheries in defiance of the Supreme Court 
of Canada.
<P>
	The new act allows the minister to keep his pork barrel activities 
to himself, as he is not required to publish details of the 
agreements.
<P>
	The new act removes the public right to fish, a right guaranteed 
in law since the signing of the Magna Carta. The public loses its 
right of access to fish. The minister gets the right to give fish to his 
Liberal friends and do it in secret.

with me today hundreds of letters which supplement the many 
phone calls I have received from Yukoners with regard to the cuts 
to CBC.
<P>
	As we know, in the north in particular the CBC provides a 
national, international and local window for northerners on events 
as they occur. It also provides a voice for northerners that is 
obviously seen to be very much threatened.
<P>
	Probably in my 10 years as a member of Parliament I have not 
received as many letters and as many phone calls as I have about 
the proposed cuts to CBC in the north.
<P>
	The Liberal government in its red book stated clearly that it 
would provide stable multi-year funding for the CBC. It is a 
promise it must keep. The cuts to CBC north are particularly 
severe. We have already dealt with a $1.9 million funding cut by 
this government. CBC north is essential to the unity of this country 
and to the options for voices for northerners and for the information 
to be clearly seen from coast to coast.

the theme this year is rediscovering family strengths.
<P>
	Building on the 1995 theme, families are forever, this year's 
National Family Week theme urges Canadians to celebrate the 
strengths and capacities of our families.
<P>
	Where would we be without our families? For many Canadians 
there is no simpler or more fundamental  question to answer. The 
guidance and the love that our families give us are essential to 
finding our own path to the future.
<P>
	Rediscovering the many ways in which families support and help 
their members through life's changing circumstances, life's joys 
and sorrows brings us all back to the basics of what families are all 
about: caring, nurturing, supporting and developing the potentials 
of all their members.

we all know that the Liberals have no respect for the personal rights

<P>
	But thank goodness there is hope on the horizon. The Alberta, 
Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario and Yukon governments will 
challenge the constitutionality of the federal government's 
universal gun registry.
<P>
	These five governments will ask the courts whether the registry 
violates the civil and property rights of Canadians. They will also 
argue that the registry will be an ineffective means of reducing 
crime, an inappropriate use of scarce tax dollars and will unfairly 
penalize lawful gun owners and users.
<P>
	If it is clear to five different governments and if it is clear to 
most every Canadian that a universal gun registry will not reduce 
crime and will waste millions of dollars, it should be clear to the 
Liberal government. But it does not seem to care.
<P>
	I challenge the Liberal government today to repeal its plan for 
universal gun registration. I challenge the British Columbia 
government to join with other provincial governments to help 
protect the personal rights and freedoms of Canadians.

in a country of two million people, 85 per cent unemployment and 
entire communities of destroyed homes and buildings. The lack of 
clean water, medical and dental care, electricity and basic 
sanitation is dehumanizing. I particularly mourn the young people 
who will never have the opportunity to finish school and hold a job, 
an entire lost generation.
<P>
	I encourage this government to maintain our peacekeeping 
commitment. I also encourage more organizations such as Doctors 
Without Borders and most especially dental practitioners to 
continue their generous work over there. When the fighting stops 
the real human needs begin.

	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, October 
is breast cancer awareness month. In Canada, over 17,000 women 
are diagnosed with breast cancer every year. On average, every day 
49 Quebec and Canadian women must face this shocking piece of 
news. Breast cancer kills over 5,400 women every year. Today, 
October 7, 15 women will succumb to it.
<P>
	Groups such as the breast cancer society are working hard to find 
a cure to this disease. The causes of it are not well known, the 
treatment of it is all too often ineffective and hopes of surviving it 
come at the cost of severe mutilation, for some women.
<P>
	Basic research in this area must go on. Treatment effectiveness 
must keep on improving to give hope and courage to the thousands 
of women faced with this terrible disease.

	<B>Mrs. Sharon Hayes (Port Moody-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, today marks the beginning of National Family Week and, 
on behalf of the Reform Party, I want to commend all Canadian 
families for the vital role they play in the stability and survival of 
Canadian society.
<P>
	Without question, the family is our most valuable institution and 
the heart of our social order. It is the place where children are 
brought into the world and cared for. It is where they learn, or ought 
to learn, trust, love and security as well as the values and behaviour 
that will make them good citizens and in turn good parents 
themselves.
<P>
	The family is where our most deeply held beliefs are passed on 
to future generations. It is where social stability and prosperity 
begin.
<P>
	That is why since its inception the Reform Party of Canada has 
recognized the importance of strong family units in building a 
successful society. The party's constitution states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We affirm the value and dignity of the individual person and the importance of 
strengthening and protecting the family unit as essential to the well-being of 
individuals and society.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Put simply, families represent the future of Canada. It is in the 
best interest of us all to make sure they are healthy and thriving.

	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the new Minister of National Defence said, when he was 
appointed, that it was important to send a clear message to 
members of the armed forces in order to ease the distress in the 
ranks.
<P>
	Will the Minister of National Defence not admit that the 
situation within the armed forces cannot be changed as long as 
General Boyle is chief of defence staff?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, in the last few 
days the Department of National Defence has undergone 
considerable changes. I had an opportunity this morning to meet 
with General Boyle and the deputy minister of the department.
<P>
	I can well understand the hon. member's remarks regarding the 
distress that exists within the armed forces. We will do everything 
possible to make adjustments within the existing system in order to 
restore the confidence of the men and women working in the armed 
forces.
<P>
	That may take a while. Furthermore, it is my view that my 
predecessor did a remarkable job. I am very sorry to see him go. 
We will proceed in a reasonable and responsible manner.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Yes, Mr. 
Speaker, let us talk about responsibility. Members will recall that 
the former defence minister resigned because he had signed a 
compromising letter, even though he could not recall doing so. He 
took full responsibility. He refused to blame his staff.
<P>
	General Boyle did the exact opposite. Having himself given the 
order to release falsified documents, he blamed his staff, whom he 
said did not inform him of the ramifications of this action. He 
concluded that he could not be held responsible.
<P>
	I ask the minister why the rules of accountability applied to the 
former defence minister are not applied to General Boyle?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, there is no 
doubt that the member has described a situation that was very 
difficult for my predecessor, the former defence minister. He was, 
however, in a situation where he was advised that the rules were 
clear and that what he had done was not consistent with the existing 
rules. He decided to hand in his resignation, and I am sorry to see 
him go.
<P>
	As for the situations being looked at in the Somalia inquiry and 
the allegations that have been made, the commission is still hearing 
testimony, and we will respect the conclusions of this inquiry.
<P>
	General Boyle, however, was in a situation that was rather 
different from that facing my predecessor.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have trouble seeing how the rules can be clear for a 
minister, but not for General Boyle. These are not allegations. The 
general has admitted this himself in his testimony. We do not have 
to ask the judge whether or not he believes General Boyle's 
testimony. The general has admitted it himself.
<P>
	Does the minister realize that the morale of the troops will 
remain low as long as General Boyle continues to hold his position, 
for he no longer has the confidence of his troops, or of Canadians? 
He only has the confidence of a government that continues to 
protect him in the face of all logic.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, we intend to do 
everything necessary in order to restore the confidence of the 
armed forces. I am not as certain as the hon. member that the men 
and women in the armed forces are all in disarray.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	We admit that we have major problems, but this extends well 
beyond the scope of the Somalia inquiry. This is necessary, and my 
predecessor was in the process of taking decisions that might 
improve the situation of the armed forces, for example with respect 
to the purchase of new equipment and all sorts of other measures to 
be implemented in the coming weeks.
<P>
	We will do everything necessary to restore to the Canadian 
Armed Forces the reputation they have earned over the years. It 
will not be an easy task, but we will give it our all.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of National Defence.
<P>
	The new Minister of National Defence also stated that the 
problem would not be solved by assigning responsibility to a single 
individual but by tackling the whole system.
<P>
	Can the minister, who wants to take all necessary measures, 
make a commitment to ask the Somalia inquiry to submit an 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5164"> 5164 </A></B>
<P>
interim report as soon as possible so that light can be shed on the 
cover-up operations within the Canadian armed forces following 
the Somalia incidents?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I think one must 
be very careful in trying to tell the Somalia inquiry how it should 
run its business.
<P>
	I take good note of the hon. member's suggestion, which was 
also raised by other members in this House, that there should 
perhaps be an interim report on certain issues that have already 
been looked at by the inquiry.
<P>
	I am sure the hon. member will agree with me that we should 
avoid doing anything that would bring into question the Somalia 
inquiry's integrity and impartiality.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, could 
the minister's refusal be due to his fear that a specific, early interim 
report might reveal the role and responsibilities that should be 
assumed not only by General Boyle but also by the former Minister 
of National Defence?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.): </B>No, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to congratulate the new defence minister 
in his new position. He has been the prime minister's firefighter 
and he is going to be busier than Smokey the Bear at national 
defence.
<P>
	Reform wants to see morale restored in the Canadian Armed 
Forces. On Friday the former defence minister caved in to pressure 
and threw in the towel, but he left behind his hand-picked chief of 
defence staff, General Jean Boyle. Will the new defence minister 
prove his commitment to restoring morale in the Canadian Armed 
Forces and fire General Boyle?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my predecessor 
is an honourable man and he chose a course of action which was 
made very clear when he reviewed a situation which he has 
thoroughly explained and which was covered by the rules of 
conduct for ministers of the crown.
<P>
	I want to assure my hon. friend I am convinced that many 
members of the House on all sides and from all political parties, 
have one objective in mind and that is to try to do what is right and 
what is responsible with respect to protecting the reputation of the 
Canadian Armed Forces, a reputation gained through great trials 
and tribulations over this past century.
<P>
	I intend-and I have given this undertaking-to do everything I 
can, and I hope that he will join with us, to make sure that 
everything we do is designed to try to improve the conditions of 
work for the men and women  of the Canadian Armed Forces and to 
make sure they do the job which Canadians expect of them.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I take it that was a yes.
<P>
	The minister's resignation highlights another Liberal double 
standard. The last defence minister wrote a letter to the 
Immigration and Refugee Board. He screwed up. He admitted it 
and he quit. It was the only thing he could do. General Boyle should 
not be far behind. Boyle signed a letter authorizing the release of 
altered documents. He screwed up and he admitted it.
<P>
	Will the government explain why mea culpa is okay for General 
Boyle when the defence minister lost his job over it?
<P>
<B>(1425 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, if the objective 
of the exercise in which we are involved is simply to attach blame 
to one or two individuals or to indicate that there were problems 
such as the hon. member describes, then surely the inquiry at some 
point will tell us what it thinks is the appropriate remedy.
<P>
	I want to suggest respectfully to my colleague that the armed 
forces and Canada are faced by a major crisis. One person or two 
people being involved or being singled out for special attention, 
especially when they are in positions of leadership, is 
understandable. But I believe the problems in the Canadian Armed 
Forces go far beyond just a couple of people who, for whatever 
reason, are being singled out for special attention today and have 
been for some weeks. I am not going to be drawn into that at this 
point.
<P>
	I began my work this morning by meeting with the chief of the 
defence staff and the deputy minister. What I have said to them and 
will say to my hon. friend is that what we do will have one 
objective. I hope that together we can make sure that the men and 
women of the Canadian Armed Forces work in an environment 
where they have a mandate and the people of Canada through 
Parliament give them the resources to carry out that mandate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the minister for his answers. There is a culture 
of cover-up at national defence, and the Liberals have not only 
condoned it, they have fostered it by refusing to take any action to 
remedy it.
<P>
	Documents have been shredded, the military police have been 
lied to, the public has been misled, the spirit of the Access to 
Information Act has been broken and the morale of the good people 
in our Canadian Armed Forces has been dragged through the mud.
<P>
	Yet one of the major players in this whole affair still has his job. 
Will the minister take action today and fire General Boyle?
<P>

<P>

<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, one of the 
principal reasons we have been involved during the past several 
months in the process of determining what went wrong in Somalia 
is because the government and my predecessor had the will power, 
the commitment and the courage to institute a commission of 
inquiry.
<P>
	I want to point out something to my hon. friend that I believe is 
very important to Canadians. It is not just what went on in terms of 
communicating information and indicating whether or not 
appropriate information was being made available on inquiry, as 
important as that is. What is far more important, what I believe 
after some 72 hours of having been asked to do this job, and what I 
believe my hon. friend believes as well is that Canadians find out 
what happened in Somalia. What went so wrong that Canadians 
have been shocked and disgusted by what took place in Somalia?
<P>
	We are going to find out what happened in Somalia.

	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question 
is for the Minister of Immigration or another government 
representative.
<P>
	The death last week of a woman who was trying to enter the U.S. 
revealed an illegal immigrant smuggling operation between 
Canada and the U.S. Worse, according to a U.S. border patrol 
official, this kind of activity has been on the rise since 1994. Yet the 
RCMP assures us that they have no information to this effect and 
no investigation is under way. In a word, there is no problem, 
according to the RCMP.
<P>
	Is the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration aware of this 
illegal immigrant smuggling via Akwesasne and did she ask her 
colleague, the solicitor general, to investigate, since the RCMP are 
obviously ignoring the problem?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the tragedy that occurred last week 
demonstrates there is illegal activity going on. With a border the 
length of ours with the United States it is not surprising that there is 
illegal activity.
<P>
	Over the past three years, with the investment the government 
has made in the anti-smuggling initiative, every available effort has 
been made to try to reduce the extent of illegal activity.
<P>
<B>(1430 )</B>
<P>
	I should also draw attention to the fact that the Prime Minister 
and the President of United States recently entered into an accord 
with respect to patrolling the  border pursuant to which authorities 
in both countries share information and meet regularly to develop 
co-ordinated strategies to diminish illegal activities across the 
border.
<P>
	They will never be entirely eliminated but last week's tragedy 
demonstrates the urgency of our continued effort. It is to that 
continued effort that this government is committed.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in spite of 
the efforts described by the minister, the situation is deteriorating. 
Since this illegal immigrant smuggling has been going on for years 
and the minister is still not taking her responsibilities, are we to 
understand that the federal government is not acting because the 
smuggling ring is operating on aboriginal territory?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, no, that is not so. A lot of the 
success achieved in the last year or two has resulted directly from 
the integrated efforts of the Akwesasne Mohawk police, the RCMP, 
the Sûreté du Québec, the Ontario Provincial Police and the New 
York state police. Together, those five forces have combined efforts 
to make real progress in intercepting and diminishing the extent of 
smuggling.
<P>
	The government accepts its responsibility and takes it very 
seriously. I assure the hon. member that its efforts to reduce and 
diminish the kind of illegal activity to which he has referred will 
very much continue.

too would like to congratulate the Minister of National Defence on 
his appointment and wish him well in his quest to restore the pride 
and morale in the armed forces that they deserve.
<P>
	General Boyle was appointed as chief of the defence staff in 
January 1996. That means that he has now been in the seat for 10 
months. When he was appointed, there was a question as to his 
suitability for the job because of his involvement with Somalia. 
Whether it is fair or not, there is concern about his leadership.
<P>
	Would the minister consider, because of this questionable 
leadership, asking General Boyle to stand aside until the facts are 
brought to the surface?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, first let me 
thank my hon. friend for his congratulations. I look forward to 
working with him and with other members of the the House who 
have the best interests of the Canadian Armed Forces at heart.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5166"> 5166 </A></B>
<P>
	As I go through this phase, let me suggest to him, to a lot of 
people at national defence headquarters, to a lot of people across 
the country in the forces themselves as well as to all the public 
servants, I do not expect to be able to master all of this in a very 
short period of time but I am going to work very hard at it.
<P>
	I want to assure my hon. friend that we will take into account all 
of the suggestions, all of the recommendations. I will be very 
careful in doing that. I want to make sure that I am fair and as 
equitable as possible.
<P>
	I do not have any prejudice or axe to grind in any of this. I look 
forward to working with those members of Parliament who believe, 
as I do and as I can tell my hon. friend does from his question, that 
the objective of the exercise is to make sure that the men and 
women in the Canadian Armed Forces know what is expected of 
them, that we provide them with a mandate they can understand 
and work within and that we provide them with the financial and 
human resources to carry out that mandate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the question is still one of leadership. To be fair and to see that 
justice is done to all concerned, I ask the minister that he consider 
asking the commission to provide an interim report which would 
provide him with the information regarding whether General Boyle 
is or is not fit to continue his job, and then take the appropriate 
action, whichever way it falls.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, that question 
was put to me earlier. I will address it again because it is an 
important one.
<P>
	I want to be very careful about not appearing to interfere in any 
way in the work of the commission of inquiry. We will look at 
whether there are some approaches that might be appropriate and 
considered that way by members of the commission. We will take 
into account all the suggestions that are made.
<P>
<B>(1435)</B>
<P>
	There is one thing I want to stress today. The hon. member made 
reference to the length of time the chief of the defence staff has 
been in office. I ask him to consider, and I ask Canadians generally 
to consider, whether we can envisage the commission of inquiry 
working on a very lengthy agenda into six months, a year, a year 
and a half and what impact that also might have on the morale and 
the capacity of the armed forces to function.
<P>
	There are a couple of questions that are implicit in the one the 
hon. member has just put which we will have to address. I will 
certainly take his views into account as we come to a final 
determination.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="AIRTRANSPORTATION">AIR TRANSPORTATION</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Transport.
<P>
	On July 12, the Minister of Transport wrote, in a letter 
attempting to justify the withdrawal of Air Canada's privilege to 
fly to Prague, that he was the one who decided that Canadian 
Airlines International would become Canada's carrier to the Czech 
Republic.
<P>
	On Friday, in answering a question from the Bloc on the same 
issue, the minister said in this House, and I quote: ``I made no 
decision. That is how it works. It is automatic''.
<P>
	There is a problem. The minister is contradicting himself. My 
question is very simple. Who is right: (a) the minister, in his July 
12 letter; (b) the minister in the House, on October 4; or (c) none of 
the above?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member is showing the traditional confusion of 
the Bloc with respect to government policy which has been in place 
for somewhat over a year.
<P>
	The policy is this. One or other of the major airlines is assigned 
the right to exploit a new route. If within the time given, in this case 
365 days, it fails to establish the service, the option then goes to 
another airline. In very rare cases the other airline is neither Air 
Canada nor Canadian International. Basically it is automatic, it 
goes to the other airline.
<P>
	The hon. member is simply confused in this respect. He is 
confused in thinking that the established policy of how new routes 
are divided, the so-called use it or lose it policy, requires the 
intervention of a minister in any substantial way.
<P>
	As I indicated last week, essentially it is automatic. It is a minor 
question of issuing a letter. There is a minor question of 
determining whether one of the many other smaller airlines might 
be considered, but basically it goes to either Air Canada or 
Canadian International.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, this is very 
confusing indeed. The minister just alluded to the rule of 365 days, 
or 12 months.
<P>
	He says it is for this reason that Air Canada lost the Prague route. 
If so, why did the minister give Canadian almost two years to 
choose its destinations to India, Malaysia and the Philippines? Why 
the double standard?

<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as I indicated in my response to the earlier question, this is 
a relatively new policy of the government.
<P>
	The previous policy was the so-called division of the world. If it 
is the desire of the Bloc to go back to the so-called division of the 
world, where Air Canada has no routes in Asia and where Canadian 
has its routes severely limited in Europe, that is its policy.
<P>
	I would like to know what the Bloc proposal is. We adopted a 
new policy 18 months to two years ago where we allowed 
competition on routes such as Hong Kong and the Japan route. Air 
Canada was allowed to dramatically expand its flights to Asia in 
particular and we are now in the process of waiting until the year 
1998 to see how that new policy works out before making any 
change to it.

over meaningful family policy?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the member might know that the Minister of Health is 
away on government business today.
<P>
	There is a very busy week planned. We do not accept the 
assertion in the member's question and preamble that there is a 
confusion in the policy. I would be most happy to transmit the 
member's question to the minister so that he will be able to respond 
either on the floor of the House of Commons or certainly in writing 
to the member.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sharon Hayes (Port Moody-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, speaking of the confusion, perhaps I can give an example.
<P>
	Seventy per cent of women with young children have stated they 
would stay at home to care for their own young children if they 
could afford to do so. Recently a letter from the finance minister in 
response to a question about taxation policy stated that government 
taxation policy must not work as a disincentive to a spouse  seeking 
to work, but made absolutely no mention of those who are 
desperately seeking to stay home.
<P>
	I ask the Minister of Finance: Will the Liberals show respect for 
all Canadian families and commit to a level playing field by giving 
families real choice in the provision of care for their children?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, you have got me again. I will certainly try not to make 
policy on behalf of my colleague. However, when it comes to social 
policy, I am not sure we need any lectures from the Reform Party of 
Canada.

<P>
	<B>Hon. Don Boudria (Minister of International Cooperation

first of all, the hon. member across the way ought not slap a guilty

	Second, I would remind my hon. colleague that this government,

	<B>Ms. Susan Whelan (Essex-Windsor, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Finance.
<P>
	A number of recent articles about the new seniors benefit claim 
that the new system will impose double taxation on seniors and 
discourage savings in RRSPs. Can the parliamentary secretary 
please clarify how the new seniors benefit will affect millions of 
retired Canadians?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member's question provides 
an opportunity for the government to respond to those who are fear 
mongering among seniors. This frightens seniors and I am happy to 
set the record straight.
<P>
	The new seniors benefit does not affect current seniors and most 
Canadians I hope now know that. We have protected the payments 
of every current senior. We have improved the system for those 
who will be seniors in 2001. There is no across the board 50 per 
cent tax back rate as some articles are suggesting. There is no 
disincentive to save for RRSPs. The fact is the benefit looks at the 
after tax income of seniors and it will be tax free. Seventy-five per 
cent of seniors and couples will be as well off or better off than they 
are today.
<P>
<B>(1445)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Canadian families purchase RRSPs to look after 
themselves in their retirement years. The new seniors benefit 
means that seniors will pay tax at a rate of 50 per cent beginning 
with the first dollar of income earned from other sources. This 
means that RRSP income will be taxed at 50 per cent; it means that 
CPP income will be taxed at 50 per cent.
<P>
	Will the minister tell young Canadians why they should buy 
RRSPs today when the marginal rate is 17 per cent only to pay 50 
per cent when it is taxed back when they are seniors?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I guess I get to do it again.
<P>
	For those members opposite who did not hear the earlier answer, 
I will repeat there is no across the board 50 per cent tax back rate. I 
further say on this occasion that it is interesting to hear such a 
question from the member opposite when his party proposes to 
privatize it all with no indication of what the cost would be to 
individual Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it defies reality. The government's own budget documents 
clearly state that income from other sources is  taxed back from the 
first dollar to $16,000 at 50 per cent. After $16,000 to 
approximately $24,000 it goes to zero. It makes absolutely no 
sense. This is from the government's own documents.
<P>
	The Liberal 50 per cent senior tax hurts needy seniors the most. 
Why then are Liberals deliberately discriminating against the most 
needy senior citizens?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, that is simply untrue. Seventy-five 
per cent of those Canadians who are the most needy among us will 
be better off under the new seniors benefit. That is also in the 
papers to see.

question is for the Minister of the Environment.
<P>
	On September 20, the minister told this House he would act 
quickly to ensure the site of the <I>Irving Whale</I> wreck is 
decontaminated. He said that, should sediment samples show a 
high concentration of contaminants, he would give instructions to 
clean up the area before winter comes.
<P>
	Since it has been confirmed that only 10 per cent of the 7,200 
kilograms of PCBs were recovered, could the minister bring us up 
to date on the results of the seafloor analyses?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as I mentioned to the member about 10 days ago when she 
asked a similar question, we were very concerned about the 
possible traces of PCBs that may have still been at the bottom in 
the area of the footprint of the barge.
<P>
	The member should know that some 20 per cent of the PCB 
contaminated fuel was recovered. On the way down or during its 26 
years on the bottom, it obviously may have leaked at a greater rate 
than earlier anticipated. We did get some 3,400 tonnes of oil fully 
recovered, which would have been an environmental catastrophe 
for P.E.I. as well as Îles-de-la-Madeleine.
<P>
	Boats are on the scene today. Fourteen samples were taken over 
the weekend and those will be analysed as quickly as possible to 
determine the extent and the seriousness of the results. I mentioned 
before in the House and I mention again that if the analysis 
determines that there should be further remediation, then further 
remediation it shall be.

	<B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):</B> Mr.

Northern Development.
<P>
	When the minister announced August 8 that the BHP Diamonds 
project in the Northwest Territories had received conditional 
approval, he laid down a 60-day deadline for satisfactory progress 
to be made on negotiating both an environmental agreement with 
Ottawa and impact benefits agreements with aboriginal peoples.
<P>
	Two months later that deadline is upon us. One thousand 
construction jobs are on the line and the window is quickly closing 
in which winter work can be contracted that far north. What comes 
next for Canada's first diamond mine, the BHP Diamond project?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to report to the 
House that the parties are negotiating well. I met with Mr. Kakfwi 
from the government this morning. I met with the chief on treaty 8 
last week. The Deh Cho negotiations are going on with the Dog Rib 
and the government.
<P>
	There is a sense that it can be done. People are staying in the 
north rather than going to Vancouver or coming here to negotiate. It 
has a feel of closure. There have been some complications as the 
hon. member might know. The water board adjourned its hearing of 
two months back a few weeks ago. This has complicated the 
situation but I would advise the member that it is on track. 
Everybody feels if they work together with the governments and 
the First Nations that we will have an agreement the whole country 
will be proud of.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, mining communities worldwide are watching what 
happens with this project and they will make decisions based upon 
what happens up there.
<P>
	We understand and the minister knows there is only a certain 
timeframe that work can be done in the north. What is the minister 
doing to ensure this project moves forward now?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, there is more at issue than the 
desires of BHP. The meetings with BHP have been very positive. I 
met with them last week. There are governments, First Nations and 
people living there. There are at least six major agreements which 
have to be brought together. They are coming together. I have heard 
no one say that they are leaving the table or that it is a no go. As of

result of that promise?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robert D. Nault (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of

interesting to listen to the Reform members asking questions in the 
House.
<P>
	If they read the whole red book they would know that it deals 
specifically with the collaboration of the provinces. Once we have 
an agreement with the provinces on some sort of child care 
initiative we will certainly announce it in the House. I am sure 
when we do, if we get the co-operation of the provinces, those 
members will still disagree with us on child care spaces. However, 
we will do a lot of hard work and try to get that done for them.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it becomes very obvious that the Liberals are better at 
making excuses than keeping their promises.
<P>
	This government is preventing parents from giving the best 
possible care: parental care. Why do Liberals remove real choice 
by favouring institutional day care and why do they instead give 
phoney promises? The government is not creating equal 
opportunities for all parents, including those who stay at home to 
take care of their children.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robert D. Nault (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, again I can 
only say to the member that when we announced the CHST we 
made it quite clear that there was a tremendous amount of 
flexibility within the program in the delivery of finances to the 
provinces. That flexibility does not suggest one particular child 
care initiative over another, but does give flexibility to the 
provinces to allow parents to choose the child care facilities or 
areas which they think are best suited to their location.
<P>
	I disagree with the member when he says that we are suggesting 
one over the other. In fact, we are giving the flexibility and the 
choices which parents need in this modern era.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="FIREPREVENTIONWEEK">FIRE PREVENTION WEEK</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Labour and Deputy 
Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this week Canada will be observing Fire Prevention Week. 
It is the appropriate time to heighten Canadians' awareness of the 
need to be vigilant and responsive to fire hazards, especially in the 
home and at work.
<P>
	Saturday, October 12, has been designated as Fire Service 
Recognition Day. Our full time and volunteer fire fighters often put 
their own lives in danger in order to save other lives.
<P>
	We want to use this day to express our appreciation and gratitude 
to all fire fighters across Canada.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The theme for this year's fire prevention week campaign is 
``let's hear it for fire safety: test your detectors''. As all members 
know, fires are always dramatic experiences, especially when 
human lives are involved.
<P>
	It is important for Canadians to increase their awareness of the 
danger of fire and the ways they can protect their family, property 
and themselves. Since the 1970s when smoke alarms were 
introduced in Canada statistics have shown repeatedly that these 
devices can save lives and reduce loss of property.
<P>
	However, to offer the protection for which they were designed 
smoke alarms must be fully operational. This means that they must 
be checked periodically to ensure that they are in good working 
condition, that the  batteries are not dead or have not been removed, 
and that they are located at strategic points in the home.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The costs associated with fire related injuries, death and property 
losses are high. In 1993, 417 Canadians lost their lives as a result of 
fires, 78 per cent of which occurred in the home. In fact, 26,000 of 
the 66,000 fires reported were residential fires and amounted to 
$482 million in property losses.
<P>
<B>(1505)</B>
<P>
	As for federal buildings, 48 fires were recorded in 1995-96. 
Although no death occurred, the fires accounted for eight injuries 
and $716,000 in property losses. Canadians must be reminded that 
the vast majority of fire deaths in North America occur in the 
home.
<P>
	To increase their protection, they must constantly be aware of the 
fire hazards lurking in their midst. It is always better to be safe than 
sorry. I therefore urge all Canadians to check their smoke detectors 
and participate in fire safety initiatives during this year's Fire 
Prevention Week.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak today to draw attention to fire 
prevention week, and to take advantage of this opportunity to 
encourage the public to take the time to think about fire prevention, 
both at home and at work.
<P>
	As you know, hundreds of lives are lost every year in fires of 
various types, but unfortunately most deaths by fire are related to 
fires in the home. This means that, if we are to improve this 
situation and reduce deaths by fire as much as possible, more 
emphasis than ever must be placed on prevention and on continuing 
to raise public awareness.
<P>
	The discovery of fire goes far back into the history of human 
kind. Fire is a part of our everyday lives, and will surely be around 
for a very long time to come. Although, most of the time, fire 
seems to be under control, we must be vigilant and not let down our 
guard. Incidents involving fire can happen so quickly, and their 
consequences, both material and personal, can be very serious.
<P>
	One of the best ways of saving lives if there is a fire is to install 
smoke detectors. A properly maintained smoke detector can, 
without a doubt, prevent terrible human tragedies and, moreover, 
detectors are inexpensive and easily installed.
<P>
	Whether in a house or apartment or in the work place, these 
devices are essential to our safety, and I encourage people who do 
not have smoke detectors to get them as soon as possible, and 
people who do have them to check them to ensure they are 
operating properly. During fire prevention week, whose theme this 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5172"> 5172 </A></B>
<P>
year is ``let's hear it for fire safety: test your detectors'', we all need 
to do our bit to improve our collective safety.
<P>
	This coming Saturday, October 12, has been designated as the 
day to pay tribute to fire fighters. On behalf of the public, I would 
like to thank all full time and part time fire fighters for their 
excellent work and for all of the services they render to society.
<P>
	We take their presence for granted, and all too often lose sight of 
the fact that they frequently put their lives on the line to save 
someone else. I want them to know that we are grateful and that 
they have every right to be proud of what they do. It is not always 
easy to serve the public. It demands self-discipline, determination, 
and professionalism. I encourage our fire fighters to keep up the 
good work. Our heartfelt thanks for the excellent work they do on 
our behalf.
<P>
	In closing, I would like to invite everyone to take part in the 
various activities that will be held during the week and to keep in 
mind that it is important to be prevention-conscious all year long.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on behalf of my party I would like to join my colleagues 
and add our support for fire fighters and echo their words.
<P>
	In the constituency I represent, Edmonton Southwest, fire 
fighters have been long time supporters of the burn unit at the 
University of Alberta hospital. Fire fighters are involved in the 
community far beyond their day to day jobs as firemen. Very often 
we will find that the stalwarts in communities, particularly smaller 
communities, are volunteer fire fighters, really the backbone of the 
community.
<P>
	Earlier speakers suggested that this week we are paying 
particular attention to fire and the ravages of fire to us as 
individuals. It is well now to recall once a year that each home 
should have a fire evacuation plan. Just as we have fire drills right 
in the House of Commons and in our places of business, places of 
worship and schools, every home should have a fire drill.
<P>
	We in this House have the opportunity to do something real when 
it comes to fire fighters. That is to support the motion that will be 
coming up by the member for Burnaby-Kingsway, Motion No. 
241, which is to put into Canada operation respond, a computerized 
data base of hazardous materials that would improve safety for fire 
fighters and help save lives and property.
<P>
<B>(1510)</B>
<P>
	That will be debated at 5.30 p.m. on October 10 in this House. It

introduce Bill C-334, an act to amend the Criminal Code (violent 
crimes or sexual offences).
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, this private member's bill will send this 
message to criminals: two violence or sex strikes and you are out.
<P>
	This legislation directs our courts and judges to automatically 
order a life sentence for any offender who, on two or more separate 
occasions, is convicted of a serious violent or sexual offence.
<P>
	Canadians deserve to feel that they and their families are safe in 
their homes, at work, at school, on the street and in their 
communities. In short, Canadians want a country in which we can 
look to the future instead of over our shoulders.
<P>
	Consequently this bill is urgently needed to address the 
unchecked proliferation of high risk violent criminals, pedophiles 
and sexual predators who cause great harm to our communities.

	For the last two years the banks, the so-called big six, made $5.6

requires them to open their purse to small businesses to give more

	The House resumed from October 4 consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-55, an act to amend the Criminal Code (high risk 
offenders), the Corrections and Conditional Release Act, the 
Criminal Records Act, the Prisons and Reformatories Act and the 
Department of the Solicitor General Act, be read the second time 
and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to rise and comment on Bill C-55, an act to amend the 
Criminal Code.
<P>
	Before I begin, I want to tell the House a story about what 
happened not long ago in my hometown of Williams Lake, a city of 
about 20,000 people in the central interior of British Columbia. On 
July 16, 1996 a wife and mother was innocently riding her bicycle 
in a wooded area near the city one afternoon. When she did not 
come home that night, police were called to investigate. Two days 
later they found her body. She had been sexually assaulted and 
murdered. To this day her killer has yet to be found despite the 
outrage in the community and the thousands of dollars which have 
been put aside as a reward to those who might point to the killer.
<P>
<B>(1520)</B>
<P>
	I tell this story to the House today, not to sensationalize another 
murder case, but to give an example of what people in the 
Cariboo-Chilcotin, and all Canadians I might add, live with every 
day. People do not know who or where this murderer is and they 
worry about their safety.
<P>
	How does this deep concern that Canadians have for their 
physical safety relate to Bill C-55? The bill deals with changes to 
the criminal justice system and Canadians want criminal justice 
reform. They want to be safe. They want to feel safe in their homes. 
They want to walk down their streets without fear and they want 
their neighbourhoods restored for themselves and their children to 
places of peaceful activity.
<P>
	Will this legislation restore people's basic freedoms and allow 
Canadians to experience greater freedom from fear? This is the test 
we place on the legislation as we consider it today.
<P>
	Let me briefly outline the contents of the bill. Bill C-55 consists 
of three components: first, a dangerous offender provision; second, 
a long term offender provision and, third, a judicial restraint 
provision. I want to examine each of these in turn.
<P>
	First, let us look at the dangerous offender provision. Bill C-55's 
dangerous offender provision would give the crown a window of 
six months after conviction to bring a dangerous offender 
application based on newly received information. Presently a 
dangerous offender application must be made at the trial. This new 
provision does not go far enough in protecting people from 
dangerous criminals.
<P>
	As the proposed dangerous offender provision now stands, the 
crown could find evidence to support a dangerous offender 
application after the six-month period, but the crown would be 
unable to bring an application against the criminal because the 
six-month time period had expired. Consequently, a dangerous 
offender could still be back in society too soon, still a threat, still 
causing fear and concern. This provision does not go far enough to 
protect Canadians and provide them with the safety they seek.
<P>
	Therefore, Reform proposes that Bill C-55 be amended to allow 
the crown the right to seek dangerous offender status for persons 
convicted of crimes causing serious personal harm at any time 
during that offender's sentence.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5175"> 5175 </A></B>
<P>
	To offer Canadians even greater protection from violent 
criminals, Reform also proposes that Bill C-55 be amended to 
require the courts to automatically place a dangerous offender 
finding on any person who commits on two or more separate 
occasions an offence constituting a serious personal injury offence. 
I refer to Criminal Code section 752.
<P>
	Under the present system, the crown has the option to bring a 
dangerous offender application against a criminal after any number 
of offences. This Reform amendment would give Canadians 
greater confidence that all violent criminals would be incarcerated 
for an indefinite period of time or until that person poses no danger 
or threat to anyone else.
<P>
	I want to consider the long term offender provision. The second 
component of Bill C-55 would create a new class of criminals 
called long term offenders. These criminals would be supervised by 
the justice system for up to 10 years after their sentence and the 
completion of parole. They would be designated long term 
offenders if it can be determined among other criteria that there is a 
substantial risk that the offender will reoffend. They must also be 
convicted of sexual assault, sexual interference, invitation to 
sexual touching, sexual exploitation, exposure, aggravated sexual 
assault and sexual assault with a weapon or causing bodily harm.
<P>
<B>(1525)</B>
<P>
	This provision does not go far enough in protecting society 
against these very brutal crimes. To help Canadians feel and be safe 
in their homes, in their neighbourhoods and in their communities, 
long term offender status must be broadened to apply to a wider 
range of offences committed by sexual predators or pedophiles.
<P>
	Reform proposes that Bill C-55 be amended to include under the 
proposed section 753.1(2) an offence under any of the following 
provisions of the Criminal Code: householder permitting sexual 
activity by a child relating to section 171; living off the avails of 
prostitution by a child, subsection 212(2); obtaining sexual 
services of a child, subsection 212(4). I could mention a number of 
other offences but I list these to make the point that Bill C-55 could 
be amended to go much further in protecting society from persons 
convicted of sexual crimes.
<P>
	The third component of Bill C-55 is the judicial restraint 
provision. This provision would add to the Criminal Code a process 
that permits provincial attorneys general to apply to a judge when 
they have reasonable grounds to believe that an individual will 
commit a serious offence, a violent crime. The judge would have 
the power to place those individuals under police supervision, 
prohibit the possession of firearms, ammunition and firearms 
acquisition certificates and require them to wear electronic 
bracelets so that their movements can be monitored.
<P>
	The Canadian people cannot accept this provision of Bill C-55 
because it makes the wrong approach in attempting to reduce 
crime. The judicial restraint provision can be applied to people who 
have no criminal record or even to people who have been acquitted 
of any criminal charges.
<P>
	I believe that greater physical security can be ensured through 
deterrence but I certainly do not believe that deterring crime means 
constituting a broad, indiscriminate and unreasonable infringement 
of a person's right to a fair trial before his peers.
<P>
	The minister's proposal is tantamount to conviction without trial 
and Canadians want nothing reminding them of star chamber 
proceedings in our judicial system. Monitoring innocent people 
will not reduce crime. In fact, are we not innocent until proven 
guilty and not guilty until proven innocent?
<P>
	This is not the first time we have seen such legislation from this 
justice minister who is so willing to disregard civil liberties. The 
first instance of his willingness to ignore Magna Carta civil 
liberties was Bill C-68 calling for universal gun registration. This 
legislation penalizes law-abiding gun owners and users and could 
mean the future confiscation of their firearms. This bill also moves 
against ancient rights preventing unwarranted search and seizure 
and the right of a person to not give evidence against himself.
<P>
	Why does the justice minister distrust law-abiding Canadian 
citizens so much? How can the government punish people for 
something it cannot prove or punish them for something someone 
might do in the future? This judicial restraint provision would be a 
violation of fundamental human rights and would further break 
down the trust level between government and law-abiding citizens.
<P>
	When introducing this legislation last month the justice minister 
told the House: ``We are taking steps to prevent crime before it 
happens''. The way to do this is not by monitoring innocent people 
but by getting tough on criminals who have committed serious 
violent crimes. This means bring in truth in sentencing for violent, 
repeat serious offenders. Bring in tougher sentences. By this I mean 
sentence every criminal who is convicted a second time for a 
violent crime to life imprisonment without eligibility for early 
release or parole. Make prison time hard time, no free time, no law 
libraries, no holiday pay, no fun experiences at all.
<P>
<B>(1530 )</B>
<P>
	The judicial restraint provision of Bill C-55 must only be 
contemplated in matters where individuals have been convicted for 
offences under the Criminal Code of Canada. Clause 9 of Bill C-55 
which allows for the surveillance of innocent Canadians must be 
struck in its totality from the bill.
<P>
	In closing, I want to re-emphasize that the Canadian people are 
concerned about their physical security. They want criminal justice 
reform. They want to feel safe in their homes. They want to be safe 
in their homes. They want their streets free for their children to 
play safely and they want their communities restored to them 
without fear.
<P>

<P>
	Bill C-55 does not go far enough in protecting people's basic 
freedoms and allowing Canadians to experience greater freedom 
from fear. However, if the amendments I suggest to the dangerous 
offender, long term offender and judicial restraint provisions were 
made to Bill C-55, I would not oppose passage of this legislation.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley, 
Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a great pleasure for me to speak today on 
Bill C-55, another attempt by the government to deal with 
dangerous offender legislation.
<P>
	As many in this House know, over the past three years that I have 
been a member of this Chamber I have spent a lot of time and 
energy dealing with the aspect of dangerous offender legislation. In 
April 1994, over two years ago, I introduced a private member's 
bill that dealt specifically with the items that Bill C-55 is trying to 
deal with.
<P>
	That piece of legislation has been before the justice and legal 
affairs committee for well over two years. Had this government 
really wanted to do something for Canadians in the aspect of 
dangerous offender legislation, it should have seen to the 
immediate acceptance of that private member's bill in this House. 
What the government has done over the past two years has been to 
introduce legislation that has dealt with partial elements of my 
private member's bill.
<P>
	In the last session the solicitor general introduced Bill C-45 
which saw the wisdom of taking a section out of my private 
member's bill dealing with the crown having to prove serious harm 
or death would be done to a child in order to keep somebody who 
was likely to reoffend incarcerated. My private member's bill 
suggested that it was a very difficult thing for a child to express the 
harm that was done and that it should not be a requirement and only 
the likelihood of an offender reoffending against the child should 
be taken into consideration. The government saw the wisdom in 
using that aspect in Bill C-45 in the last session.
<P>
	Now Bill C-55 has been introduced in this session. It also is 
taking a part of my private member's bill which dealt with long 
term supervision for people who are deemed to be dangerous 
offenders or likely to reoffend. That clause, adding up to a 10-year 
supervision at the end of the sentence, comes directly from my 
private member's bill.
<P>
	I have to give credit to the government for seeing the wisdom in 
those aspects of my private member's bill. I would still suggest that 
had the government been serious it could have enacted and brought 
into law Bill C-240, which is now Bill C-254 which sits in 
committee and deals with these aspects plus others.
<P>
<B>(1535 )</B>
<P>
	As with Bill C-45 in the last session and now Bill C-55 in this 
session, the government is still falling short of providing that kind 
of protection to Canadians, that  people who are likely to reoffend, 
to cause serious harm or death to an individual are going to be dealt 
with in a serious manner. Our party is planning a number of 
amendments which it is hoped will fill those loopholes the system 
will still have.
<P>
	This legislation has not dealt with the time frame. Presently a 
dangerous offender must be designated at the time of sentencing. If 
for whatever reason the information is not there, the assessments 
are not done at the time of sentencing, one cannot deem an 
individual to be a dangerous offender.
<P>
	This legislation is opening the window to a six-month period of 
time. What it does not deal with is that in that six months there is 
one month when the offender will likely be in a provincial remand 
centre waiting for his appeal to be heard. Then the offender will 
spend two months in an assessment centre having various tests and 
information collected. It will be three months into the six-month 
window before the offender is even incarcerated in his place of 
residence for the next number of years where he can be supervised 
and where his behaviour and attitudes can be monitored.
<P>
	It certainly does not allow the offender any opportunity to take 
part in counselling to see whether counselling and treatment will be 
of any benefit to him. It does not allow any possible rehabilitation 
for the offender. It does not allow any possible length of time for 
the people who must make these kinds of determinations to review 
the individual and see whether he is likely to cause serious harm or 
death upon release.
<P>
	The concept of six months will not do anything. I would suggest 
that the government go back to my private member's bill and have 
a good look at the reasons why it points out that the time to do this 
kind of assessment or reassessment is in the last year of this 
individual's incarceration. They can then monitor what kind of 
treatment this individual had, whether he refused treatment, 
whether the treatment did any good, whether there has been any 
effective rehabilitation, whether the individual has had a lousy 
attitude in the prison system where he has been constantly 
supervised and monitored. Six months will not allow the people 
working with this individual any opportunity to make those kinds 
of assessments.
<P>
	We see once again the inability of the government to look at the 
options and alternatives that have been presented by other members 
of the House which may bring some solution to the problems at 
hand. We see the inability of the government to go beyond a limited 
response to the demands of Canadians.
<P>
	Canadians whom I have talked to want some commitment from 
the government that it will make sure that known dangerous 
offenders who wander the streets, people who they know will likely 
reoffend and cause serious bodily harm or death to an individual 
are not out there on the streets. They want to know that when their  
children walk from school or a workplace that they will not become 
the victim of a person known to those who had them in their care 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5177"> 5177 </A></B>
<P>
that they were likely to cause serious bodily harm or death to an 
individual.
<P>
	Canadians are looking to their government for assurances that 
they will be safe on the streets. Once again the government has 
fallen short. Yes, it is a good step in the right direction. Yes, it is 
taking some aspects that are likely to work better than what we 
have now. But there is a refusal to make those decisions that will 
give the kind of guarantee or commitment by the government to 
Canadians that the government takes the risk seriously and that it 
will make those tough decisions to keep somebody incarcerated 
because it knows they are likely to cause serious bodily harm or 
death to an individual.
<P>
	This legislation still will not help the Melanie Carpenters. Auger, 
her killer, would not be caught under this legislation. Mr. Auger 
who ended up killing a young Canadian girl who was in her 
workplace would still be out on the street able to find a victim. That 
is what Canadians want the government to protect them from. The 
government has an opportunity to do just that. I would suggest it is 
not too much for Canadians to ask of their government.
<P>
<B>(1540 )</B>
<P>
	If we can lock up people because they do not pay their bills, or if 
we can lock up people because they abuse a substance, surely to 
God we can lock up people who are likely to kill innocent 
Canadians when we know they are likely to kill innocent 
Canadians. Surely Canadians can expect their government to bring 
in legislation which allows them to keep those dangerous offenders 
off the street.
<P>
	Why is the government once again coming up short of the mark? 
Why is the government going part of the way and bringing in 
another aspect of supervision or another aspect of identifying 
dangerous offenders but not doing the right thing? When the 
system that deals with the care and the concern of these individuals 
is saying that we cannot afford to put these people back out on the 
street, why is the government not listening to it?
<P>
	Six months will not do the job. It needs to be done the year 
before they are released. Only then can the decision be one based 
on fact and not just on what might or might not happen.
<P>
	I would like the government to seriously consider the 
amendments which will be proposed by my party. I would like the 
government to seriously look at amendments which will make the 
legislation the best piece of legislation it can be in order to protect 
Canadians and to ensure there will be no Melanie Carpenters in the 
future.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I read an 
interesting editorial on this particular bill entitled: ``Allan Rock in 
Wonderland''. I chuckled-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I would remind all members 
to refer to each other in the traditional manner of the House, which 
is by ministry or by riding.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Macleod):</B> My apologies, Mr. Speaker. The justice 
minister in Wonderland would have been more appropriate.
<P>
	The editorial described how the justice minister has two views of 
citizens in Canada. One view is a deep suspicion of law-abiding 
citizens, that they might commit a crime. The other is that he has an 
abiding view that the criminals who have already committed a 
crime just need to be better understood. They need to be 
rehabilitated. They need to have their backgrounds checked. I 
chuckled over that because I do not think Canadians will buy that 
any longer.
<P>
	I want to illustrate what I consider to be the real flaw in this 
legislation by talking about how insecure the citizens in my 
community are in their homes and streets. They are insecure in 
terms of the safety of their kids when they are at school. I would 
like to illustrate by example where the justice system is going. This 
example is not publicly known. The young man who was affected 
by this would not speak in public. He was concerned that he would 
be criticized by the media.
<P>
	A young farmer lives very close to the Saskatchewan-Alberta 
border. In fact, his farm is right beside the Trans-Canada Highway. 
One morning he got up to go out and do his combining. As he left 
his farmstead he noticed a hitchhiker in the ditch along the 
Trans-Canada Highway. Farmers are really friendly in that part of 
the country. He stopped, rolled down his window and said: 
``Buddy, can I do anything for you?'' The young fellow woke up 
and said: ``No, I am just catching a few winks before I hitchhike on 
down the road''. He said: ``Are you sure I cannot get anything for 
you?'' The hitchhiker said: ``No, I am okay. Thanks a lot''.
<P>
	Off the farmer went. He climbed into his combine and went 
about doing his work. He worked for much of the day doing his 
rounds. He had a two-way radio in his combine and his brother 
from a neighbouring farm phoned him and said: ``The RCMP want 
to see you. You had better come home''. He went home all 
concerned. Maybe his wife and children had been hurt in a car 
accident, or some such problem. They had been visiting another 
locale.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	The RCMP said: ``Do you own a motor bike?'' He said: ``Yes, it 
is in my garage''. The RCMP said: ``I do not think it is in your 
garage. We just caught somebody. We chased him down the 
highway riding a Harley Davidson registered to you. He has 
crashed it on the  Alberta side of the border near Medicine Hat. You 
better come and claim your motor bike''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5178"> 5178 </A></B>
<P>
	He climbed into his pick-up truck and went. Sure enough, the 
hitchhiker who had been in the ditch, who had been just waiting for 
a ride to go down the road, had broken into his garage and stolen 
his motor bike. He had also broken into his House and stolen some 
of his money, some of his ID and a firearm, a pistol.
<P>
	When our farmer friend got to the motor bike, it was badly 
damaged. These motor bikes are worth quite a bit of money. It was 
his pride and joy. He bought an old one and restored it. It was all 
smashed up. It was all bent up.
<P>
	He said: ``I just do not understand how a person could do that. I 
was friendly to him. I tried to help him''. The RCMP said: ``This is 
not a nice dude. We have a record on him all the way from Ontario. 
He is a vicious criminal''. He was able to hitchhike across our big 
land. He was not stopped. There was no problem for him, but he is 
caught now and he is in deep trouble with the law. He has broken 
into your house. He smashed into your private domain. Thank 
goodness your wife and children were not there because he might 
have done something really serious''.
<P>
	``Good'', he said, ``our justice system is going to take care of this 
dude. I am okay. I will just take my motor bike and my licks and go 
home''.
<P>
	``Just a second'', asked the RCMP, ``how did you store your 
pistol?'' ``I stored my pistol in my locked home. It is my castle, my 
domain, locked up. Nobody could get near it''. ``Have a trigger 
lock on it, boy?'' ``What do you mean?'' ``Don't you know the law? 
By the way, do you have a permit to take that pistol from your 
home to the shooting range?'' ``That's my personal protection 
against coyotes''.
<P>
	``You're in trouble, my boy. You're in trouble. You had better be 
talking to the Medicine Hat police because they have your pistol. 
The fine for what you have just done-you vicious, heinous 
criminal, not having your pistol locked up with a trigger lock and 
the ammunition in a different box''.
<P>
	The fact is he had all those things but he was accused of not 
having them. The fine is $800. There goes our young law-abiding 
farmer, back home, tail between his legs, whooped, no pistol, big 
fine coming.
<P>
	He went to his friends and said: ``I wonder what is going to 
happen to the real crook in this thing. What's going to happen to the 
guy with the criminal record from Ontario who has travelled across 
our country, who has stolen my Harley Davidson, smashed it in the 
ditch, stolen my ID and my wallet?''
<P>
	He actually got in trouble, did our boy. He got in real serious 
trouble, did our boy. He got 18 months suspended sentence-a 
little pat on the wrist. Off he went, our criminal.
<P>
	Could he be a dangerous offender? According to this he could 
not be a dangerous offender because he had committed a crime. He 
was misunderstood, probably had some poverty in the family. He 
probably had a dad who did not take care of him properly, a mother 
who did not understand him.
<P>
	The crook in this case walked. The crook in this case smiled. The 
crook in this case laughs at our justice minister. The crook in this 
case ends up being the young farmer whose only mistake was not 
have an electric fence around his home to electrocute this sucker.
<P>
<B>(1550 )</B>
<P>
	The whole idea of our justice minister in wonderland leaves 
Canadians from coast to coast insecure in their homes, in their 
schools and in their businesses, cynical about our justice system.
<P>
	What should have happened here? This is so simple. My grade 9 
son was here last week and he knows what should have happened. 
There should have been a real clanging, slamming of an iron door 
for the crook.
<P>
	The young man may have made a mistake by not understanding 
the storage of the firearm. He had owned this .357 magnum firearm 
for 15 years. He should have had from the Medicine Hat police a 
simple document saying: ``You must comply properly with the 
terms of storage for this firearm. Please make certain that you 
understand the rules''. In other words, he should have had the slap 
on the wrist for a mistake. There was no mistake on the part of this 
other friend. None whatsoever.
<P>
	A criminal justice system that sets out to prevent stalking, to 
prevent sexual predators, to prevent the serious violent crimes in 
our society is a good start. However, the cynicism that Canadians 
feel about our justice system will not be addressed by this bill.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, where am I at?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> One minute left.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> One minute too much.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Macleod):</B> Let me summarize then. My colleagues say 
one minute too much. Maybe they would like to address this issue 
and ask was the justice system just in this case.
<P>
	Would the member across like to stand before Canadians and say 
that the slap on the wrist was directed toward the right individual? 
If he can stand in this place and say that, this member of Parliament 
would be surprised.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
with interest to the speech from the hon. member for Macleod. His 
comments were very appropriate as we debate Bill C-55, 
amendments to the Criminal Code, high risk offenders. This is the  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5179"> 5179 </A></B>
<P>
government's response to Canadians, saying we are going to be 
tough on crime.
<P>
	We just heard the hon. member for Macleod point out to us that 
when the government wants to get tough on crime it gets the wrong 
guy. The young hood who committed the major crime of stealing, 
robbing, helping himself to the guys wallet got off virtually scot 
free, whereas the young farmer had to pay the price.
<P>
	This type of attitude has to stop. There are many situations in the 
country where people become victims of crime. When a person 
becomes a victim of crime, they change their opinion about the 
offender, the criminal. Obviously the people on the government 
side have been quite fortunate because they have not been victims 
of crime.
<P>
	But let us talk about it from the perspective of a victim. We have 
heard about and we see every day, unfortunately and far too often, 
our citizens being murdered, raped, assaulted, victimized, robbed. 
That means that every time a crime is committed there is a victim 
and that victim is an innocent person who does not deserve to have 
that crime inflicted on them. It is the responsibility of the 
government to stop criminals from harassing and putting fear into 
ordinary law-abiding Canadians who just want to live their lives in 
safety and in peace. That is in danger and we hear it time and time 
again.
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	I have heard our leader, the hon. member for Calgary Southwest, 
tell us about the time he was at a town hall meeting talking about 
crime and justice. He was asking the people what they wanted. An 
elderly couple stood up and said: ``Do you know what we want? We 
want to be able to leave this meeting, walk down the street to our 
car and drive home, park our car and walk into our house which is 
currently in darkness and feel safe. Safe as we walk down the 
street, safe as we drive home, safe as we park our car, safe as we 
unlock the door in a dark house and walk in and safe as we live 
there at night. But we do not have that''. That is what every 
Canadian wants and that is what this government is failing to 
deliver. People want to be assured that the streets of this country 
are safe.
<P>
	We have crime protection units all across the country. We have 
crime watch. We have all these organizations which are just great, 
and I commend every Canadian who participates in these, but they 
are participating in holding up a justice system that is being 
ignored and let down by this government. It is far more interested 
in looking after the criminal than looking after the victim.
<P>
	When a crime is committed and the police arrest a suspect the 
victim becomes a disinterested bystander. The fight is now between 
the government and the suspect, where the government proves its 
case and the suspect puts up his defence and a decision is rendered 
guilty or  not guilty. The role of the victim has been completely 
bypassed and ignored, and the victim feels like they have been 
trashed by the system. That is what we are trying to stop. We need 
compassion for the victim and we have to ensure that there is a 
proper punishment handed out to the criminal, not like what my 
friend from Macleod was saying.
<P>
	We have very loose and open parole systems in this country. We 
have a parole system that says even though someone is sentenced to 
a period of incarceration by a judge for this length of time, they can 
actually get out by serving as little as one-sixth.
<P>
	That does not mean they are going to get out after serving 
one-sixth of their time, but when they serve as little as one-sixth of 
the sentence imposed by a judge, somebody else comes along, 
some parole officer, a patronage appointment by the way, who is 
making $100,000 a year because they happen to be well connected 
with the right political party at the right time, and sits in judgement 
and says: ``The recommendation or the decision by the court, by 
the judge, at the time the criminal was found guilty is irrelevant. 
We are going to let this guy walk out on the street''. Now they are 
going to say: ``Maybe we are going to put some more restrictions 
on that''.
<P>
	We have been debating Bill C-45 which says that if a judge 
recommends that a person be locked up for 25 years, after 15 years 
we should take another look and let him out on the street. That is 
being soft on crime.
<P>
	While the Liberals may talk about their dangerous offender class 
the whole point is they want to get these people back out on the 
street faster and as quick as possible, ignoring the 
recommendations of the judges, ignoring the wishes of Canadians 
in the street, ignoring that these people are going to be committing 
crimes on an ongoing basis. That is what has to stop.
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	If the government gets into this whole realm of dangerous 
offenders, and this is what it wants to do, why did it not bring in 
Bill C-55 earlier? There are many people who should be locked up 
for a very long time who are already walking down the street, 
courtesy of section 745 which allows earlier parole. Now it wants 
to bring in this type of legislation before the election to say ``look 
how good we are''.
<P>
	I do not think this legislation is very good. While it is a good 
start, it is only a start. It is not in any way, shape or form recognized 
as a bill that is going to really address the issue which is going to 
punish our criminals, which is going to make sure they realize the 
benefits of a disciplined environment, shall we say, in prison where 
they learn normal rules of society. I know that may be difficult in 
prison, but we can start.
<P>
	The only time that I have seen the inside of a prison was as a 
member of Parliament. I had the opportunity of visiting the 
maximum institution in Edmonton. I have to admit our visit was 
quite sufficient. There is no requirement there for people to cut 
their hair, be dressed properly and get to work. They have a 
problem filling in their time. They laze around.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5180"> 5180 </A></B>
<P>
	We need an institution that puts people to work all day, every 
day, six days a week, so that they can be ready to work when they 
go back out into the general public. We let them lie in jail and by 
mollycoddled. I think I heard my friend from Fraser Valley West 
the other day talk about the fact that they are going to get a cost of 
living increase in jail. What is a cost of living increase in jail? We 
should not be paying these people unless they are actually 
producing something.
<P>
	Bill C-55 is a small attempt, a poor attempt and not much of an 
attempt to really make Canadians feel more comfortable about 
being out in the streets, to know that the streets are safer, that they 
can feel this government is concerned about them as individuals 
more than looking after criminals. It is a small start. Let the 
Reform Party finish the job after the next election when we are 
given the right to be over there on the other side.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-26, 
an act respecting the oceans of Canada, be read the third time and 
passed, and of the amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to rise today to oppose passage, at third reading, of Bill C-26, an act 
respecting the oceans of Canada.
<P>
	I oppose this bill aimed at, among other things, recognizing 
Canada's jurisdiction over its maritime zones for a number of 
reasons. Some of them were set forth in the speech I made in this 
House on June 11.
<P>
	Bill C-26 seeks to establish a national oceans management 
strategy, while defining federal responsibilities in this regard. It is 
these very fundamental aspects of this bill that concern the Bloc 
Quebecois-major concerns which I fully share. This bill abuses 
several provincial prerogatives by giving the fisheries minister 
power to act without prior endorsement from provincial 
governments.
<P>
	Canada is known to be one of the countries of the world which 
has the longest coast, on three oceans. Our oceans contain 
numerous resources, not only water resources, but also various 
kinds of fish and marine mammals, beluga whales, seals, and so on 
that live in them. Canada's waters also contain numerous as yet 
undeveloped resources, oil and natural gas, for instance.
<P>
	Quebecers and Canadians are aware of the existence of these 
marine resources, and react quickly whenever they are threatened. 
They also know that water controls the Earth's climate and releases 
a lot of oxygen.
<P>
	The Minister of Fisheries and Oceans also knows how concerned 
Quebecers and Canadians are about these natural resources. That is 
why he created ocean day on June 8, 1996. I remind the House that 
this special day was a result of initiatives taken at the Earth Summit 
held in Rio de Janeiro in 1992. National ocean day is there to 
heighten public awareness of the influence of oceans on our daily 
lives.
<P>
	Despite his desire to educate the public about the importance of 
Canadian waters, the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans has 
introduced a bill that does little to deal with what Quebecers and 
Canadians really want in this regard.
<P>
	Bill C-26 being extremely centralizing, the provinces have 
virtually no role left with regard to the ocean policy. Yet we know 
that provinces are much more aware of what the people want than 
the federal government.
<P>
	As for the partnership between the federal and provincial 
governments, the former Minister of Fisheries and Oceans had 
supported the idea, but I see in this bill that the possibility of 
partnership has been ruled out. As a matter of fact, clause 29 of Bill 
C-26 tends to view provincial governments as mere collaborators, 
on the same level as aboriginal organizations, coastal communities 
and other interested persons and bodies.
<P>
	I believe that Bill C-26 will lead to endless discussions as well as 
long and painful struggles between both levels of government.
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	The bill contains other clauses showing the desire of this 
government to centralize powers. Cases in point are clauses 28 to 
36 dealing with the development of a management strategy for 
estuaries, coastal waters and marine waters. Not only do these 
clauses infringe upon provincial jurisdiction, but they give the 
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans powers already belonging to the 
federal environment minister.
<P>
	It should be noted that the environment is an area of jurisdiction 
not explicitly attributed to either level of government under the 
Constitution. Before 1985, the Quebec government played a 
significant role in environmental issues. The federal government 
only got involved in areas related to its own jurisdiction. However, 
after 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5181"> 5181 </A></B>
<P>
1985, Ottawa started to be very active in environmental issues 
through its spending powers. This led to a lot of duplication and 
overlap.
<P>
	Bill C-26 is a further step toward centralization, which the 
provinces, Quebec especially, find unacceptable. Overlap exists 
mainly in federal-provincial regulations regarding the 
environment. As a result, companies must often spend a lot of 
money, time and energy to learn about the many existing 
government programs and to abide by the stringent requirements of 
both governments. Bill C-26 only makes matters worse since the 
federal government, in spite of its financial problems, is creating 
new structures to protect a specific ecosystem.
<P>
	The Minister of Fisheries and Oceans also wants to unilaterally 
impose, on the marine industry, fees for all coast guard services, 
including navigational aids and ice breaking, as stated in clauses 41 
and 47 to 52 of the bill.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois proposed several amendments to these 
clauses in order to make the fees more equitable and force the 
minister to consult the industry and the provinces before he 
imposes fees or raises the rates. This new federal tax threatens the 
competitiveness of the port of Montreal-as you know, I represent 
Montréal-Nord which is part of the greater Montreal area-of other 
harbours on the St. Lawrence and of all Quebec businesses that 
depend on marine transportation.
<P>
	The Quebec minister of state responsible for the Montreal area, 
Serge Ménard, and the president of the Communauté urbaine de 
Montréal, Vera Danyluck, have condemned this improvised and 
dangerous tax. It must be pointed out that the federal government 
ordered the coast guard, the agency responsible for the safety of 
marine transportation in Canada, to charge ship owners $160 
million before 1999, beginning with $20 million this year, in 1996.
<P>
	However, the impact will be worse for Montreal and other 
Quebec harbours because the federal government wants to 
implement three different fee schedules, one for the St. Lawrence, 
one for the west coast and one for the maritimes.
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	For instance, Ottawa will collect a fee from a foreign vessel 
arriving in Montreal, while that vessel will not pay anything if it 
goes to American ports on the Great Lakes. It must be pointed out 
that half of the some 726,000 containers that are carried each year 
to Montreal go to and from the American Midwest and the state of 
New York and the New England states.
<P>
	Costs at the port of Montreal will increase and this will benefit 
harbours on the eastern seaboard of the United States that are 
competing with Montreal. Unfortunately, the Minister of Fisheries 
and Oceans did not wait for the results of an economic impact study 
before introducing this measure. Clearly, through this action, 
Ottawa wants to favour the other regions to the detriment of 
Quebec.
<P>
	The first fees have just been collected for navigational aids: 
buoys, lighthouses, traffic control, but the hardest for Quebec will 
come in 1997, when ice breaking fees will be implemented. Port 
activity generates major economic spinoffs of $1.2 billion for 
Montreal, as well as 14,000 jobs in Montreal.
<P>
	On April 3, I met officials of the port authority in Montreal with 
my Bloc Quebecois colleagues from the Montreal area. They told 
us that container traffic is at an unprecedented level and that the 
port authority has a net profit for the sixteenth year in a row. This 
net profit was at $9.3 million in 1995, compared to $8.7 million in 
1994.
<P>
	The Montreal Port Corporation is stepping up its efforts to 
stimulate activity and expand its facilities. However, the Canadian 
Coast Guard cost recovery project counteracts the Montreal Port 
Corporation's efforts to become more competitive. It also hurts 
industrial users such as the oil industry.
<P>
	Shipping is vital to the economy of Montreal and Quebec as a 
whole. The port of Montreal alone handles 20 million tonnes of 
cargo per year. Since 60 per cent of the freight passing through the 
port of Montreal is shipped by rail to various destinations 
throughout the continent, the profitability of the rail system will 
also be affected by the proposed fee structure. This bill will 
aggravate the situation in the Montreal region, which faces 
enormous economic problems as well as an outrageously high 
unemployment rate.
<P>
	When I spoke to Bill C-26 last June, I listed the many reasons 
why I was opposed to this bill as it was presented to us. Today, I 
reaffirm my opposition because the bill provides for too much 
federal interference in areas of provincial jurisdiction. As a 
member who is sensitive to the needs of the people who elected 
him, I am unable to endorse a bill that totally ignores their 
concerns.
<P>
	In this, I agree with my Bloc colleagues, who show the same 
consideration for their constituents. That is why I supported all the 
motions put forward by the Bloc Quebecois, and especially by my 
colleague from Gaspé. For all these reasons, I oppose Bill C-26.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened quite attentively to the comments and critique of 
the hon. Bloc member on Bill C-26, the oceans act.
<P>
	In light of the fact that my hon. colleague from Skeena had made 
a number of amendments, I believe seven, at the time the bill was 
before the House at report stage, what specifically is different 
about the amendments the Bloc is bringing forward?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5182"> 5182 </A></B>
<P>
	I heard his concern about the fee structure for the coast guard 
marine services fees. It sounded very reminiscent of the same 
concerns that were being put forward by my hon. colleague from 
Skeena at that time, and certainly support his concerns about that 
section of the bill and the amendments he has brought forward.
<P>
	Reform was concerned about the dedication of costs to ensure 
that the costs that were attributed to the provision of certain 
services were actually documented. Therefore the fees would be 
structured in such a way as to be specific to those costs being 
incurred by the government, that they would not go beyond that.
<P>
	Could the hon. member enlighten me and the House regarding 
what specifically is different about the amendments being brought 
forward and debated at this time by the Bloc? What is different 
from the Reform amendments that were brought forward at report 
stage, which unfortunately were subsequently defeated in the 
House?
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nunez:</B> Mr. Speaker, the amendments proposed by Bloc 
members would provide for greater provincial involvement in the 
development of an oceans strategy and policy. We also want a 
fairer fee implementation scheme, and I mentioned that the 
government scheme would have a major impact on Montreal. We 
agree that a strategy should be developed, but provincial 
jurisdiction in this area should be respected, and I think the bill 
violates this principle.
<P>
	I should add that some of the Reform Party's amendments were 
in line with those put forward by the Bloc Quebecois, which was a 
mere coincidence. Unfortunately, all these motions were defeated 
by the members of the majority party, and I find this regrettable.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in the words of 
the hon. member of the Reform Party and the hon. member for 
Bourassa, what is different about the amendments brought forward 
by the Bloc Quebecois, compared to those brought forward by the 
Reform member for Skeena, who also sat on the parliamentary 
committee, is mainly the relationship between the provinces and 
the central government in Ottawa.
<P>
	I found the amendments put forward by the hon. member for 
Skeena-which dealt mainly with a feedback mechanism to 
establish, for instance, whether the services provided by the coast 
guard were performed efficiently-most appropriate.
<P>
	The second amendment asked for transparency to be exercised in 
developing a price setting mechanism. We would have liked to 
come back and debate this in the House. I am pleased that the hon. 
member for Skeena  addressed these issues. We had gone about it in 
a slightly different way.
<P>
	Still in response to the remark my hon. colleague from the 
Reform Party made today, I would like to point out that, in light of 
the fact that an agreement between British Columbia and the 
federal government is imminent, the Bloc Quebecois tabled this 
afternoon an amendment to have the next reading of Bill C-26 
deferred by six months, since the discussions between the province 
and the federal government on the sharing of management 
measures regarding, for example, resource conservation will 
dictate how the federal government should act thereafter, with its 
individual provincial partners.
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
	These were the main differences between our amendments and 
those put forward by the Reform Party. But on many other aspects, 
it is clear that we can work together to impress upon the 
government party that time has come to face the facts and 
recognize that this committee's work was not partisan, but aimed at 
moving things along. If the process stalls, the people will be the 
judge of that later.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nunez:</B> Mr. Speaker, I can only agree with the remarks 
made and views expressed by my distinguished colleague from 
Gaspé. I must commend him because he has very aptly represented 
the views of the Bloc Quebecois on this issue. He knows the subject 
and the bill before us inside out.
<P>
	Naturally, I will take this opportunity to support the amendment 
he has brought forward this afternoon. I think there are still too 
many outstanding issues that must be resolved. He mentioned 
British Columbia. I think that the government of that province has 
maintained a very dignified attitude vis-à-vis the federal 
government. It voiced complaints and criticisms, and made claims 
that the federal government has not seen fit to take into account.
<P>
	For these reasons, I support the amendment put forward this 
afternoon by the hon. member for Gaspé.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Before resuming debate, it is 
my duty pursuant to Standing Order 38 to inform the House that the 
questions to be raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as 
follows: the hon. member for Portneuf-Telecommunications; the 
hon. member for Saskatoon-Clark's Crossing-Justice.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dianne Brushett (Cumberland-Colchester, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise in support of Bill C-26 and to respond 
to the concerns raised by the Bloc Quebecois members of the 
House.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois is concerned that in some way the Canada 
Oceans Act infringes on the rights and jurisdiction of the prov-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5183"> 5183 </A></B>
<P>
inces. Such concerns are valid concerns for any province to have, 
but they simply do not apply with respect to the Canada Oceans 
Act.
<P>
	On the contrary, the spirit of this legislation is to bring the 
various stakeholders together to participate in integrated ocean 
management. The objective is to work in close co-operation with 
provincial governments and other agencies to create partnerships 
and to jointly develop concrete plans for managing marine 
resources.
<P>
	This is quite obvious if one reads the preamble of the act which 
states in part that the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans will 
encourage the development and implementation of a national 
strategy for the management of estuarine, coastal and marine 
ecosystems in collaboration with other ministers, boards and 
agencies of the Government of Canada, with-I say 
with-provincial and territorial governments and with affected 
aboriginal organizations, coastal communities and other persons 
and bodies, including those bodies established under land claims 
agreements.
<P>
	Obviously the provincial role is central to this act. Clause 29 
states specifically that the minister, in collaboration with provincial 
and territorial governments among others, shall lead and facilitate 
the development and implementation of a national strategy for the 
management of estuarine, coastal and marine ecosystems.
<P>
	There is no exclusion of the provinces. There is total respect for 
the integrity of provincial ocean territory and there is a specific 
recognition that the oceans management strategy outlined in the 
Canada Oceans Act must be the result of concerted efforts between 
the federal government and the provinces.
<P>
	Further to this, the provinces are mentioned specifically in the 
clause dealing with integrated management plans and in the clause 
dealing with the implementation of these plans. They are key 
players. Clause 33(1)(a) states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In exercising the powers and performing the duties and functions assigned to the 
minister by this act, the minister (a) shall co-operate with other ministers, boards and 
agencies of the Government of Canada, with provincial and territorial governments 
and with affected aboriginal organizations-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The provinces are again mentioned in clause 33(2) which deals 
with consultation. Does this sound like an exclusionary act? Does 
this sound like an act that wants to take away the rights and 
privileges of the provinces? No, it does not because it is not. The 
government would not be here today promoting the act if it were.
<P>
<B>(1630)</B>
<P>
	Bill C-26 respects the rights and jurisdiction of all provinces and 
territories. It provides for an integrated strategy of oceans 
managements developed in co-operation with those provinces and 
territories. The legislation does not make any changes to the 
present constitutional framework or to the distribution of powers 
between the federal government and the provinces. It  does not 
encroach in any way on provincial rights. Any such fears are totally 
unfounded.
<P>
	The Canada oceans act is all about partnership. It will make it 
possible for Canadians to work together to preserve our oceans' 
resource. In no way, as has been suggested, a grab for more power 
by the federal government at the expense of any province.
<P>
	The bill before us today calls on all Canadians to come together 
to develop that strategy that combines a harnessing of the oceans' 
economic potential with a respect for the oceans' environmental 
needs. The national environmental agenda can no longer be 
separated from the national economic agenda.
<P>
	Bill C-26 puts in place the fundamentals to ensure the 
convergence of Canada's economic and environmental agendas for 
our oceans. Indeed it goes even further than that. It puts in place the 
fundamental legislative foundation to ensure that Canada's ocean 
strategy is based on converging environmental, economic, social 
and foreign policies.
<P>
	Ocean resources are not finite. We have learned that the hard 
way. We have learned that human actions can jeopardize fragile 
ocean ecosystems. We have learned that ocean species and 
resources are independent. We have learned also that the 
environmental health of our oceans is directly connected with our 
country's economic health. If we abuse the oceans we pay the price 
for that abuse.
<P>
	The Canada oceans act formalizes Canada's jurisdiction over 
nearly five million square kilometres of ocean. It creates a 200 
nautical mile exclusive economic zone for Canada in the Atlantic, 
Pacific and Arctic oceans. What does that jurisdiction mean for 
Canadians? It gives Canada the right to explore and exploit the 
resources of the waters, the seabed and the subsoil in this exclusive 
economic zone. It also gives us the right and the responsibility to 
conserve and manage the living and non-living resources in that 
zone.
<P>
	As all hon. members are aware, if we do not conserve and 
manage those resources wisely, it will not be long before there will 
be no resources to explore or to exploit. What the bill now before 
this House is doing is setting out the legislative framework for new 
oceans management strategy. That is why the bill consolidates and 
clarifies specific federal responsibilities for implementing the new 
strategy. Note I said consolidates and clarifies. There is no question 
here of a power grab at the expense of the provinces.
<P>
	Bill C-26 calls for sustainable development of Canada's oceans 
and their integrated management. It is only through sustainable 
development and integrated management that we can make our 
economic and environmental agendas converge.
<P>
	The Canada oceans act is based on that wisdom. It is based on 
the philosophy of sustainable development. The bill takes mea-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5184"> 5184 </A></B>
<P>
sures to give life to the principle of sustainable development by 
putting in place a basis for Canadian action plans for our oceans.
<P>
	The Canada oceans act will extend Canadian environmental 
legislation to include the new exclusive economic zones. The act 
will make the the Department of Fisheries and Oceans the common 
focal point for co-ordinating federal ocean activities. It will 
authorize the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans to develop marine 
quality guidelines and to establish marine protected areas.
<P>
	The act will give the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans 
responsibility for conducting and facilitating marine research. The 
act will give the minister the authority to lead in co-ordinating the 
activities of all Canadians in the development of a shared Canadian 
oceans strategy. The act will enable the minister to enter into new 
partnership agreements, to share ocean information, to share ocean 
research and to share ocean planning and ocean management.
<P>
<B>(1635 )</B>
<P>
	That is why this bill is about sharing. It is only through working 
together that we can reduce duplication and conflicts. It is only 
through working together that we can increase the effectiveness of 
measures to protect the ocean environment. It is only through 
working together that we can adopt a comprehensive ecosystem 
based approach to comprehensive ecosystem problems.
<P>
	The Canada oceans act recognizes that efforts to promote 
sustainable development of our oceans cannot take place in 
isolation. Sustainable development of our oceans is not the sole 
responsibility of the federal government. It requires efforts on the 
local level, the provincial level, the regional level, the national 
level and the international level. It requires efforts by all of us, 
acting both individually and together.
<P>
	We absolutely need national goals and national priorities. We 
also need community based planning and meaningful local 
decision making. We also need provincial planning and decision 
making. None of us can do the job alone.
<P>
	The Canada oceans act is not a federal power grab. It is far from 
it. The Canada oceans act represents the federal government's 
taking its obligations to our oceans seriously and responsibly. A 
critical aspect of those obligations is the creation of a legal 
foundation to enable provinces and territories, businesses and 
environmentalists, fisheries and ocean industries to pull together 
and to pull in the same direction.
<P>
	We all want Canada's oceans to be productive, safe and healthy. 
We can achieve that only by making Canada a world leader in 
ocean and marine resource management. We can achieve it only if 
we manage our oceans in close co-operation with one another.
<P>
	The Canada oceans act is very precise and very detailed in 
describing Canada's new oceans jurisdiction. It is very precise and 
very detailed in describing the reorganization and the renewal of 
federal responsibilities for our oceans. However, it is quite open 
ended with respect to the precise elaboration of the new ocean 
management strategy. That is because we must build the strategy 
together. We need to draw on each other's strengths and we need to 
be sensitive to each other's aspirations.
<P>
	As we travel through Canada's provinces we find concentrations 
of knowledge and skill. We find not only ocean scientists, 
engineers and business managers, we also find people in fishing 
communities with generations of accumulated knowledge about 
currents, salinity, water depth, temperatures, tides and navigational 
routes. That knowledge is important in the development of a 
national ocean marine strategy.
<P>
	A major challenge in building a new strategy is to make certain 
that we link all that knowledge together and share it with one 
another. We need to understand what we know and what we do not 
know. We need to understand how each of our ocean regions is 
unique and how our ocean regions are interdependent. We need 
more incite into all aspects of our oceans and their resources. That 
will take a tremendous effort and amount of co-operation; a 
multidisciplinary effort. It is going to take a long time.
<P>
	The Canada oceans act will facilitate the process by allowing the 
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans to make federal research and 
scientific data widely available across Canada. The bill will also 
give the minister the power to enter into new agreements to 
promote ocean scientists' research. The bill will also enable the 
minister to work co-operatively with all ocean stakeholders in 
marine resource management. Thus we are poised to enter a new 
era of domestic conservation, management and enforcement 
agreements for the wide range of ocean resources made available to 
Canadians through jurisdiction over the exclusive economic zone.
<P>
	Let us also note that Canada's ocean marine strategy must place 
the highest priority on marine safety. The Canada oceans act 
confirms the merger of the Canada Coast Guard and the 
Department of Fisheries and Oceans. This is a key common sense 
action to meld ocean responsibilities with ocean safety.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	Our aim is to work in harmony to develop even better safety 
enhancing technologies and navigational systems as we forge a 
future of ocean sustainable development. This legislation makes it 
possible to form new domestic agreements to assist ocean trade and 
commerce. We can work co-operatively to transfer technologies 
from government and academic researchers to the private sector. 
We can work co-operatively to improve resource assessment and 
inspection. We can harmonize regulations  and guarantee services 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5185"> 5185 </A></B>
<P>
provided by different levels of government to meet the needs of our 
sea coast communities and ports effectively.
<P>
	The Canada oceans act makes it possible for Canadians to work 
together to shape the best national answers and the best local 
answers for the sustainable development of our very precious 
ocean resources. It provides for the components of an integrated 
ocean strategy. Those components are a better understanding of 
oceans, better resource management, better environmental 
management, increased safety and increased trade and commerce. 
That is what the Canada oceans act is all about. It is about sharing 
and working together.
<P>
	If we are to have a future at all, if we are to have oceans with 
resources for future generations to develop, we must learn to work 
together as partners.
<P>
	In no way can it be asserted that in this bill the Government of 
Canada is assuming the right to legislate unilaterally on Canada's 
maritime regions. On the contrary, the spirit of this legislation is to 
bring stakeholders together to participate in integrated oceans 
management. The objective is to work in close co-operation with 
provincial governments and other agencies to create partnerships 
and jointly develop plans for managing marine resources.
<P>
	As I said earlier, Bill C-26 respects Quebec's territorial integrity 
and the territorial integrity of every province and territory in this 
country. It respects the rights and the jurisdictions of the provinces 
and territories. It provides for an integrated strategy of ocean 
management developed in co-operation with the provinces.
<P>
	I urge all hon. members of this House to support the Canada 
oceans act.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philippe Paré (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
carefully to the hon. member for Cumberland-Colchester, and I 
cannot help but conclude that this is just more double talk from a 
government that keeps quoting fine principles.
<P>
	For example, the member said: ``The spirit of this legislation is 
to bring stakeholders together. It is about national goals and 
national priorities. It is about sharing and working together''. At 
the same time, this bill divides Canada into three different zones as 
far as navigational aids are concerned, each zone having different 
conditions, which means different fees. In the end, what we have 
here is the old philosophy of dividing and ruling.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brushett:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the hon. member's 
question. In my opinion the reason the bill has divided our oceans 
into three zones is that we are talking about three oceans. We are 
talking about the Atlantic Ocean, the Pacific Ocean and the Arctic 
Ocean. This is a vast and great country and it is imperative that we 
meet the needs of all its zones.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member for Cumberland-Colchester is quite excited about this 
bill and it escapes me as to the reason for that.
<P>
	When I look at the bill I do not see too much there. I see that the 
government is committed into entering into negotiations with 
various groups to determine a strategy. For example, in section 29 
it says: ``The minister in collaboration with other ministers-'' and 
it goes on and on as to the groups he is going to collaborate with. It 
says he shall lead and facilitate the development and 
implementation of a national strategy for the management of 
estuarine, coastal and marine ecosystems and waters that form part 
of Canada or in which Canada has sovereign rights under 
international law. What does that mean? What is the policy? What 
management strategy is the government going to pursue? I do not 
know. I would bet dollars to doughnuts the hon. member does not 
know what the strategy is either.
<P>
<B>(1645 )</B>
<P>
	That is the problem with the bill. It sets up the minister as a 
dictator. He can determine what the policy is going to be, make it 
up as he goes along. The rest of us will have no say in it because it 
will be passed, it will be law and there will be nothing we can do 
about it.
<P>
	The people who sent us here will have complaints about the 
legislation. It will not get any support because there is absolutely 
nothing. We are giving the government carte blanche to do what it 
wants.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brushett:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the hon. member's 
question. Coming from the marine territory of Nova Scotia, which 
is surrounded by water, I am fully aware of the implications of the 
bill.
<P>
	When the government came to power I made three promises to 
the Canadian people; sustainable finances, sustainable economic 
development and sustainable environmental development.
<P>
	This bill practices sustainable environmental development. How 
well the Canadian people know what past rules, regulations and 
policies have done to our ocean resources. How well the people off 
the coastal waters of the Atlantic know what has happened without 
resource management.
<P>
	This bill brings together a facilitation process, not a dictatorial 
process, where the federal government in co-operation with the 
coastal provinces, whether they be Atlantic, Pacific or northern, 
will communicate and share information on scientific, resource, 
industrial, oceanographic matters. We will develop sustainable 
policies, not only for this generation but for the future of our young 
people.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as my hon. colleague from Delta indicated, the hon. 
member who just spoke seems to think this is the greatest thing 
since sliced bread. I am not exactly sure why.
<P>
	I know time is short for questions and comments. I would like to 
point out to the hon. member that the Reform Party put forward a 
number of amendments at report stage about which I spoke a few 
minutes ago. We feel it is crucial that any and all fees brought about 
by the legislation should not be implemented until a full 
socioeconomic impact analysis is done.
<P>
	The member spoke quite eloquently in her presentation about 
how co-operatively the minister and the government would be in 
implementing this national strategy. I wonder why her party voted 
against the amendments which would have made it necessary for 
the minister and the government to initiate a full impact study 
before the fees were put in place. The people in her riding involved 
in the industry would have a say about what the fees would be and 
whether the fees would would have a positive or negative impact 
on their industry.
<P>
	How did she vote? Why did the government members vote 
against this?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brushett:</B> Mr. Speaker, again I reiterate that the 
government made the promise of sustainable finances and a 
sustainable environment. They are part and parcel of the 
legislation.
<P>
	I live on the coast of Nova Scotia where fees will be 
implemented as they will be on the west coast. People there know 
what fees are.
<P>
	I find it interesting that the hon. member would talk about fees 
when it is his party that wants to cut everything in sight and reduce 
the deficit faster. It seems quite admirable that he would stand in 
the House today and challenge why we are creating fees and cutting 
the deficit.
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gérard Asselin (Charlevoix, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to address Bill C-26, but I do so with much less enthusiasm 
than the hon. member who just spoke.
<P>
	First, we must publicly condemn the fees that will cause all 
kinds of problems in the various departments since, under this 
legislation, the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans will have 
authority to get involved in matters relating to the environment.
<P>
	The hon. member for Gaspé does an excellent job as the official 
opposition critic on issues that relate to fisheries and oceans. He 
had an opportunity to meet hundreds of witnesses who expressed 
their disagreement with the bill that the minister wants the House 
to pass.
<P>
	Following the representations made by the hon. member for 
Gaspé, the Bloc Quebecois proposed amendments in the House that 
would have had the effect of protecting the resource, the 
environment and the industry, while making all fishing boats safer.
<P>
	These amendments were proposed by the Bloc at second reading, 
but the minister did not seem to agree with them. He did not deem 
appropriate to include them so as to improve Bill C-26 which, in 
fact, violates certain prerogatives of the provinces.
<P>
	Yet, the minister must, in Bill C-26, respect these provincial 
prerogatives. Obviously, a federal act affecting the St. Lawrence 
Seaway, such as Bill C-26, does not concern Quebec only, but all 
the provinces. Today, these issues are being raised mostly by the 
Bloc Quebecois. The Reform Party also proposed amendments, but 
we must make the federal government aware of the problems that it 
will create for every provincial environment department.
<P>
	It is also important that the federal government seek the approval 
of its provincial counterparts, since this legislation will create 
management problems for them. The bill will cause more overlap 
and duplication, which is already a $6 billion problem for Quebec 
and Ottawa alone.
<P>
	In this case, the overlap will not necessarily occur between the 
federal and provincial governments, but between departments. 
Indeed, if we read Bill C-26, we can see that it gives powers to the 
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans regarding the environmental 
sector. I will get back to this later on.
<P>
	The Liberals are once again resorting to one of their good old 
techniques. They claim to be consulting, they pat people on the 
back, but in the end they will do as they please. Why waste MPs' 
time, whether they are Liberals, Reformers or Bloc members? We 
all have better things to do. Our work in committee is an important 
task.
<P>
	When the House refers a bill to the fisheries and oceans 
committee, it means the committee will conduct a clause by clause 
review. However, this is a futile exercise, since the minister does as 
he pleases. The minister decides what he wants to do; if the dice 
have already been cast, they should tell us. There is no use sending 
a bill to a committee for study and calling witnesses from across 
Canada, from Quebec City to Halifax and from Montreal to 
Vancouver, to come here and tell us they do not agree with the 
legislation, if unfortunately the minister does not take into account 
submissions to the committee.
<P>
	In any case, we, in the Bloc Quebecois, have agreed to keep on 
condemning the mess the minister is about to make in the shipping 
industry as well as in the pleasure boating industry. If the Minister 
of Fisheries and Oceans wants to pass, with Bill C-26, legislation to 
ensure the safety of ships, the Bloc has no quarrel with it. And if the  

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5187"> 5187 </A></B>
<P>
idea is to make the users of marine infrastructures pay for the cost 
of the coast guard in order to ensure people's safety, the Bloc has 
no quarrel with that, either.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	However, the fault we find with the legislation is that it goes too 
far in involving the coast guard in controlliing pleasure craft. I find 
it hard to imagine the coast guard patrolling the hundreds and 
thousands of lakes on the north shore used exclusively for hunting 
and fishing. It is hard to imagine the coast guard regulating and 
making sure that someone driving a boat with a 2 hp or 4 hp motor 
is qualified to drive that boat, to put gas in the motor or change the 
spark plugs. Or course, it will have to make sure the boat is 
equipped with life buoys.
<P>
	People in our area know all these things and we do not want the 
coast guard involved in matters of hunting and fishing and tourism, 
which could hurt our tourism industry. I can hardly imagine coast 
guard vessels sailing up and down our rivers. It will be very 
expensive, because its vessels will run aground a few times. We do 
not have too many rivers that are navigable, except for fishing 
boats.
<P>
	Bill C-26 also claims titles of sovereignty. I do not quite get the 
idea. If they come up with such a bill, are we to understand that the 
federalists have caught the sovereignty fever?
<P>
	There are also many grey areas in this bill. A few things are not 
quite clear, and the government should pay attention to these grey 
areas. That was done in committee and in different forums.
<P>
	I wonder if I am not just wasting my time today, trying to explain 
to Liberal members how important it is for the government to get 
the co-operation of the provinces concerning this bill and the use of 
exclusive provincial jurisdiction over the environment. I have 
already said that, but it bears repeating.
<P>
	The provinces, the environment departments and the provincial 
officials should not be considered mere associates. They should be 
involved and they should be given the opportunity to voice their 
views and say what they think of Bill C-26, or it will become a 
nuisance if they are not consulted.
<P>
	The provinces should be involved in discussions. They should be 
more than mere associates, as I said. They should help draft this 
bill. Then it would be easier for the federal government to see to the 
implementation of this legislation within each of the provinces.
<P>
	In one of its amendments, the Bloc Quebecois asks that the rights 
and jurisdiction of the provinces be respected for the management 
of the environment and the marine infrastructure on the north 
shore. The Bloc Quebecois wants to protect the right of the 
provinces over any area of the sea in which a law of a province 
applies and over the living resources of that area. The  Bloc also 
wants to ensure that the provinces take part in the development and 
implementation of the oceans management strategy.
<P>
	Bill C-26 also deals with the environment and I will have the 
opportunity later on to examine the environmental system in more 
detail. The Bloc Quebecois also tried to force the minister to 
consult the Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans. For 
greater openness, the government should have agreed to have its 
decisions sanctioned by elected representatives of all political 
parties. It is important to consult every political party. Members of 
Parliament have been elected by the people to represent all of the 
ridings throughout Canada. I think there are 75 ridings in the 
province of Quebec, which means 75 members of Parliament from 
Quebec, who should all have their say about this.
<P>
<B>(1700)</B>
<P>
	The Bloc members are the only ones to criticize this bill, except 
for the Conservative member for Sherbrooke and the independent 
member for Beauce. Where are the other members?
<P>
	What are the Liberal members doing in this House? They have 
been gagged and their actions have been restricted. I am sure that, 
back home, in Charlevoix, the people are criticizing this bill and 
that the residents on the north shore or in Charlevoix are not the 
only ones to do so. The Bloc Quebecois members are not the only 
ones to be worried about this piece of legislation. I would like the 
Liberal members who were elected to represent their constituents 
to reject this proposal coming from their colleague, the minister.
<P>
	One of the purposes of Bill C-26 is to encourage the federal 
ministers to talk to each other. Do we need a bill to encourage the 
Liberal members to talk to each other as well? As far as I know, 
there still is cabinet, which meets quite regularly. It is in the 
interest of ministers to see to it that the machinery of government is 
working properly.
<P>
	I want to make a point here. Since the events back in June, the 
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans proceeded with the first step of 
the rate setting process for navigational aids. Twenty million 
dollars were taken out of the taxpayers' pockets. This is a hidden 
tax.
<P>
	Marine companies received bills during the summer even though 
the impact study on the new initiatives will be ready only in 
November. If ridicule kills, many will die. It is fortunate that 
ridicule never killed anyone because it is ridiculous to implement 
such regulations and bill people who kindly helped and contributed 
in spite of the fact that there is an injunction order against this rate 
setting process.
<P>
	Three major companies asked for an injunction. Even though the 
bill has not yet been passed and has been challenged, and even 
though an injunction was made, the Minister of Fisheries and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5188"> 5188 </A></B>
<P>
Oceans sent bills for $20  million to companies currently using the 
services of the coast guard.
<P>
	But there is more to come. In the next few days, the government 
wants to get $40 million more. This is a hidden tax. The 
government says in its red book that it will not raise taxes while 
increasing services, but we have found out what is going on. The 
Liberal government is resorting to a hidden tax to raise taxes. This 
is just another way of taxing small taxpayers, in particular users of 
pleasure craft or inland vessels.
<P>
	Here is an example. The Société des traversiers du Québec, that 
operates a ferry on the St. Lawrence between Matane and 
Baie-Comeau or Matane and Godbout, will be hit by a $25,000 
increase in only one year. And I am saying a $25,000 increase 
because the Société des traversiers du Québec will have to pass on 
the costs of this new rate structure to users.
<P>
	I will say it again. This rate increase for crossing the river by 
ferry between Matane and Baie-Comeau and Matane and Godbout, 
which applies to products-and we know that many food products 
and materials are shipped across the river-will mean a higher cost 
of living in exchange as a result of the impact of this bill.
<P>
	What I find most laughable is the fees charged for pleasure craft. 
The Bloc had brought forward amendments calling for the removal 
of all references to navigation and pleasure craft. It is unacceptable 
that the minister should grab the power to act on rivers and lakes 
that, for the most part, are managed by the Government of Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
	In Quebec, rivers and lakes are managed by the province's 
Department of Environment, and that includes the fauna and flora 
as well as the water. Furthermore, the Government of Quebec 
manages the land surrounding lakes as regards to the building of 
hunting camps or cottages.
<P>
	When the federal government says it will manage pleasure craft, 
I wonder if it will go as far as taxing outdoor recreational 
equipment like surfboards, pedalos and water skiing equipment. 
And it may not have thought of it, but if it is a few cents short with 
its hidden tax, it could tax life buoys. But since the goal is to 
increase security, I suppose the minister has thought of it. Just 
about the only piece of equipment that left out is the lifebuoy.
<P>
	Bill C-26 gives the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans powers that 
already belong to the Minister of the Environment. The bill seems 
to be creating a sectoral department of the environment: the 
department of the coastal environment. If that was done in all 
sectors, we would have a department of transport environment, a 
department of industry environment, etc. All departments would 
end up with environmental protection and conservation powers. If 
that is the direction the government wants to go, it should abolish 
the Department of the Environment.
<P>
	I have been sitting on the environment committee for one year as 
parliamentary assistant to the hon. member for Laurentides. 
Recently, the minister told us that there was no environmental 
issue. When we ask a question of a minister, we want to talk to a 
minister who has a plan, an agenda, we want to talk to a minister 
who knows where he is going. When the minister moves away from 
his plan or agenda, we ask him questions, we try to make him stick 
to that agenda.
<P>
	The present Minister of the Environment as well as the former 
one, who is now Deputy Prime Minister, have any plan. It seems to 
me that the Department of the Environment still exists only 
because it has always existed, but there is no co-ordination 
whatsoever. I understand that the federal government wants to give 
the Department of Fisheries and Oceans and to the Department of 
Transport their share, but I hope that one day it will abolish the 
Department of the Environment if nobody here in Ottawa is in 
charge of environmental protection.
<P>
	I would say that the Minister of the Environment is not in a very 
comfortable position. To use a maritime analogy, I would say that 
in the environment sector, we are adrift in a dinghy without a 
captain.
<P>
	It is important to bring this government back to its senses. The 
minister has to be responsible for environment and must have 
backbone and be able to say to his Cabinet colleagues: ``Just a 
minute. As Minister of Environment, I am responsible for 
everything that concerns the environment, be it at Fisheries and 
Oceans or Transport Canada. We have a department called 
Environment Canada and we intend to administer all areas relating 
to environment''.
<P>
	For the last six months or so the definition of sustainable 
development has been under study. The Department of Fisheries 
and Oceans is bypassing once more the Department of 
Environment. I believe that the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans 
has enough in his own backyard to keep himself busy. He should let 
Environment Canada administer the environment.
<P>
	Those sections empower the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans to 
develop and implement a national strategy for the management of 
estuarine, coastal and marine ecosystems. This strategy will 
require the implementation of plans for the management of 
activities, the establishment of management or advisory bodies, the 
development of numerous programs, the establishment of 
environmental standards, the gathering and analysis of scientific 
data on the ecosystems involved. What a waste!
<P>
	This bill provides for the establishment of a program, the 
implementation of a plan, the development and establishment of 
bodies but all those things already exist in the environment sector.
<P>

<B>(1710)</B>
<P>
	There will be duplication and overlap between federal and 
provincial governments, and, as I was saying, they are creating 
more and more problems here with yet another example of 
duplication and overlap between departments.
<P>
	In no case does the bill require the department to agree with 
other federal departments or with the provinces in this process. The 
minister is not required to agree with his ministerial colleagues or 
with the provinces. He has a free hand. He can do as he pleases. It is 
one hell of a situation. It makes no sense. Liberal members are 
going to have to tone down their enthusiasm and bring their 
minister, who is about to do something that will probably cost a lot 
of money, back into line. If he is allowed to go his own way, it will 
be a major disaster.
<P>
	That the minister is not required to work in co-operation with 
environment officials in particular and with other departments in 
general is inconsistent and unacceptable. At a time when positions 
are being cut and the government is supposed to be cutting its 
spending, the Department of Fisheries and Oceans is creating 
duplication within the federal government. That was what I was 
explaining.
<P>
	Of course, we want to bring down the deficit and that is why the 
Liberals were elected, but they should not bring it down at the 
expense of the most disadvantaged, or by creating a disguised tax, 
or by going after the very tools workers need by imposing 
additional fees on their boats. After they are registered, it is almost 
certain that there will be no way to keep track, and if so, how much 
will it cost?
<P>
	In theory, the Department of the Environment will be 
responsible for administering this additional jurisdiction, with the 
co-operation of each of the departments concerned. As I was 
saying, the minister would do well to consult each of the 
departments.
<P>
	There is now considerable overlap and duplication in federal and 
provincial environment regulations. Private enterprise is therefore 
very often forced to spend time, money and energy obtaining 
information on the numerous government programs; providing the 
two levels of government with the required information and data; 
sitting on the many advisory committees and sub-committees 
responsible for regulating industry; preparing for inspections 
conducted by the federal and provincial governments; and, finally, 
meeting the requirements of both levels of government.
<P>
	In this regard, the toxic waste regulations are a convincing 
example. At this time, eight federal regulations overlap similar 
regulations that exist in Quebec. Let us take, for example, the 
storage of PCB material regulations and the pulp and paper effluent  
regulations. Quebec sovereignty would have resolved all this by 
eliminating overlap and duplication.
<P>
	I am certain that each of the provinces, and certainly Quebec, has 
regulations concerning bodies of water, as do municipalities and 
<P>
RCMs. There are provincial and municipal committees on the 
environment. Each of the municipalities and RCMs has green 
plans.
<P>
	When the minister says he will impose fees on pleasure craft, it 
gets to where I wonder whether the minister will not start tattooing 
registration numbers on the back or leg of anyone swimming across 
Lac Saint-Jean next year.
<P>
	I will be one of the members of the Bloc Quebecois voting 
against Bill C-26. I could have said a lot more, for it is truly a 
scandalous bill.
<P>
<B>(1715)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. 
member for his intervention. I would like to pose some questions 
that might accelerate our proceeding to the conclusion of the 
debate.
<P>
	Would he recognize that it is a matter of high urgency to 
establish a jurisdictional base in Canadian law against predatory 
foreign interests in our contiguous zone and our exclusive 
economic zone, and that these interests are so far only protected 
under international law and pending ratification of the law of the 
sea convention, customary international law and bilateral treaties? 
Would he concede this urgency?
<P>
	In so far as there may exist in his view difficulties in 
co-operation between the provincial government-in this case I 
believe he was speaking of Quebec-and the federal government, 
would he be prepared to study the recent memorandum of 
understanding between the Government of British Columbia and 
the federal government? It is directed to a cognate problem under 
the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Fisheries and Ocean's coastal 
communities where co-operative federalism is being achieved 
without the necessity of a constitutional amendment, which we 
recognize under chapter five of the 1982 act is almost impossible to 
achieve.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Asselin:</B> Mr. Speaker, there is a problem when one reads 
Bill C-26. How could the federal government be concerned about 
the area you just mentioned, when it has no regard for its partners, 
the provinces? You should start by paying attention to these 
partners, the provinces which are going to help you manage and 
plan this bill you are getting ready to enact.
<P>
	I believe that the government's strategy is first and foremost to 
set fees. Let us be honest. It is money you are after, not foreign 
products. You are not interested in knowing what is going to 
happen and how. It is money you need. And you are going to do it 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5190"> 5190 </A></B>
<P>
under the guise of safety. You are going to set fees, claiming they 
are needed for safety and protection.
<P>
	I believe that if we removed the fees, and kept only the elements 
related to safety and protection, the minister would not be 
interested in having this piece of legislation passed. He is only 
interested in money. He is even putting a tax on small sail boats, 
windsurfers, pedal boats, etc. It is obvious he is grabbing whatever 
he can.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Colleagues, I would ask you to address 
your remarks to the Chair. Thank you.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, first of all, I wish 
to congratulate my colleague from Charlevoix for his presentation. 
I have a question for him that concerns the environment.
<P>
	If I may, I would first like to respond to the parliamentary 
secretary's question and set the record straight for the members 
who are here tonight-I am concerned about fisheries while my 
colleague was more interested in the environmental aspects-as 
well as the people watching us on television.
<P>
	The question of my hon. colleague from B.C. is as follows: Do 
you want us to pass this bill because it is the only way to protect our 
marine environment, our waters from the whole world?
<P>
	I simply want to inform this House and the parliamentary 
secretary that part I of this bill canadianizes the terminology used 
in the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. How can we provide a 
little more protection for our waters? Do we want international 
recognition?
<P>
	We simply grab a pen, go to the UN and sign the Convention on 
the Law of the Sea. That is how it will be done, not by signing this 
here in Ottawa. Even fisheries and oceans officials said that part I 
of the bill was not needed. This goes without saying.
<P>
<B>(1720)</B>
<P>
	Having said that, I took notes during my colleague from 
Charlevoix's speech, and I noticed that, as assistant to the official 
opposition critic on the environment, he paid attention to the 
measures the government is about to take.
<P>
	My colleague pointed out the communications links provided 
between some government departments like justice or the solicitor 
general and fisheries and oceans for enforcing certain regulations.
<P>
	My hon. colleague surely noticed that Bill C-26 makes no 
mention of the relationship between Environment Canada and the 
Department of Fisheries and Oceans, and I should remind this 
House that, when this bill was drafted, the two ministers 
responsible were the current Deputy Prime Minister and Brian 
Tobin. Mr. Tobin himself told a committee that these two 
departments or individuals were the yin and the yang.
<P>
	So here is my question, which I think he also mentioned: In the 
absence of duly written rights, does my colleague expect some 
duplication-as I understood from his speech-between the two 
federal ministers?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Asselin: </B>Mr. Speaker, in reply to the allegation of the 
member for Gaspé, who is parliamentary critic for fisheries, I think 
there will be more than one duplication. Let us take an example. 
Quebec is already involved in the environmental area. Ottawa, 
through Environment Canada, is trying to legislate in that same 
area. Already you have a duplication there.
<P>
	Besides that, we will create duplication within departments. The 
environment minister will have no power whatsoever because, 
apparently, the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans will have the 
ability to legislate without consulting the Minister of the 
Environment.
<P>
	The minister will have the freedom to have Bill C-26 pass and 
implement it as he pleases, provided Fisheries and Oceans is 
responsible for the plant life and the wildlife; in other words, he 
will be able to interfere in areas governed by Environment Canada, 
without consulting that department. Afterwards, Environment 
Canada will try to act also, because public servants in that 
department will want to save their jobs.
<P>
	But the environment minister will also want to protect his job. 
Somewhere along the road there will be frustrations and bickering. 
When they come out of the cabinet meetings, there will be 
quarrelling, because the environment minister will feel powerless 
since the fisheries and oceans minister will be doing his job. It 
makes no sense.
<P>
	Again, I think this goes far beyond duplication and overlap, it 
means people are looking for something to do and that means real 
waste. We are wasting our energies trying to invent something that 
already exists internally.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harold Culbert (Carleton-Charlotte, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise to take part in the debate on the Canada Oceans Act.
<P>
	Canada is by any global standard a maritime nation. It is a nation 
with unique, vast and diverse ocean resources. Geographically 
Canada has the longest salt water coastline of any nation in the 
world and the longest archipelago. With the declaration of an 
exclusive economic zone, Canada's ocean territory will be the 
equivalent of one-half of its land territory. Canada truly is a water 
world.
<P>
	With these three distinct ocean environments, the Atlantic, the 
Arctic and the Pacific, Canadian coastlines represent the most 
fascinating ecosystem diversity on earth. Canada is never very far 
from its oceans. For this reason Canada must place ocean 
management very high on its list of priorities.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5191"> 5191 </A></B>
<P>
	Eight provinces and both territories possess salt water 
coastlines, as does my constituency of Carleton-Charlotte 
located on the Bay of Fundy in New Brunswick. 
Carleton-Charlotte represents diversity in its many industries: 
agriculture, forestry, manufacturing and processing, fishing and 
aquaculture to name a few. This diversity exemplifies the 
economic and long term sustainable benefits of our natural 
resources base and the urgent need to conserve them. The oceans 
act is a fundamental building block of natural resources 
management, the area where Canada has and will continue to be 
a leader.
<P>
<B>(1725)</B>
<P>
	The global environment behaves as an umbrella, an end and 
constantly changing result of its primary components, the natural 
resources. Environmentally, the influence of the oceans on the 
Canadian climate is felt by all parts of the country. Hudson Bay 
acts as a great temperature moderator to central Canada. The bay 
brings cool nights to temper the hot summer prairie days. The 
resulting climate has given Canada the most productive agriculture 
region in the world.
<P>
	On the east coast the cold Atlantic mixes with the warm gulf 
stream to create the wonderful variable climate that has shaped a 
coastline of unsurpassed beauty. Tourists from all over the world 
come to admire the marvellous ocean scenery and the world's 
highest tides found along the Bay of Fundy coast in 
Carleton-Charlotte.
<P>
	Culturally, the oceans have contributed to the tradition and 
character of the Canadian fabric. From the earliest records of 
aboriginal settlements to the arrival of the first Europeans, the 
oceans have been a stage on which Canadian history has been 
played.
<P>
	It was the glowing reports of the bountiful oceans and the quest 
for the promised ocean route to the Orient that accelerated the pace 
of development. The Europeans prized the fish, whale and seals 
they found in the Canadian Atlantic as much as they prized the gold 
and silver of Mexico and the spices and silks of the West Indies.
<P>
	The oceans continue to be stamped indelibly on our culture and 
social consciousness. Each year Canadians everywhere make their 
annual pilgrimage to the seashore. The ocean literature and art by 
numerous Canadian authors and artists such as Farley Mowat, 
Emily Carr and David Blackwood are indeed cherished classics.
<P>
	Economically, Canada's ocean fisheries have suffered setbacks 
in recent years with the collapse of the groundfish industry in the 
east, directly affecting my constituency of Carleton-Charlotte, 
and the reduction of salmon catches on the west coast. However, 
there is much opportunity and promise in new technologies and 
new ocean ventures. The conservation initiatives have provided for 
optimistic futures.
<P>
	Canada's aquaculture industry continues to grow as an 
international industry. The aquaculture industry is predicted to 
generate over $1 billion in sales, including some $500 million in 
export sales by the year 2000.
<P>
	The finest restaurants in the world serve seafood grown in 
Canada. The Bay of Fundy Salmon Marketing Institute, a 
subsidiary of the New Brunswick Salmon Growers Association, 
has recently launched its certified quality Bay of Fundy salmon. 
The program has been implemented to ensure quality standards in 
all 13 of its processing plants. These salmon must pass some 30 
quality standards to gain certified quality designation. Watch for 
the blue and gold logo on the gill tag and sticker, guaranteeing a 
quality product.
<P>
	The Centre for Cold Ocean Resources Engineering, C-CORE, at 
Memorial University in Newfoundland is increasing its 
international component each year. Its international component is 
projected to be 50 per cent of its total projects within the next five 
years. At least a dozen Newfoundland high technology companies 
can trace their roots to C-CORE and many professionals who 
previously gained experience in the entrepreneurial driving forces 
in new businesses in all regions of Canada.
<P>
<B>(1730)</B>
<P>
	On the west coast a group of ocean entrepreneurs from all sectors 
have created a consortium, the Canadian ocean frontiers research 
initiative, to research and develop ocean technology projects in the 
specific exclusive economic zone. Marine transportation is vitally 
important to Canada's economic well-being. The marine sector 
handles 40 per cent of the freight shipped each year, a good chunk 
of the exports we sell. It generates over $2.5 billion in revenue 
annually and directly employs some 47,000 Canadians.
<P>
	Examples of innovations such as this will build Canada's future, 
and the oceans are the medium of opportunity. The Canada oceans 
act will ensure that we continue to look to the oceans as a source of 
economic wealth both in the traditional ways and in new ways. 
Innovation opens new opportunities for ocean resources.
<P>
	Our oceans are a source of great pride to me and to the members 
of the government. Now Canadians will have an opportunity to 
share this pride through their involvement in the oceans 
management strategy contained in part II of this bill. To develop 
the oceans management strategy we will be talking with Canadians 
and we will be learning from each other about our great ocean 
territory. These discussions will serve a number of purposes. They 
will create a framework for the oceans of the future. They will 
articulate what our oceans mean to our national dream. They will 
raise awareness of what oceans have meant to the cultural history 
of this great nation of ours. Canadians will decide.
<P>
	Ocean awareness will ensure that Canadians will make the right 
management decisions. Awareness creates understanding and
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5192"> 5192 </A></B>
<P>
understanding prompts stewardship. We have much to do to 
generate awareness, but there have been some good starts.
<P>
	Cultural, heritage and conservation groups from across Canada 
have documented the influence and impact of the oceans on local 
history. The New Brunswick Conservation Council's <I>Voices of the 
Bay</I> tells us a history of the Bay of Fundy from the perspective of 
those who have lived on its tides. The Western Education 
Development Group's <I>The Beach Book</I> provides us with a glimpse 
of sea life on the Pacific.
<P>
	Educational material that creates ocean awareness has been 
developed by organizations such as the Vancouver Aquarium, the 
Huntsman Marine Science Institute and the Canadian Wildlife 
Federation. Students all over Canada benefit from the material 
distributed to them by these organizations.
<P>
	The oceans are an important subject to students. The planet earth 
is somewhat misnamed, as over 70 per cent of it is covered by 
oceans. Politically it is fairly simple to create boundaries on dry 
land, but global oceans defy political boundary. The oceans tie the 
fate of each nation to a common global fate. Stewardship of the 
ocean is at one time a regional, a national and an international 
responsibility. What better way to ensure sound stewardship in the 
future than to educate those future stewards today.
<P>
	For Canadians our ocean geography is particularly unique.
<P>
<B>(1735 )</B>
<P>
	No other country in the world can claim to include three distinct 
ocean ecosystems within its exclusive economic zone. The Arctic, 
the Atlantic and the Pacific are as unique and different in climate 
and life form as are the prairies, the Canadian shield and the tundra.
<P>
	I look forward to the day when classrooms across Canada will be 
filled with ocean projects, students tracking icebergs and salmon, 
drawing the paths of circumpolar pollution and measuring the high 
tides of the Bay of Fundy. I look forward to the day when we 
describe the Canadian landscape with ocean references as well as 
with land references.
<P>
	I want Canadian school children to be able to point out the Grand 
Banks and the archipelago on a map as easily as they can find the 
Rockies in the west or the Appalachian Mountains in the east.
<P>
	I would certainly urge all of my colleagues in the House in join 
me in voting in favour of this legislation, not because of the 
importance of the legislation but because of the importance of the 
oceans to all Canadians.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I must say I am a 
little stunned. What I would like to hear from the hon. member 
relates to two issues.
<P>
	Why could Canadian students not study Canada's marine 
geography before the introduction of Bill C-26, the legislation on 
ocean management? I think the main thrust of Bill C-26 is to define 
the management strategy. What is important in a so-called national 
strategy are the partners who will support this strategy.
<P>
	I know the hon. member, but I do not remember whether he is in 
his first or second term. By the way he answers-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member: </B>It is his last.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier (Gaspé): </B>Someone says it is his last, but we will 
see at the next election.
<P>
	I would like the hon. member to tell me, in order to protect 
ourselves from the risk of a change of government-I know some 
will work very hard for a change of government, as there may be 
also changes in provincial government-is it not appropriate at this 
stage to properly define the rights and powers of the provinces and 
the federal government on this management issue, so that we do not 
revive the squabbles of the past?
<P>
	When people leave, if things are ill defined, the imbroglio starts 
again. We only have to remember the time where Brian Peckford 
was the Liberal premier of Newfoundland, and we had a 
Conservative Prime Minister in the House. They were like cats and 
dogs. At that time, Newfoundland could not make itself heard on 
the status of conservation of the resource that was at its door.
<P>
	If these rights and powers are well specified now, we will indeed 
solve these problems and, no matter what parties are elected, those 
who follow will know what to do. In that sense, history will show 
Canadian students that the hon. member is greatly in favour of 
education. They will remember that the people who were here 
during the 35th Parliament took action to ensure there a well 
preserved resource will remain.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Culbert:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague for his 
question and his points of concern.
<P>
	Obviously we must encourage and develop our students in the 
future to have access to more information on our oceans because 
they are, as I said in my speech, going to be the stewards in future 
years both environmentally for our oceans and all other 
components on this earth.
<P>
	Yes, the bill does acknowledge partnerships with various groups 
and organizations, be they provinces of this great country that 
border on our ocean territories, be they fishing communities or 
environmental organizations. That is what it is all about. It is 
listening to one another. What works in one area quite frankly may 
not work in another area.

<P>
	<B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in his 
intervention my friend, the hon. member from the Gaspé, noted the 
crux of Bill C-26 was to define management strategies for the 
oceans act. When the bill was before committee the main Inuit 
organization in the Nunavut territory advised the committee that 
certain sections of the bill were ultra vires given the Nunavut land 
claims agreement.
<P>
	The organization suggested the bill be amended to acknowledge 
that the governor in council could not make regulations under the 
act unless they were approved by the Nunavut land claims 
authority.
<P>
	Given that the response of the government was to acknowledge 
that federal authority in Arctic waters is limited by the land claims 
agreement, what guarantees can the member for 
Carleton-Charlotte give the people of Canada that their interests 
in the Arctic will be protected by this bill?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Culbert:</B> Mr. Speaker, the bill provides the framework to 
discuss with groups in the Arctic, groups in the Atlantic, groups in 
the Pacific the future and the stewardship of oceans. With reference 
to the Arctic Ocean, our future there and the various interventions 
that may have been made in the past or may be made in the future, 
this is extremely important.
<P>
	That is why consultation is so important. That is what the bill is 
all about. It provides that opportunity for consultation in the future.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened to the member's comments. I want to ask the 
hon. member the same question I asked one of his colleagues 
earlier for which I did not get an answer whatsoever.
<P>
	When this bill was before the House at report stage, the Reform 
Party put forward seven specific amendments to better the bill. The 
thrust of what we were trying to accomplish with those 
amendments was to make the point that we feel it is crucial that any 
and all fees are implemented only after a full socioeconomic 
impact analysis has been carried out, that they reflect the level and 
cost of the specific service and are discussed and implemented in a 
fully transparent manner with fully ongoing consultation with 
affected resource users.
<P>
	The hon. member mentioned the importance of consultation and 
that this bill will allow that. Why then would the hon. member's 
party vote against those amendments?
<P>
	I asked this question of one of his colleagues earlier and I did not 
get an answer. I would ask how this member voted and if he knows 
why his party voted against those amendments which would allow 
for that consultation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Culbert:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not have before me a copy of the 
amendments the member spoke of. I can certainly guess that 
judging from the past they were not seen to be complementary in 
improving the bill. That is why they were turned down and not 
supported in that case.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réjean Lefebvre (Champlain, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, before 
speaking on Bill C-26, I would like to congratulate the hon. 
member for Gaspé on the excellent job he is doing on this issue.
<P>
	I am pleased to rise in this House to speak on Bill C-26, an act 
respecting the oceans of Canada. The bill is based essentially on 
three parts: first, the recognition of Canada's jurisdiction over its 
ocean areas; second, a legislative framework for a national oceans 
management strategy; and third, the granting of powers to the 
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, including the power to fix fees, 
power over marine sciences and, of course, power over the coast 
guard.
<P>
<B>(1745)</B>
<P>
	Bill C-26 is a perfect example of how little respect the federal 
government has for the provinces. The Minister of Fisheries and 
Oceans is set to unilaterally impose a fee structure on the marine 
industry for the services provided by the coast guard, particularly 
navigational aids and icebreaking.
<P>
	Not only does it impose a fee structure that is far from equitable, 
but Bill C-26 also encroaches upon provincial jurisdiction, which it 
totally ignores, granting the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans the 
power to act without first obtaining the consent of the provincial 
governments concerned.
<P>
	The minister uses Bill C-26 as an excuse to legislate in areas that 
currently fall under provincial jurisdiction or in a grey area. It is 
clear that the minister is taking this opportunity to settle the 
situation in his favour by taking over areas where he would like to 
act alone. The most blatant evidence of this is the fact that the 
provinces were barely considered in the process.
<P>
	The tactic is simple: the provinces are led to believe that 
consultations are being carried out in good faith, but the 
government then acts according to plan, without making any 
changes.
<P>
	We now see the result. While the bill is not yet in force, the 
Canadian coast guard has already started charging the shipping 
industry for its services. It should be the other way around. The 
mess the minister will be plunging the shipping industry and the 
pleasure craft industry into will come as a surprise to no one.
<P>
	Just look at the provisions of Bill C-26 and you will understand 
the meaning of chaos, a real mess.
<P>
	I will now look at part I of Bill C-26 entitled ``Canada's 
maritime zones''. This part refers to the  rights the government 
wishes to legislate. Since the law of the sea is covered under an 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5194"> 5194 </A></B>
<P>
international convention, jurisdiction over maritime zones is 
established accordingly.
<P>
	This legislation is so much wishful thinking and fine principles. 
The problem is that the provincial jurisdiction over maritime zones 
is being totally ignored. Worse still, the government is using the 
preamble of Bill C-26 to claim sovereign rights over this 
jurisdiction. Bloc Quebecois members are not fooled by these 
tactics, and neither are the provinces.
<P>
	Part II of Bill C-26 sets out the legislative framework for the 
establishment of a national oceans management strategy. As I said 
before, the government is trying to assume new powers by taking 
advantage of existing grey areas. The result is an inappropriate 
legislative framework and persisting doubts over federal 
responsibilities as far as oceans management is concerned.
<P>
	This vague legislative framework is deliberate and suggests that 
the minister intends to interfere in areas which should come under 
provincial jurisdiction. As an example, Bill C-26 refers to 
provincial ministers as mere associates. It goes even further, and 
places interested persons and bodies on the same level.
<P>
	The main element of this part of the legislation is without any 
doubt the environment to which it refers. Indeed, Bill C-26 gives 
the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans environmental powers which 
already belong to the Department of the Environment.
<P>
	It is as though a sectoral environment department was being 
established within the Department of Fisheries and Oceans, a 
coastal environment department. Why not abolish the existing 
environment department and transfer the responsibility for 
environment protection and conservation to all the departments? 
This would make it a total mess.
<P>
	Seriously, we know that the tendency in the environment sector 
is to centralize powers in Ottawa. With Bill C-26, and supposedly 
because of the national interest, as defined in the Constitution, and 
the global nature of environmental problems, the fisheries and 
oceans minister will assume all the powers, including some which 
are not his relating to the environment.
<P>
<B>(1750)</B>
<P>
	The best example of this is the definition of ``sustainable 
development'', which is found in the bill instead of in the Canadian 
Environmental Protection Act.
<P>
	The fisheries and oceans minister will also have the right to 
develop and to implement a national strategy for the management 
of estuarine, coastal and marine ecosystems. In order to achieve all 
this, officials will first have to set up activity management plans, 
establish management and consultation organizations, develop 
multiple programs and environmental standards, as well as collect 
and analyze scientific data on these ecosystems.
<P>
	All this implies that the fisheries and oceans minister will turn 
his department into a perfect model of duplication and waste of 
public moneys, since it will get involved in all these activities 
which, incidentally, are already being conducted by Environment 
Canada or the provinces. Since the minister will be under no 
obligation to work in co-operation with officials from the 
environment department or any other department, let alone with the 
provinces, it should come as no surprise that the marine sector 
cannot understand what is going on. All this is unacceptable.
<P>
	Part III of Bill C-26 gives the minister powers regarding fees, 
marine sciences and the coast guard. It is to be noted that, while the 
bill has not been passed yet, the minister has already implemented 
the first stage of the fee structure for navigation aids, which will 
bring in $20 million. Indeed, companies were billed during the 
summer, even though the impact study on such fees will only be 
completed in November. Anyway, we already know what the 
results will be: the fees will have a devastating impact on the job 
situation in the marine sector in Canada and in Quebec.
<P>
	Also, the whole fee policy is unfair. The minister is using the 
user fee principle to justify the regional rates, which give him the 
opportunity, for instance, to help out his native province of 
Newfoundland by granting considerable reductions, which the 
regions of the St. Lawrence and the Great Lakes will have to make 
up for.
<P>
	We already know that these fees will greatly undermine the 
competitiveness of the ports in the St. Lawrence and the Great 
Lakes areas. The minister also intends to implement charges for 
dredging ports and the St. Lawrence seaway as well as for ice 
breaking along waterways. These measures are putting the ports of 
Montreal, Trois-Rivières, Matane and Rimouski in jeopardy, and 
that is unacceptable.
<P>
	Bill C-26 undermines the power of the provinces by granting the 
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans exclusive powers over the 
maritime areas, all in the so-called best interests of the country. 
The government will only succeed in creating a total administrative 
mess and costly duplication by setting up an unfair fee schedule 
and by granting the Department of Fisheries and Oceans powers in 
environmental matters, which are already dealt with by the 
Minister of Environment.
<P>
	The proposed measures in Bill C-26 are a threat to the marine 
sector and this is unacceptable, since the current economic 
situation requires rational and stimulating action to help create and 
develop jobs.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Okanagan Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, a 
series of speakers this afternoon have given us  science lessons on 
the value of the oceans, on the beauty of the oceans and of its 
inspirational value to various artists. We have now heard about the 
duplication of federal jurisdiction over provincial jurisdiction. 
There have been accusations of intrusion into the provincial 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5195"> 5195 </A></B>
<P>
jurisdiction by the federal minister. And all this is subsumed under 
the bill presently before the House.
<P>
	We have had all these pontifications about the science, the 
research and the development, the high tech science and 
technology that will be developed because of the ocean since after 
all it gave rise to the explorers from across the world, and this is 
what built Canada. The oceans apparently are the source of 
everything good and wonderful that has ever happened to this 
country. If it is so important, why is it that this bill is silent?
<P>
<B>(1755)</B>
<P>
	Could the hon. member tell us whether he has done any research 
into the area of the ocean management strategy and the Advisory 
Council on Science and Technology that is being outlined here? 
Exactly how is this going to fit in with a further development of 
science and the culture of science in the Canadian student body and 
the young people that are going to find jobs in the research and 
development of oceans in this Canada of ours?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lefebvre:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to indicate to my colleague 
that I am not a member of the government. It is not up to me to find 
out all the answers. We are here in fact to protect the interests of the 
taxpayers. We can see today that duplication among departments 
really exists, even among federal departments.
<P>
	Moreover, this infringes on the provincial jurisdiction over lakes 
and rivers. As you know, we have many outfitters in my riding of 
Champlain. We even have a lake and forest fair. My colleague 
mentioned earlier the issue of student jobs. Where my riding, 
which is so rich in lakes and rivers, will be hurt is in its outfitters 
and fairs. That is why I want to stress the fact that my riding's 
outfitters and fairs will be ruined.
<P>
	This is where the student jobs come from. And now, the whole 
economy of the tourism industry will be destabilized.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
congratulate my colleague from Champlain for the speech he just 
made on Bill C-26. He made a good analysis of this bill, dealing 
with each of its three parts separately. I took note of his remarks.
<P>
	But before commenting on the speech made by the member for 
Champlain, I would also like to mention that the Reform member's 
question was very appropriate. It is true that my colleague, being an 
opposition member, does not have to prove the merits of this bill. It 
is also unfortunate that we do no Liberal member has risen in  this 
House and said: ``Yes, we are eager to get rid of this bill because we 
have other bills to study which will create jobs''. In this sense, the 
Reform member was right to raise this question.
<P>
	I would now like to come back to the speech made by my 
colleague from Champlain. In the first part of his remarks, he 
mentioned that Canada was using the preamble to this bill to 
proclaim its sovereignty over its waters. This will not increase, and 
I am sure my colleague will confirm it, the quantity of fish in these 
waters.
<P>
	I would like to add to the member's remarks that it is funny to 
hear that from the Liberals. When we say the word ``sovereignty'', 
they think it necessarily means separation. Should we expect a 
declaration of separation of Canada from the rest of the world? I do 
not think so. I take this opportunity, since the Liberals now use the 
word ``sovereignty'' in its true sense, to do a bit of teaching. 
Sovereignty means being able to enjoy the rights you are entitled to 
within your own territory. In a sense, that is what we mean in 
Quebec when we talk about sovereignty.
<P>
	I noted that my colleague mentioned that there is no distinction 
between the rights of the Department of Environment and the 
Department of Fisheries and Oceans. It is a complete mess. The 
former fisheries minister has already admitted in committee that 
the two departments had become the Yin and the Yang. Once again, 
good marks for the member for Champlain who has understood 
everything.
<P>
<B>(1800)</B>
<P>
	The other point he raised deals with the power of the minister to 
set fees, and many other colleagues of mine will also raise that 
point. Without having those regulatory powers yet, the minister has 
already grabbed 20 millions dollars from the marine industry for 
aids to navigation.
<P>
	Last summer, during consultations over the issue of pleasure 
craft, they tried to get an additional $14 million. But because of our 
protest, and my colleague from Champlain had already begun to 
raise the issue in his own riding, people came in great number to 
those consultation hearings and the Canadian Coast Guard had to 
back down.
<P>
	Imagine if the power to set fees had already been in place 
without the transparency process necessary to guaranty efficient 
services!
<P>
	When the Coast Guard provides services those services must be 
efficient. Secondly, there has to be transparency in the 
establishment of fees. Like myself, numerous other members are 
wondering how we will improve security by requiring recreational 
boaters to pay five dollars or even 35 dollars to register their craft. 
That does not make any sense.
<P>
	So I would ask my colleague to tell me if he believes that, in the 
riding of Champlain, thanks to this new  legislation and the powers 
it provides, because it seems that the power to set fees is the only 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5196"> 5196 </A></B>
<P>
thing that interests the minister, safety on the lakes will be 
improved be requiring fee of $ 35 on a pedal boat, for example.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lefebvre:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for Gaspé for 
his question. Concerning the fees, we are now visiting our 
constituents in our ridings and we hear a lot of complaints.
<P>
	As I said, these fees will ruin outfitting operations and fairs in 
our ridings, where there are lakes. In Sainte-Thècle, where the lake 
and forest fair takes place, these fees will reduce the flow of 
visitors in the nearby communities, affecting the tourism and 
fishing industries, as well as river canoeing and kayaking. If these 
municipalities must pay for the lake activities or infrastructures, I 
think we will see student summer jobs disappear, and this is really 
too bad. Summer jobs for students as well as every other paying job 
in our municipalities would be affected.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
extremely pleased to speak again on this bill, which has been 
around since last spring. I do so as the member for Trois-Rivières, a 
port city, and as the critic for regional development. I can tell you 
that regional development gets it in the neck with this bill. I do so 
also as an associate member of the Standing Committee on 
Fisheries and Oceans, on which I have the privilege to sit and 
where I heard the complaints, claims and concerns of users, 
particularly of the St. Lawrence River and the seaway. They came 
to try to change the government's mind about this bill.
<P>
	It seems to me that the federal government has for a long time 
been considering imposing fees on users of Canada's ports in 
general and of the St. Lawrence River in particular.
<P>
	In fact, a few months ago, the government commissioned a study 
entitled IBI, pretending-according to the witnesses-to ask the 
users of St. Lawrence ports and of major Canadian port facilities 
for their opinion. These studies have been described as a farce, 
phoney consultation, pseudo-consultation and-to use the words of 
one witness-a study which is not worth the paper it is written on.
<P>
<B>(1805)</B>
<P>
	This gives you some idea of how well the users agree on this. 
The key concept in the government's intentions is user pay. 
Hearing witnesses such as these shows us just what collaboration 
there is between the two parties.
<P>
	Clearly, the government has only one real objective: by the year 
2000, to extract the tidy sum of $100 million from the pockets of 
the users, the ship owners who use Canada's port facilities. This 
amount will be recovered in three stages. The first involves 
navigational aids, and that is the one that is involved at the 
moment. The second, coming this fall, involves ice breaking, that 
is the use of  icebreaking vessels, particularly in eastern Canada, on 
the St. Lawrence. The third will involve dredging the channel itself 
and whatever passages between the channel and the ports need 
dredging.
<P>
	We have seen a great deal of arrogance, a great deal of 
arbitrariness, a great many decisions not necessarily based on true 
reflection and consultation. I would say that the Department of 
Fisheries and Oceans behaved badly in this connection. Not only 
did it not succeed in convincing the stakeholders that its position 
was justified, it did not even try.
<P>
	It carried out no impact studies on the effect of charging user 
fees in future for services currently offered free of charge in the 
public interest. I must point out that some witnesses spoke of the 
devastating effects on the St. Lawrence and Great Lake ports' 
ability to compete with the American eastern seaboard, with 
Halifax-in the case of Montreal)-and even with ports along the 
Mississippi in the U.S.
<P>
	There has been no impact study demonstrating the risks or 
benefits of charging fees. There may be long term benefits, but 
there do not appear to be any short term ones. No one even took the 
trouble to see what the effects would be.
<P>
	There was no obligation felt to describe the services actually 
provided by the coast guard to these users, in order to convince 
users of the need to charge fees. All that was said was that the coast 
guard does this, that, or the other thing, in this or that part of 
Canada, and that starting on such and such a date, users will have to 
pay for unspecified services rendered.
<P>
	Contrary to what was immediately requested by users, those who 
deal with the coast guard, there has been no effort on the part of the 
coast guard to systematically reduce costs and make this fee setting 
scheme more palatable, potentially more acceptable. If at least it 
could be said that the coast guard has made an effort, has been 
trying to do its part to reduce the deficit by collecting $180 million, 
has reduced its costs by X million of dollars, we would agree to 
join in. In no way has the coast guard tried to show its good faith or 
streamline its operations.
<P>
	This is serious. But beyond the words, the speeches condemning 
this, there will be dire consequences. We have heard some 
troubling facts. I will give you a few examples. According to some 
users, and not the least of them, if I recall SODES made the 
following point.
<P>
	SODES is made up of all the major users, namely the Canadian 
aluminum industry, the pulp and paper industry, the forest industry, 
the mining industry, the oil industry, everybody including St. 
Lawrence Cement, Irving Oil-that belongs to a famous 
family-and a lot of important people. Even the Canadian 
government, mainly through Industry Canada, belongs to this 
group. SODES 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5197"> 5197 </A></B>
<P>
found that this will result in an increase of one dollar a tonne for 
services on the St. Lawrence.
<P>
<B>(1810)</B>
<P>
	The coast guard said that it was not one dollar, but rather 10 
cents a tonne. If SODES is right, one dollar a tonne would be a 
disaster in terms of international competition. SODES must be 
wrong, because if it is not, one cannot help thinking this is a 
machiavellian plot to weaken the Quebec economy, and it might 
very well be. As a matter of fact, it is an issue which would deserve 
more in-depth scrutiny because if it were to result in a one dollar a 
tonne increase, this would mean that the cost of services currently 
provided would double.
<P>
	Another troubling fact concerns the way the fees were set, given 
the competition between the various ports in eastern Canada. You 
must know that Montreal is a destination for container carriers 
whereas Halifax, a direct competitor of Montreal, is a port of call.
<P>
	They had a choice between two ways of setting fees. One is 
based on the actual size of the ships. A 30,000 tonne ship is always 
a 30,000 tonne ship whether it is at sea or in port, whether it is full 
or empty. According to this method, there is an objective fee 
applicable to all ships and the price is always the same, since it is 
based on the size of the ship.
<P>
	The other method, which is also used, is based on the volume of 
cargo unloaded at a port of call. As we said, Montreal is a 
destination and Halifax is a port of call. What method do you think 
the coast guard chose? One discriminates in favour of Halifax and 
the other one would set all ports on an equal footing. What method 
was chosen? The one discriminating in favour of Halifax, of 
course.
<P>
	So all those containers unloaded in Halifax are taken into 
account when the fees are set. A more objective method could have 
been used, one that would have pleased all those people using the 
St. Lawrence and, I am sure you have guessed it also, that would 
have been a great help to Montreal's economy which in any case is 
flourishing because of the constant help it receives from the federal 
government, which of course decided a long time ago to appoint a 
minister responsible for the Montreal area, as Quebec did.
<P>
	There is another element of some concern in the way these fees 
will be implemented. While we rely on a principle called ``coast to 
coast pricing''-that is to say a fee structure applicable from one 
end of Canada to the other-the need to reduce the deficit, the 
mood of the time, the decision to impose a fee, all of Canadian 
from coast to coast to that point, except that for obscure reasons, it 
has been decided that Canada should be divided in three large 
regions: the West, central Canada-that is Quebec, Ontario, the 
Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence-and the East. We then have 
three large regions with, as you might have thought, different fees.  
We have three distinct societies each with its own fee structures for 
basically the same services.
<P>
	An analysis has been done for Quebec, and the proposed fees, 
just for aids to navigation, will have ``potentially devastating 
consequences'', to use the expression of one of the witnesses. For a 
25,000 tonne ship using the St. Lawrence Seaway and aids to 
navigation, the $112,000 will be per year. Can you imagine, when 
you have a fleet of 25,000 tonne ships how much more this will 
cost for aids to navigation only.
<P>
	Therefore, when we talk about devastating effects, this 
government will never be able to claim that it did not know, it will 
never be able to say that the opposition did not do its job of raising 
awareness. We are warning the public that what is going on right 
now is of immeasurable proportion and will have devastating mid- 
and long-term effects.
<P>
<B>(1815)</B>
<P>
	This may seem comical, but we are talking about $112,000 each 
year for a ship that sails on the St. Lawrence, that goes to Montreal, 
for example, that uses a port on the St. Lawrence. The ship that 
sails on the St. Lawrence and goes directly to the United States 
without stopping in any Canadian port does not have to pay 
anything.
<P>
	It will use navigational aids, ice breakers and so on. Until further 
notice, it does not have to pay a cent. It goes through Quebec and 
Canada and directly to the United States, and it pays not a cent. If 
there is any logic in this, it is in Canada's heavy dependency on its 
dear American neighbours. There is no other explanation for it. 
How can such an anomaly be justified? No user fees are imposed. 
This will, as you also understood, greatly increase competition 
between American and Canadian ports. American ports will not be 
penalized in any way, while Canadian and Quebec ports will be hit 
directly.
<P>
	I would simply like to say, and I speak as the critic for regional 
development, we should be aware it is Quebec's regions that are 
affected. It is Sept-Îles and the area around it, Baie-Comeau, 
Port-Cartier, Quebec City, the Saguenay, Trois-Rivières-my 
region, Montreal, the south coast of Gaspé, Rimouski, Lauzon, 
Saint-Romuald, Sorel, the industrial park of Bécancour with its 
port in Quebec and, of course, Montreal. All these regions will be 
affected as 85 per cent of the Quebec population lives along the St. 
Lawrence. This bill and the proposed power to set fees would have 
a major impact on all the regions in Quebec.
<P>
	That is why the people must be alerted. The media must examine 
this issue. As was pointed out earlier, they in no way tried to find 
out how much it would cost us to collect this $20 million. If it cost 
25, 30, 40 or 100 million dollars, should we still go ahead with 
this? Could we not say, as we have always said, that we will make 
our services even more efficient so that foreign shipowners  want to 
come to Canada, to the St. Lawrence? We should pay attention to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5198"> 5198 </A></B>
<P>
how we can compete with U.S. and other foreign ports, especially 
that of Philadelphia, which is very aggressive and very well 
positioned to compete with Montreal.
<P>
	We should proceed very carefully in this area instead of barging 
in without any studies or analyses.
<P>
	The second part of this fee implementation policy, as you heard 
from my colleagues earlier, deals with recreational craft. 
Registration will now be compulsory and owners will have to pay 
between $5 and $35 depending on the kind of boat. The 
government says it will consult with people but all it does is ask for 
their opinion and then forget about it the next day as it imposes 
measures that have nothing to do with the main purpose of this bill. 
The government's big excuse is public safety. How can the 
government argue that having to pay $25 for a canoe or a 
pedal-boat will make the owner more careful?
<P>
	What is the relationship? The government's demonstration is 
flawed. In fact, having to pay a fee in no way guarantees that the 
owner will be more careful.
<P>
	As for the user pay principle, there is no evidence in this respect 
either since in Quebec the coast guard operates on the St. 
Lawrence, Saguenay, Richelieu and Ottawa rivers but the 
fees-which are in fact a hidden tax-will be paid by people who 
own pedal-boats on small lakes north of La Tuque or in the 
Laurentians, where the coast guard has no business. People will 
now have to pay for a license to own a canoe. This has nothing to 
do with the coast guard. Let us call a spade a spade. The 
government should at least have the decency, instead of talking 
about safety, to say that they need money, that the cutbacks are not 
enough.
<P>
<B>(1820)</B>
<P>
	They say that the Coast Guard has not been able to cut its 
services first, to rationalize its operations, and so once again they 
are dumping on the little guy, forgetting that ten horsepower 
engines have to be registered free of charge, neglecting to perhaps 
make them pay a bit more. Do you know what the rate is per foot 
for the luxury boats that use the locks here, not far from Parliament 
Hill? Do you know what it costs for a thirty foot boat? The charge 
is 50 cents a foot, 15 cents to open the locks, the staff required, the 
maintenance and so on. When you can afford that kind of a boat, 
you can afford all that goes with it and should not be asking those 
on welfare or unemployment or earning minimum wage, which is 
worse yet, to help you pay because 50 cents per feet is too high a 
fee. Why not charge the actual cost to these people so that they 
assume the full consequences of operating a boat that size.
<P>
	Another thing bothers me and that is, in its press release, the 
department's talk about the benefits of imposing fees on boats. My 
hon. colleague from  Bellechasse, who is a lawyer by profession, 
will understand what I mean. As a benefit of the fee structure, the 
department lists, and I quote: ``The establishment of a 
computerized system to store up-to-date information on boats 
allowing the organizations responsible for search and rescue 
operations and for implementing the act, to have quick access to 
reliable data, 24 hours a day. This system would greatly increase 
their effectiveness during investigations relating to theft and other 
offences, and to search and rescue operations. All those who use 
Quebec waters would benefit from this improvement''.
<P>
	No one, including myself, can be against virtue, but I think the 
government is coming up with some fine excuses to monitor people 
and find out where they are 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The 
same thing happened with firearms. I think this is a little too 
reminiscent of a quasi-police state in that there has been no debate. 
This is not necessarily wrong, but there has been no debate. The 
government makes its own little administrative rules and gives 
powers to ministers, deputy ministers, officials and police officers 
under the guise of controlling and getting information. Big brother 
was not invented by the official opposition, by the Bloc Quebecois. 
These departments should be cautious and think twice before 
imposing so many controls on the population. This is dangerous 
and it does not appear that any such reflection took place within the 
department.
<P>
	I now come to the last point. As regards the negative impact of 
this possible fee structure, we mentioned earlier that outfitting 
operations could be seriously affected. They have many boats. If an 
outfitter has 50 rowboats, a fee of $5 to $35 per boat will result in 
high costs in the end.
<P>
	The same goes for summer camps who must have pedal boats, 
canoes, kayaks, windsurfers, etc. Who is going to pay for that? 
Once again, the father who is sending his kid to summer camp will 
be told: ``It will cost you $80 more because of the government's 
fees''. We should not lose sight of that. That is what impact studies 
are for. When they are not made, bill are full of holes. One can 
wonder about the wisdom of this bill. But maybe they are so near 
sighted they cannot think of any other means. The impact on 
regional tourism development should also be considered. By 
increasing taxes all the time, Quebecers and Canadians who spend 
their holidays in their own country, Canada or Quebec, may very 
well feel like going on vacation elsewhere.
<P>
	A person who has a cottage and consumes beer, grocery, bread, 
etc. and who buys gas in Canada and in Quebec deserves to be 
congratulated from time to time, instead of being encouraged to go 
to another country not too far away where prices are cheap.
<P>
	Fortunately our dollar is low, but it could go up with such 
policies. What kind of strategy do we have to encourage tourists 
from Canada and Quebec to stay here? We find numerous ways of 
making life less  pleasant and of reducing the purchasing power of 
tourists vacationing in Quebec and in Canada.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5199"> 5199 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1825)</B>
<P>
	This bill is particularly appalling, because it strikes at big and 
powerful users and jeopardizes the economy of Quebec and the 
whole St. Lawrence Valley. It strikes, underhandedly, at the 
consumer, at families and at institutions like outfitters and summer 
camps. It is very disturbing in security terms and it implies, as I 
said, a certain control over the population, which is worrying for 
me. That is why I will, of course, vote against this bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
commend my hon. colleague from trois-Rivières for the 
presentation he just made as well as congratulate and thank him 
because he was an associate member of the fisheries and oceans 
committee at the time when the committee considered the proposed 
tariff structure for navigational aids that the coast guard imposed 
this year.
<P>
	Thanks also because we had to go so quickly and hear many 
witnesses. I must praise the hon. member for Trois-Rivières for his 
regular attendance and say that his remarks were always to the 
point, just like today, in relation to the concerns he had, along with 
industry representatives.
<P>
	That said, the focus of our colleague's remarks was part III of the 
bill, dealing with the minister's power to fix fees. Even though Bill 
C-26 has not yet been passed, a great deal of arm twisting has 
already taken place in the industry. Now, once Bill C-26 is in force, 
imagine how quick and easy it will be for the government to go 
around picking pockets, as required.
<P>
	This may sound slightly exaggerated, but I think my colleague 
has clearly put the point across that people have had it with having 
their pockets picked all the time without any impact studies nor 
examination of the efficiency of the services offered by the coast 
guard.
<P>
	At many hearings, people testified before the fisheries and 
oceans committee that they were prepared to do their share to lower 
the deficit. Coming from the industry, it does them credit to come 
out and say something like that. But they added this: ``But we do 
want to be sure, for one thing, that the services are provided 
efficiently. Also, could there be a fee setting mechanism?''
<P>
	This bill gives the minister the power to set fees but does not 
provide, in the name of transparency, for further consideration in 
this House. We did not ask for much in our proposed amendments, 
just for another three hours of debate. Why was this proposal 
rejected?
<P>
	A feedback process should also be put in place. My colleague, 
who has very close ties to the industry, knows what a valuable 
contribution the industry can make. We will need the co-operation 
of the industry, of these taxpayers, in the future. They are quite 
willing to do their  share, but we must show them how transparent 
our actions are. We must also tell them how they could co-operate, 
tell them where cuts must be made, where concessions have to be 
made. We must do things like that.
<P>
	One more point, before I complete my remarks. I would like to 
draw attention to the wisdom of what my colleague for 
Trois-Rivières said when he pointed out that the regulatory 
measure establishing the fees to be paid for Coast Guard services, 
for navigational aids, by ships sailing on Canadian waters, will not 
apply to ships bound for the United States sailing through Canadian 
waters. That is unfair.
<P>
	After having established in the preamble of Bill C-26 that:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Parliament wishes to affirm in Canadian domestic law Canada's sovereign rights</BLOCKQUOTE>
	how can a Canadian government do that? If we are sovereign, we 
should also take the means to enforce the law when those ships sail 
through our waters. Since I see that my colleague would like to add 
something to that, I yield to him.
<P>
<B>(1830)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rocheleau:</B> Mr. Speaker, I simply want to point out two 
things. As regards the fees for navigation aids, do you know how 
much users in the port of Trois-Rivières will have to pay because of 
these fees? It will cost them $500,000 annually. They will have to 
pay this amount every year for navigation aids, and it appears this 
is the least costly part of the whole thing.
<P>
	Soon they will also have to pay for the removal of the ice and 
then for dredging. Imagine the impact of these fees on the 
competitiveness of the port of Trois-Rivières, compared to other 
Quebec ports, but particularly American ports, given that Quebec 
ports will all be affected.
<P>
	When no impact study is conducted because the government 
wants to immediately bring in $20 or $30 million, it could easily 
end up costing us $50, $60 or $100 millions, in the medium and the 
long term.
<P>
	I will conclude with my second point. I want those who are 
listening to realize that, in my opinion as a citizen and a member of 
Parliament, it is almost unthinkable that the Quebec government 
would consider something like this in the context of sovereignty. In 
a sovereign Quebec, the St. Lawrence River would, given its 
important role in Quebec's economy, be made even more attractive 
to foreign investors and shipowners.
<P>
	This is an almost machiavellian operation that will have the 
effect of making the St. Lawrence River an option that is way too 
costly. I believe there is a real danger of this happening. In Europe 
and in Asia, people will look at the map and wonder why it has 
become so costly to go to Montreal, compared to previous years.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5200"> 5200 </A></B>
<P>
	It will be because a fee is charged for the ice breaker working 
up north. It will be because a fee is charged for navigation aids, 
buoys, beacons, telecommunication and other services. It will be 
because a fee is charged for everything, including dredging. When 
they see this, users from Greece, England, Australia, Taiwan or 
China may well decide to stop coming to Montreal, because it will 
cost too much. And it will cost too much because Ottawa will have 
decided so.
<P>
	As a sovereignist member of Parliament, I am convinced that 
such a decision is unthinkable in the context of a sovereign Quebec. 
This is yet another reason to encourage Quebecers to remember 
this episode at the next referendum.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, when I 
went over this bill, I was flabbergasted. I met with industrialists 
from my riding, who told me that they have had raw material 
brought by boat from South America, among other places, and that 
the price difference per ton of using the St. Lawrence Seaway 
rather than a port in the eastern region of the United States, in 
Boston or New York, for example, and then the railway system was 
only about 1 cent.
<P>
	Now, the fee schedule set by the minister will affect this fragile 
balance and cause these industrialists to rethink their transportation 
policies. Members will realize that, if other industrialists react the 
same way, some resources in the St. Lawrence seaway will have to 
be shut down, and this will lead to unemployment.
<P>
<B>(1835)</B>
<P>
	Earlier, my colleague from Trois-Rivières was right to say that 
we have yet to assess the impact of this decision. It looks like, in 
the very short term, the minister wants to quickly collect about $20 
million a year. But for what? So that his government does not have 
to cut elsewhere in order to still be able to deal with a deficit 
without having to take the consequences.
<P>
	However, the real consequences, as my colleague from 
Trois-Rivières pointed out, are the medium and long term impacts, 
which will be much more considerable than the total amount of the 
expected savings. This could lead, for example, to increased 
unemployment. In fact, this is exactly what will happen. We are 
creating unemployment. This government across the way, which 
got itself elected on a job creation platform, is proposing a bill that 
will create unemployment. And where? In Quebec, among my 
fellow citizens, whose principal activity, from the time our 
ancestors arrived on this continent until now, has been shipping.
<P>
	The St. Lawrence Seaway is a resource for Quebec. It is a 
resource that Ottawa, the federal government, has no right to 
control to the point where we can no longer use it economically. 
And that is exactly what is going to happen.
<P>
	The minister does not understand the ramifications of what he is 
about to do with this bill. The minister does not realize that, as far 
as industry is concerned, all the ports on the St. Lawrence are going 
to be dealt a hard blow.
<P>
	Jean-Marie Vignola, who was given the mandate of studying the 
economic impacts relating to the port of Quebec City, discovered 
that the economic contribution of the port of Quebec City, and I am 
only speaking of that port, over a seven year period, is equivalent to 
the impact of hosting the Olympic Games. Imagine, every seven 
years, the port of Quebec City alone generates the equivalent in 
economic spinoffs for the Quebec region of hosting the Olympic 
Games.
<P>
	That is what the minister is monkeying around with, and not just 
in Quebec City, but in Montreal, Trois-Rivières, Bécancour, 
Saint-Romuald, in fact the length of the St. Lawrence. User pay is 
all very fine and well. But what is the user using and how much is 
he paying? Will there be a distinction made between the user who 
relies a little more heavily on telecommunications and the user who 
relies a little less so, between the user who uses a satellite 
navigation system and the user who relies on buoys and 
lighthouses?
<P>
	Earlier, my colleague, the member for Trois-Rivières, quite 
rightly pointed out that ships travelling the St. Lawrence Seaway to 
a final destination in the United States will not pay a cent. They 
will have used the resources to the same extent as any other ship 
destined for Montreal or Quebec City, but since their destination is 
the United States, they will not have to pay a cent. Who will pay the 
bill? It will be split among other users who use the services to reach 
destinations in Quebec or in Canada.
<P>
	You realize that this bill is being presented to us under false 
pretences. The rationale behind it is faulty. And I have not 
mentioned the absolutely ridiculous provisions that would tax an 
ordinary citizen, small outfitting operations and holiday camps for 
their pleasure craft.
<P>
	Honestly, will it get to the point where they slap a tax on the 
boats children play with in wading pools or the bathtub? Where 
will it all end? The coast guard claims that it will provide services. 
None of our viewers takes that seriously. The only person taking it 
seriously is the minister.
<P>
	I see that my time is up and I will conclude as follows: the public 
cannot accept such a sorry excuse for a bill and I hope it will make 
its views know. It has the support of the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
<B>(1840)</B>

minutes left next time if he wishes to use them.

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">ADJOURNMENT PROCEEDINGS</H2>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 deemed 
to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="TELECOMMUNICATIONS">TELECOMMUNICATIONS</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, on a 
different subject, and not really a more pleasant one, I had the 
opportunity, a few days ago, to ask the industry minister what he 
intended to do to ensure that everybody had access to basic 
telephone services.
<P>
	The problem is this: the industry minister, in the name of free 
competition, wants us to believe that the consumer is going to 
benefit from this competition. However, our telephone bill has 
already increased by $4. And that is not all. There will be another 
$2 increase and, on top of that, Bell Canada will soon be asking the 
CRTC to approve a rate increase that will affect mostly rural 
communities.
<P>
	I met with people from Bell Canada and asked them what is 
going on. They said: ``Look, we do not make the laws. The minister 
makes the laws''. But from the moment he makes them, we have to 
live with them.
<P>
	Here are the consequences: since there is free competition and 
since the cost of providing telephone services in urban centres is 
less, everybody is rushing to take its share of the urban market. 
Before, since there was a monopoly, part of the revenues from 
urban areas were used to pay for the additional costs in rural areas. 
There are more poles to install, more wires, etc. That will no longer 
be possible.
<P>
	We will have a problem in rural areas because telephone 
companies will refuse to provide that service. If that is the message 
the minister wants to send Canadians, what he is indeed saying to 
the people and to small, medium and large businesses is that they 
should stay away from rural areas because they will pay more for 
telephone services, that they should be closer to the urban centres if 
they want to reduce their telecommunication costs.
<P>
	It so happens that telecommunications are very important for a 
business in a world where information is the cornerstone of the 
economy. The minister's message contradicts reality. The 
consumer does not benefit from this kind of competition. The 
consumer pays increasingly more, and it is not over yet.
<P>
	So, basically, what I am asking the minister is this: Will he take 
measures to eliminate or solve the problem? Will he follow the 
example of California and create a fund to allow isolated areas to 
reduce their phone bill and to allow the less well-off, people who 
cannot afford to pay higher phone bills, to have telephone services 
at an affordable price?
<P>
	To me, it seems to be fundamental. The minister can no longer 
wash his hands of it and leave everything to free competition. He 
has the social responsibility to protect rural communities and the 
less well-off. I am expecting an answer from the minister.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morris Bodnar (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Minister for the Atlantic Canada Opportunities 
Agency and Minister of Western Economic Diversification, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, Canadians have one of the best and most 
advanced telecommunication systems in the world at prices that are 
among the lowest in the world. Canada has achieved one of the 
highest telephone penetration rates in the world, which is 99 per 
cent in 1995.
<P>
	One of the objectives of the Telecommunications Act is to render 
reliable and affordable telecommunication services to all 
Canadians. Another objective is to foster competition in the 
provision of telecommunication services.
<P>
	Since the late 1980s we have introduced competition in almost 
all telecommunication markets. As we move to more competitive 
markets, the government is committed to ensuring that all 
consumers, those living in rural and remote locations, those in low 
income groups and those with special needs, continue to have 
affordable access to central communication services.
<P>
	Currently the CRTC is considering the need for specific means to 
ensure that local service continues to be universally accessible and 
affordable as we move to competition in this market. The 
government is monitoring these proceedings closely. Our goal is to 
have the most advanced and lowest cost telecommunications 
infrastructure in the world, one that offers consumers a broader 
range of innovative products, services and suppliers from which to 
choose.

	<B>Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon-Clark's Crossing, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, some time ago I raised with the Minister of Justice his 
handling of Patrick Kelly's section 690 application.
<P>
	As the minister and the House know, Mr. Kelly, a former 
undercover RCMP officer, was convicted in 1984 of the murder of 
his wife three years earlier and has spent thirteen and a half years in 
jail, the last eight being at William Head Institution.
<P>
	Patrick Kelly continues to languish in the bowels of the 
Canadian criminal justice system while the minister drags his feet 
about ordering a new trial for Mr. Kelly. From day one Mr. Kelly 
has proclaimed his innocence and from day one the Department of 
Justice has mishandled the investigation into Mr. Kelly's case.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="5202"> 5202 </A></B>
<P>
	Three years ago Dawn Taber, the crown's key witness, recanted 
her original testimony in which she had claimed to have seen Mr. 
Kelly push his wife from their Toronto highrise balcony. ``I did not 
see Patrick Kelly drop his wife off the balcony. That was a lie''. She 
said this three years ago.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice took one and a half years after this 
recantation to even both contacting Dawn Taber for an interview 
even though she has made herself available and has been a willing 
witness.
<P>
	On many occasions, other members of Parliament and I have 
pressured the justice minister to release critical information from 
the police investigation that was originally withheld, information 
that Mr. Kelly's defence lawyers would need in order to properly 
represent him. But those police reports apparently fell into the 
chasm of bureaucracy for 13 years until some of them, and only 
some of them, were released in February 1996.
<P>
	Why has the tape recording of the interview with Dawn Taber, 
the key witness, with the police and the psychiatrist mysteriously 
gone missing? What are the police, the psychiatrist and the 
Department of Justice hiding? Furthermore, the minister assigned 
the very officer accused of suborning Dawn Taber's evidence in the 
first place to take part in the reinvestigation. Clearly this represent 
a serious problem.
<P>
	In June 1995 the minister ordered an independent scientific 
analysis of the evidence. However, to date the minister has failed to 
ensure that this analysis is completed and calls from Mr. Kelly's 
counsel for this analysis are going unanswered.
<P>
	On more than one occasion the minister assured the House that 
he would prepare an investigative brief and personally assured 
members of Parliament that this would be done. Yet suddenly after 
three years of spending public money on this investigation, the 
minister refuses to supply that brief.
<P>
	There are very serious questions about the minister's inaction in 
this case. Why has the report that was prepared by Michelle Feurst, 
the minister's independent counsel, not been made available to 
Patrick Kelly and his counsel and shown to the public who paid for 
it? Again, what kind of justice is this?
<P>
	The Minister of Justice has mishandled Mr. Kelly's application 
and it is time that he accepted some responsibility and answered 
some questions. Is his staff incompetent or are they merely 
uninterested in pursuing the truth? What about the evidence which 
is being hidden from all of us, perhaps evidence that shows Mr. 
Kelly's innocence? What about concerns of wrongdoing by the 
metro Toronto police, the RCMP and, indeed, Department of 
Justice officials?
<P>
	The minister has led an investigation that has acted with no sense 
of urgency, with a total lack of established rules of procedure and a 
total lack of disclosure. Why  does the minister continue to conduct 
an investigation in darkness and secrecy?
<P>
	When the crown's key witness admits to lying on the stand and 
when police documents show they have hidden information, then it 
is clear that justice has been violated, a fair trial denied and thus a 
new trial must be ordered. It is quite that simple.
<P>
	The minister has repeatedly promised to review the case, to 
release a brief, to make a decision and yet the silence continues. 
That silence is the sign of a minister responsible for justice not 
ensuring that justice is done. This cannot go on any longer.
<P>
	When will the Minister of Justice do the right thing by Mr. 
Kelly?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
May 8, 1996 the hon. member for Saskatoon-Clark's Crossing 
questioned the Minister of Justice in the House about the section 
690 of the Criminal Code application of Mr. Patrick Kelly.
<P>
	Section 690 of the Criminal Code provides a person convicted of 
an indictable offence with a last chance to correct a wrongful 
conviction. It authorizes the minister to grant a new trial or if 
circumstances warrant, the ordering of an appeal if the 
circumstances warrant.
<P>
	The section 690 procedure allows for ministerial review of cases 
where, for example, new evidence or information provides a 
reasonable basis to conclude that a miscarriage of justice likely 
occurred in the conviction of the applicant. This section gives the 
Minister of Justice important powers so that each application is 
reviewed very conscientiously and thoroughly.
<P>
	The hon. member for Saskatoon-Clark's Crossing has 
expressed concern at the department's handling of this application. 
Mr. Kelly's application has some extraordinary features. One of 
them relates to the request by the applicant's counsel for all the 
information gathered during the investigation and not merely a 
summary of it. An investigation brief only provides a summary of 
the relevant information and in this case, indeed, the department 
acceded to the counsel's request and provided the relevant 
information. Therefore there is no need to provide a summary of 
the same information.
<P>
	On July 16, 1996 Mr. Kelly, by his counsel, submitted comments 
and additional materials which exceeded 500 pages. These 
submissions have been reviewed by department officials who have 
recently referred the application and the submissions to the 
Minister of Justice for his review.
<P>
	In the circumstances, since the applicant has received the 
relevant information that was gathered, there is no need to provide 
a summary of the same information.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The motion to adjourn the House is 
deemed to have been adopted. The House stands adjourned until 
tomorrow at 10 a.m.
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 6.49 p.m.)
