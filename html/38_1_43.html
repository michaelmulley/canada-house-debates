Sue Barnes (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development and Federal Interlocutor for Métis and Non-Status Indians, Lib.): </b>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of Bill C-20, the first nations fiscal and statistical management act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I speak to the contents of the proposed legislation though, I would like to extend my sincere thanks to the members of the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development, and I note that our chair, the member for Nunavut is here today, and colleagues in the House who, with their consent, facilitated this final debate today.  I acknowledge and am grateful for that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This important legislation will enable first nations to access the tools they need to increase their participation in the economy.  Under the provisions of Bill C-20, first nations will have at their disposal the same financial instruments and mechanisms used by municipal governments to plan effectively, raise capital and secure investments. With this capacity, first nations will be better able to realize their dreams of self-sufficiency and prosperity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The impetus for this legislation originates with first nation leaders from across the country.  It is important to recognize that Bill C-20 was developed by first nations for first nations.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legislation before us today is the product of many years of hard work, detailed analysis and continual refinement. Leaders of first nations have told us that Bill C-20 represents their communities' best hope  for a more equitable share in Canada's prosperity. I believe it is incumbent upon us to champion this hope and facilitate a new reality for first nations in our country together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latest figures from Statistics Canada confirm that first nations communities continue to rank among the poorest in Canada; their residents experience the lowest standards of living.  This is not acceptable.  This we need to address.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manny Jules, the principal architect of Bill C-20, summed up the current situation eloquently, when he said:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>Today a wall surrounds First Nation economies; a wall built by past legislation and policies; a wall of mistrust and dependency that traps us in poverty.  Each additional year of dependency adds another brick in this wall.  The wall has not served Canada well because it prevents us from participating in the economy.</small></td>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manny Jules, together with Chief Strater Crowfoot, Chief Tom Bresette, Harold Calla and Deanna Hamilton are foremost among the committed leaders of this legislative initiative.  Others have done amazing work to assist the development and realization of their dreams, and I acknowledge not only their presence and support today, but their steadfast efforts over time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am convinced that Bill C-20 will help dismantle the wall.  With this vitally important legislation, first nations communities will be able to fulfill their vision of self-sufficiency and prosperity. Bill C-20 would enable first nations leaders to meet the specific needs of their specific community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The essence of the legislation is a series of four distinct yet complementary institutions: a finance authority, a tax commission, a financial management board and a statistical institute.  Precursors to two of these institutions, for instance the Indian taxation advisory board, have operated for several years and the results have been remarkable.  The time has come to move forward to do better.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once these institutions are in place, first nations will have many of the powers long enjoyed by municipal governments, including the ability to borrow money at competitive rates, to develop effective real property tax systems and to protect the interests of their ratepayers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First nations that participate in these institutions will also be able to increase financial management capacity and improve long term planning.  In short, first nations will exercise greater control over and assume greater responsibility for the economic and social health of their communities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The viability of every community in Canada is affected by the strength and reliability of its physical infrastructure.   For example, transportation links, water and sewage treatment facilities and other components of modern infrastructure are also essential to economic growth,  Municipalities across Canada have long funded infrastructure projects through low interest loans. Lenders were keen to invest in these projects because of the legal status, financial health and political stability of municipal governments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most first nation communities, though, struggle to attract investors and finance the construction of infrastructure.  Funding even the most modest of projects quickly becomes prohibitively expensive due to high transaction costs and interest rates.  Furthermore, verification and approval processes often delay the start of projects, leading to additional costs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to a study completed by first nations fiscal institutions initiative, funding an infrastructure project in a first nations community can be up to 10 times more expensive than a similar project built elsewhere.  As a result, today many first nations communities suffer from the effects of inadequate physical infrastructure.  Bill C-20 would establish these four independent institutions that would  provide valuable services to first nations at every stage of growth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to describe these institutions briefly now and explain their roles.</p><A NAME="T1010"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1010"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1015"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1005"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1010)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than a decade ago, a handful of communities pooled their resources to create the First Nations Finance Authority Inc. for investment purposes.  As the number of first nations participating in the authority grew, so did the feasibility of issuing debentures to access long term capital at competitive interest rates.  The concept attracted the support of a key partner, the Municipal Finance Authority of British Columbia, which had 30 years' experience and a triple A credit rating.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new First Nations Finance Authority will provide participating first nations with access to capital markets by issuing debentures using property tax revenues as security, debentures that will finance infrastructure projects.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To assist band councils in instituting effective property tax regimes, Bill C-20 would create the First Nations Tax Commission, or FNTC.  The FNTC will establish the legal framework needed to effectively balance community and ratepayer interests.  It will institute processes to resolve disputes and to approve bylaws and it will provide the services needed to securitize real property tax revenues. In short, the FNTC will foster the secure and stable fiscal environments sought by investors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure that this environment thrives over the long term, first nations must have access to adequate financial management services.  Lenders must have a clear and accurate picture of the fiscal health of borrowers.  Independent assessments must be readily available. The First Nations Financial Management Board, or FMB, is designed to meet these requirements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two components of the FMB's mandate.  The first component focuses on the provision of technical services to first nations regardless of financial status.  The FMB will assist with research and advocacy, policy and capacity development, along with financial management, reporting and standards.  These activities will help first nations communities to make the most of their financial resources.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second part of the board's mandate focuses on first nations that collect property tax and seek to borrow against this revenue.  The FMB will certify and monitor financial management standards of these first nations, providing potential investors with a clear and accurate picture of fiscal health. By conducting independent assessments of financial status, the board will ensure that lenders have the information and the confidence needed to invest. The FMB will be empowered to intervene promptly and decisively if needed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure that the institutions I have described can function appropriately, their performance must be recorded accurately and also analyzed regularly.  To accomplish these goals, an effective method of gathering statistics is needed.  Unfortunately. the quality and accuracy of statistical systems in first nations communities has been inadequate and, I must say, inconsistent. Precise, relevant data is particularly essential for community planners.  Information on population growth and effectiveness of service delivery mechanisms, for instance, is needed to design effective housing and health initiatives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Planners in first nations communities, though, rarely have had access to the valuable information collected from fellow residents. Although several government departments and agencies have long collected data about and from members of first nations, this information is seldom shared with other agencies or even with the communities that have provided the information in the first place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few years ago, the Auditor General estimated that each first nation annually provides the government with information about more than 150 aspects of community life. Data concerning school enrolment, employment, population and dozen of other subjects are recorded and analyzed, but the information is usually gathered for specific purposes and rarely shared with first nations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not surprisingly, this severely hampers the ability of band councils and aboriginal leaders to plan effectively. Further compounding the problem is the fact that few agencies involve residents of first nations communities directly in the compilation, collation and analysis of information.  As a result, few aboriginal people have acquired any familiarity or expertise with statistical techniques.  Although this is a generalization, I think it is relatively true.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-20 would improve the situation significantly by establishing the First Nations Statistical Institute, or FNSI.  FNSI will have the power to collect information from a variety of sources and develop a comprehensive database of accurate and pertinent statistics about each first nation community in Canada. As a first nations led organization, FNSI will bring an aboriginal perspective to every aspect of information collection, interpretation and use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of greater significance, though, is the positive effect that the expertise in data management will have on local governance.  Chiefs and councils will have the data needed to make informed decisions about economic and social development in their communities.</p><A NAME="T1015"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1015"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1020"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1010"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1015)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Speech from the Throne, the government committed to begin the essential task of renewing its relations with first nations.  The government vowed to follow a collaborative approach and pledged to establish a relationship based on equality, trust and mutual respect. Much progress has been made on this front and we will continue to go forward.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canada-aboriginal peoples round table united representatives of dozens of governments, agencies and organizations from across Canada for a series of focused and productive discussions.  These talks led to a series of processes to accelerate progress and measure performance. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sectoral follow-up meetings focusing on health, lifelong learning and housing have already been held. Next week, sessions on fostering economic opportunity will get under way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legislation before us today is another part of this collaborative effort. Designed by first nations, Bill C-20 would play an important role in the new relationship between Canada and aboriginal peoples. The legislation sends a clear message to all first nations that the Government of Canada is aware of the problems they face, has listened carefully to the solutions they have proposed, and is now prepared to act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The practical fiscal management tools at the heart of this legislation will help first nations better manage their land and more easily acquire the funds they need to engage in community building projects.  Improvements in physical infrastructure would contribute to a better quality of life in two ways. Upgrading transportation and communication links creates jobs, establishes new opportunities for entrepreneurs and increases land values.  Investments in infrastructure fuel a healthy cycle of economic development that will continue well into the future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-20 provides these tools that would support the building of new relationships and give first nations access to financial instruments and mechanisms to raise capital and secure investment.  With these tools, first nations would be able to create a business-friendly economic growth and realize their dreams, not ours, of self-sufficiency and prosperity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This legislation is not a panacea for the economic woes of first nations.  It will not magically transform poverty stricken communities into prosperous, thriving towns.  Bill C-20, however, would give first nations the freedom to develop their communities on their own terms. Community leaders would gain access to the same legal tools and financial mechanisms that enabled other Canadian communities to flourish and grow.  All first nations can benefit from the expertise of institutions such as the FMB, whether or not they decide to participate in the borrowing pool.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-20 would not diminish the constitutionally protected rights of aboriginal peoples.  Instead, the legislation would help those first nations that choose to participate to exercise those rights by creating equal opportunities for first nations within the Canadian constitutional framework.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government is well aware that there is no such thing as a one size fits all solution to the divergent needs and aspirations of first nations.  First nations governments can use this legislation if and when they are ready.  No band will ever be forced to take part.  The choice of whether to participate or not will be up to the individual communities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-20 is flexible and inclusive enough to meet the needs of hundreds of first nations.  I am convinced that the tools accessible through Bill C-20 would help to close the considerable gaps that exist between aboriginal and non-aboriginal communities in this country. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, by combining rigorous standards with legal powers and institutional support, the legislation would ensure that first nations operate within their debt carrying capacity as they move toward self-sufficiency.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Bill C-20 would create a legal framework enabling first nations to work directly and effectively with private companies and public agencies.  This would put an end to first nation isolation and lead to a better quality of life for first nations communities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, Bill C-20 outlines a balanced approach to long term financial health for first nations.  Clearly, all Canadians stand to benefit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-20 is not a prescriptive bill.  First nations are neither required to participate in the institutions I have described, nor must they adhere to a specific regime.  This legislation recognizes and accommodates the divergent needs and aspirations of first nations.  I believe that the flexible, inclusive approach articulated by Bill C-20 is its greatest strength.  Bill C-20 would provide access to a range of options, enabling each community to chart its own path to prosperity.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank my hon. colleagues of all parties who have by their actions shown support for this legislation.  I say merci and I wish good luck to everyone.</p><A NAME="T1020"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1020"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1025"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1015"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1020)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

We have been having different groups come in and give presentations. The biggest concern we have heard is that we are passing legislation in the House without any type of gender analysis, without any type of analysis that tells us how legislation is going to affect women.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some women coming to our status of women committee meetings are from the aboriginal groups. They have a lot of concerns. I would like to know how this bill is going to address the concerns that the aboriginal women have been bringing to our committee, particularly their concerns about property rights. Yesterday we heard a lot of concerns about not having enough shelters for a lot of the women who are trying to get away from violence, from domestic violence and from violent relationships. We also have heard a lot of concerns about not having representation of women on councils.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am wondering if any of this has been taken into consideration. It looks like we are going to be spending quite a few of the next months listening to more of these presentations. I am wondering if this bill has been analyzed for gender.</p><A NAME="Int-1078406"></A><a HREF="#Int-1078408"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1078404"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Sue Barnes: </b>Mr. Speaker, for the hon. member opposite, I am absolutely ecstatic that the opposition party is now in favour of gender analysis. It was a policy put forward through the Beijing meetings nearly a decade ago. I can tell the member that in the Department of Indian and Northern Affairs we have already started to do some gender work inside the department on specific projects. I can also tell the member that this side of the House is looking forward to doing more gender analysis throughout all the departments, but we know that this has not been completely done at this stage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very happy to hear the Conservative Party talking to this aspect of government-wide work. I know the member is not referring specifically to the work we are doing in our committee; it is actually another committee of the House that she is referring to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can tell the hon. member I agree with her when she says there are problems, specifically with matrimonial property on reserves. This is an issue that has taken the interest of the minister. In fact, he has recently written to the chair of our committee asking the committee to study matrimonial property with a view to looking at legislation the House could put forward to address this huge challenge, which has stymied many first nations leaders and individuals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that the reality of the problem is there. Our committee has not yet had a chance to discuss how we will go about  this mandate, so I will not preclude what the committee will do on that matter because that would be inappropriate at this time. I very sincerely believe, as a personal belief, that this is a challenge which we have to all rise to together. We will not do that without a collaborative effort with first nations communities, which also recognize that this is a huge challenge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the bill itself, if the member would read specific clauses in the bill she will see that they specifically talk about getting qualified men and women, for instance on the directorship, including first nations communities, involved in this legislation. At the committee, I actually pointed out the specific clause in the bill that refers to this. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The benefits will be in  the well-being of the whole community. I am very much looking forward to people utilizing this aspect. I look forward to working with the member and her party in future on all these issues.</p><A NAME="T1030"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1030"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1035"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1025"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1030)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1078408"></A><a HREF="#Int-1078411"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1078406"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP): </b>Mr. Speaker, throughout the debate on this bill much has been made of the optional nature of the bill. Even in earlier incarnations this was less clear, but in this incarnation of the bill, as it went from Bill C-19 to Bill C-23, to now Bill C-20 in this Parliament, the claim is made by the government that this is truly optional and people's fears are groundless. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it remains unclear to me and perhaps the parliamentary secretary can help me with this. In relation to the statistical institute, which is one of the four new fiscal institutions created by Bill C-20, I do not understand how the claim can be made that Bill C-20 is optional.  In fact, the statistical institute is not optional at all. All first nations in Canada come under this whether they wish to or not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless I am missing something completely, there is no optional nature to the statistical institute. Perhaps this should have been dealt with as a separate bill. Perhaps the government should have introduced the three other fiscal institutions as one bill. If there was a need for the statistical institute, it could have been dealt with separately. I would like the parliamentary secretary to explain to me how the statistical institute could be seen as optional.</p><A NAME="Int-1078411"></A><a HREF="#Int-1078413"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1078408"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Sue Barnes: </b>Mr. Speaker, I referred to the optional part of this bill as in the fiscal tools. The minister stated in  committee in his opening remarks that the statistical institute is not optional. It applies to all first nations.  If the member had wanted to do something different about severing the statistical institute, I am sure he could have made amendments to that effect, but he did not. In fact, he chose, and I am very glad that he did, to be part of the unanimous passing with other amendments but nothing relating to that situation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was clarified in committee.   The bill is a reincarnation of two previous attempts to have the bill changed into optional legislation.  First nations will choose if and when they wish to participate in the taxing and borrowing regimes established by the bill. The provisions of the bill dealing with these regimes will apply only to those first nations which appear in the schedule to the bill.  A band council must ask to be added to the schedule.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The schedule is established by the governor in council. The name of the first nation can appear in the schedule only at the request of the council of that first nation. First nations have had the option, under the Indian Act, to establish real property tax regimes since 1988 and that option will also continue to be available.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First nations would continue to be free to raise capital as they do now. There is no obligation for any first nation to borrow through the finance authority. No one has forced any first nation to tax under the provisions of the Indian Act. No one will force any first nation to tax or borrow under the provisions of this bill. First nations will make that decision. The minister made that point very clearly in committee. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This initiative is first nation led. The bill has resulted from over 15 years of dedicated effort by a group of first nation leaders who seek to remove existing barriers to economic development. The development of the bill has been guided by their vision, their determination, their skills and personal commitment, along with input of industry specialists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, yes this is optional for the taxation.   The whole point of the statistical institute is to be able to do the planning. If that was unclear to the member, I am very glad he gave me this opportunity to clarify that.</p><A NAME="T1035"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1035"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1040"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1030"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1035)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1078413"></A><a HREF="#Int-1078428"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1078411"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Jim Prentice (Calgary Centre-North, CPC): </b>Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to rise today and speak to Bill C-20, a bill described as the first nations statistical and management act. The bill has made quite an expeditious journey through the House of Commons to committee and back onto the floor of the House of Commons today, anticipating early approval with the cooperation of all of the parties in the House.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not replicate the comments made by my learned friend. There are substantial parts of this legislation upon which she and I agree for once. My comments will respond to a couple of the questions that have been raised and to outline in philosophical terms why our party supports this legislation. The Conservative Party is fully in support of Bill C-20 and the principles contained therein.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This past month the <i>National Post</i> published an opinion piece which was prepared by  Phil Fontaine, the National Chief of the Assembly of First Nations. As I said before, while I do not agree with everything that my colleague, Grand Chief Fontaine, has said in that article, there are many matters upon which he and I agree and which I think all Canadians should consider.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This country is a modern federal democracy in which all of the citizens of Canada must bear equally the responsibilities and also the privileges of citizenship.  The time has come that aboriginal Canadians are entitled, indeed they are expected, to share in the governance of Canada, to share in the governance of their own affairs, and their inherent right of self-government. If aboriginal Canadians are to be equal citizens in this country, if they are also to bear upon their shoulders the hopes and dreams of Canada, then they must also bear equally the responsibilities of governing this country. Concurrently, they must enjoy the full benefits of citizenship, including the protection of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Chief Fontaine observed in the <i>National Post:</i></p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>To be self-sufficient, to rely on ourselves, we must be free and able to make our own choices. Reliance on the choices that others make for us is a denial of the means to self-sufficiency.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that regard, an important study was carried out in Canada and referred to by Mr. Fontaine, the Harvard Project. It referred to three factors which are critical to economic self-sufficiency.  These are worth emphasizing in the context of this debate.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, practical sovereignty means genuine decision-making power over internal affairs, governance, resources, institutions and development strategies. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, capable governing institutions are those which exercise power effectively, responsibly and reliably.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the necessity for a cultural match, which means formal  institutions of government that match indigenous concepts of how authority should be organized and should be exercised.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this country, over the past many years, we have had a debate about the scope and content of aboriginal self-government. Much has been said about that subject and that debate will carry on. The debate, by and large, has been a democratic and a civil one, even though it has been marked by a lack of consensus on many fundamental matters.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both aboriginal and non-aboriginal Canadians need to be reminded that, while we do not always agree upon the scope and content of governance rights, virtually all Canadians share a desire to see aboriginal Canadians as equal partners in this marvellous country.  They wish to see a full embodiment of the inherent right of self-government in a way which is practical and which achieves success for aboriginal Canadians.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Indian Act is both anachronistic and archaic.  Frankly, it has no place in the Canada of tomorrow.  It has not yet been replaced in our country by a modern legislative framework only because we have been unable as a country to this point  to define how and by what legislative means the Indian Act should be replaced. However, I would hasten to add that I anticipate that in the next several years we will make great strides in that regard. We will succeed in replacing the Indian Act with legislation which has the support of first nations and which moves us into the future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issues to be sure are complex. They involve questions that strike to the heart of this country: issues pertaining to the application of the charter; the distribution of governmental jurisdiction within our country, within our federal system; the incidence of citizenship; the correlative rights and expectations which we demand of one another as fellow citizens; and also those difficult issues that deal with the distribution of resources.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These would be difficult enough questions on their own. They are all the more difficult when one factors in the rich and diverse mosaic, the linguistic mosaic, and the cultural mosaic of Canada's aboriginal peoples: Inuit, Métis and over 600 distinct Indian first nations.</p><A NAME="T1040"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1040"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1045"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1035"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1040)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Grand Chief Fontaine has observed, people need control over their own lives and the chance to reap the benefits of their own labours.  They do not flourish when they are denied the right to decide for themselves how they will live.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I for one have reached the conclusion, after many years of involvement on this subject, that many of the difficulties which aboriginal people have faced in this country tie back to their struggle against the collectivist tyranny of the Indian Act. It is important that we replace that legislation and Bill C-20 is extraordinarily important legislation in that regard. It represents one of the first steps to pass control of the lives of aboriginal Canadians in respect of economic and taxation matters back within their own jurisdiction in a voluntary manner.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of self-government, the position of myself and my party is clear.  The Indian Act and related legislation should be replaced by a modern legislative framework which provides for the inherent right of self-government for the devolution of full, legal and democratic responsibility to aboriginal peoples over their own affairs.  This must be done within the overall framework of our federal state.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This reform should be pursued following full consultation with first nations, with the objective of achieving a full and complete devolution of democratic authority that is consistent with the devolution of authority elsewhere within our federal democratic system.  Aboriginal Canadians, like all  Canadians, are entitled to enjoy democratic control over their own affairs within a legislative context that ensures certainty, stability, respect for the rule of law, and which balances individual and collective responsibility.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aboriginal communities must have the flexibility to determine for themselves whether and how principles, such as free market principles and individual property ownership should apply to reserve lands. We feel very strongly that this devolution should be accomplished in a manner which takes into account the cultural, linguistic  and rich diversity of Canada's first nations.  Within that context and within the framework of the Canadian Constitution, we should be prepared to make flexible accommodations for the protection of language and culture within self-government agreements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I return at this point to the legislation before the House, Bill C-20.  One of the fundamental aspects of this legislation, which warrants emphasis, is that it originates not so much with the Government of Canada, and I mean no disrespect in that regard, but rather with a group of visionary leaders, aboriginal Canadians who have fought for their vision of self-government and who have persisted in the face of considerable difficulty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I speak of a team of people, but there are four or five people in particular I wish to mention for the record in this honourable House. They are Chief Tom Bressette, the chairman of the first nations statistical advisory panel and the present Chief of the Chippewas of Kettle and Stony Point First Nation; Harold Calla, chairman of the financial management advisory panel, a councillor and individual from the Squamish First Nation; Chief Strater Crowfoot, chairman of the Indian taxation advisory board and chief of the Siksika First Nation; Deanna Hamilton, the president and CEO of the first nation finance authority of the Westbank First Nation; and Manny Jules, the former Indian taxation advisory board chairman and the former chief of the Kamloops Indian Band.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These men and women, and the extraordinary team of people who have worked with them are fighting to ensure that the first nation communities that wish to will have voluntary access to practical levers of self-government, which will bring them economic progress, prosperity and social development.</p><A NAME="T1045"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1045"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1050"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1040"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1045)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their vision is one of prosperity, of infrastructure development, of economic development, of economic opportunity and social progress.  The self-government, which they are fighting for, is predicated upon the hard work associated with citizenship in this country, the installation of community infrastructure, the responsibilities of debt service, the administration of a property tax system, and the building of fiscal, managerial and financial capacity in their communities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legislation also concurrently balances the interests of the federal crown and contains provisions that  would provide the necessary protection for the position of taxpayers commensurate with that of other taxpayers in our federal system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to point out, in response to some of the questions that have been raised surrounding this legislation, that there has been an enormous amount of consultation surrounding the development of this statute.   </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill not only originated with the first nation communities, of which I have spoken, but this project evolved to include many other first nations and regional first nation bodies, the First Nation Summit of British Columbia and the Union of Ontario Indians.  Discussion was held in those forums.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Years of consultation and debate have surrounded the development of this initiative.  Debates with the Assembly of First Nations AGM, the B.C. First Nation Summit, the Union of Ontario Indians, the Atlantic Policy Congress, as well as numerous discussions with individual first nations. In addition to those consultations, meetings have been held with non-first nation taxpayers,   provincial governments, private sector companies and municipal governments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would point out for the record and for special note, that consultations have  been held with the Canadian Property Tax Association, the Canadian Energy Pipeline Association, the Federation of Canadian Municipalities, the Union of B.C. Municipalities, the Bank of Montreal, First Nations Bank, TD Canada Trust, VanCity Credit Union, Standard &amp; Poor's Corporation, Moody's Investors Services, the Aboriginal Finance Officers Association, the Municipal Finance Authority of British Columbia and other bodies as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What all of that speaks to is the remarkable amount of consultation on the legislative progress of the bill.  In that regard, when I went through the provisions of the bill in a detailed way, chapter and verse, paragraph by paragraph, I was struck by the fact that the provisions of the bill were well thought out, well crafted and meticulously drafted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three particular issues which the House needs to be aware of and which I think are adequately addressed in the legislation.  First, the rights of taxpayers under this legislation; second, the liability of the crown; and third, the provisions relating to default or defalcation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to note that with respect to the rights of taxpayers, a great deal has been done in the legislation to ensure that a taxpayer on reserve, whether it be an industrial taxpayer or a taxpayer in a residential or commercial context, is being treated very much the same as a taxpayer anywhere else in Canada.  An assessment bylaw must be approved by the tax commission under clause 5(2).   Assessment appeals are mandatory and prescribed by regulation.  There is an appeal review process.  A  review can be requested of the first nation tax commission under clause 33. In addition, the commissioners of the tax commission include specifically taxpayer appointed nominees under clause 20.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A great deal of effort went  into ensuring that the rights of taxpayers were examined,   considered and protected.  I think they are quite commensurate with a situation any other taxpayer would face in this country.</p><A NAME="T1050"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1050"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1055"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1045"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1050)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to the liability of the crown, this is an issue that has been raised.  I would point out that under section 60 of the statute, no one is entitled to give a guarantee on behalf of the Government of Canada.  Both sections 133 and 135 provide very clearly that no person has a right to receive any compensation or damages, or an indemnity from the crown in respect of this legislation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that is very important because the first nations in this case are not being backstopped by anyone other than themselves.  When we talk about aboriginal Canadians standing up and taking responsibility for their own affairs, this legislation shows that it is exactly what is happening.  They are not being backstopped by the Government of Canada.  This is their own responsibility.  It is a collective effort on the part of first nations to guarantee one another's debt and, through that method, to advance themselves economically.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legislation does contain provisions relating to accountability, and in particular what happens in the event of a difficult circumstance of defalcation or default.  There are also extensive co-management or third party management procedures that would happen under the direction of the First Nations Finance Authority.  Those matters have been dealt with as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is good  legislation  and it is  indicative of the direction in which we need to move.  I spoke earlier of the individuals who have exercised leadership in bringing this forward.  Our party compliments them.  We are proud of the work   they have achieved.  We are proud to support this initiative.  We think it sets a direction for the country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other initiatives in Canada  are developing along these same lines.  Just this week I met with a very well respected aboriginal leader, Satsan Herb George, who spoke of the governance centre in Chilliwack, British Columbia.   This is a proposal that will fit quite naturally in with what is being envisioned by the legislation in front of us, Bill C-20.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we are talking about is capacity building for first nations to put themselves in a position where they will have governance structures, taxation options, finance options and fiscal management capabilities  to lift themselves up and to make social and economic progress on their reserves.  This is all very positive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For my part, I have sometimes worried about the endlessness of the debate that we are having surrounding self-government.  The many issues surrounding self-government, the meaning, the scope and the content of that term will, in gradual course, be resolved in Canada, but I think it will be resolved in the same way that other issues in our country have been resolved and that is in an evolutionary and,  I would suggest,   a conservative and cautious manner that  responds in a gradual way to the needs of our diverse Canadian community.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will make progress.  We perhaps will make it cautiously but we will make it with full regard to the consequences of the decisions that we are making.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us move forward with the legislation.  This is not legislation that  answers all of the self-government questions in this nation but it is a start . If  we adopt this legislation there will be economic and social progress in Canada for many of the first nations that  are in a position and can  decide to avail themselves of this legislation.  We will be closer to the economic independence and self-sufficiency of which Grand Chief Fontaine speaks.</p><A NAME="T1055"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1055"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1100"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1050"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1055)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1078428"></A><a HREF="#Int-1078431"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1078413"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP): </b>Mr. Speaker,    it must be simple being the aboriginal affairs critic for that party because members of that party  do not seem burdened by any contradictions or contradictions do not seem to bother them. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the one hand, the member has been waxing poetic about the importance of self-determination and self-governance, and on the other hand,  just this week we saw members of the  Conservative Party en masse vote against the most historic self-governance and self-determination land claims issue in recent history, only the second such modern land claim in the country since the Nisga'a bill which they also voted against.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all the member's quite valid language about the importance of the abolition of the Indian Act and that    successful economic development models are directly correlated to the degree of self-governance, during the clause by clause consideration of Bill C-20 in committee  he and his party voted against eight separate amendments which would have given some input into the placement of the board of directors of these new fiscal institutions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would ask him to dwell on, if he could, why he could not see fit to support changes to the appointment process in  Bill C-20, of  appointing the board of directors which would have given first nations more direction and control over who will  get these key commissioner, co-commissioner  and director positions in these new fiscal institutions.</p><A NAME="Int-1078431"></A><a HREF="#Int-1078579"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1078428"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Jim Prentice: </b>Mr. Speaker, I can confirm that it is a  pleasure to be the critic on this subject matter for  the Conservative Party. I can also confirm, as my friend has said, that it is a pleasure not to be burdened by contradiction because we are not. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our party has spoken in a principled way about the way forward. We have consulted with people in the community. We have talked with the AFN and with others. We have put forward a series of policy ideas that take the Conservative Party to the very front of what is going to happen in this country in the next 20 years in terms of the development of self-government and those are based upon a very logical, consistent and principled approach. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would point out that it is an approach that  has enjoyed a great deal of support among the aboriginal Canadians with whom I have spoken. It involves the gradual orderly elimination of the Indian Act with other legislation, which will make it possible for aboriginal Canadians to get on with their lives and to achieve social and economic progress. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are proud of where we are going. It is a program that  will enjoy support in the days ahead. I have spoken of   the need to develop a legislative framework which governs the expenditures that  the department is making on behalf of aboriginal Canadians. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would encourage my learned friend to stay involved in the debate and he will continue to be pleased with the progress that the Conservative Party is making.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to his specific question, his party brought forward a series of motions which were soundly defeated at the committee stage. The effect of those motions would have been to essentially take the good work of the respected leaders,  the respected aboriginal Canadians who  brought Bill C-20 forward to this point, and frozen it by adopting a process of consultation that would have been unworkable and would have made it impossible for the government, or frankly any government, to achieve the necessary unanimity on appointments, and that is why we did not--</p><A NAME="T1100"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1100"><!-- Hour: 11--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1105"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1055"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1100)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1078579"></A><a HREF="#Int-1078445"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1078431"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Speaker: </b>The member will have another five minutes for questions and comments after question period.</p>

Sarmite Bulte (Parkdale—High Park, Lib.): </b>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate International Human Rights Day. This date was established in 1950 by the United Nations General Assembly to honour the anniversary of the passage of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights on December 10, 1948.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The declaration is truly a remarkable document. Its 30 articles deal with the full range of human rights, including political participation, due process under law, education, property rights, and the freedom to marry among consenting spouses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While virtually every country has signed on to the declaration, we know that the practical recognition of human rights is far from universally observed. This is why it is important to celebrate and reflect on these values that are so fundamental to living a life unburdened by despotism, racism, persecution and arbitrary sanction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the people observing International Human Rights Day, I would especially like to single out our country's vibrant Tibetan community, a great many of whom live in my riding. I commend their efforts and the efforts of all their supporters in promoting human rights during this difficult period in their long history.</p>

There is no need for a new regional airport east of Toronto when Hamilton International is operating under capacity and provides a more economical and competitive option.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pickering airport proposal was first announced in 1972, but it was wisely cancelled in 1975. Why is the government allowing a bad idea to be resurrected? </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The infrastructure for a thriving airport in Hamilton is already in place. A new highway in Hamilton leading to the airport has just been opened.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rather than exploring an obviously bad idea, the government should reverse its decision and invest in Hamilton International through ACAP, the airport capital assistance program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I particularly call on the member for Hamilton East—Stoney Creek to put some action behind his words. He enjoyed media attention by announcing he was opposed to the Pickering project, yet when he was transport minister, he did absolutely nothing to halt work on the proposal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resources should be put into Hamilton International where a positive difference can be made, and not into an expensive boondoggle that makes no sense.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kodak, at its Mount Dennis location on Eglinton Avenue, has been part of the history of the former city of York, now the city of Toronto, for 100 years. During that time Kodak has been a caring and sharing corporate citizen, supporting community activities, enjoying a committed and dedicated family of employees. Kodak Canada has contributed to the international reputation that Eastman Kodak enjoyed, from traditional imaging to state of the art digital technology. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the end of a very special era. It is a very special and sad time for the Kodak family and the York South--Weston community. We are appreciative of the care that Kodak officials have expressed with respect to their employees and the transitional support that will be provided.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hostility in Canada to Christian teachings about the sanctity of the family and life has resulted in persecution here at home. The government has launched a campaign of intimidation to silence churches by dispatching tax collectors to threaten the charitable tax status of denominations who speak out against the Liberal government. This attacks the very democratic foundations of our society. The recent persecution of a Christian children's camp by the Ontario Liberal Party over its flawed and unworkable water regulations is but one example of anti-Christian actions here at home. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Governments do not like those who challenge the moral authority they claim for themselves. It is time to challenge what we believe is wrong. To quote St. Pius X, “error is approved by non-resistance, and truth is suffocated by not defending her”.</p>

<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this occasion, I want to congratulate agencies such as Bouclier d'Athéna, which provides family services specializing in intervention in domestic violence cases, as well as Arrêt-Source and Transit 24, agencies in my riding that provide help, support and companionship to women who are victims of violence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their work and dedication enable  us to make progress in the fight against this scourge.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our days and in today's society, violence against women still exists. Until we break this vicious cycle, every day will be December 6.</p>

Her three and a half year old child is still waiting to get in. Clearly his sister-in-law did not work on the immigration minister's campaign.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This person is a certified surgical nurse in her former country, but she lost that specialized job when her employers found out she was a single mother. For that reason she decided to join us here in Canada. Health care workers are needed in Cambridge, yet this professional is not certified to work here. This nurse will not quit. She wrote her nursing exams for Ontario this week. Her dream is to help Canadians, to build a better life for herself in Canada and to get her child here as soon as possible, a little girl she has not seen for over two years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My constituent wonders why Liberal campaign workers are more important than nurses. He also wonders why priorities are put on stripper programs rather than reuniting mothers with their toddlers, and nurses with patients.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the report was made public, I asked the Minister of Industry when he would act on recommendations. He stated, “Over the next couple of weeks we will be putting together the final touches on an automotive strategy for Canada”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nearly another month passed when I again pressed the minister about inaction and he said, “In terms of cabinet consideration I don't know the degree to which I can be open about that, but I would like to think that we can get feedback before Christmas”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the record,  all I want for Christmas is a Canadian auto policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CAPC report was more than two years in the making and had  significant government involvement.  The recommendations, therefore, are no surprise. We need to move on investment opportunities like the GM Beacon  project so we do not lose more investment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is time to move on the CAPC recommendations; fight back against international subsidies that steal Canadian jobs; question markets that are closed to Canadian automobile sales, yet  sell in our markets; and take this opportunity to be the pioneers of the manufacture, design and assembly of a new wave of environmentally friendly vehicles that  Canadians manufacture and assemble and have those jobs.</p>

The current procedure includes serious infringements of basic human rights, in particular, hearings at which the accused is not present and the lack of appeal. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-20, an act to provide for real property taxation powers of first nations, to create a First Nations Tax Commission, First Nations Financial Management Board, First Nations Finance Authority and First Nations Statistical Institute and to make consequential amendments to other Acts, be read the third time and passed.</p><A NAME="Int-1078812"></A><a HREF="#Int-1078826"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1078839"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. André Bellavance (Richmond—Arthabaska, BQ): </b>Mr. Speaker,  I am pleased to speak to Bill C-20, the First Nations Fiscal and Statistical Management Act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like my colleague from Louis-Saint-Laurent—the Bloc Québécois Indian Affairs and Northern Development critic—who also delivered a speech at second reading  on November 19 in favour of this bill, I agree with this act to provide for real property taxation powers of first nations, to create a First Nations Tax Commission, First Nations Financial Management Board, First Nations Finance Authority and First Nations Statistical Institute and to make consequential amendments to other Acts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bill essentially provides the first nations with financial management tools. Like many other bills, the bill being presented to this House today is not perfect, but it could help in creating a environment that would help first nations to assume their financial independence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was very important for us to support this bill to help the first nations to assume a certain financial independence or least much more  than they had in the past.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sit on the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs, Northern Development and Natural Resources with the hon. member for Louis-Saint-Laurent, and we heard from a number of first nations officials, who supported this bill, not to mention those whom we met privately, as part of our parliamentarian duties.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone knows that the Bloc Québécois cares about the self-government claims of the aboriginals, since we too have many such claims in Quebec. In fact, we prefer the term “sovereignist”. In our opinion, true self-government is achieved when a nation controls all of its economic levers. First nations that will avail themselves of the services provided under Bill C-20 will be able to play a more active role in their economy and promote private investments on their territory. This legislation will give  first nations access to tools that are already available to other levels of government and in turn access to financial markets, among other things.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we warn the federal government not to succumb to the temptation of using Bill C-20 to opt out of its fiduciary responsibilities towards aboriginal people. It remains the government's job to address inequality between aboriginals and non-aboriginals. I can assure the government that we will keep a close watch.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the benefit of the public and of those members who may not be very familiar with the bill, I should mention this legislation proposes the establishment of four financial institutions. I will explain them briefly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first one is the first nations tax commission, which will replace the  Indian taxation advisory board. It will be responsible for  the property tax rule approval process, and its streamlining will also help strike a fair balance between   the interests of the community and those of taxpayers, when rates are set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second institution is the first nations financial management board. The board will set financial standards and provide the independent and professional property assessment services required by first nations that want to take advantage of the borrowing pool of the first nations finance authority.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third institution, namely the first nations finance authority, will help first nations communities that will adhere to the legislative scheme to issue securities  collectively and to raise long term capital at preferential rates for highways, water supply systems, sewers and, of course, other infrastructure projects.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the first nations statistical institute will help all first nations communities to meet their local data needs, while encouraging participation in Statistics Canada's integrated national systems and their use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The establishment of a new financial relationship between the federal government and the first nations is nothing new. Already in 1983, the Penner report, a report by the special parliamentary committee on aboriginal self-government, recommended that the fiscal relationship between the federal government and the first nations be redefined.  The Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples made the same recommendation in 1996. Bill C-20 is a step along the road toward greater economic autonomy for first nations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is a brief historical overview of Bill C-20. Before it established a supervisory structure to administer the new legislation, the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development created the Indian Taxation Advisory Board in early 1989. In September 2003, 107 first nations began to tax real property. After the Kamloops amendments, in 1988, if I am not mistaken, a number of events strengthened the existing support for the restructuring of financial relations between the first nations and the federal government.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1991, the Department of Finance undertook a review of its policy on Indian taxation and, in 1993, made public the Working Paper on Indian Government Taxation.</p><A NAME="T1215"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1215"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1220"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1210"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1215)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1995, the First Nations Financial Institute or FNFI was created and, at the instigation of the Westbank First Nation, it was then federally incorporated. The main objective of the FNFI was to provide investment opportunities to first nations in order to ensure long-term financing of their public debt. With the adoption of Bill C-20, the FNFI will become the First Nations Finance Authority, which was discussed a bit earlier in this debate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1995, a round table of representatives from the Department of Finance and the Assembly of First Nations led to the adoption of a resolution on taxation. The following year, the participants at the annual general meeting of the Assembly of First Nations adopted resolution 5/96  supporting the establishment, between the first nations governments and the Government of Canada, of new fiscal relationships based on the principles of flexibility, equity, choice, the assurance of government services comparable to those provided by other governments, economic incentives and efficiency.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chiefs' Committee on Fiscal Relations was created two years later to review fiscal relations between first nation governments and the federal government. That is known as resolution 49/98 of the general assembly. It recommended the establishment of first nations financial institutions. In 1999, the Assembly of First Nations expressed its support for this initiative when participants in its annual general meeting supported the creation of the first nations financial authority, and backed the Indian Taxation Advisory Board's efforts to establish the first nations tax commission. Those are known as resolutions 6/99 and 7/99 respectively.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December of the same year, the federal government and the Assembly of First Nations signed a memorandum of understanding concerning the creation of a national round table on financial relationships, with the objective of establishing solid bases for these relationships through an exchange of  information, capacity building and the establishment of benchmarks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2000—we are getting closer—the Assembly of First Nations maintained its support for the creation of the first nations statistical institute and the first nations financial management board, pursuant to resolutions 5/2000 and 6/2000 of the Confederacy of Indian Nations. The general assembly then passed resolution 24/2001 supporting the recommendation by the chiefs' committee regarding the establishment of the four new first nations financial institutions by federal legislation. The legal validity of this resolution was questioned, however, since some people thought that it had not received the support of 60% of those present  required, as we know, under the charter of the Assembly of First Nations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On August 15, 2002, the Minister of  Indian  Affairs and Northern Development released a draft bill with the intent to carry out public consultations before introducing it in the House. Several first nations then raised deep concerns with the way the bill was written. Of course, the Bloc Québécois shared these same concerns.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, the AFN convened a special chiefs assembly in November 2002 and passed a resolution rejecting the proposed first nations fiscal and statistical management bill. According to Resolution 30/2002, the proposed legislation violated the historic nation to nation relationship, infringed upon aboriginal and treaty rights, and was otherwise so flawed that it could not be corrected by mere amendments.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An additional so-called accommodation resolution was also passed, that is AFN Resolution 31/2002 respecting the right of those first nations to enter into local and regional agreements, but not in the context of national legislation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On December  2, 2002, the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development tabled Bill C-19 on first nations fiscal and statistical management in the House of Commons.  That bill, which died on the Order Paper in November 2003, was reinstated as Bill C-23 on March 10, 2004. That bill also died on the Order Paper after third reading. It was reintroduced very recently, on November 2, 2004, with some significant changes. We are debating this new Bill C-20 today, after studying it for not too long, but, say, carefully in committee.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, former Bills C-19 and Bill C-23 were unacceptable both to us and to first nations.  We had concerns about the fact that the act could work against aboriginal rights and reduce the federal government's fiduciary obligations toward the first nations. We were also concerned that the institutions would only serve a few first nations. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-23, for example, like the Indian Act,  delegated tax authority to first nations communities, which came down to making aboriginal governments municipal entities, if you will, when their legitimate desire  was to enjoy greater financial autonomy.</p><A NAME="T1220"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1220"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1225"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1215"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1220)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, the preamble to Bill C-20 uses language that reflects the government's strongly municipal approach to the first nations. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to  Bill C-19, we had a number of critical comments. First, the definition of “specific claims”  was too narrow. Access to the tribunal was nearly impossible; the $7 million ceiling excluded most claims. Neither the commission nor the tribunal were independent  or impartial. The minister had the power to accept or reject claims. Finally, there was doubt about the impartiality and flexibility of the process. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, two very important changes have been made in the bill before us today. First, a schedule was added to  ensure that the legislation applies to those first nations who wish to participate, because participation is optional, something we feel is very important. Second, a non-derogation clause was included to protect the aboriginal and treaty rights of all first nations.     </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These changes ensure consistency with the Charter of the Assembly of First Nations as well as the principles of self-determination, the approach taken by the first nations, and the optionality provided for in recent resolutions of the Assembly of First Nations, which were passed in Saskatoon and ratified again in Charlottetown.   </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This economic disparity exists because some lands do not have services, investors are uncertain and the cost of starting a business is still too high.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A backgrounder produced by the First Nations Fiscal Institutions Initiative says that a dollar of first nation tax revenue buys 30% to 50% less in capital works than it does for other governments. The problem lies primarily in the legislative and institutional framework.    </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For 130 years, the Indian Act has perpetuated this state of affairs, this lack of fairness. It has prevented first nations from creating their own institutions and participating in the economy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will Bill C-20 completely correct this situation? No, but we think it is  a step in the right direction, as long, of course, as the federal government does not use this bill as a means to opt out of its financial obligations with respect to the first nations. I repeat, the government has a fiduciary obligation to the aboriginal peoples and it cannot opt out of that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are so many things to improve in the living conditions of the first nations that they will not be settled by this bill, but only through real political will exercised by the current government.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Housing conditions, education and health are inferior compared to the rest of the population. On the reserves, 65% of families live in substandard housing. The Bloc Québécois is deeply concerned about the fact that the lack of adequate, affordable housing for aboriginals has implications beyond housing standards. We know that various medical and social problems are related to poor housing conditions and quality of life. The Government of Canada must make the necessary efforts to correct the situation without offloading the problems to the first nations. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-20 will help first nations who so desire to participate significantly in their economy and encourage private investment on their lands, which is more difficult at present. First nations wanting to borrow money to develop their community infrastructure face transaction costs, processing  delays and interest rates that are far too high, even prohibitive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the positive aspects of this bill, we must not lose sight of some of the basic principles it must respect. First, will it protect the first nations' right to self-determination? Will it benefit first nations, particularly those in Quebec? Will it protect the rights of first nations  that opt out of the legislation and the obligations toward them? Will it help redress the fiscal imbalance of first nations that take advantage of this legislation? We may not get all the answers today, but we will make sure the minister does not forget these questions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the Bloc Québécois, aboriginal independence claims are very important and must be respected. Recently, with Bill C-14, we supported the aboriginal peoples' right to self-government. Bill C-14 was about the Tlicho people. This bill will help those first nations who so desire to access the financial tools they have been lacking and that the other levels of government have been using  for a long time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why we are in favour of Bill C-20.</p><A NAME="T1225"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1225"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1230"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1220"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1225)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very pleased to rise on behalf of the NDP to speak to Bill C-20. Nothing is perfect, but we see a lot of improvements in this bill over the one that was introduced in the 37th Parliament, Bill C-23. We had some very serious problems back then and thankfully people have had a chance to take another look.  This is a bill that we can live with. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important because it does a number of things. It takes a huge step forward in giving autonomous responsibility to the first nations people for their own future. At the end of the day, is that not what all people ask for, frankly around the world, to be the authors of their own destiny? In the modern world, if we do not have control of our finances, we really are limited to how much true control we have over the course in front of us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am particularly pleased in terms of the pooling aspect, which is a big part of this. It came from the experience in B.C. with the New Democratic government there working with the municipalities and the provincial government. They pooled all their money so their borrowing needs were also pooled and that meant two things. First, all municipalities had an opportunity to borrow money at one of the best rates available. That will now apply to the first nations people, assuming this bill carries and we certainly hope it does.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, it allows smaller communities or municipalities, in the case of the first nations people, to still benefit from what is usually available only to larger urban centres where they have the money and the ability to back up their borrowing needs with sufficient revenue at a very good rate. The lower rate we pay the more tax money can be applied to other important things such as health, education, environment, et cetera.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This part alone will play a significant role in assisting first nations people with a lot of their needed projects. Anyone who has visited any of the first nations reserves will know the challenges that are there. We cannot help but walk away with a heavy heart realizing how much more this country has to do for its first nations people. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This modest step forward is still significant because it will allow them a little more certainty in terms of the future: how they get there and how they are going to pay.  The fact that they have smaller numbers will not limit their ability to play the kind of role that they obviously want to play, and that the House wants to see played.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long after the bill is passed, we are going to be watching to ensure that there is no creeping paternalism in this process at all. This is meant to be an arm's-length autonomous process that allows the first nations people to make their own decisions. That means beginning with appointments to these boards and commissions and agencies, all the way through to the decisions that they make and the implementation of them. They need to be in control. We as a caucus will not stand for any kind of paternalism. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole idea is to get away from paternalism.  This is very significant to us. It is equal in fact to the money and commissions that are being created, and the ability to charge for property taxes and increase their revenues. They are all important, but if we do not move away determinedly and in a progressive fashion from the overhang of paternalism that still exists, if we are not achieving that with Bill C-20 and every other bill we deal with from here on in, then quite frankly, this House is selling a bill of goods to the first nations people. History would show that they have been sold more than bill of goods.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This needs to work for them. It needs to work for Canada.</p><A NAME="T1230"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1230"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1235"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1225"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1230)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1078836"></A><a HREF="#Int-1078848"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1078826"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Nathan Cullen (Skeena—Bulkley Valley, NDP): </b>Mr. Speaker, I wish to thank the hon. member from Hamilton for sharing his time on this very important piece of legislation that we do support. It took the government a couple of kicks at the can to get it right.    Now that it has it right, we are able to see this thing through and see the light of day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My riding of Skeena--Bulkley Valley is in the far northwest corner of British Columbia. There are a number of first nations groups in my riding. As the hon. member mentioned, when I visit the first nations, I am seeing the conditions that we would not accept in Toronto, Montreal,  or Vancouver. I am seeing the way that people are living and struggling to survive, both through acquiring education and just the basic human rights, the basic health care needs. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basic needs that all of us share are not being achieved. We hope that this bill goes some measure forward in allowing first nations to achieve and realize the same successes that many Canadians have realized over the past century.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Nisga'a people are within my riding. Recently, I had the deep and profound honour of speaking at the memorial service for one of the great Nisga'a members, Rod Robinson, who recently passed away. He was  a true giant of a man in the first nations community at the local level, across the province of British Columbia, and across our nation. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was a man who saw the importance for first nations to be full and inclusive members in Canadian society, to be proud members, and to realize among themselves the importance of self-determination.  He saw the importance of rights and title, of what it truly means to have consultation and accommodation, and the role that the federal Government of Canada plays in reaching out to first nations in a true and sincere way.  Finally, to defend the honour of the Crown, which was recently spoken to in the decision by the Supreme Court of Canada with the Haida and the Tlingit. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The federal government has this responsibility to defend the honour of the Crown. The record of the federal Government of Canada over the last 150 years has been absolutely deplorable when dealing with first nations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One has to look no further than some of the communities within my riding and the challenges that they face, the basic challenges of health and hygiene, advancement in education, and a real economy where they can strive ahead and look to the future. We believe this bill does a number of things that will allow first nations to combine their resources and go to the institutions that have the capital that they need to invest properly into their communities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My hon. colleague mentioned that this came out of the B.C. NDP government. It organized the municipalities to give them greater strength in going to the banking community and allowing them to invest in those projects that they needed to do. It was a good idea and it has been working. It has been proven to work. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that the idea was actually spurned by the Grimean Bank, an experience in the developing world. Small borrowers were able to pool their resources together, in that case to get microcredit loans, to achieve small projects and realize great benefits for their local communities. We know the repayment schedules were excellent and did very well for those communities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Nisga'a agreement was coming to fruition a number of years ago, I was not involved in politics. The member who was currently representing our riding at the time was  Reform, then Alliance, and then Conservative. The fearmongering that went on during that debate, and there were 422 amendments or something that came through in the House,  was that if this agreement went through, the economy in the northwest of British Columbia would shut down.  There was fear spread that first nations would take over and control the resources, mining would shut down, forestry would no longer exist, and that  it would all come tumbling down. The federal government was told that it should not be agreeing to this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We heard similar rhetoric just recently on the Tlicho debate in the House.  Frankly, I was embarrassed as a parliamentarian to hear the views expressed by fellow parliamentarians across the House describing the same scenario again.  They were saying that first nations will take over, that this is a terrible idea, and that we should not allow them any progress.   This is something that the government finally got agreement on from the local communities, from the major industries in the area, and from the Northwest Territories. Some members said that we should not allow this process to go ahead, that this is a bad thing for this country, and supposedly a bad thing for first nations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hypocrisy during that debate and the Nisga'a debate was deplorable. One of the reasons that I decided to enter into politics was the idea to represent my riding with such strong first nations' presence: the Haida, the Haisla, the Tlingit, the Tahltan, and the numbers go on. I wanted to come to the House to challenge those that would say that treaties are not good for first nations, that settling out and understanding how first nations are going to finally be included in the economy and the society of Canada in a meaningful way is not a worthy project. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have constantly been pushing the government to come to the treaty table with first nations with a needed sense of urgency. To this point there is this open-ended feeling that we can go on and on, and that first nations can wait for these treaties to be settled in a meaningful way.</p><A NAME="T1235"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1235"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1240"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1230"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1235)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are encouraged by this particular piece of legislation because it goes some way to push the government to allow first nations to pool their resources collectively.  Recently, we received a letter from a financial institution, a credit union in B.C., which is very supportive of this work, ready to go, and already involved in projects of this nature. These are sometimes basic health care projects or economic projects.  This is something that we are working collectively with our first nations brothers and sisters to finally get the issue pushed forward.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was 15 years ago that we passed a resolution in the House to end child poverty in this country.  We have been completely unable to do that. The statistics within the country are deplorable with respect to child poverty. It is a shame upon this House. If we move to the case of first nations, the case becomes much worse. Whatever indicator we look at, the first nations situation in Canada today is so much less, so much poorer than all other Canadians. If there is anything that we can do in the House to improve those conditions, both on and off reserve for first nations across the country, then our party will always be in support of it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my riding there is a beautiful example of first nations working together. Seven nations came together to work on a totem pole.  From all living memory that we could decipher, there had been no instance of  these first nations working together collectively on something as important and significant as the raising of a totem pole.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through much deliberation and in conjunction with a community college with a non-aboriginal board of directors, they were able to come together, work with the communities, and find a place where they could work on this totem pole. Each group had to decide what it was going to bring to the pole. Some weeks ago they raised it together, pulled on the ropes together with the non-aboriginal community in Terrace, B.C.  They raised this magnificent and stunning work which represents how first nations can work together with the non-aboriginal community to achieve something beautiful, historic and monumental.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can apply that same feeling, that same willingness to work together across the nations with the non-aboriginal community and sincere feeling from government, to achieve even greater things, such as justice within our time, and some sense of pride when we look to the first nations communities and know that Canadians are doing well by our first nations brothers and sisters.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we can say to our children that we were involved in a process that finally remedied the abuses and the misconduct of the federal government toward first nations people.  That will be a very proud day for us. That is a day that we need to all work toward collectively.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one more important concern. As we move toward this, some nations have expressed  concern that the federal government will be abdicating some of its responsibility toward first nations, that it will be turning it over to the private sector. We will be looking very strongly throughout the implementation of this piece of legislation to ensure that the federal government maintains its importance. The Haida case and the Tlicho case point clearly to the federal government's role.  It must be the one that consults with first nations, that works with true and proper accommodation of first nations' rights and title. That is the role of the federal government.  That is the role that we must maintain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While this is innovative, progressive, and born out of the provincial New Democrats, a place where many progressive, new and innovative things have come,  we support it. The federal government must maintain its place at the table and must increase its sense of urgency to finally and completely settle first nations claims.</p><A NAME="T1240"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1240"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1245"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1235"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1240)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1078848"></A><a HREF="#Int-1078891"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1078836"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Speaker: </b>Is the House ready for the question?</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House resumed from December 7 consideration of the motion.</p><A NAME="Int-1078867"></A><a HREF="#Int-1078874"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1078856"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Newton—North Delta, CPC): </b>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise on behalf of the constituents of Newton—North Delta to participate in the debate on Bill C-27, which is an act to regulate and prohibit certain activities related to food and other products to which the acts under the administration of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency apply, and to provide for the administration and enforcement of those acts and to amend other acts in consequence.  The short title of the bill is  the Canadian Food Inspection Agency Enforcement Act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intent of this proposed legislation is to consolidate, modernize and enhance the inspection and enforcement powers of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency. The bill seeks to provide the CFIA with the basic inspection and enforcement tools that it needs to continue protecting Canada's food supply and animal and plant resource base. It is intended to allow CFIA inspectors to do their jobs more effectively and efficiently and to provide Canada with modern border enforcement tools that will be more consistent with  recent American legislation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-27 consolidates inspection and enforcement provisions from the eight acts that form the current legislative base for the CFIA.  Those eight acts are: the Canada Agriculture Products Act; the Fish Inspection Act; the Meat Inspection Act; the Seeds Act; the Feeds Act; the Fertilizers Act; the Health of Animals Act; and the Plant Protection Act. These acts were introduced by different departments over the course of many years. Some date back as far as the 1940s and 1950s.  These acts have been around for a long time, and   the department thought it would try to integrate, consolidate and modernize the food inspection legislation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government responsibility for food in Canada is divided among the federal, 10 provincial, three  territorial and numerous municipal governments.  Some 77 pieces of legislation govern Canada's food inspection among the three  levels of government. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Federal responsibility centres on export and interprovincial trade, protecting and expanding export markets for Canadian food products and facilitating interprovincial trade.  In addition, the federal government sets food safety, quality and grading standards for products sold interprovincially and internationally. It   administers regulations aimed at preventing the production or sale in Canada of dangerous, adulterated or misbranded products.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provinces and municipalities are responsible for the intra-provincial aspects of the food industry, including local food processing, the food service industry and the food retail industry. They decide whether and how to inspect local operations, including restaurants and grocery stores, as well as dairies and meat plants whose products are sold within the province.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Food Inspection Agency is the result of the amalgamation in 1997 of food safety and inspection programs from three federal departments: Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, Health Canada and the Fisheries and Oceans Canada. The establishment of a single agency followed a long history of discussions about the benefits of consolidating the federal food inspection system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following are some of the  reasons for creating the CFIA. Industry and government favoured harmonized standards and streamlined inspection to ensure the competitiveness of the Canadian food industry domestically, as well as internationally. Canadian producers and processors were vulnerable to trade challenges in a fragmented system. Closer integration of the U.S. and Canadian markets under free trade agreements made the industry anxious to reduce the costs and inefficiencies resulting from differing provincial standards.  Canadian exporters were concerned about being denied access to external markets on the grounds that Canadian food safety standards and inspection systems were not equivalent to those of the markets into which they were shipping.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The agency's main activities focus on inspecting the   food supply, but it also conducts activities related to animal health and plant protection.  The agency is responsible for delivering federal inspection programs that enforce these policies and standards.  Bill C-27 is basically a housekeeping bill, but that  does not mean  it is without fault.  It has flaws.</p><A NAME="T1250"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1250"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1255"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1245"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1250)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My main concern is that the bill does not incorporate any aspect of accountability for fair and effective enforcement on the part of the CFIA.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Food inspection is absolutely essential to Canadians.  We want to have faith in the food we eat.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Large quantities of foodstuffs, for example, rice or some indigenous foods, are imported into Canada by Canadian firms from  China, India and many other countries. Many of the foods are from different communities in their country of origin.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of these foods are accepted into the United States but normally they are not accepted into Canada.  The criteria used in decisions often appear to be arbitrary and unfair.  The importers or business people are catering to a huge multicultural market in Canada and are unable to import foods which are easily imported into the United States of America,   our neighbour and  largest trading partner.  We need to look into that aspect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The root cause is the regulatory process.   Since my election to this chamber in 1997, I have taken a particular interest in regulatory reform and in reducing  red tape.  I have been the co-chair of the Standing Joint Committee on the Scrutiny of Regulations and have succeeded in passing a private member's bill, of course with the cooperation of all members in the House. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That bill  provides parliamentarians with an opportunity to disallow any federal statutory instruments that are illegal, redundant or that are not supposed to be there, even ones that originate from government agencies like the CFIA which we are talking about today. I also organized a conference on regulatory reform and have authored numerous op-eds on the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me talk about Bill C-205 which was one of, I think,  1,700 bills that have been introduced in the House since I was elected.  I was lucky to have  the cooperation of some members from the opposite side as well.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to the passage of my bill, Parliament was powerless to revoke hundreds of regulations written by government agencies like the CFIA, the CRTC and many other agencies.  In other words, the quasi-government organizations or agencies have been delegated the power to make regulations.  When Parliament delegated the power to  them to make the regulations, parliamentarians  did not have the power to review, scrutinize or disallow the regulations which many times contradicted the original intent of the legislation. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a big black hole in the accountability for many years before the passage of this most important private member's bill.  As a result of the passage of that bill, all the regulations that are made in Canada by different agencies now come under the purview of Parliament.  The Standing Joint Committee on the Scrutiny of Regulations has demanded to review and scrutinize some of those.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am therefore interested to see that Bill C-27 seeks to support the government's so-called smart regulation strategy by providing more consistent inspection and enforcement powers; providing a wider range of regulatory instruments; simplifying and streamlining the regulatory process; and contributing to the increased harmonization of  legislation and regulations, to reduce overlap. Sometimes regulations are not consistent with those of our largest trading partner. The bill seeks to  contribute to the regulatory cooperation with the United States, our largest trading partner.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bill is long overdue.  The Canadian Food Inspection Agency was created in 1997 to combine all federal food inspection, animal, plant and health services into a single inspection agency.  The legislative basis for the agency should have been updated at that time or shortly thereafter, not after seven years. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though the government has had more than ample time to prepare the legislation, it is still not without flaws.  Therefore, I am concerned that the bill  does not incorporate any aspect of accountability for fair and effective enforcement.  It fails to address accountability for frivolous or false detainment and destruction of products and materials.  Without such accountability, I will not be able to support the bill. I look forward to meaningful amendments to the bill.</p><A NAME="T1255"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1255"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1300"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1250"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1255)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1078874"></A><a HREF="#Int-1078875"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1078867"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Speaker: </b>Is the House ready for the question?</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said:   Mr. Speaker, I rise today with great pleasure and honour to speak to Motion No. 193.   This is the  first private member's motion that I have had the opportunity to present in the House. As such, I have chosen to put forward an issue for debate that is very important to both me and my constituents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My riding of Desnethé—Missinippi—Churchill River is geographically one of the largest in the country, covering the northern half of my province of Saskatchewan.  It accounts for 58% of the land mass of the province.  It is an area larger than the country of Germany and nearly the size of France.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Existing in my massive and remote riding are over 30 first nations and 108 individual Indian reserves, the most of any riding in the country. My riding is made up of over 50% of people of aboriginal ancestry.  Representing them is a responsibility I take seriously.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe it is an indisputable fact that aboriginal veterans were not treated fairly or equitably upon their return from serving their country during World War I, World War II and the Korean War. When these soldiers were overseas they were treated the same. Aboriginal and non-aboriginal trained together, fought together and, in too many cases, died together. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They say that there are no atheists in foxholes. During Canada's wars, among the soldiers at least, there were no skin colours in combat. These men served shoulder to shoulder and spent the most harrowing moments of their lives relying on each other for their survival. Often these men would serve together for years on end, seeing more of each other than they did of their own families, becoming truly bands of brothers. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These soldiers served heroically and with great distinction, winning battles from Vimy to Juno Beach to Ortona.   Many aboriginals and non-aboriginals alike lie buried together in war cemeteries across Europe and in the countries in which they gave their lives to free from tyranny and oppression.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why were these brave soldiers treated differently when they returned to Canada? There have been many different explanations offered, but it basically comes back to the same thing: systemic and deep rooted discrimination within the institutions of the Government of Canada.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like their comrades in arms, first nations veterans looked forward to re-establishing themselves back home with the generous benefits of the Veterans Charter provided by a grateful nation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In theory, first nations veterans were eligible for and entitled to exactly the same benefits as any other returning servicemen, with the exception of the Veterans Land Act special provisions for settlement on Indian reserve land. In practice, however, a number of systemic factors inhibited the ability of first nations veterans to obtain adequate, timely and accurate information, as well as unbiased counselling, about the complex array of benefits for which they might apply. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, these veterans faced bureaucratic delays and complications which, when combined with the differential economies of scale found in the benefits of the Veterans Land Act, meant first nations veterans faced a steeper uphill struggle for post-war re-establishment than other veterans.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point I would like to go through some of the specifics regarding the lack of equal treatment faced by first nations veterans. I will start with the Veterans Land Act and move on to the lack of access to an administration of veterans benefits for first nations veterans, then discuss problems with dependents allowances and assigned pay.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to note as well that much of the initial research on these topics was done by Dr. R. Scott Sheffield and laid out in a major report conducted for the national round table on first nations veterans issues back in April 2001.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Veterans Land Act was one of the primary re-establishment options, enabling qualified veterans to settle on a piece of land and take up agriculture, either as a full time occupation or as an income supplement on a smallholding hobby farm. Originally the act provided loans of $4,800, of which $1,200 was for the purchase of equipment, at a low interest rate of 3.5%.  However, by war's end the maximum had been expanded to $6,000, all of which could be used to acquire land. If the loan was repaid on schedule and in full, the government was prepared to forgive the last $2,320 of the $6,000.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First nations veterans were eligible in theory to apply under the VLA off reserve and be considered on the same basis as other veterans. Realistically, however, there were obstacles that made such an event unlikely, something that was acknowledged by the Veterans Affairs Department in a notice from the director in 1945.  It stated:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>The average Indian veteran may be confronted with a practical difficulty in seeking qualification papers from the responsible committees set up for the purpose, who may be expected to feel some diffidence about qualifying an Indian for establishment on the land on a debt basis. In other words it is feared that few Indians could qualify under the conditions set by the Act.</small></td>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first nations veterans lack of a credit rating, combined with discriminatory stereotypes among the wider population, probably would have blocked many from obtaining VLA grants off reserve.  The dubious opportunities for first nations veterans to settle outside reserves clearly would not have helped many first nations soldiers who would have undoubtedly gone back to their reserve communities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, under the existing VLA, legal hurdles remained that barred the act's extension to reserve lands.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, since title to reserve land was held by the crown for the use and benefit of the band for which it was set apart, the VLA director was prohibited from holding title to it as required under the act. Second, the individual land allotment was not legally equivalent to a veteran owning a piece of land off reserve in fee simple.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An amendment to the VLA was passed in 1945 to get around these legal obstructions, which created  section 35A.  Under this section, a grant of up to $2,320 could be provided to qualified veterans on reserve.  A first nations veteran required a location ticket to a specific tract of reserve land and a band resolution to confirm his ownership of the land to quality. Though the $2,320 was not equivalent to the $6,000, the Indian affairs branch argued that this deficiency was balanced somewhat by “the more favourable conditions that existed on reserve”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First nations veterans were understandably angered at being barred from the loan provisions of the VLA and skeptical about the so-called advantages of reserve conditions, particularly as it involved having the Indian affairs branch and their  Indian agents directly handling their cases.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to government records, more than 4,000 veterans settled off reserve on crown lands with the help of the same level of assistance as on reserve farmers, with a maximum $2,320 conditional grant as compared to the $6,000 for non-aboriginal veterans.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of factors worked against first nations veterans who attempted to re-establish themselves under the VLA.  With regard to those who wanted to undertake farming on a full time basis, the immediate challenges they faced had to do with economies of scale.  For several reasons, the average size of farm that first nations veterans could secure was substantially smaller than could be obtained off reserve.  As an example, we can look at Alberta where many veterans, first nations and otherwise, pursued full time agriculture under the VLA.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grain farms totalling a full section of 640 acres of land would not have been considered out of the norm in the immediate post-war period.  There is no evidence available of a first nations reserve farmer receiving a land allotment for more than a quarter section, or 160 acres, and some were closer to half that size.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is more, the limited land base on many reserves proved a serious obstacle for expanding their operations.  The government recognized that VLA farmers required access to more capital if they were to continue expanding their operations, and in 1954 passed an amendment to the act providing farm improvement loans. Sadly, these loans were inaccessible to first nations veterans because of the fact that they were loans.  The result was that many first nations farmers were never able to build prosperous agricultural operations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second area of inequality was with regard to access to and administration of veterans benefits for first nations veterans.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First nations servicemen were generally told to return to the reserve and see their Indian agents about benefits as opposed to non-aboriginal veterans who fell under the jurisdiction of the veterans affairs department. From this point forward, first nations veterans received differential treatment from the norm.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon return to Canada, after their service was complete, non-aboriginal veterans were entitled to apply for either a re-establishment credit, which was equal in value to the basic war service gratuity, or instead a choice for agricultural re-establishment,  that is  the Veterans Land Act,  which I have discussed, and education and training opportunities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall first nations veterans faced systematic disadvantages, not faced by most other veterans, in obtaining information, counselling and applications for all the options that were open to them. In addition, the Indian affairs branch and the Indian Act added an extra layer of bureaucracy and regulations between first nations veterans and their re-establishment. The resulting delays and complications created hardship for some veterans and frustration for many more.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One example of the systematic problems faced by first nations veterans should be pointed out in detail, namely, the fact that much of the information that was disseminated on the benefits available to veterans through the Veterans Charter was distributed through posters and pamphlets in legion halls and advertisements on radio and in the newspaper.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was particularly problematic for first nations veterans as the discriminatory provisions of the Indian Act prohibited first nations veterans from entering legion halls as these establishments served alcohol.  As for radios, at that time very few existed on post-war Indian reserves and the high rates of illiteracy meant that newspapers were of little use either, assuming a reserve community even received them. In many cases this left a first nations veteran with only the Indian agent as a source of information and advice about veterans benefits.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a number of reasons, this dependence on the Indian agent and Indian affairs to supply accurate details of programs and unbiased advice in a timely and efficient fashion proved unfortunate, to put it mildly.  There is evidence that many Indian agents did not fully understand the complex array of programs available under the Veterans Charter, and also that the Indian affairs bureaucracy was incapable of even disseminating all the information to the Indian agents.  Even assuming that the Indian agents were knowledgeable, there is evidence that many did not tell first nations veterans under their jurisdiction of all available options, but rather what the agent thought they should receive.</p><A NAME="T1305"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1305"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1310"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1300"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1305)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third area of unequal treatment for first nations veterans is with regard to the dependents' allowances and assigned pay. The clearest case of discrimination came in the Dependents' Allowance Board's unilateral decision to reduce allowances to first nations dependants residing on a reserve unless under the direct administration of the Indian agent. Beyond this, the initial separate system established for administering first nations dependants, which simply placed the cheques in the hands of the Indian agents with few guidelines and no accounting procedures, created a lot of opportunities for mismanagement, abuse of power and fraud. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even when stricter measures were put in place to keep track of the money due to first nations dependants, some Indian agents were still circumventing the process. It is difficult to determine exactly how much money that first nations dependants lost out upon, but it is clear that funds due to these people were never received.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly, without any doubt, first nations veterans were not treated equally with their non-aboriginal comrades in arms. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation regarding Métis veterans is somewhat less clear, largely owing to inadequate records kept by both the defence department as well as by the veterans affairs department. Veterans Affairs claims to have identified the records of 174 Métis veterans, even though individual soldiers were not allowed to identify as Métis when they signed up for service. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Métis Veterans Association states that there are approximately 2,000 Métis veterans who fought in World War II and in Korea, and refutes the department's claim that these veterans have been sufficiently identified and compensated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a recent meeting of the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development, Métis Nation Veterans Affairs official, David Chartrand, spoke of how Métis people were working to identify and record living Métis veterans from the second world war and  Korea. Mr. Chartrand made clear that the 174 figure quoted by the department was far too low. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear that when many Métis veterans returned from the war, they faced many of the same hurdles and problems faced by first nations veterans. Most returned to their remote home communities, many in my riding, where information on programs and benefits available was non-existent. Many of these veterans returned to their traditional occupations of trapping, fishing and hunting, and lived on remote traplines deep in the wilderness of norther Saskatchewan and northern Alberta. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the National Métis Veterans Association, less than 3% of the identified Métis veterans received one of the three key programs of the Veterans charter: land, education or the re-establishment grants.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people have asked me why I chose to bring this motion forward, the first piece of private member's business I have had the opportunity to present before the House. The answer is that the way aboriginal veterans were treated by this country when they returned is one of the great historical injustices of our time. The fact is that we do not have much time left to make this injustice right. There are only 2,000 first nations veterans left, and an even small number of Métis veterans left. This motion calls for compensation for these veterans because they are owed it as  a simple matter of equality, but to be honest, the veterans with whom  I have spoken   do not even care about the money. What they desire is an acknowledgement that they were treated unfairly, and a thank you from this country, a country  they fought and died for. They are asking for recognition and for their dignity, something we owe them in spades.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some will say that compensating these veterans fairly will cost too much. To that I say that if anybody in this country deserves compensation from the government, it is those who fought to defend our freedom. If the government can find seemingly limitless money for gun registries and sponsorship programs, surely it can find some funding to compensate 3,000 to 4,000 men who put their lives on the line to defend our values and future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some will also argue that first nations veterans have already been compensated and will refer to the $20,000 payout to first nations veterans in the aftermath of the national round table on first nations veterans issues. To that I will say that a take it or leave it offer by the government for a sum that was literally picked out of thin air is hardly sufficient compensation. How much is enough? That should be determined in consultation with veterans groups.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is interesting to note that of the 2,000 first nations veterans identified for compensation in 2002, only 1,100 have ever received a dime. Indeed, I would go so far as to say that the impression that the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Indian Affairs that I get is that they are simply trying to play for time and run out the clock. They know as well as anybody that time is not on the veterans' side  and that soon there will be no veterans left to compensate. This was certainly the impression I got when department officials testified before the aboriginal affairs committee earlier this year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will conclude with the words of Mr. Edgar Borchert, a World War II veteran and president of the National Métis Veterans Association, who  testified before the aboriginal affairs committee on November 4, 2004.</p><A NAME="T1310"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1310"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1315"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1305"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1310)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the aboriginal affairs critic for our party, I speak in support of the motion. I have been around these sorts of issues for many years.  I served as a commissioner of the Indian Claims Commission of Canada for 10 years, and for 8 or 9 of those years  as a co-chair. I must say how proud I am of the  hon. member,  as I have watched him do  his work as a member of the House and   watched his attempt  to advance claims for fairness and justice for aboriginal people. He has been a great advocate at committee and has been a great advocate in the House. We all owe him a debt of gratitude for the fine work that he has been doing on behalf of aboriginal Canadians and the people of his constituency, and I thank him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion is one that involves acknowledgement, recognition and dignity to a group of men and women who have served this country with distinction and who when they returned from military service found that they were not treated in the same way. In particular, I was struck by the testimony which I read of members of the military, veterans who said that while they were in service as aboriginal Canadians, it was the first time in their lives that they were treated in a way that measured up in terms of respect and equality. They were treated wonderfully as members of the Canadian service. The problems began when they returned to Canada and found themselves again under the thumb of the Department of Indian and Northern Affairs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stories that we heard at committee with respect to the treatment of those people would not make any Canadian proud. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question I have for the  hon. member concerns  how   this matter came  before the House.   It was before the committee at an earlier time. What has brought this motion before the House? Why is it here? Could he explain that to Canadians?</p><A NAME="T1315"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1315"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1320"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1310"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1315)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1078903"></A><a HREF="#Int-1078914"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1078901"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Jeremy Harrison: </b>Mr. Speaker,  the hon. member for Calgary Centre-North   has been a tremendous advocate for first nations people and  has done an outstanding job as the critic for aboriginal affairs and northern development for the Conservative Party.  He brings a great deal of compassion and an incredible amount of knowledge to the table on these issues.  He has done a fantastic job and I say that with all sincerity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to explain how this particular motion came before the House.   After hearing incredibly moving testimony at the aboriginal affairs committee about the differential treatment of aboriginal veterans, the hon. member for Calgary Centre-North  put forward a motion at the end of one of those meetings calling on the government to recognize  the  inappropriate treatment of aboriginal veterans  and to thank them for their service. The motion  was supported by both the Bloc Québécois and the NDP, to their great credit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, the government, for whatever reason,  was not in support of the motion.  The Liberals delayed   and refused to allow the motion,  a very simple motion recognizing what are facts and  thanking  these veterans for their service and thanking  them on behalf of Canada, to come to a vote.   </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberals put on this show in front of   distinguished veterans and representatives of veterans groups from across the country.  I must say that  I was truly offended at what happened in committee on that day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For that reason I thought if this could not  be dealt with in committee then it had  to be something that the entire House had  deal with.  If the Liberals wanted to put on a show in front of Canadians and make a mockery of the sacrifice of the service provided by these veterans, then they could  do that  in the House of Commons in front of Canadians so they could  see how they act. </p><A NAME="Int-1078914"></A><a HREF="#Int-1078911"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1078903"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. David McGuinty (Ottawa South, Lib.): </b>Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure  to respond to the motion this afternoon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I  commend the member for his efforts in keeping this issue alive but, unfortunately, I think many of the things that he has put  forward in the motion are somewhat misguided and not always reliant entirely on the facts in terms of what the government has been doing in this regard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The history of first nations, Métis and Inuit military service is quite remarkable and, when called, of course  Canada's aboriginal veterans answered the call by the thousands.  They served nobly in all three major wars of the last century.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first world war, with its trench warfare, its poison gas and its machine guns, destroyed virtually a full generation of young Canadian men.  Among them were at least 300 aboriginal Canadian soldiers.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over four years, aboriginal Canadian soldiers participated and earned medals for valour in practically every major land battle.</p>
<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than 200 native Canadian  soldiers were killed or died from their wounds during the second world war. Natives earned a minimum of 18 decorations for bravery in action. They participated in every major battle and campaign, including the disastrous Dieppe landings and the pivotal Normandy invasion. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They also served in one of the worst imaginable theatres, Hong Kong, where just under 2,000 members of the Winnipeg Grenadiers and the Royal Rifles of Canada became prisoners of war of the Japanese. Included among them were at least 16 Indians and Métis, nine of whom died from wounds or illness.</p><A NAME="T1320"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1320"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1325"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1315"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1320)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Korea would see our aboriginal veterans answer the call to service as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is for such service that all Canadians want to see that aboriginal veterans are treated with fairness and justice.  If and where there has been elements of unfairness over time, we want to take steps to correct that unfairness.  The government believes it has done just that.</p>
<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In February 2000, some federal ministers invited the aboriginal veterans to come and discuss the treatment they received during and after the wars.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Round Table on First Nations Veterans Issues was created with the first nations veterans. Discussions took place with the National Métis Veterans Association on the subject of Métis veterans, and the National Aboriginal Veterans Association agreed to take part in a research project on the fate of non-status  Indian veterans after the wars.</p>
<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grievances of aboriginal veterans relating to their treatment during and after the wars are very complex and have been examined and discussed many times in various fora over the recent past. The member opposite knows this full well.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At each discussion, the complexities become even more apparent.  They are difficult matters to grasp, partially because they invariably require an understanding of issues that originated decades ago. A reading of history decades later can give rise to all sorts of legitimate misunderstandings and misinterpretations. In that reading, we are faced with different perspectives of different parties, which makes it difficult to respond in a manner that satisfies everyone.</p>
<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to look at these issues in their context, we should examine the history of veterans' benefits offered to all who served in wartime. Here they are, in broad terms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every veteran who was honourably discharged was eligible for a war service allowance and a clothing allowance. In addition, if they met the eligibility criteria, veterans could choose one of the following options: first, a re-establishment credit , second, educational assistance, including retraining allowances, or third, assistance under the Veterans Land Act. </p>
<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am going to leave it to my colleagues to speak to some of the more substantial detail about how the application of these demobilization benefits played out over time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no denying that for decades aboriginal veterans, that is to say first nations, Métis, non-status and Inuit, have felt that they were not treated fairly by the Government of Canada after the wars.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I mentioned earlier, to better understand and respond to the concerns of first nations veterans, the federal government established a national round table in February 2000. Provisions were made for first nations veterans to research how various departments dealt with their requests for demobilization benefits after the wars, including, of course, Veterans Affairs Canada and Indian and Northern Affairs. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The round table also focused on collecting oral testimonies from first nations veterans, identifying acts, policies and programs available to veterans and to their spouses during and after the wars and of course gathering data on the names of first nations veterans.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt from file reviews, research and discussions of the round table that first nations veterans received the demobilization benefits to which they were entitled after the wars. However, those who chose to return to their reserve communities after the wars had to deal with an extra layer of bureaucracy in order to receive their demobilization benefits. Veterans Affairs Canada provided the benefits for first nations veterans on reserve to their Indian agents, who in turn were to provide the benefits to the veterans.</p><A NAME="T1325"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1325"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1330"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1320"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1325)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to the report presented by the national round table, on June 21, 2002, the Government of Canada announced that it would provide $20,000 to each living first nations veteran who returned to a reserve after the wars or their living spouse.</p>
<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon. members might recall that when the previous minister of veterans affairs made the announcement in the House, members of all political parties applauded the announcement.  This tax free amount of $20,000 was, after all, consistent with other lump sum packages offered to other veterans' groups by the Government of Canada.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Veterans Affairs Canada and Indian and Northern Affairs Canada have worked with the national round table working group in order to get the message out about the federal offer to the various first nations communities. Although the original application date closed on February 15, 2003, late applications have still been accepted. To date, 1,195 ex gratia payments have indeed been made.</p>
<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation of Métis and non-status Indian veterans is not the same as that of first nations veterans who returned to the reserves, because they did not have to deal with a third party. Furthermore, access to assistance provided under the Veterans' Land Act had not been complicated by issues of inalienable reserves located on Crown land.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The federal government nonetheless established a separate process to deal with these concerns.</p>
<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Substantial funding was provided to the National Métis Veterans Association and the National Aboriginal Veterans Association to deal with issues concerning Métis and non-status Indian veterans respectively. It was used to pursue fact-finding discussions to investigate what happened to these veterans after the wars, to compile listings of  Métis and non-status Indian veterans, and to collaborate with government in researching their post-war experiences.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evidence to date indicates that these veterans opted for and received the same demobilization benefits as other veterans. Should  aboriginal veterans feel that they  did not receive  demobilization benefits they were entitled to after the wars, they should contact the department and their files will be reviewed on an individual basis.</p>
<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the wording of Motion M-193 suggests that first nations, Métis and Inuit war veterans are in the same situation when it comes to compensation for veterans, it is appropriate to provide some information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The offer of ex-gratia payments provided to first nations veterans  was based in part on the fact that many of them who returned to the reserves after the wars were unable to deal directly with the Department of Veterans Affairs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the round table found that because of the extra layer of bureaucracy, the veterans did not receive all the benefits to which they were entitled.</p>
<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was not the case for Métis and other aboriginal veterans.  Veterans Affairs Canada has precise records of the demobilization benefits paid directly to these veterans.  Extensive file reviews have shown that the benefits paid to these veterans were the same as the benefits paid to non-aboriginal veterans.  Of course, Veterans Affairs Canada will be pleased to review the files of any aboriginal veterans who feel they did not receive the benefits that were their due.</p>

</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all fairness, we must also recognize the hon. member for Winnipeg Centre, who initiated this motion in the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs, Northern Development and Natural Resources on November 4. The hon. member for Louis-Saint-Laurent, the Bloc Québécois' aboriginal affairs critic, and I also supported this motion on behalf of the Bloc Québécois. This motion was finally introduced in committee by the hon. member for Calgary Centre-North. I also recognize his efforts in this cause.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I confirm completely the claims of the hon. member for Desnethé—Missinippi—Churchill River when he related what happened in the committee in front of the first nations and Métis veterans. At the end of the committee meeting, in front of these people, the Liberals started to hesitate and to not want to recognize everything these veterans had done for us in wartime. It was a bit of a  disgrace and we strongly condemn their attitude.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why I am recognizing today the initiative of the member, who agreed to introduce such a motion to right, so to speak, this wrong. I hope that, this time, the Liberals will listen to reason.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that committee meeting, we had heard from the following witnesses: David Chartrand, of the Manitoba Metis Federation, the Métis National Council, and Edgar Borchert, president of the National Métis Veterans Association. I said then that it was thanks to people like them, veterans who had fought for our freedom and our democracy, that we are able to lead the lives we are living today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that approximately 3,000 members of our first nations fought for Canada during the second world war, and that several hundred fought in Korea. Unfortunately, approximately 500 of them lost their lives. Other historical facts have been confirmed. First nations veterans did not receive the same compensation as other veterans. This is called discrimination. Those who were compensated were excluded from programs the other veterans were entitled to, such as spousal support, training, or even employment assistance. The Métis were treated even worse: they got nothing at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2000, as hon. members know, the federal committee recommended that each aboriginal who fought for the country receive $120,000 in compensation. However, that amount was awarded to Hong Kong and merchant navy veterans. It is not that they did not deserve the compensation, far from it, but we do not understand why the recommendation was not applied to aboriginals. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two years later, as we all know, $20,000 in compensation was given by the federal government, and this is totally inadequate. It does not in any way correct the injustice that was created at the time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our opinion, Canada violated  the international covenant on civil and political rights. This is continued discrimination.   I said in committee, and I am saying it again today in this House.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also remember what Mr. Borchert replied, when I put my question to him. He said: </p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

They are simply looking at a government that has marginalized them since Canada began. But we have been there at every battle—Seven Oaks, Nile Voyageurs, the Fenian raids. We have always been there with Canada.</small></td>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He continued his testimony by saying that he would like “to see the government at least say thank you”. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Métis war veterans suffered many humiliations. Some of them had difficulty getting basic medication, necessities such as hearing aids, and some of them were even denied a military funeral. The Métis, first nations or Inuit war veterans were left to fend for themselves by the federal government.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As evidence of this, I can mention the $20,000 per person agreement that the Liberal member who spoke before me praised. Hon. members will agree that this is a totally inadequate agreement that was proposed after years of negotiations, and following threats of legal proceedings on the part of the aboriginals who fought during World War II and the Korean war. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Worse still, Métis soldiers of European and aboriginal descent, and non-status Indians living off reserve were excluded from the agreement. Members opposite do not boast about this. The war veterans who accepted the agreement had to waive their right to initiate proceedings against the government. Being now close to 80 years of age, several of them, needless to say, accepted the offer, rather than continue to fight for justice. </p><A NAME="T1330"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1330"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1335"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1325"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1330)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remind the House that, in 2000, a committee appointed by the federal government recommended that compensation of $120,000 be provided to each of the aboriginal veterans. At the time, just under 2,000 people—that is 1,800 in total, 800 veterans and 1,000 spouses— were entitled to this compensation from Ottawa, which represented just under $40 million for the federal government.  The motion is aimed at correcting this injustice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain historical facts deserve to be mentioned. After the second world war, veterans, identified as Indian veterans, were penalized in the administration of section 39(1) of the Veterans Land Act, titled Indian Veterans. An application for assistance under the Veterans Land Act contained a number of provisions which did not apply to veterans of non-Indian status. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, section 39(2) stated:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>An Indian veteran shall submit reasonable evidence that he is personally fit and able to carry on the occupation by which he proposes to gain his livelihood and that by reason of his character, habits, knowledge and experience, he is capable of carrying on that occupation successfully.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The families of first nations soldiers received the same allowance that non-aboriginal soldiers did; however, in 1941-42, certain allowances were placed under the control of the local Indian agent. From then on, the first nations soldiers and their dependents had to invest in Indian trust funds if they wanted to maximize their benefits.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First nations Canadians actively contributed to the national war effort by working in factories and by increasing agricultural production on their reserves. Furthermore, they handed over their reserves, so the land could be used for airports, firing ranges and    defence posts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contribution of first nations women to the war effort deserves special attention. They cared for sick and wounded soldiers and took part in patriotic leagues as well as Red Cross societies. They also collected food, money and clothing for overseas expeditions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some first nations Canadians enrolled in the United States army during both world wars because the Americans offered better wages and there was less discrimination. First nations Canadians who joined American units and moved to the United States were eligible to receive the U.S. war veterans allowance.   However, it must be said that the United States did not have special provisions for  so-called “treaty Indians”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industrialization and urbanization, the opening of remote areas, and better communication in the post second world war era did not benefit aboriginal Canadians. Aboriginal soldiers earned a minimum of 17 decorations for bravery during the second world war, participating in every major battle and campaign, including the Dieppe landings and the Normandy invasion. There were also at least 16 Indians and Métis in the Hong Kong force; nine died from wounds or illness as prisoners of war.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During both world wars, enlistment of aboriginals was encouraged by the government, and the response was far greater than their pre-war treatment merited. There was enduring patriotism among aboriginal veterans and their families, in spite of wartime sacrifices. Most viewed their war service with pride, although there was some bitterness and anger lingering from neglect in their history.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aboriginal Canadians, strongly encouraged to enlist, paid a significant toll in killed, wounded and sick. In contrast to their countrymen, who made political and economic gains, the situation of many Aboriginals remained the same. Their sacrifice achieved very little for them politically, economically or socially in post-war years. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As indicated thus far, the Government of Canada failed almost entirely in establishing legislation or regulations and procedures which took into account the special circumstances of aboriginal veterans.  Using the re-establishment credit available to other veterans as a basis, it should be both feasible and appropriate for the Government of Canada to establish a figure for compensation based on the amounts available as War Service Grants Act or Re-establishment Credits, but recalculated in regard to a formula for investment yield based on a term extending from 1945 to 2002.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first nations veterans package compensated a number of veterans but not all, and not always  fairly and equitably. This was obvious from the remarks of my hon. colleagues from the Conservative Party.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aboriginal, Métis and Inuit veterans want the federal government to recognize that they served their country honourably in major conflicts. They demand equitable treatment. The Bloc Québécois supports them wholeheartedly, and this Parliament could do the same by voting in favour of Motion M-193.</p><A NAME="T1335"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1335"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1340"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1330"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1335)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

I have a large first nations population in my community, and to be perfectly frank, I was not necessarily aware of this issue and how important it was to the first nations community or that the compensation offered by the government is in fact somewhat of an insult.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the compensation is coming so late, so long after the debate, that our treatment and fairness of veterans in general has been absolutely deplorable in the country. I think we stand to learn something from the first nations community on this particular issue of the treatment of our veterans.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within the first nations that I work with, the veterans of wars, the warriors, the people who have defended the community, are treated with the highest regard.  They are considered the most important in society next to the matriarchs, for in that defence of community they have allowed the community and culture to continue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us contrast that with how our federal government has treated veterans: as an afterthought.  We cannot even pull together a full standing committee on the issue because we just do not consider it an issue or of relevance.  In learning from the first nations community in respect to how they treat their warriors, their veterans, the government could come a long way in understanding what it is to sacrifice for one's country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young people in Canada  have lost the memory of that sacrifice.  A cynical person would say that the government's lack of urgency and failure to be forthcoming on veterans affairs means that it is simply waiting for veterans to no longer be with us.  A cynical person would say that, but I am not at that point yet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government  is  looking for congratulations on this $20,000 in compensation.  The government members would like us to pat them on the back and say what a wonderful job they have done.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It reminds me of the hepatitis C debate.  It is very similar. Now that the government has finally been forced to address the issue, it is looking for accolades on its ability to compensate victims when it knew from the beginning that this should have been done.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, this is the case with first nations veterans, who with all good intentions went to war on behalf of this country, defended it with life and limb and came back to this country without recognition and without compensation.  They had to wait not months or years but decades in order to finally be considered full and active members of the veterans' community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also in contrast to how the veterans themselves have included first nations within their communities.  When I go to the Legion halls, I see that  veterans are considered on a par with and of the same class as any non-aboriginals who participated in the war.  That is the excellent status and class of the veterans' community, which neither this  government nor governments prior have exemplified.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Underlying this issue is respect for the Métis nation within our country, but the government seems very reluctant to give any acknowledgement of or full recognition to the Métis because it is worried about where that road will lead in recognizing aboriginal rights and title.  The Métis remain a second class.  They remain an “other” in society.  They are not brought completely to the table and are always given second, third or fourth consideration after the first nations with full rights and title. If the government ever were to acknowledge this, what horrors would be upon us: to actually consider compensation and accommodation for the Métis nations that exist within our country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is strong support for this group. A particular sign is the young people within the Métis nation who are now coming forward, speaking strongly on behalf of their rights and looking for recognition in our Constitution and our government.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the government is looking for congratulations on its rather slow and insulting process, it is not going to get it from this side of the House, particularly not from this corner of the House.  It is absolutely deplorable that anyone on the government side can stand in this House and say that the government has done right by first nations. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor has it done right by veterans. These people who gave so much to allow this very structure and concept of democracy to exist are the same people we slap in the face and give late and poor recourse to when the time comes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. member from across the floor said it well when he mentioned that veterans are not the types to come forward cap in hand looking for proper compensation; I think the expression he used was “looking to get rich quick”.  These are men and women of pride who consider their work for the country to have been done with pride, and  they have been insulted for not months, not years, but decades.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NDP stands in support of this motion.  We congratulate the member again for his persistence in this matter. We look forward to quick passage of the motion.</p><A NAME="T1340"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1340"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1345"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1335"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1340)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1078922"></A><a HREF="#Int-1078931"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1078917"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Navdeep Bains (Mississauga—Brampton South, Lib.): </b>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues in debate on this motion. A little earlier my colleague from this side of the House spoke mainly of the history of veteran benefits available to first nation veterans, specifically status of Indians living on the reserves after the war years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since this motion speaks to other aboriginal veterans, such as the Métis and the Inuit war veterans, I will speak more directly to their situation. The short story is that Métis and non-status Indian veterans were not affected by the same administrative realities that are applied to first nations veterans who settled on reserves after the wars. Research conducted to date has not substantiated allegations of any differential treatment of Métis and non-status Indian veterans from that of non-aboriginal veterans.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That said, I am fully aware there remains deeply held views by Métis veterans that they too were treated unfairly upon their return from the wars.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2000, two separate processes were initiated with the National Métis Veterans Association and the National Aboriginal Veterans Association to represent Métis and non-status Indian veterans respectively, to explore these issues with the federal government. The federal government funded these processes and participated along with Veterans Affairs Canada.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Funding was specifically provided for the National Métis Veterans Association to strengthen the capacity of its organization to “pursue compensation” for Métis veterans.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to determine what benefits Métis veterans received after the wars and under the current programs, Veterans Affairs Canada agreed to review veterans' files.  The department has precise records of the demobilization benefits paid to Métis veterans and the file review to date reveals that the veterans received the benefits to which they were entitled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Veterans Affairs Canada informed the National Métis Veterans Association that the file review clearly indicated that Métis veterans received the benefits to which they were entitled.  The department extended an offer to further review  these findings with the National Métis Veterans Association.  Veterans Affairs Canada also encouraged the association to have individual Métis veterans who believe that they did not receive benefits to which they may have been entitled. or who have questions about the current benefits that Veterans Affairs Canada provides. to contact the department.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of Veterans Affairs has clearly stated that if a Métis veteran did not receive demobilization benefits, the department would of course be prepared to look into that individual case.  However  the review of the random file indicates that they have received the same benefits and continue to receive the same benefits as all other veterans.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In March 2003, the former minister of veterans affairs met with the then president of the National Métis Veterans Association to listen to concerns and to discuss the findings of the Métis veterans file.  At that time, the government committed to develop an outreach program in consultation with the association to facilitate communication and ensure that Métis veterans and their spouses benefit from the full range of Veterans Affairs Canada programs and services for which they are eligible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In March 2004, the Minister of Veterans Affairs met with the president of the Manitoba Métis Federation and an executive of the Métis National Council to further discuss the concerns of Métis veterans, including the matter of unmarked graves, the post-war treatment of Métis veterans and the development of an outreach strategy. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsequently, the department's prairie regional director general met with the Métis National Council representatives to provide information on Veterans Affairs Canada services and benefits and to explain the assessment/application process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to the third group of aboriginal veterans, the National Aboriginal Veterans Association was given funds to conduct research and compile a list of veterans.  Veterans Affairs Canada conducted a random file review of case files to determine what benefits non-status Indian veterans received after the wars.  Preliminary results indicated that these veterans also received the same demobilization benefits as other veterans upon their return from the wars.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Veterans Affairs Canada has extended an open offer to the National Aboriginal Veterans Association to review the findings and encourage the National Aboriginal Veterans Association to have any Métis or non-status Indian veterans who have questions about the benefits that Veterans Affairs Canada provides to contact the department.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where does this leave us?  Although significant discrepancies exist between the anecdotal evidence of Métis post-war experiences and those documented in the Veterans Affairs Canada files, Veterans Affairs Canada has offered to work collaboratively with both the National Métis Veterans Association and the National Aboriginal Veterans Association to further investigate their concerns.</p><A NAME="T1345"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1345"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1350"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1340"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1345)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to address current issues, Veterans Affairs Canada is developing an aboriginal outreach strategy aimed at facilitating communication and ensuring that eligible aboriginal veterans and their spouses are benefiting from the full range of Veterans Affairs Canada programs and services. As a part of the strategy, a senior officer within the department would be the first point of contact for aboriginal veterans, spouses and organizations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On November 10 the federal interlocutor announced a total of $200,000 in funding for aboriginal veterans to promote their contributions to wartime efforts.  The National Aboriginal Veterans Association will receive $100,000 and the National Métis Veterans Association will receive $100,000 as well to carry out projects related to their service in the Canadian forces.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government of Canada recognizes the service and sacrifice that aboriginal veterans made during the wars.  It has already contributed approximately $500,000 toward the construction and unveiling ceremony of a national aboriginal veterans war monument as a tribute to Canadian aboriginal peoples military contributions.  Contributions of $1.15 million were also made to establish the aboriginal veterans scholarship trust.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know these initiatives, substantive as they are, do not satisfy all the concerns of the aboriginal community.  I am in no position to comment on the feelings or the heartfelt experience of these gallant war veterans.   As in so many things, when it comes to the application of official programs, government is constrained by the rules of the day, the law and the paper evidence found in 60 year old files.  In the case of these veterans, there is no evidence in the files that they did not receive the demobilization benefits that were available to all eligible veterans.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I would like to stress that all aboriginal veterans who feel they are not receiving benefits are encouraged to and should contact Veterans Affairs Canada.</p><A NAME="T1350"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1350"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1355"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1345"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1350)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1078931"></A><a HREF="#Int-1078932"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1078922"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Jim Prentice (Calgary Centre-North, CPC): </b>Mr. Speaker, I am truly amazed. The government has, in response to the motion brought forward by my hon. friend, a chance to do the right thing. It had an opportunity to do the right thing when this matter was before the committee. The committee adjourned at the insistence of the members of the government without dealing with the issue. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberals  have had an opportunity in the House today to respond to the  specific motion that  has been brought forward, which is a good motion. They have an opportunity to do the right thing by aboriginal Canadians who fought and served for this country in the last war and in the Korean War, aboriginal Canadians who have not received what they were entitled to receive under the law of Canada when they returned to this country. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why will the government not do the right thing? Why will the government not respond in some meaningful way to these Canadians who have stepped forward and said that they were not treated fairly?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have received documentation specifically with respect to the Métis National Council, the Manitoba Métis Federation and Mr. Chartrand, in the report, “To Walk With Dignity”.  They found that less than 3% of the identified Métis veterans had received one of the three key programs under the Veterans Charter that they were entitled to receive, whether it was education, land or re-establishment grants. Why will the government not deal with this? Why will it not come to the table and respond?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead, we have a bureaucratic response, an offer to work in collaboration, an offer of partnership, an explanation that the Liberals  are tied down and constrained by old files and the weaknesses of them and that they cannot do anything about this. We have a bureaucratic response something in the nature of the Métis delivery research output program, whatever that is. Why can the government not simply do the right thing and recognize that the hon. member has brought forward a motion where the House has an opportunity to say loudly and clearly that the right thing has not been done in the past?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I keep a copy of the throne speech in my desk. It said that the government and aboriginal people would work together to develop specific quality of life indicators and a report card to hold everybody to account and to drive progress. This is one matter, which posterity will report for the report card of the government that it had an opportunity to do the right thing and it did not do it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking on behalf of the members of this side of the House and on behalf of my friends elsewhere in the House, we are unanimous in this. The government has repeatedly had an opportunity to deal with this issue, to set Canadian history right, to do the equitable thing, to do the just thing, to respond to the request for recognition and fairness and it has refused to do so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last word  I will say on this is that is the record before the House.  Canadians in days ahead will have a chance to see that.</p><A NAME="T1355"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1355"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1350"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1355)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1078932"></A><a HREF="#Int-1078931"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Speaker: </b>The time provided for the consideration of private member's business has now expired and the order is dropped to the bottom of the order of precedence on the order paper.</p>
