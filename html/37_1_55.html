<A NAME="LINK5">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK6"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Anne McLellan (for the Minister of Transport)</B> moved 
that Bill S-5, an act to amend the Blue Water Bridge Authority 
Act, be read the second time and, by unanimous consent, referred 
to a committee of the whole. 
<P><A NAME="LINK7"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Brent St. Denis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, at the outset I would like to 
ask for consent to share my time with the member for 
Sarnia—Lambton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Is it agreed that the hon. member split 
his time with the hon. member for Sarnia—Lambton? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Brent St. Denis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak 
at second reading on the proposed legislation, an act to amend 
the Blue Water Bridge Authority Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed legislation amends the Blue Water Bridge Act of 
1964 by updating the ability of the Blue Water Bridge Authority 
to borrow funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those members who may not know, the Blue Water Bridge 
connects Point Edward, which is near Sarnia, Ontario, with Port 
Huron, Michigan.  It joins Ontario Highway 402 to Michigan 
Highway Interstates 69 and 94 on the U.S. side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Blue Water Bridge is the second largest Canada-U.S. gateway 
in terms of exports and the second busiest crossing for trucks. 
An average of 14,000 vehicles per day cross the Blue Water Bridge 
and on a busy day as many as 20,000 vehicles, including well over 
6,000 trucks, may cross this international bridge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Blue Water Bridge is Canada's fastest growing crossing with 
traffic increases of about 8% per year.  The bridge is primarily 
a long distance crossing.  I am told that approximately 250,000 
to 300,000 trucks per month from the province of Quebec alone 
cross this bridge heading to the United States.  Obviously this 
crossing is important to many of our provinces, not just Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1992, 50 years after the bridge was first opened for traffic, 
an international task force studying the Blue Water Bridge 
crossing concluded that the existing bridge was operating in 
excess of its designed capacity and that a second bridge should 
be built. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On July 22, 1997, a second Blue Water Bridge span was open to 
traffic.  Once the new bridge was opened, the original 60 year 
old bridge was temporarily closed for much needed rehabilitation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Blue Water Bridge Authority has owned and operated the 
Canadian half of the bridge since the early 1960s.  The authority 
was created by the federal government by an act respecting the 
international bridge over the St. Clair river known as the Blue 
Water Bridge.  This act was proclaimed on May 21, 1964. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Blue Water Bridge Authority is a public body basically 
independent of the crown operating at arm's length.  It is not an 
agent or employee of the crown and the crown is therefore not 
liable for its debt.  It receives no federal funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The governor in council appoints the directors of the authority 
and the reporting mechanism is through Transport Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I previously indicated, the purpose of the amendment to the 
Blue Water Bridge Act of 1964 is to update the ability of the 
Blue Water Bridge Authority to borrow funds.  The current act 
limits the authority to borrow funds when the bond interest rate 
is less than or equal to 6.5%.  This restriction is not in 
keeping with current practice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other international bridges have an established maximum 
borrowing limit.  The amendment proposes a maximum borrowing 
limit of $125 million which would be adequate to handle its long 
term debt, currently totalling approximately $60 million, and its 
multiyear capital plan totalling an additional $55 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Blue Water Bridge Authority is continually looking for ways 
to improve its operation and to make its crossing as 
efficient and as safe as possible.  Its capital plan identifies 
major modifications to the terminal layout to improve the flow of 
traffic and to address the safety concerns identified by 
independent consultants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without the passage of the legislation, the authority will be 
unable to borrow the necessary funds to make these improvements. 
The proposed legislation stipulates that all borrowing 
transactions are subject to the approval of the Minister of 
Finance and the Minister of Transport.  The bill also reinforces 
that the federal government is not liable for any borrowing by 
the authority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The authority is not for profit.  Its revenues come primarily 
from bridge tolls but it also has rental income from things 
like the duty free shop and from broker establishments at the 
crossing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed legislation to amend the Blue Water Bridge 
Authority Act is important for Canada's economic viability and 
competitiveness.  With the Canada-U.S. trade growing at an 
average annual pace of more than 10%, we cannot afford to ignore 
the crucial economic role that our international border crossings 
play in facilitating the movement of this trade.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope all members will join me in giving expeditious 
consideration to this important initiative.  The Blue Water 
Bridge Authority needs the legislation in order to continue to 
operate and to maintain this important transportation link 
efficiently and to make capital improvements in the most cost 
effective manner possible. 
<P><A NAME="LINK8"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roger Gallaway (Sarnia—Lambton, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I too am pleased to speak to Bill S-5 and to urge its speedy 
passage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is in essence a private bill in that it affects one 
operation, in this case the powers of the board of directors 
consisting of four people who are the overseers or managers of 
the Canadian half of the international crossing known as the Blue 
Water Bridge, which is located in my riding of Sarnia—Lambton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1937, after 20 years of study between the Canadian government 
and American interests, agreement was reached to construct a 
bridge over the St. Clair river at its narrowest juncture which 
is at the base of Lake Huron in the village of Point Edward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For close to 60 years the original structure served as the 
crossing point between Canada and the United States, Ontario and 
Michigan, and the communities of Sarnia and Port Huron.  For 
almost 60 years the first bridge served the interests of 
business, family and tourism well by providing a fast and 
efficient place to exit and enter Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in 1964 parliament enacted legislation, known as the 
Blue Water Bridge Act, which created a board of directors of four 
people with certain powers, authority and obligations to operate 
the facility.  The reason for that was twofold.  First, the 
automobile in the post-war years resulted in a much greater 
volume of traffic: business, commercial, tourism, as well as 
personal use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the operations of the bridge needed to be 
self-sustaining and fulfil the expectations of the local, 
regional as well as national interests.  With the passage in 1964 
of the Blue Water Bridge Authority Act, control over operations 
was vested in the authority subject to certain provisions in 
terms of reporting to Transport Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation has served us well locally and nationally.  The 
authority under the 1964 legislation provided the buildings for 
Canada customs, immigration and agriculture Canada free of 
charge.  This was part of the 1964 act and continues and will 
continue to be the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the period from 1964 to 1992, the volume of traffic grew. 
This was a three lane bridge located some 50 minutes from 
Detroit.  As both Canada and the U.S. became greater trading 
partners, as the method of moving goods shifted toward trucks and 
as the 400 series highways blossomed in Ontario and their 
interstate counterparts were built in the U.S., something quite 
startling happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ontario Highway 402 was built in the mid-seventies connecting 
the Blue Water Bridge to Highway 401 some 100 kilometres away. 
On the American side, Interstate Highways 94 and 69 connected the 
bridge to Detroit and Chicago.  As trade between our countries 
blossomed and traffic volume skyrocketed from a few trucks daily 
in 1938 to well over 7,000 18-wheelers daily today, the Blue 
Water Bridge is now the second busiest land commercial crossing 
on the Canada—U.S. border. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1992 the Blue Water Bridge Authority, responding to both 
local and national needs, conducted a feasibility study in 
concert with its American counterpart operators, the Michigan 
Department of Transport, and embarked on a bridge twinning 
project.  On July 12, 1997, that second parallel Blue Water 
Bridge, the new one, was officially opened:  a new structure 
abutting and running parallel to the 1938 structure.  The bridge 
now offered six lanes to facilitate the crossing of goods and 
people.  After the opening of the new span, a commitment of more 
than $75 million by the Blue Water Bridge Authority, the original 
span was closed to be re-decked and refurbished, a further 
commitment of about $25 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1997 the volume of truck traffic has continued to grow 
somewhere in the neighbourhood of 12% per annum.  The opening of 
a casino abutting the Canadian plaza of the bridge, literally 
almost under the bridge, and the favourable position of the 
Canadian dollar vis-à-vis U.S. residents, has resulted in an 
explosion of traffic.  Some 20,000 vehicles are crossing daily 
and more than 1.6 million annually. 
Each and every month the revenues of the bridge authority have 
increased, despite the talk that there is a slowdown in the 
economy.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means a number of things, reflected in Bill S-5.  The 
bridge authority, through studies commissioned by it, has 
identified further capital projects to disentangle truck traffic 
from regular motor vehicle traffic.  It must, for safety reasons 
and to facilitate the just in time delivery of goods, make major 
changes to its plaza at the base of the bridge.  Without the 
passage of this legislation, Bill S-5, the Blue Water Bridge 
Authority will be unable to borrow the necessary funds to make 
these improvements as well as handle its long term debt load and 
multi-year capital plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1964 act has worked for 37 years, but in this era of 
increased trade and tourism this new legislation will allow the 
Blue Water Bridge Authority to continue to meet our national, 
regional and local interests.  It is a sign and a symptom of 
success. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing I would like to thank the bridge authority and its 
chair, Mr. Doug Keddy, and the mayor of the village of Point 
Edward, Dick Kirkland, who have in recent years worked so 
diligently to ensure the success of this facility.  As well, in 
anticipation I would like to thank the members of the House for 
their support in the adoption of this bill. 
<P><A NAME="LINK9"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am also pleased to rise today to 
address at second reading Bill S-5, which seeks to amend the Blue 
Water Bridge Authority Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although most Canadians have probably not even heard of the Blue 
Water bridges, the parallel spans connecting Port Huron, Michigan 
to Sarnia, Ontario, we have all felt the effects of their 
presence.  As the second busiest commercial vehicle corridor 
between Canada and the United States, the Blue Water bridges are 
an integral part of the Canadian economy, providing us with 
access not only to the U.S. market but to Mexico as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The modernization of this act would give the Blue Water Bridge 
Authority the means and capability of conducting its business 
affairs in a manner similar to that of any other private 
corporation in Canada.  As a result of these changes, the 
authority will be able to borrow money to invest in 
infrastructure improvements on an as needed basis up to a limit 
of $125 million.  The act will also ensure that the borrowing 
activities are overseen by the Minister of Finance and the 
Minister of Transportation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I have some reservations about placing control for 
approval of borrowing in the hands of only two members of the 
House, I am hopeful that this arrangement may actually encourage 
some dialogue between the ministers on infrastructure investment 
for the rest of Canada's transportation system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to see the Minister of Transport in the House 
today.  Earlier this week Canadians heard the minister defend his 
inaction on highways by once again reiterating that he could not 
possibly spend money on roads since they are a provincial 
responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that is the case, then the question is this:  why is the 
federal government collecting taxes that clearly belong to the 
party responsible for the roads, namely the provinces?  It seems 
simple.  If the government will not take responsibility for the 
roads then it should stop taking the money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fortunately we also had the Minister of Finance around to try to 
defend the paltry $600 million that the government intends to 
distribute to the provinces for road improvements over the next 
four years.  He reminded us of all the wonderful things that the 
remaining $4 billion, yes, $4 billion, of fuel tax buys us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the state of our highways it is unconscionable that the 
finance minister would defend spending 95% of fuel tax revenues 
on projects other than roads.  As the Blue Water Bridge Authority 
has proven over the past 37 years, reinvesting revenues from 
operations means that we can afford to maintain infrastructure to 
impeccable standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine for a moment that an American tourist is heading for a 
vacation in Canada.  The American side of the journey is on 
interstate highways that receive funding to the tune of 95% of 
all fuel taxes collected by the state.  The American tourist gets 
to the Blue Water Bridge, maintained fully by the revenue it 
generates, and enjoys a very pleasant crossing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then the American tourist arrives in Canada and continues the 
trip on highways that receive funding of less than 5% of total 
fuel tax revenues.  The pathetic condition of our highways has 
the American checking his map furiously to make sure that he did 
not somehow make a wrong turn and is actually heading to Mexico.

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mention Mexico again because it brings up yet another 
compelling reason for renewed investment in our highway 
infrastructure, and that is trade corridors.  The government has 
gone to great lengths to ensure that we have free trade with 
Mexico, yet it has spent no time considering how we will get 
there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Access to and from the growing Mexican economy involves more 
than ensuring that we have enough bridges to the United States. 
Importers and exporters need to have confidence that the Canadian 
government is committed to ensuring that our transportation 
infrastructure will exist long enough for trading relations to 
fully develop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to invest in developing and maintaining trade corridors 
to the south and national highways to the east and west to 
sustain access to the infrastructure such as the Blue Water 
bridges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I am pleased to confirm that the Canadian 
Alliance supports the speedy passage today of all stages of 
amendments to the Blue Water Bridge Authority Act, Bill S-5, with 
the hope and the proviso that it may encourage further 
improvements to our national transportation network. 
<P><A NAME="LINK10"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to say a word or two on Bill S-5 simply to get on the 
record, because it is not a very controversial piece of 
legislation.  It is quite mundane, as a matter of fact, and I 
want to say on behalf of our party that we support the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill will simply update the borrowing rules that apply to 
the Blue Water Bridge Authority.  The current and complex rules 
for borrowing money are replaced by a requirement that the 
Minister of Finance and the Minister of Transport approve the 
authority's borrowing.  A cap of $125 million is placed on all 
borrowing by the authority and the government will not be 
responsible for repayment of the authority's debt, so there no 
reason why anyone would not support the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bridges are operated by the Blue Water Bridge Authority, 
which includes Canadian and U.S. representatives.  The authority 
operates at arm's length from government and receives no 
appropriations.  It is not an agent of the crown and the 
government assumes no responsibility for debt incurred by the 
authority.  As I said a moment ago, there is no reason not to 
support and approve the appropriations outlined in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian law governing the authority's ability to borrow 
money sets out a complex and antiquated set of rules and 
restrictions such as the maximum rate of interest to be paid, the 
maximum length of time to maturity for bonds issued in the 
authority's name, and the maximum rate to be paid on bonds 
redeemed early by the authority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The borrowing authority sought under the bill is about $125 
million.  It is more than double the current outstanding debt of 
$60 million.  The government says that is adequate to handle 
planned multi-year capital spending of $55 million.  That is all 
we have to say on the bill.  We support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Is the House ready for the question? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The question is on the motion.  Is it the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Canadian

speak in debate to Bill S-2 and specifically to both motions put 
forward to amend clause 39. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would perhaps be helpful if I run through the chronological 
order of how this amendment came about.  We submitted the 
amendment to clause 39 in Bill S-2, the Marine Liability Act, to 
the Standing Committee on Transport and Government Operations 
during clause by clause consideration of the bill.

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment relates to the establishment of a date by which 
the government would establish regulations for compulsory 
insurance for commercial passenger vessels.  These are vessels 
that are making a business of carrying people.  It would bring 
them in line with all other modes of transportation.  Commercial 
shipping is the only area which does not have compulsory 
insurance requirements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill establishes the shipowner's liability for passengers 
but does not require them to prove that they have the financial 
means to pay any potential injured passengers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee heard contradictory testimony from departmental 
officials.  On one hand they stated that it could not be done 
without a detailed examination of the impact on the insurance 
industry.  On the other hand marine insurance professionals 
stated that compulsory insurance was already part of their 
business and the industry could respond immediately to comply 
with the requirement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During clause by clause analysis there was considerable debate 
on the amendment to clause 39.  All four opposition parties were 
united in their support for the amendment that I had drafted and 
introduced.  The amendment required the government to make 
insurance compulsory by January 1, 2002, a date chosen to allow 
the government the time it stated was required to implement an 
adequate administration scheme. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Liberal members of the committee agreed that the bill without 
compulsory insurance would not accomplish the objective of 
protecting passengers travelling by ship.  Assurances were given 
by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Transport that 
the government would act on a commitment.  It shall make 
regulations as soon as it is able.  That is really what the 
amendment is all about, because it says it shall in the future 
perhaps.  However the government was not prepared to amend the 
bill at that time. I made an offer to extend the implementation 
date by a full year and was summarily dismissed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It became clear in committee that despite acknowledging that the 
bill was deficient with respect to the compulsory insurance 
provisions, Liberal members were supporting the bill as drafted 
on a purely partisan basis.  They were concerned that any 
amendment would require the bill to return to the Senate and thus 
delay royal assent.  It was pointed out that the bill passed 
through the Senate in a single day.  We all know that Bill S-2 
originated in the Senate.  Liberal members agreed that any delay 
would not be significant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Approval of deficient legislation on partisan grounds or on the 
basis that it would require the bill to follow its prescribed 
course to the Senate constitutes special circumstances.  That is 
why the amendment we are discussing today was allowed to stand at 
report stage as well as in committee.  That is why I have amended 
our motion to reflect the compromise offered by the four 
opposition parties in committee.  It now reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Governor in Council shall make regulations by January 1, 
2003, requiring insurance or evidence of financial security be 
maintained to cover liability under this Part. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment is in addition to those put forward by my hon. 
colleagues in the New Democratic Party.   Although they support 
the motion I put forward in committee, and I believe they will 
support it in the House, once it is defeated we need to have a 
fallback position.  We need to ensure that passengers travelling 
on commercial vessels have some assurance they are protected, and 
if they are not protected that they are made aware of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support the intent of Motion No. 2.  I believe very strongly 
there is no legitimate reason, and there were no compelling 
reasons presented in committee, why commercial shipping vessels 
are not required to have compulsory insurance to protect 
passengers who are travelling by boat.

<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Failing that and if Motion No. 1 is defeated, the Canadian 
Alliance would support Motion No. 2 because it would provide some 
protection.  If there is a requirement that a visible sign or 
some other form of communication has to be posted by shipowners, 
a warning sign, passengers would know the particular vessel does 
not have an adequate insurance policy or the financial means in 
the event the boat were to sink or some other mishap befalls 
passengers.  They would not have reasonable assurance that their 
injuries or the injuries of their loved ones would be covered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am speaking in favour of my motion which would require 
compulsory insurance by January 1, 2003, so that all passengers 
travelling in Canada on water vessels would have the assurance 
and be well aware that all shipping companies in the business of 
transporting people have adequate insurance to protect them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be similar to what airlines, bus companies and other 
modes of transportation have.  They are required to have third 
party liability insurance to make sure passengers are adequately 
covered.  Passengers boarding those forms of transportation have 
that assurance, yet we do not see the same requirement of 
shipowners.  I speak in favour of Motion No. 1 for those reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Motion No. 1 is defeated, our party would support Motion No. 
2 as a fallback position so that passengers understand when they 
board a particular vessel which does not have adequate insurance 
coverage they are accepting some personal risk with their 
decision.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Brent St. Denis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to 
address the amendment of thee hon. member for Prince 
George—Peace River.  My comments could be taken as applying to 
the amendment of the hon. member for Windsor—St. Clair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These motions seek to amend clause 39 of Bill S-2 by putting an 
obligation on the governor in council to make regulations 
requiring shipowners to provide evidence of insurance or other 
financial security covering their liability to passengers under 
part 4 of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the hearings held by the Standing Committee on Transport 
and Government Operations concerns were raised regarding the 
absence of compulsory insurance provisions in the bill. Reference 
was made to systems of compulsory insurance in respect of 
passengers in other modes of transport and to those currently in 
place in the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to stress that the introduction of a passenger 
liability regime in Canadian law is the first and essential step 
for the introduction of compulsory insurance for passenger ships. 
Bill S-2 makes a quantum leap toward this objective as it 
establishes for the first time in Canadian law the liability of 
the shipowner for loss of life or personal injury to passengers. 
The bill provides specific levels of compensation to which each 
passenger would be entitled in the event of an accident. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unlike other modes of transportation there continues to be no 
international agreement mandating insurance coverage for 
passenger ships.  The International Maritime Organization is 
currently working on a compulsory insurance regime for passengers 
and Bill S-2 recognizes this in clause 39. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 39 provides for governor in council authority to adopt 
regulations on compulsory insurance and thus enables Canada to 
adhere to a uniform regime supported by international insurance 
markets.

<A HREF="#LINKT8"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However Canada can act on clause 39 as soon as the bill is 
passed and unilaterally introduce a regime of compulsory 
insurance for all ships operating in Canadian waters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some provisions in the United States on compulsory 
insurance, but its system does not provide the benefits that Bill 
S-2 is trying to achieve.  The U.S. compulsory insurance scheme 
is not comprehensive as it only deals with ships that have 
overnight accommodation for 50 or more passengers.  In addition, 
the amount of compensation provided depends on the capacity of 
the ship which generates different treatments of passengers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, in respect of ships with overnight accommodation 
capacity of between 50 and 500, the U.S. regime requires 
insurance of $20,000 U.S. per passenger accommodation.  This 
amount decreases with higher capacity ships so that a ship with a 
capacity of 2,000 the required insurance is only $12,500 U.S. per 
passenger accommodation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to these variations in the treatment of passengers, 
all types of day trip ferries, sightseeing ships, tour boats, et 
cetera, are not covered by the compulsory insurance scheme of the 
U.S. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian regime provides compensation of $350,000 per 
passenger.  Large shipowners, particularly in the coastal ferry 
and cruise ship markets, are generally well insured with 
established insurers and have full coverage against liability as 
set out in the bill.  Hence these shipowners should have no 
difficulty to obtain and maintain adequate insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly the vast majority of small shipowners and operators 
should not encounter any problems in the Canadian insurance 
market to secure insurance against the obligations under Bill 
S-2. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also aware that as the insurers would not be compelled to 
insure every ship, it is possible that some operators, 
particularly in the whale watching or white water rafting market, 
may find their premiums substantially increased.  Under the new 
liability regime they may be considered uninsurable and forced 
out of business.  Others may lose some competitive advantage 
against U.S. operators who are not required to have insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As in the case of compulsory insurance and in the current 
insurance regime for oil pollution, the establishment of 
compulsory insurance for passenger ships may require the 
establishment of some safety net for claims arising from 
uninsured ships or from the failure of the insurers to meet their 
obligations.  Thus a necessary part of any compulsory insurance 
regime would be the responsibility of the government to approve 
insurers as is currently done under the oil pollution regime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that shipowners would voluntarily act responsibly. The 
government would act as soon as possible following the passage of 
the bill on the development of appropriate regulations to give 
effect to clause 39.  In fact government testimony in committee 
repeated that commitment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This would ensure that all shipowners obtain and provide 
evidence of adequate insurance against their liability to 
passengers under part 4.  The government's serious commitment to 
this objective was already demonstrated in our efforts in the 
field of oil pollution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In part 6 of the bill there is a regime of liability for oil 
pollution damage caused by oil tankers.  The regime includes 
provisions on compulsory insurance that shipowners must have 
before they are permitted to navigate in Canadian waters.  The 
oil pollution regime is based on international conventions which 
Canada adopted in 1999.  As a result, Canadian interests such as 
our environment are protected by a well established regime that 
has the full co-operation of international insurance markets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This co-operation was essential since our domestic insurance 
markets do not have the capacity to provide coverage against the 
levels of liability for oil pollution established in the 
international convention.  This example of our dedication to 
protect Canadians in the marine transportation field speaks for 
itself.  While there is no equivalent international agreement on 
compulsory insurance for passenger ships, this would not prevent 
Canada from introducing such a regime at the national level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this instance, the emphasis would be primarily on smaller 
vessels which to a large degree can be insured in the domestic 
insurance market as was reported by some of the industry 
witnesses who appeared before the Standing Committee on Transport 
and Government Operations.  We would take their advice and that 
of others potentially affected by the compulsory insurance system 
to make sure that we have examined every aspect of it and that we 
have put together a viable and workable regime.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Our goal is to ensure, first, that we have taken into account 
all interests involved and, second, that we have at the end a 
compulsory insurance system which is effective in its impact and 
efficient in its application. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have mentioned, the bill takes a giant step forward in 
addressing passenger ship liability and provides for an eventual 
solution to the concern raised by the opposition member. However, 
acting on clause 39 at this stage would be premature. The 
government will therefore not support either of the two proposed 
amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments could be detrimental to small passenger ship 
operators or unfair to the insurance industry.  Measures will be 
taken as soon as the bill is passed to address this very 
important aspect of it.  Given all that has been said, I 
reiterate that we will not be supporting the motion.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Comartin (Windsor—St. Clair, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
my colleague from Churchill is on the committee reviewing the 
bill.  When I became aware of the legislation it drew to mind an 
incident that took place in Lake Huron about a year ago.  As a 
parent it is one of those scary nightmares we all have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Students from one of the local high schools were out on a ferry 
on Lake Huron.  There was a sudden storm, the ferry sank and two 
lives were lost.  Two of the students drowned.  It subsequently 
was learned that the ferry had no insurance.  As a result the 
parents must not only cope with the tragic loss of their child. 
They must also deal with the financial consequences such as 
funeral expenses, et cetera, with no ability to look to the ferry 
operator for compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP is quite prepared to support the first motion before the 
House today because we believe insurance is the answer.  I know 
from my experience in the civil litigation field that the second 
motion, my motion, is a far distant second preference.  Putting 
up notices would not be nearly as effective as compulsory 
insurance in dealing with the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The advantage of compulsory insurance is that it is not only 
available for parties who have suffered injury, death or other 
losses.  It also acts as a check on the practices of the 
operators of the industry or service.  If their practices are not 
conducted in a proper and safe fashion the insurance industry 
acts as an enforcement mechanism.  It is therefore far preferable 
to have insurance than to rely simply on putting up notices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government is absolute in its position that it will not 
make insurance compulsory then notices may still have some 
effect.  If notices had been posted that the Lake Huron ferry had 
no insurance then the school that organized the day trip, being 
concerned for the safety of its charges, may not have used it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is not much more I can say.  The comments of my Alliance 
colleague summarize the issue.  I simply add these points and ask 
the government to rethink its position and move to compulsory 
insurance.  If not, it should consider the fallback position of 
making it compulsory to post notices.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Marcel Gagnon (Champlain, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is difficult 
to be against a bill making shipowners liable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments to the act strike me as logical.  Making 
shipowners liable and giving passengers and owners of luggage an 
opportunity to recover their belongings and sue a shipowner 
after an incident is, in my opinion, extremely worthwhile. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, it is not a question of making shipowners liable but of 
being able to give them the tools to assume that liability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In clause 39, when it says that the government may require 
insurance, the way we see this is that by giving them 
responsibilities, the government must require shipowners to be 
responsible financially by having liability insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember, in the days before car insurance was required in 
Quebec, if we draw a comparison, people were sued following an 
accident because they were responsible for the accident, but not 
financially responsible.  I can remember defending families, for 
example, who had lost everything as the result of an accident, 
because the person who was responsible was unable to assume his 
responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Automobile Insurance Act was passed, forcing owners of 
cars, trucks and any other road vehicles to carry the necessary 
insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this regard, when the government says it 
will see that shipowners get insurance once the bill is passed, 
that is too late.  We have to fix this situation now, while we 
have the opportunity to do so, and we strongly support the 
motion that vessel operators be required to get liability 
insurance immediately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some Department of Transport officials have said that the 
industry was not ready right now to take on such a risk.  However 
members of the insurance industry assure us of the contrary. 
They say they are perfectly prepared to take such risks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for liability with respect to pollution, this is a topic of 
particular interest to me. 
It is true that we must do everything possible to force 
shipowners to respect the waters they navigate on, among others 
the St. Lawrence.  There are regular spills, perhaps not major 
ones, but there is a certain laxness as far as the environment 
is concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I applaud this bill, which will require shipowners to be more 
responsible for the waters of the St. Lawrence, as well as to 
enable those who have sustained damages, whether fishers, 
farmers, marine algae producers or anyone sustaining damages as 
the result of an oil spill for instance, to sue shipowners in 
order to be compensated for the losses incurred.  Plant workers 
are also entitled to do the same.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would caution the government against a temptation that seems 
to have existed for a number of years.  The St. Lawrence pilots 
and the specialized pilots, all associations of pilots with the 
responsibility of taking control of a ship and guiding it 
through the St. Lawrence to the Lakehead, tell us that 
attempts are being made, or at the very least 
pressures, to exclude them from this work some day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must say that we owe the condition in which the St. Lawrence 
is today, claims of its pollution notwithstanding, to the 
quality of the St. Lawrence pilots. 
Without the skill and calibre of these pilots, even their 
interest, and because of the fact that St. Lawrence River pilots 
know the river like the back of their hand—they know it so well 
they avoid the reefs, as is true as well in the Great Lakes—there 
would be major incidents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I warn the government to avoid the temptation to take away 
pilots' responsibility for guiding ships to the Great Lakes. 
The pilots are afraid for their status as St. Lawrence pilots, 
and I hope this fear is unjustified.  For 30 years, 
they have felt there has been a temptation to take this 
responsibility away from them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am saying that, on the contrary, they must be assured that 
responsibility for safe navigation on the St. Lawrence and the 
Great Lakes is theirs.  Given their calibre and skill, I think 
they require assurance that they will continue to do this work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, we agree with most of the conclusions of this report 
and everything relating to the protection of the environment and 
the individual.  Once again, I ask the government to act on its 
intention and ensure there is an obligation for shipowners to 
carry insurance in keeping with their responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will add one other small point, which I do not find here, and 
that is that it seems to me there should be a requirement to 
inspect vessels moving from the sea into the Gulf of St. 
Lawrence. 
This would avoid damage caused by aging vessels, which could 
pollute the St. Lawrence and the Great Lakes, in the event of an 
incident.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cannis (Scarborough Centre, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I wish to bring to the attention of the hon. members of the House 
the fact that today marks the inauguration of Canada's first 
Information Technology Week, a national celebration of Canadian 
skills and achievements in information and communications 
technology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The week is organized by Industry Canada in collaboration with 
the Information Technology Association of Canada.  The week will 
run for 10 days, from May 4 to May 13. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians from all over our country are invited to participate 
in the following:  technology conferences; open houses; award 
ceremonies for local IT heroes; IT seminars for seniors; and IT 
workshops for young men and women and Canadians of all ages. 
Business and IT presentations will take place, including some in 
regard to careers in IT.  Online quizzes and many more activities 
are planned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is just one way of saying that Canada is indeed at the 
forefront of information technology.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, capping the equalization program and ignoring the 
concerns of Atlantic Canadian provincial ministers will result in 
two different Canadas, those parts of the country that can afford 
services and others that cannot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Liberal government sits on a $17 billion surplus, their 
grinch-like attitude toward less prosperous provinces will result 
in the decline of health care, education and roadways in Atlantic 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nova Scotia premier John Hamm has continued his campaign for 
fairness to gain more control of the province's offshore oil and 
natural gas reserves and to move the province away from being an 
equalization recipient. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Industry made election promises to change the 
equalization system, but just like Nova Scotia's equalization, 
the minister's promises have been clawed back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current equalization system can actually inhibit growth in 
the recipient provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The PC Party calls upon the government to introduce a five year 
break on the reduction of equalization benefits, providing 
provinces with an opportunity to utilize these new sources of 
revenue to reduce dependency and create a more favourable 
business environment with higher levels of growth.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is vital in today's economy to provide opportunities for the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the opportunity for the government to aggressively 
attack European Union and United States agricultural subsidy 
policies has never been better.  The Bush administration will 
soon be bringing forward its new farm bill.  The Americans have 
indicated a willingness to continue the present level of market 
distorting support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The European Union is also facing a number of issues.  The EU 
spends half its total annual budget, $50 billion, on farm 
support.  It is under pressure from within to reduce this amount. 
The proposed enlargement of the EU will put additional pressures 
on its budgets.  The WTO peace clause expires at the end of 2003 
and critical elections in Europe will be over by then as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Worldwide a billion dollars is spent everyday on some form of 
agricultural support.  It is imperative that the government act 
now to pressure the European Union and the United States to stop 
subsidies that continue to critically harm Canadian producers.

</H3><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK61"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the economic news from the U.S. is not all that great this month. 
I see record layoffs.  I see employment has fallen.  In fact 
growth expectations are down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada could well be right behind.  In the upcoming economic 
statement will we find new, and I stress the word new, tax cuts 
and cuts to job killing red tape? 
<P><A NAME="LINK62"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the government and the Minister 
of Finance have always said that we will do the right thing at 
the right time.  We cut taxes by $100 billion last fall.  That is 
working its way through the economy.  The minister is monitoring 
the situation.  Of course we are concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are getting mixed messages, but I should point out that both 
the OECD and the IMF expect Canada's economy to grow 2.3% this 
year compared with 4.7% last year.  At the same time the OECD and 
the IMF know that the finance minister's tax cut strategy has 
been well timed to provide further strength to the economy. 
<P><A NAME="LINK63"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the parliamentary secretary missed that right at the end 
of those comments he said that these guys were likely to spend 
too much and that could make a mess of the whole situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what my constituents are saying to me.  They are saying 
that they are losing jobs.  They are saying they are having 
trouble looking to their financial future.   Will we see new tax 
cuts in the upcoming economic statement? 
<P><A NAME="LINK64"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as I said before, the tax cuts 
are the largest in Canadian history.  Combined with provincial 
tax cuts, it is approximating 2% of GDP and most economists agree 
that this is hugely stimulating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister will be meeting with Canada's leading 
economists in the very near term.  After that he will be 
presenting an economic and fiscal update to the finance 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course we are concerned about Canadians who might be losing 
jobs.  I should point out that by combining provincial tax cuts 
with the tax cuts that are in place, personal disposable income 
will increase 5.6%. 
<P><A NAME="LINK65"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, earlier this week a leading expert in Canada on 
competitiveness, John Porter, said that Canada was sliding.  That 
is a shame.  I think it is because of the fiscal policies of the 
government, but one reason for that is job killing red tape. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is easier to cross the border to work in the U.S. than it is 
to cross provincial boundaries and find a job.  Will we see an 
end to job killing red tape in the upcoming economic statement? 
<P><A NAME="LINK66"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have read the report as well 
and the member opposite is very selective in his quotes.  In fact 
what John Porter said was that Canada's positioning on 
macroeconomic policy had shown tremendous progress on the 
macroeconomic front. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What he did say was that at the microeconomic level, which 
includes local governments, provincial governments and 
businesses, we need to have smarter business strategies.  We need 
to take advantage of the strong economic position in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have low unemployment.  We have low inflation.  We have low 
interest rates. We have eliminated the deficit.  We are paying 
down debts and we are cutting taxes.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Cheryl Gallant (Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, paying down the debt with budget 
leftovers is no plan at all.  Taxpayers need more assurance than 
the whim of the finance minister that the debt will be repaid. 
After all, debt represents nothing more than future taxes on our 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When will the government commit to following the lead of the 
provinces of Alberta and Ontario and putting in place a 
legislated repayment plan of the debt so that Canadians will have 
a guarantee in law that our debt will be repaid? 
<P><A NAME="LINK68"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is very characteristic of 
the party opposite.  It wants its cake and to eat it too.  It 
wants investments in Chalk River and it wants to pay down the 
debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is paying down the debt.  In fact we have 
exceeded the targets that were set by the Alliance Party.  We are 
paying down debts faster than any G-7 country, and we will 
continue to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member opposite did not listen to the finance minister last 
year when he said that every fall he would proactively decide 
whether we would pay down the debt.  We will have paid down more 
than $30 billion by the end of this fiscal year. 
<P><A NAME="LINK69"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Cheryl Gallant (Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the government could learn from the 
provinces.  It was our leader, as the finance minister of 
Alberta, who changed the debt repayment legislation to raise the 
bar, to increase the debt repayment target. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For our children, why will the government not commit that the 
$10 billion it says will go to debt repayment will become a 
yearly minimum amount of debt reduction for the rest of its 
mandate? 
<P><A NAME="LINK70"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the standard accounting 
principle is that any surpluses left at the end of the year 
automatically go to pay down the debt, but last fall in an 
economic update the Minister of Finance said he would proactively 
decide what would be paid down on the debt.  This year he 
announced a minimum of $10 billion against the debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of the actions of the government we have reduced the 
amount of revenue dollars from 36 cents per revenue dollar down 
to about 25 cents per revenue dollar on servicing the debt, and 
we will go further, faster.

the Ministre de la Famille du Québec announced that the Quebec 
parental leave program might have to be deferred until January 
2003, because of the federal government's refusal to transfer to 
it the sum of $500 million pursuant to section 69 of the 
Employment Insurance Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What explanation is the federal government going to give to the 
Quebec families forced by its stubbornness and confrontational

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ralph Goodale (Minister of Natural Resources and 
Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the Government of Canada has been providing maternity 
benefits to Canadians for more than 30 years and parental 
benefits for the last decade.  The initiative builds on a very 
longstanding foundation.  The extension of maternity and parental 
benefits has been provided to Canadians at no additional cost. In 
fact for the last seven years premiums have gone down under the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently there are employers and provincial governments that

<P><A NAME="LINK74"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, there is a

national assembly has unanimously supported a motion demanding 
that the federal government transfer the necessary funds to 
create its own parental leave program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When is the federal government finally going to respect Quebec 
consensus, which it seems to take an unhealthy delight in 
systematically ignoring?

Speaker, the Government of Canada has obligations to all Canadian 
workers.  That is why we have established a very sound system 
that has served well over time.  As I indicated earlier, in the 
case of maternity benefits they have been there for 30 years.  In 
the case of parental benefits they have been there for 10 years. 
It provides a very sound system, at no additional cost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where provinces or employers wish to build upon that, they are 
certainly at liberty to do so, based upon that very solid

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat O'Brien (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for

because when I first became Minister of Fisheries and Oceans 
there were representations from the Newfoundland government.  It 
did not want to have a recreational fishery only on a two weekend 
basis.  It wanted the fishery ongoing throughout the season with 
proper tags, control and management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This year we will be doing that on a pilot project basis, as the 
representation from the Newfoundland government.  We will ensure 
there are proper tags and proper licensing so that we have better 
management and control of the recreational fishery.  It will be 
done on a pilot project basis.  It was done as a result of the 
request by Newfoundland government.  We will be watching closely 
how it works.

law as it is written, and the law prevents organic growers from 
developing the niche markets that will allow them to flourish.

We all know there has been another tragedy with contaminated

C-14, which died at committee stage at that time.

Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government believes that the improvement of our drinking 
water supply and sewage treatment is of utmost priority.  That is 
why we have allocated $2 billion for infrastructure.  In many of

Mr. Speaker, between 1995 and 2000 the segment of the Jacques 
Cartier River that is located within the limits of CFB Valcartier 
was completely decontaminated through a program involving several 
phases.  There is no longer a threat that ordnance will migrate 
outside the perimeter of the base. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last summer the portion of the river located in Shannon was 
successfully decontaminated.  The department will continue to 
take these matters seriously and ensure that we clean up these 
situations.

Mr. Speaker, I guess one member of parliament has made up his

times that we are in a consultation process now with the United 
States, as it is with other allies, with Russia and with China. 
It has not designed the parameters of its program.  It has not 
made a decision on that specific program. We are in the 
consultation phase and we will continue in that phase.

the junior minister of multiculturalism shamelessly slandered the

from the mayor, but she has been unable to produce the letter 
because it does not exist.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

said there were cross burnings, but there were not.  She said she 
had a letter, but there was no letter.  Access to information 
requests now give positive proof that the mayor of Prince George 
was accurate when he denied its existence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For a minister in her position to make up such a damning and 
false accusation is in and of itself sufficient grounds for 
dismissal. However, to deny and cover up exposes an inherent 
character flaw and total unsuitability for this position.

would ask the members opposite to look at the character flaws of

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I rise on a point of order respecting questions on the 
order paper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a complaint that is a weekly sort of rant.  Under the 
provisions of Standing Order 39 members are allowed to put up to 
four questions on the order paper.  I wish to remind the House 
and the Canadian public that those questions are put on the order 
paper for a very specific purpose.  The House allows that 
provision in the standing orders in order to allow members of 
parliament to do their job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have had two questions on the order paper well in excess of 60 
days with no response from the government.  Madam Speaker, with 
the generosity that you exercise from the chair, could you 
imagine any government minister putting questions to the 
government and having to wait more than 24 hours for those 
answers?  The fact is the government has the resources to answer 
those questions today if it wants to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is such a thing as transparency.  In the business of 
politics there should be transparency.  This restricts my ability 
to represent my constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To conclude, this is a very important topic dealing with the 
Department of Human Resources Development, the abuse of 
shellfishers in eastern Canada and the violation of the code of 
ethics of government employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that the Canadian public and members of 
parliament know the answers to those questions.  It is 
inexcusable that we have to wait in excess of 60 days for answers 
to very important questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee:</B>  Madam Speaker, the hon. member is 
assiduous in pursuing answers to his written questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government makes every effort to provide answers on a timely 
basis.  It is worth noting that oftentimes the way the questions 
are prepared involve many person hours taking into due regard the 
amount of resources and the amount of research that must be put 
into obtaining an answer.  We have often seen replies in the 
House in the form of documentation that is a half-inch to an inch 
thick and involving more than one ministry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regrettably sometimes these answers take more than the presumed 
reasonable amount of time.  I realize that the hon. member has 
two specific questions on the order paper.  In light of his 
representation today he can be sure that I and others who are 
involved in the preparation of these answers will look for a 
reply very soon.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>MARINE LIABILITY ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK213">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of Bill S-2, an act respecting 
marine liability, and to validate certain by-laws and 
regulations, as reported (without amendment) from the committee, 
and of Motions Nos. 1 and 2. 
<P><A NAME="LINK214"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I would like to make some brief comments on behalf of my 
colleague, the member for St. John's East, who has carriage of 
the legislation.  Coming from St. John's he obviously understands 
the necessity for requirements with respect to marine liability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I understand it there are two amendments.  One was put 
forward by the member for Prince George—Peace River.  It calls 
upon the House to amend clause 39 of the bill to make liability 
insurance for passenger vessels mandatory as of January 1, 2003. 
Our party agrees with it.  We believe that anyone who is carrying 
passengers should have mandatory liability insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other one comes from the member for Windsor—St. Clair.  It 
keeps the current wording of clause 39 that allows the government 
to introduce compulsory liability insurance by regulation if it 
sees fit.  However the amendment adds a second part requiring 
vessel operators without insurance to post a notice to that 
effect until such time as liability insurance becomes compulsory. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1225"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We agree that if there is no liability insurance covered by the 
carrier of that particular vessel it should be posted for 
customers to see.  Customers would then have the opportunity of 
deciding whether or not to use the carrier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill consolidates Canada's marine liability law and 
incorporates into Canadian law a number of international 
conventions to which we are a signatory.  However, nowhere in the 
117 pages of the bill does it say a vessel owner must have the 
kind of liability insurance that the bill endlessly talks about 
throughout the whole document.  That in itself is absolutely 
astounding.  We would never think of taking to the roads without 
liability insurance.  When we drive on roads we not only have 
collision but also liability coverage should we be at fault or be 
involved in the injury or death of other parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what we are suggesting should happen here.  It should 
apply not only to ocean going vessels but to those vessels that 
may carry passengers and operate inland.  There are a lot of 
lakes and waterways in Canada.  We believe that any Canadian 
passenger vessel should have the mandatory requirement of 
carrying liability insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not asking very much because there is not a huge cost 
associated with it.  It is just good business.  Whether or not it 
is the law the carriers should carry such insurance, but we know 
that some carriers feel for whatever reasons that if they do not 
want to they should not be forced to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we are suggesting the amendments put forward by the 
members for Prince George—Peace River and Windsor—St. Clair 
should be accepted by the government so that the changed 
legislation would serve Canadians better.  I put that on the 
record on behalf of my colleague from St. John's East. 
<P><A NAME="LINK215"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I would like to address a few items in Bill S-2. I 
cannot resist the temptation to draw attention once again to the 
fact that Bill S-2 comes from the Senate.  I would ordinarily 
have no objection to a bill coming from the Senate.  I know some 
members of the Senate.  Some are very honourable people and they 
work very hard.  That is fine, but I really wish they were 
elected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is something wrong in a modern day democracy when members 
can actually introduce bills which affect our lives and they are 
not even elected.  It is like reverting to a time when kings used 
to tell people what to do.  If the people did not obey they were 
clubbed with a mace, similar to the one we have in the House. 
That was the original purpose of the mace, to enforce the law of 
government or the law of the king. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I object that the bill comes from the Senate.  It should have 
been introduced in this elected House.   We will not flag in our 
zeal to have an elected Senate.  I have had several conversations 
with some senators and have urged them to push for an elected 
Senate.  As I told them, I am sure that with their popularity 
they would probably be elected anyway.  They have nothing to 
worry about.  It would give the position a lot more legitimacy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we are dealing with the liability insurance of shipowners. 
It is curious to me that shipowners of the few ships registered 
in this country are not required by law to actually carry 
liability insurance.  It is very strange.

<A HREF="#LINKT30"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a couple of vehicles.  I am required by law to carry 
liability insurance, not only for someone who happens to be in my 
vehicle but if I happen to injure someone in another vehicle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a matter of fact, I had a conversation with someone just a 
few weeks ago about the required liability insurance on my 
motorcycle.  I said it was really unfair that the liability 
insurance on my motorcycle was almost as high as it was on my 
car.  I said that was really wrong because if I was in an 
accident, although I am well padded, it would still result most 
certainly in serious injuries.  Yet I had this huge liability. I 
said my little 400 pound vehicle with a 400 pound rider was not 
going to cause nearly as much damage as if I had hit somebody 
with my 6,000 pound Suburban.  So that insurance was very unfair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point I am making is that I am required to carry liability 
insurance in the event that something happens, so I comply with 
that law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is beyond me why the government would choose not to include 
such a provision for shipowners and the protection of their 
passengers.  It really boggles the mind.  Every provincial 
government has required public liability insurance.  Taxis have 
to.  Buses have to.  Airlines have to.  Who does not have to? 
The shipowners.  Again, <I>s</I> stands for senate and <I>s</I> 
also stands for ships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to digress.  I am on the finance committee and so I have 
great interest in taxes and things like that.  It is a curiosity 
to me that there are some Canadians who actually own ships who do 
not even register them in our own country.  I suppose they think 
that the tax regime here is unfavourable to them, so they fly 
flags of convenience, as they are called, registering their ships 
in some other country where either the taxes are lower or do not 
exist at all.  I am not aware of this, but it seems to me that 
this particular bill would possibly not even apply to ships which 
are not registered in Canada.  That is a whole other question 
which ought to be addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an amendment put forward by our transportation critic 
which is a very fine amendment.  During the committee hearings on 
the bill, there were representatives who said we should have 
compulsory insurance. There were representatives from the 
insurance industry who said they were ready to provide it, that 
they would write it up and that everything would be in place. 
Notwithstanding that, government officials said there was some 
barrier and that they could not do it.  However the insurance 
people said “Yes we can. What is the impediment?” They said it 
was all ready to go.  The government said in those committee 
meetings that it would introduce regulations which would make 
insurance compulsory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Listen to this very fine amendment.  I know it has already been 
read into the record but it is such a fine one.  The motion that 
our party is putting forward, which must be passed, is just 
common sense.  It says “The Governor in Council”, that is the 
Cabinet, “shall make regulations by January 1, 2003”, that is 
over a year and a half from now, “requiring insurance or 
evidence of financial security be maintained to cover liability 
under this part”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not see a person in the House rising to speak against the 
amendment.  There has not yet been one.  That is because there is 
no rational argument against the amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My big task then is to persuade the 172 Liberals over there to 
support the amendment.  That is the challenge.  I feel that I am 
doubly offended.  First, the bill came into here from the Senate 
and not from this elected place. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1235"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second way in which I am offended is that I do not know if 
the Liberal members, who are in the majority in the House, all 
172 of them over there, are even hearing my arguments.  I am 
telling them there is no rational reason to reject this 
amendment.  If they would only show that they have an ability to 
hear an argument, to understand it and show some wisdom when the 
vote is called and rise unison say that yes, it is a great 
amendment, it makes sense and is consistent with all other 
transportation facilities in the country, therefore we will 
support that amendment.  There is just no other way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a way I am wasting my time putting forward this argument. 
Anybody who would read it and think for about .38 milliseconds, 
because that is how long it would take, could compute that is the 
only reasonable response. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will they do it?  Dare I express my pessimism about it.  It 
seems to me that for the sole reason that this amendment came 
from the opposition rather than from the government the members 
will be told “No, we want to be agin this one”. In unison they 
will stand up and say that they will not vote for common sense, 
that they will not vote for a rational argument and that they 
will not vote for the protection of passengers embarking on trips 
on ships which originate in Canadian ports.  They will do as they 
are told and vote against the amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what I cannot understand.  That is where I suddenly have 
difficulty understanding what goes on here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have stated the case as strongly as I can on that amendment. 
It is absolutely mandatory, it makes sense and it is for the 
protection of passengers.  Furthermore, it is totally doable. 
The insurance people have told us it is.  There is no loss to the 
government.  All it is is a requirement that these shipowners who 
take passengers on will have the ability to cover a possible 
loss.  That is so standard in the industry all over the world. 
It is unbelievable that in this country we even hesitate on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have about two seconds to say that the NDP motion is the 
backup one.  It says that in the event that these Liberals do not 
think on the Canadian Alliance amendment, they have an 
opportunity to bail themselves out partially by requiring that 
these shipowners post a notice clearly visible to passengers 
boarding their ships that there is no insurance on their ships. 
That also makes sense.  We insist nowadays that consumers be 
informed of what their food contains, so they should be informed 
of what coverage they have when they go on a ship.

</I></B></P><P align=left>First, Bill C-245 deals with Part III of the criminal code as 
enacted by section 139 of the Firearms Act.  It was implemented 
with the passing of Bill C-68 several years ago.  The purpose is 
to remove the power in subsection 117.04(2) to search and seize 
without a warrant in cases where no offence has been committed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage people listening to the debate on the bill to look 
at this.  It deals with search and seizure without a warrant in 
cases where no offence has been committed or is suspected to have 
been committed.  It is really important to know that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My bill, if passed, would end the unusual search and seizure 
provisions as put forth by Bill C-68 and bring them more in line 
with search and seizures in the rest of the criminal code.  This 
is something for which Canadians have been asking, especially gun 
owners and those who understand that the whole so-called issue of 
the gun bill really goes way beyond guns.  It speaks to our civil 
liberties, and constitutional implications are involved.  I will 
get to some of those later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second part of the bill also makes provision for the 
restitution for unnecessary loss or damage in a case where a 
search has taken place.  The way it is worded it takes into 
account whether the loss or damage was reasonably necessary in 
light of the evidence collected and in light of the behaviour of 
the person or persons on the premises.  I am not saying there is 
no reason to cause damage in the case of a search process.  I 
want this to be very reasonable.

<A HREF="#LINKT33"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am saying in my bill is that in cases where it is 
demonstrated that the damage done was unreasonable and 
unnecessary there would be restitution for the damage done.  I 
think that will cause police officers to be very cautious in 
their search process, as well as peace officers, because of 
course under this act it does not even have to be police officers 
that break into a house without a warrant.  It can be any peace 
officer, which broadens it considerably.  That is what I am 
asking for in the second part of the bill.  I would add a section 
which would ensure that if unnecessary damage is done there would 
be restitution.  That in a nutshell is what the bill is about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In regard to my concerns, subsection 117.04(2) allows a peace 
officer to enter the premises to search for and to seize weapons 
without a warrant.  Removal of this section means that a warrant 
must be obtained for search and seizure except in cases of fresh 
pursuit, so again I am not being unreasonable.  I think most 
members would agree that this is completely reasonable in a case 
of fresh pursuit where the police officers strongly believe that 
there could be some danger to someone and they want to be able to 
continue the pursuit.  Of course I think the court would 
determine whether it was reasonable.  I trust that process. 
Certainly it would end the measure put in place under Bill C-68 
which allows search and seizure without a warrant at all.  That 
is what is of great concern to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under section 8 of the charter it says that Canadians have the 
right “to be secure against unreasonable search and seizure”. 
That is in our constitution.  Does that sound unreasonable to 
anyone here?  I do not think so.  I have some problems with the 
charter in a broad sense, but I, and I believe many Canadians, 
would not have a problem with saying that Canadians have the 
right to feel secure and be secure against unreasonable search 
and seizure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I argue and many Canadians have argued very vigorously that the 
changes put in the criminal code as a result of the passage of 
Bill C-68, the so-called gun bill, really take away that right 
that is guaranteed under the charter.  Whether the courts would 
or not I cannot say.  However, I know many Canadians feel that it 
is a problem, a problem put in place with the passage of Bill 
C-68. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to speak to the issue of compensation for 
unnecessary damage done.  I may get to two examples, but I 
probably only have time for one.  I will work through that 
example and talk about damage done to private property to a great 
degree in that case, damage which seems to be completely 
unnecessary and excessive and in my view unacceptable.  When I 
get into the case I think that will be better understood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second part of the bill ensures that the damage and the 
confiscation of property without compensation violates a 
fundamental right of Canadian citizens, the right to own 
property.  A problem we have as Canadians is that the right to 
own property is not enshrined in our constitution.  Many thought 
that it should have been part of the charter.  I certainly think 
it should be in our constitution.  So far politicians have chosen 
not to put it there, but certainly common law and most Canadians 
would agree that we do have a right to own property in this 
country and that this right should be respected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How could one argue that this right is being respected in cases 
where we have peace officers breaking into someone's house 
without a warrant and doing unnecessary damage to property or 
removing property unnecessarily?  We are not talking about 
interfering in the actions of police officers where such actions 
are necessary.  We are talking about unreasonable actions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-245 adds a provision to the criminal code that enables a 
person to apply for restitution to the justice who issued the 
warrant, warrants being issued in all cases except those where 
there is fresh pursuit. 
In these cases they would have a right to apply to the justice 
for restitution of the property that has been the subject of 
entry and search under the authority of a warrant pursuant to the 
Firearms Act and if their property has been lost or damaged as a 
result of this entry and search.

<A HREF="#LINKT34"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also adds that the justice will fix a date for a 
hearing on the matter.  The justice will notify the applicant, 
the officer or officers involved and the officer who applied for 
the warrant as well as anyone else the justice sees fit to 
notify.  After the hearing, the justice may order restitution to 
the person whose property has been damaged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask members to think of the practical benefit of this.  I have 
heard numerous complaints, as I am sure many of my colleagues 
have, about searches conducted by peace officers which have 
caused incredible damage, way beyond anything that makes sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part of the reason for that is that police officers have become 
so frustrated because their hands are tied under laws which, 
quite frankly, have been protected by the government. They feel 
their hands are so tied that even if they get a case to court and 
have a lot of evidence, quite frequently the case is thrown out. 
They are frustrated by that.  I have actually heard the thinking 
on this from some police officers, although I do not think it is 
justifiable.  I think it is wrong, but the thinking on the part 
of police officers is that they know this person is a law breaker 
so they will make him pay in this way.  They will do considerable 
damage in the search and that will be justice in itself.  Any of 
us in the House would agree that is not proper and not right.  I 
think this change would only give reasonable protection to that 
type of action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the bill there are exceptions to compensation.  The bill does 
list several situations where compensation is not warranted. 
According to Bill C-245, no person is entitled to restitution for 
loss or damage resulting from entry or search “if the person is 
convicted of an offence on the basis of the evidence discovered 
during the search”.  Even in this situation, the justice must 
conclude that the loss or damage was not excessive in light of 
the nature of the offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, if the applicant lost something he or she did not have 
the right to possess, then of course the applicant would not be 
compensated.  For example, if someone had stolen some property, 
in this case guns, ammunition or other property that was 
discovered in the search, then of course the person should not be 
compensated for the loss of that property.  It does cover that 
kind of thing.  It also covers loss or damage if it was a result 
of the applicant and/or another person on the premises refusing 
to co-operate with the police officer.  It recognizes that in 
cases where the occupants refuse to co-operate, there may be more 
damage done than there would be in another type of search.  It 
covers that kind of thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the limits of restitution for loss or damage, 
Bill C-245 states that there are no limits to restitution for 
loss or damage if the damage was not necessary.  That is only 
reasonable.  Again, it goes to the very right to own property and 
to the expectation that police officers will conduct themselves 
properly in the case of a search. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is recognized in the bill that speed in a search may be 
necessary because of the circumstances and the loss or damage may 
be reasonable where speed is necessary.  There may be more damage 
in a case like that.  The justice can also take into account the 
behaviour of the applicant and other persons during entry and 
search. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now go through a case.  I will start by reading, if I 
may, a short article from the Edmonton <I>Journal</I>.  I also 
have one from the Edmonton <I>Sun</I>.  They are very short 
articles which will not take a lot of time to read.  I will then 
go through them and talk about the case.  This article is 
entitled “Machine guns, ammo found in Lloyd home”.  This is an 
article from March 23.  It says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>More than 100 firearms, including machine guns, and thousands of 
rounds of ammunition were seized during the search of a home 
about 20 kilometres southwest of Lloydminster on Wednesday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“RCMP received a tip in February about the weapons, many of 
which were unlicensed and illegal”, said Const. Jason Simpson of 
the Kitscoty RCMP detachment. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It continues: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A firearms expert is sorting through the prohibited and 
unregistered restricted weapons to make sure proper charges are 
laid.  Simpson said the machine guns were found among a large 
quantity of hunting rifles.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The article goes on to say the man would not be named and that 
the police declined to give details about the suspect because of 
the small population.  Of course everybody in the country knows 
who it is just as a result of this article. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a reference to more than 100 firearms.  Immediately I 
can see the reaction:  that there was no reason the guy would 
need 100 firearms and so of course he deserved what he got. 
However, he is a gun collector.  He has been collecting guns for 
years.  In regard to the machine guns and thousands of rounds of 
ammunition, people would think that there was no good reason for 
him to have them.  All of the weapons could well have been 
legally obtained and may have been legal to own when he came into 
possession of the weapons.  Since that time the laws have 
changed, making them illegal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People would then argue that he should have registered them, 
that he should have done what was necessary.  I will not argue 
that it is the law.  However, the individual knew that if he had 
registered the weapons, if he had done what was proper, they 
would have been taken away from him without compensation. 
Consider how that could change how one would think about the 
situation.  It is important to consider that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am being given the signal to wrap up, but I look forward to 
the opportunity to talk more about this at the end of the hour. 
<P><A NAME="LINK221"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Maloney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to speak to Bill C-245, an act to amend the Criminal 
Code (search and seizure without warrant). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed amendments to the criminal code would prohibit a 
peace officer who was aware that a danger to public safety 
existed from searching for and seizing, without first having to 
obtain a warrant, firearms from people who pose a potential 
danger to themselves or to the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regardless of the existence of exigent circumstances, that is, 
circumstances that have been examined by the courts in the past 
and found to be constitutional, the amendment would prohibit 
police from quelling an imminent danger to public safety.  It is 
conceivable that the police would be powerless to act while life 
is at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In many situations where time is of the essence, this could 
result in the loss of life.  The provisions of Bill C-245 are 
inconsistent with the powers police need to effectively perform 
their duties.  They are inconsistent with the principles of 
firearms control in Canada and inconsistent with the interest of 
public safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed amendments by the hon. member for Lakeland would 
endanger public safety.  The Minister of Justice cannot support 
the amendments to the criminal code put forth by the hon. member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The existing provisions of the criminal code are a valuable part 
of Canada's firearms control legislation and important for 
ensuring public safety.  The controls on the possession and use 
of firearms set out in the Firearms Act are justified in a free 
and democratic society by the need for safety and security for 
our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While it is recognized that most Canadians who own and use 
firearms do so prudently and responsibly, the presence of 
firearms under some circumstances carries with it a risk for the 
safety of all.  In those circumstances, the police must be 
empowered to adequately respond to the danger present.  The 
current provisions of the criminal code permit them to do that. 
Bill C-245 would not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current provisions of the criminal code were devised to 
reach a middle ground, balancing an individual's need for privacy 
with the public's right for safety and security.  They have been 
refined over the years to ensure that the parameters are clearly 
understood.  They have been in place in one form or another for 
over 25 years and have not been the subject of misuse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a rule, a peace officer requires a warrant to search for and 
seize firearms or firearms related items from individuals where 
it is not in the interest of safety that the person possess 
firearms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where public safety is at risk and exigent circumstances are 
present, the criminal code permits peace officers, provided that 
they have reasonable grounds to obtain a warrant, to search for 
and seize firearms and firearms related items without a warrant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the existing provisions of the criminal code permit 
searches and seizures of firearms and firearms related items in 
exigent circumstances, such searches are not without limits or 
exempt from judicial scrutiny.  A peace officer who conducts a 
search without a warrant must nonetheless forthwith make a return 
to a justice indicating the items seized and the grounds on which 
the search was conducted.  Thus, judicial scrutiny is maintained 
even over exceptional searches.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed legislation put forward by the hon. member for 
Lakeland would allow a person whose property is lost or damaged 
as a result of entry and search to apply for restitution to the 
justice who issued the warrant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The criminal code does not provide immunity from civil liability 
for damage to property.  While peace officers are in some 
instances offered protection from criminal liability they remain 
accountable to the courts in both a criminal and civil context 
for their actions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In civil courts crown liability exists by virtue of the Crown 
Liability and Proceedings Act.  The liability of provincial or 
municipal peace officers is addressed by provincial police acts 
or other acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the same manner as a private person, the crown is liable in 
tort for damages caused by its agents.  Capricious or careless 
actions on behalf of peace officers in conducting search and 
seizure for firearms or firearms related items, either with or 
without a warrant, remain actionable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provisions authorizing warrantless searches do not confer 
untrammelled powers to peace officers.  People who suffer 
property loss or damage as a result of a search and seizure by 
peace officers, either with or without a warrant, already have a 
means to seek redress if they have been wronged or have suffered 
damages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of restitution for lost or damaged property is 
complex.  The hon. member for Lakeland proposes that matters of 
civil liability be dealt with in criminal courts by justices who 
are trained to deal with criminal matters.  Justices who hear 
applications for warrants to search and seize are not experienced 
in issues of civil liability.  Those matters are best left to the 
civil courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Civil courts are in a better position to adequately deal with 
issues of liability, value and quantum of damages.  They have the 
expertise and experience and they deal with such issues day to 
day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current provisions of the criminal code strike the proper 
balance between an individual's need for privacy and the public's 
right to safety.  They establish proper limits and judicial 
safeguards while empowering police to adequately respond to 
situations that endanger public safety.  The provisions are 
responsive and fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An individual's right to compensation for lost or damaged 
property is protected by the civil courts and there is no need to 
change the present provisions of the criminal code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For these reasons the Minister of Justice does not support these 
amendments to the criminal code. 
<P><A NAME="LINK222"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to have an opportunity to put some 
comments on record with respect to Bill C-245. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not at all surprised that the Minister of Justice does not 
favour the legislation.  That stands to reason given the almost 
pathological pursuit of the gun registry which has now escalated 
into the hundreds of millions of dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In speaking to police officers and those around the country who 
have the task of applying and enforcing the legislation, we are 
told time and again that it will have no impact on public safety. 
It is nevertheless a white elephant to which everyone in 
government seems to be clinging. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend the hon. member for Lakeland for bringing the issue 
forward to try to improve the ineffective, expensive and 
discriminatory registry scheme in Canada.  It is a bit like 
trying to polish a rotten apple, if I could put it that way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The law of the land is such that Canadians are, at a cost of 
hundreds of millions of dollars, forced to enter into the 
registry and yet some elements of it are particularly unfair. The 
search and seizure aspect which the hon. member for Lakeland has 
seized on should be of great concern to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Conservative Party very much supports the premise of the 
hon. member's bill.  It is necessary to protect gun owners who 
have never committed any offence, been suspected of a crime or 
used a firearm in an irresponsible fashion.  Such individuals are 
subject to search and seizure without a warrant under the new 
provisions of the Firearms Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Accepting these amendments would prevent searches based on 
hearsay or rumour and avoid developing a system akin to the 
former Soviet Union where the KGB had neighbours watching 
neighbours.  Heaven forbid we adopt that type of paranoid justice 
system.  However that is what the current gun registry seems to 
be leading toward.

<A HREF="#LINKT37"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would not hinder police forces in any way from 
protecting the public.  If they have hard evidence they can 
simply get a warrant.  I fully support the efforts of police in 
protecting the public.  However I have no difficulty in making 
the standard higher when it comes to invading a person's home in 
search of an obsolete gun from the second world war, a family 
heirloom or a gun with sentimental value that someone has tucked 
away in a trunk and not registered.  That is the type of 
legislation before the Canadian public today.  It would be 
intrusive into the lives of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The enactment would affect part III of the criminal code as 
enacted by section 139 of the Firearms Act.  The purpose is to 
remove the power in subsection 117.04(2) to enter, search and 
seize without a warrant in cases where no offence has been 
committed or is suspected to have been committed.  It is a very 
common sense, pragmatic provision that would do away with 
potential abuses under the regulatory firearms scheme. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Provision is made for restitution for loss or damage resulting 
from entry and search.  The bill takes into account whether such 
loss or damage was reasonable and necessary in light of evidence 
collected and in light of the behaviour of the person on the 
premises. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is drafted to allow police officers to exercise their 
duties responsibly and reasonably.  Who in their right mind could 
take issue with that?  Why in any stretch of the imagination 
would we not expect that reasonable standard to apply? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Subsection 117.04(2) of the act deals with search and seizure 
without a warrant.  For all intents and purposes the bill would 
remove and repeal that subsection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would make other amendments.  Subsection 117.04(4) of 
the act would be amended to ensure that a peace officer who 
executes a warrant returns to the judge who issued it and shows 
the date it was executed, a description of items and documents 
seized, the extent of the search and any property damage that 
might have resulted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again these safeguards are aimed quite rightly at ensuring 
police officers do not abuse their powers and simply stick to the 
letter of the law and follow the warrant to its natural 
conclusion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary said civil courts are the proper 
route for pursuing matters of property damage.  That is nothing 
short of ridiculous.  The powers of the state and of the 
Department of Justice would be brought to bear upon any 
individual who made such a complaint. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any time a person comes into conflict with a government the 
result is delay.  An army of lawyers and litigators would go to 
great lengths to ensure the matter was not brought to court for 
months if not years.  The average citizen simply does not have 
the resources for such a battle.  The suggestion of the 
parliamentary secretary is therefore bunk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The gun registry is doomed, although it may take another five or 
ten years to finally collapse under its own weight of costs and 
regulatory red tape.  The public, in its wisdom, will eventually 
recognize that the scheme was cumbersome, costly, unworkable and 
unwieldy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Provisions to improve the legislation such as the one before us 
are laudable.  They are encouraging to members of the House who 
see the legislation for what it is.  However the reality is that 
the government will not accept them. 
Its pathological pursuit of this particular registry scheme is 
becoming increasingly recognizable.  This cumbersome, useless 
registry is going to be with us until the government changes. 
That message is becoming clear.  Let us call it for what it is.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The registry is not about safety nor crime control.   As has 
been stated time and time again, members of the Hell's Angels and 
those who engage in crimes using firearms are not going to 
participate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is this legislation all about?  It is aimed at collectors, 
duck hunters, farmers and fishermen who use firearms as part of 
their trade or occupation to control pests or to destroy an 
animal which may have been injured in a humane fashion.  Those 
are the individuals who will be affected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a document in circulation entitled “Self-Defence in 
Canada”.  The Department of Justice acknowledges in that 
document that firearms are used about 32,000 times a year for 
self-protection from criminal activity.  A 1997 a study by Gary 
Mauser said, when animal attacks which had been prevented with 
guns were added in, the annual self-defence numbers actually 
doubled to 64,000 incidents where guns where used to save lives. 
If suicides were removed, which are sadly generally considered to 
be non-preventable, approximately 40 lives were saved for every 
life lost by a firearm.  These figures were based on the 
government's own statistics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In stating government statistics, it is important to recall that 
seven out of ten statistics are wrong.  However 44% of rural 
households in Canada own firearms compared with 11% in Canadian 
cities.  Yet the violent crime rate in cities is 40% higher than 
it is in rural Canada.  We know that this legislation is aimed 
almost entirely, or will have its effect played out, in rural 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993 the RCMP commissioner at the time Philip Murray 
complained in a letter to the minister that her department had 
greatly overstated the number of gun crimes in Canada for that 
year.  Department figures showed that 623 gun related crimes had 
occurred.  Murray stated that the real number was actually 73. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These statistics have been used sadly to misinform Canadians 
about the use of guns in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend the hon. member for Lakeland for bringing this matter 
forward.  It gives us another opportunity to put on the record 
just how inane this legislation really is.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I want to add a couple of comments in support of the 
member for Lakeland who has brought this bill forward.  He has 
brought a couple of good private member's bills forward in the 
past.  The one I particularly liked sought to get expensive tools 
for mechanics deductible.  I applaud him for doing that.  This 
bill is another example of a good bill that has been well 
researched. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However the problem is that this bill is not votable.  After 
debate today it will be dropped from the order paper and nothing 
will be done with it.  All the work that has gone into preparing 
this to bring it forward, all the legal angles that have been 
looked at, goes for naught because it will not be voted on.  Any 
private member's initiative should be.  As members of parliament 
this is one tool we have to bring forward our issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill refers to Bill C-68 concerning gun laws.  I want to 
make sure people understand that a Canadian Alliance government 
would repeal this law and replace it with a law that would 
respect private property rights and target the criminal use of 
firearms, not the lifestyles of law-abiding citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The idea of a peace officer going into a person's home without 
cause or without provocation to search the premises without a 
warrant is something we should not have to discuss. 
The criminal code does allow for such entry but it should not be 
allowed on a routine basis.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most intrusive part of Bill C-68, which people feared and 
opposed the most, was that a peace officer could enter into their 
home and take their private property without reason.  People 
brought this issue to our attention time and time again.  I am 
glad this was brought forward for discussion because it should 
not be a part of Canadian law.  We only expect to hear things 
like that happening in the Soviet Union or some place with a 
dictatorship or a communist state. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If peace officers do enter our premises and, in the process of 
their search, damage our property, whether it is the property 
they are looking for or collateral property, they should provide 
compensation.  The member for Lakeland had examples of where this 
has happened and where the people suffering the damage had no 
recourse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those two issues, the unwarranted search of private property and 
the lack of compensation for damage done during a search, needed 
to be addressed in Bill C-68.  Bill C-245 would do that. 
However, the bill was not made votable so we will not be 
standing in the House to show our support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only way we can show our support for the bill is to say a 
few comments and get them on the record.  We must also say again 
that hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent on the gun 
registry system and we see no end in sight to the cost of 
registering every firearm in Canada.  Nobody knows how many there 
are.  To intrude into the lives of private, law-abiding citizens 
and not specifically target the criminal use of firearms is 
wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-68 needs to be repealed and replaced with comprehensive 
legislation that deals with those issues.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon Benoit (Lakeland, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to take my last five minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will begin by quoting Martin Niemoller, a famous German 
theologian who lived from 1892 to 1984.  It is a very famous 
quote that we have all heard, but I ask every member in the House 
to listen to it again.  It reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Hitler attacked the Jews I was not a Jew, therefore, I was 
not concerned.  And when Hitler attacked the Catholics, I was not 
a Catholic, and therefore, I was not concerned.  And when Hitler 
attacked the unions and the industrialists, I was not a member of 
the unions and I was not concerned.  Then, Hitler attacked me and 
the Protestant church—and there was nobody left to be 
concerned. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would argue that many of the people who looked at this 
so-called gun bill, Bill C-68, and its implementation, fought the 
bill not because they cared about guns.  Many people do not own 
guns and do not care about guns.  They fought what was 
implemented with the bill.  They knew it would be just one step 
in a process that would lead to exactly what the theologian Martin 
Niemoller said in his quote.  If we do not protect the rights of 
others, even if it is an issue that does not directly affect us, 
the time will come when it is not possible under the system in 
place to protect ourselves and our families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would argue that the changes to our law that were put in place 
with the implementation of Bill C-68, the so-called gun bill, 
were a dangerous step down the road to allowing that to happen.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My bill, Bill C-245, would just take a part of Bill C-68, the 
part dealing with unusual search and seizure, and say no, that is 
dangerous, we are allowing unusual search and seizure here, and 
for what?  What is wrong with the provisions already in the 
criminal code that deal with search and seizure? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a real threat to the individual.  It is truly an issue 
that does lead down that path.  I argue that such is the case and 
that is why I brought the bill forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance, when we become the government, would 
revoke all those changes that were put in place with Bill C-68. 
That includes the registry.  That includes the need for a person 
to register guns.  Even if a person is a collector, the law 
requires a person to register every gun.  That also includes the 
section on search and seizure, which we believe is unreasonable, 
as we have argued all along. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All we want to do is put in place reasonable measures to ensure 
that we are not going to move one step further down the road to a 
point where we no longer have the power to stop government from 
infringing on our rights.  I would argue that for that reason, 
that reason alone, even members of the government who implemented 
Bill C-68, the gun bill, should start working with the members on 
this side of the House and with Canadians across the country to 
change that bill.  It was bad law when it was implemented and it 
is bad law now.  I believe that quite a large majority of 
Canadians no longer support it.  I would argue that a majority 
did not support it at the time it was implemented.  There are 
some good studies to back that up.  The Conservative member who 
spoke referred to one of those studies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, my bill never will go to a vote because of our 
private members' procedures in the House.  That has to be 
changed.  Every private member's bill should be votable.  I have 
done a lot of work on the bill and taxpayers have paid a lot of 
money to hire legal counsel to help me draft it.  I believe the 
action in the bill is supported by a majority of people across 
the country, certainly by a large number of people.  We could 
debate it and talk about that.  We could have a vote in the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Madam Speaker, that is what should have happened.  The best I 
can do is bring this to the attention of the public in this way. 
I think it does have an impact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the House for this time and I look forward to some 
action in the future to help fix the bad law that was put in 
place with the enactment of Bill C-68. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B>  The time provided for 
the consideration of private members' business has now expired. 
As the motion has not been designated a votable item, the order 
is dropped from the order paper. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It being 1.25 p.m., the House stands adjourned until Monday next 
at 11 a.m. pursuant to Standing Order 24(1). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(The House adjourned at 1.23 p.m.)
