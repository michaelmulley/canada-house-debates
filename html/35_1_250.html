<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CANADAHEALTHACT">CANADA HEALTH ACT</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona, NDP)</B> moved that Bill 
C-284, an act to amend the Canada Health Act (conditions for 
contributions) be read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I am in the happy position today of being 
able to report to the House that a great deal of progress has been 
reached on this issue since I introduced this private member's bill. I 
understand that a protocol such as this bill would have provided for 
is more than just in the works. There may even be a document 
outlining the protocol in circulation for comment, although it is 
hard to pin that down.
<P>
	I thought the best thing I could do at this point is give a bit of a 
history of the development of this issue leading up to the present 
and a few words about where I think it should go now. I thank the 
hon. member for Hamilton West for seconding the motion.
<P>
	Many members of the House will be aware that firefighters have 
been lobbying for a long time for a national contagious diseases 
reporting protocol. They have their annual lobby on the Hill and 
they meet with many members of Parliament. This is one of the 
three or four items they have been stressing for a number of years 
now.
<P>
	Firefighters and other emergency responders have been 
concerned about developing a protocol so that they could be 
informed if they were likely to have been in contact with a 
contagious disease in the course of their work and provided with 
the appropriate medical treatment and counselling in the event of 
exposure on the job.
<P>
	In February 1992 NDP labour critic Joy Langan, the former 
member for Mission-Coquitlam, introduced a private member's 
bill that found an elegant solution to the constitutional problem 
which had presented itself  with respect to this issue; that this was 
regarded as being in the provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
<B>(1105)</B>
<P>
	Her bill would have amended the Canada Health Act to make it 
necessary for provinces to set up their own protocol if they were to 
receive federal health funding. The idea was to use the federal 
spending power in health to establish a contagious diseases 
protocol in exactly the same way the federal spending power was 
used to establish medicare nationally and to establish other 
conditions for the receipt of federal transfer payments for health 
care. In effect the establishment of this kind of infectious diseases 
protocol would have been another national standard, so to speak.
<P>
	Although the bill was never debated in Parliament there was 
all-party support for the idea among members. After negotiations 
the NDP at that time managed to get the matter referred to the 
Standing Committee on Health and Welfare.
<P>
	The committee held hearings in early 1993 and tabled a report in 
June of that year. The committee recommended, among other 
things, that the federal government ``encourage the provincial and 
territorial governments to develop and implement within their 
jurisdictions a protocol for post-exposure management and 
follow-up of emergency response personnel exposed to airborne 
and blood borne diseases''. It asked the government to report back 
to the committee in one year on the progress in establishing such a 
protocol. This amounted to a substantial endorsement of the 
principles of Joy Langan's bill.
<P>
	Although it was too much to ask that the federal bureaucracy 
actually fulfil the one year deadline set up by the committee, in 
September 1994 the Liberal government did hold a national 
symposium on infectious diseases and emergency responders 
which I attended in part as an observer in my new capacity as the 
NDP labour critic.
<P>
	The symposium brought together provincial and federal officials 
as well as a wide range of stakeholders among emergency 
responders. The symposium heard very good reports on the 
development of a protocol in the province of Ontario in which an 
NDP provincial government at that time, responding to firefighter 
concerns, had taken the initiative. There was a lot of enthusiasm for 
its development and application in other provinces and territories.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15940"> 15940 </A></B>
<P>
	I say with some pride this was not the first time an NDP 
provincial government led the way on such issues. By taking the 
initiative and by doing the pilot project it put pressure on other 
provinces and the federal government to do likewise. While we 
are talking about the Canada Health Act this is how we got our 
publicly funded health care system in the first place, medicare, 
when the Saskatchewan NDP government of many years ago did 
a similar thing in the sixties.
<P>
	I tried to add to the momentum building for a national protocol 
by tabling a private member's bill early in this Parliament. It was 
very similar to Joy Langan's but added a section that would have 
improved the privacy concerns about the release of private medical 
information. That was one of the concern's about Joy Langan's bill 
tabled last Parliament.
<P>
	Even with all this momentum building toward a national 
protocol, the two private members' bills by NDP members, reports 
by a House committee and a national symposium and the Ontario 
protocol, it appeared that in May the government was backing 
away from a national protocol. I remember asking the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Health about the 
government's intentions in this regard. She appeared at that time to 
be washing the government's hands of the issue and she answered 
me only that health was a provincial responsibility, and that was the 
end of the matter.
<P>
	However, the International Association of Fire Fighters, to its 
credit, kept up the pressure and in June of this year a meeting was 
held between federal and provincial health officials and other 
stakeholders in which a national protocol was agreed upon. I have 
yet to see the final version but it is my understanding the 
International Association of Fire Fighters was very satisfied with 
the results of that meeting.
<P>
<B>(1110 )</B>
<P>
	What I understand to have happened between then and now is the 
federal and provincial governments have agreed to a protocol that 
would allow emergency workers to learn of any health risks they 
may have been exposed to in the case of significant exposure to 
blood borne infectious diseases.
<P>
	I understand the agreement has built-in protections for the 
confidentiality of patients' medical records, setting up a procedure 
through which emergency response personnel who have had 
significant exposure to blood can contact the local medical officer 
who in turn seeks information from the hospital on behalf of the 
affected emergency personnel.
<P>
	In June the federal government said it would release a document 
by mid-October. I understand from conversations I have had with 
the firefighters as recently as Friday that this has not yet been done. 
I also heard from officials in the health minister's office that at 
least  they think there is a document in circulation for comment.
<P>
	At this point in the development of this issue there seems to be 
some confusion. Perhaps whoever is speaking with the knowledge 
of what goes on inside the government today can clear this up. 
People feel progress has been made. It certainly appears progress 
has been made. We had the successful meeting in June, the 
agreement on a protocol. Firefighters have an understanding of 
what that protocol will be like. However, there is still no document 
which outlines the details of that protocol so that firefighters and 
others like me would be able to respond with some knowledge of 
what has actually been agreed upon and what the details are.
<P>
	It would have been nice if that document had been released and 
in an obvious and available kind of way in mid-October. On the 
occasion of debating this bill we would have been able to talk about 
the details of the bill. If there were some constructive criticisms to 
make they could have been made here or they could have been 
responded to here. However, we are not in that position now.
<P>
	Unfortunately with these kinds of things we will not be in this 
position ever again because the bill will be debated only for this 
hour; it is not a votable bill. Frankly, given there is this kind of 
progress, unless we are all being mislead in some way there is 
really no need for the bill to go to committee or for it to proceed. 
We do have a protocol but we are not able to comment on the 
details at this time. I invite members opposite who may be in the 
know to say more about this.
<P>
	I do not mean to single this out for special praise or 
commendation, as there are others, but it is an example of how 
through the private member's process an issue can be advanced, an 
issue can be pushed, an issue can be kept on the agenda. Eventually 
the government finds itself in a position to respond because it feels 
it has to or it finally becomes convinced of the need to respond or it 
is one of those mysterious political democratic things where at a 
certain point something becomes acceptable and doable that 
seemed very difficult to accomplish only a short time ago or 
yesterday, as one hon. member has said.
<P>
	I am very glad to see there has been this kind of progress. It is 
preferable to have happened in this way. We are in a debate now 
about the imposition of national standards and conditions through 
the use of federal spending power through the Canada Health Act. 
It probably would not have been the preferred route given the 
current political and constitutional climate, shall we say, to have 
invoked the Canada Health Act as a way of achieving this. 
Although if push came to shove that procedure was there and that 
was a way to have the federal government seized of the issue and 
putting the government in a position where it could not say there 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15941"> 15941 </A></B>
<P>
was  nothing it could do because this was matter of provincial 
jurisdiction.
<P>
	I think federal spending power ought to be used in areas where it 
is important to delineate and to enforce national standards. In that 
respect I am sure I have some disagreement with some of my 
colleagues in the House.
<P>
<B>(1115)</B>
<P>
	I am attached to the Canada Health Act. I was here in the House 
when it was passed in April 1984. I was a member of the health and 
welfare standing committee which studied the bill. There are 
amendments and phrases in the bill which I moved myself. In my 
political judgment, the bill owes its existence in part to the pressure 
which we brought to bear on the government between 1980 and 
1984. In fact, in her book <I>Medicare in Crisis</I> Monique BÃ©gin 
openly credits the NDP for the role it played in pressing the 
government to bring in the Canada Health Act.
<P>
	I raise all of this because now there is a different third party in 
the House, our Reform Party colleagues. I often see a stark contrast 
between what we called for when we were the third party and there 
was a Liberal government and what the Reform Party is calling for. 
We said to bring in the Canada Health Act and to eliminate user 
fees and extra billing. Now the third party in the House is saying: 
``Get rid of the Canada Health Act and let us not have national 
standards any more. Let us permit the provinces to do what they 
will''. There are two competing visions of what is a national 
government.
<P>
	One of my concerns today as we contemplate the vote in Quebec, 
is that regardless of the outcome, if I hear the Prime Minister and 
others correctly, even if there is a no vote we are on the verge of 
major decentralization. I urge my Liberal colleagues, no matter 
what changes may be undertaken in response to a no vote by way of 
decentralization, that what we achieved together, the NDP and the 
Liberal government at the time, on the Canada Health Act and the 
notion that when it comes to health care there are values, 
procedures and standards we all hold in common as Canadians 
wherever we live from coast to coast to coast, be held up and not 
surrendered in the wake of a no vote.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Hedy Fry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak on Private Members' 
Bill C-284, an act to amend the Canada Health Act.
<P>
	Let me say at the outset that I am extremely sympathetic and 
supportive of the plight and concerns of emergency response 
workers. Their devotion to preserving and protecting the lives of 
others often puts them unwittingly at risk of injury or exposure to 
disease. They are not aware of what the patient is carrying.
<P>
	I understand and support the motive behind Bill C-284. 
Unfortunately, the Canada Health Act is the wrong instrument. The 
amendment is not within the  scope of the act. The Canada Health 
Act sets out the broad principles under which the provinces are 
expected to operate medicare. An amendment dealing with the 
disclosure of infectious diseases is inconsistent with this purpose.
<P>
	While the protection of health care workers from contagious 
diseases is an extremely worthwhile public health objective, the 
Canada Health Act is not the proper vehicle by which to achieve 
this. Let me explain.
<P>
	Our health care insurance system is composed of 12 interlocking 
plans which are managed at the provincial and territorial levels. 
The federal health insurance legislation, which is what the Canada 
Health Act of 1984 is, establishes the criteria provincial plans must 
meet in order to qualify for a full share of federal health care 
transfers. Federal transfer payments may be reduced or withheld if 
a province contravenes the conditions of the act.
<P>
	I will discuss these criteria, the cornerstones of Canada's health 
care system.
<P>
	There is accessibility, which means access to medically required 
services regardless of ability to pay. That translates into no charges 
at point of service. There is comprehensiveness, which means a 
comprehensive range of medically required services. Universality 
means the coverage of all provincial residents must be given 
equally regardless of pre-existing conditions or diseases. 
Portability ensures that benefits go from province to province and 
abroad. Finally, public administration of medicare means that the 
plan must operate on a non-profit basis.
<P>
<B>(1120)</B>
<P>
	In addition to those five principles, the Canada Health Act 
requires that provinces provide medicare information to the federal 
minister when she needs it. In order to qualify for federal cash 
contributions, provinces also need to give recognition to the fact 
that the federal government does transfer payments.
<P>
	The Canada Health Act also discourages extra billing or user 
fees. If this is broken, there will be automatic dollar for dollar 
reductions or withholdings of federal cash contributions to that 
province or territory. The threat that user charges and extra billing 
would erode accessibility to medicare was a major reason for the 
development of the Canada Health Act in the first place. It was 
enacted to protect those five fundamental principles of medicare I 
just spoke about. Nearly all provinces have committed themselves 
to upholding these principles even while making needed reforms to 
the system.
<P>
	Canadians support the five principles and feel that medicare is a 
defining Canadian value. Results of a recent poll indicate that 
support for these national principles is higher than ever.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15942"> 15942 </A></B>
<P>
	The Canada Health Act which defines medicare is close to the 
hearts of Canadians. It is something too risky to tamper with. The 
amendments to change the Canada Health Act as proposed in Bill 
C-284 by my hon. colleague cannot be supported.
<P>
	The amendments ask that the name and nature of an infectious or 
contagious disease be disclosed to emergency response workers 
who may have been unknowingly exposed to that disease. While I 
support this objective, the amendments themselves affect the 
definition of hospital services. This will change the Canada Health 
Act criteria which deal only with the principles and funding of 
medicare. Rules are are set out concerning the non-compliance 
with the Canada Health Act and are part of the act.
<P>
	In short, Bill C-284 asks that provincial and territorial plans 
impose a responsibility on hospitals to disclose to emergency 
response employees whether a patient to whom they are providing 
service has an infectious or contagious disease which is fine. 
However, it seeks to do this by making it a criteria of the Canada 
Health Act.
<P>
	The disclosure of infectious or contagious diseases is a public 
health issue. It is not of the same nature as the principles and 
funding issues in the Canada Health Act. The protection of 
emergency response personnel is not even close to the purpose of 
the Canada Health Act.
<P>
	Moreover, the act deals with the organization and delivery of 
health care services at the provincial and territorial levels and not 
with the regulation of internal operations of hospitals which falls 
under provincial and territorial jurisdiction. It would be intrusive to 
ask the federal government to impose on or intrude into the 
federal-provincial primary responsibility for hospital management 
which is a constitutionally protected right.
<P>
	Moreover, Bill C-284 raises issues with regard to civil laws and 
rights and privacy laws in the provinces and territories. The federal 
government cannot really interfere in these issues.
<P>
	What I am trying to say is that worthwhile though the member's 
intent may be, the Canada Health Act is not the proper place to 
regulate such matters which constitutionally fall under provincial 
jurisdiction and should be better handled at that level. The federal 
government cannot dictate to a province or territory how to run its 
health care plan, much less tell it how to run institutions. All it can 
do under the Canada Health Act is to place conditions on transfer 
payments to the provinces and territories.
<P>
	At a meeting of health ministers in Victoria recently, provincial 
and territorial ministers reaffirmed their support for the principles 
of the act and agree to continue to collaborate in interpreting and 
applying its provisions. Provincial and territorial ministers agreed 
with the federal Minister of Health to work together to develop a 
vision for the future of medicare.
<P>
<B>(1125 )</B>
<P>
	Contrary to the misunderstanding of certain parties, the Canada 
Health Act is not an impediment to the management changes which 
are needed to meet medicare's challenges. In fact, the flexibility 
inherent in the act has always been one of its strengths.
<P>
	Since the enactment of the act in 1984, the federal government 
has attempted to work with the provinces in order to make the act a 
viable piece of legislation. The federal government recognizes that 
provinces and territories have primary responsibility for the 
management, organization and the delivery of health care services, 
including institutions and health care providers. Sufficient 
flexibility to operate and administer their health care insurance 
plans is obviously necessary if they are to meet the regional and 
local needs and conditions.
<P>
	At the August conference, provincial premiers and territorial 
leaders were unanimous in their support of the publicly funded 
national health care system and reaffirmed their commitment to the 
principles of the Canada Health Act. It would be dangerous 
therefore, to tamper with those principles when they have received 
such wholehearted support. If we want medicare to survive, we 
must be vigilant against seemingly innocuous tampering as against 
more blatant threats such as user charges which as we know arise 
now and then.
<P>
	I come back to the point that while the protection of health care 
workers is a serious concern and one which I share with the hon. 
member, the Canada Health Act is not the vehicle with which to 
address it. At the same time, the department has been involved with 
the prevention of infectious diseases and the protection of 
emergency response personnel for a very long time and is 
continuing to work with them on issues of concern. Let me give a 
few examples of our recent achievements in this area.
<P>
	In 1994 a national symposium on risk and prevention of 
infectious diseases for emergency response personnel was held to 
explore the same question the member is talking about and to look 
at implementing where possible preventive and protective actions 
for those workers.
<P>
	In June of this year a consensus conference was held with the 
objective of establishing guidelines the provinces and territories 
could use to develop and implement an infectious disease 
notification protocol for emergency responders. These guidelines 
are good examples of how the provinces and territories look to the 
federal government to provide a leadership and co-ordinating role 
in discussing issues related to health protection.
<P>
	I have confidence in the ability of emergency response workers 
as the ones who are best qualified to seek solutions in conjunction 
with their provincial and territorial governments, health 
professionals and experts in infectious diseases. They have our 
support.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15943"> 15943 </A></B>
<P>
	The Canada Health Act which protects our universal and 
comprehensive health care system agrees with that commitment. 
However, facing the challenges and finding solutions to problems 
which arise over the years took commitment as well and the 
commitment is still there today.
<P>
	Today we can look back with pride on our past accomplishments, 
but we cannot be satisfied to rest on our laurels. The systems and 
the federal provincial relationships face many challenges and the 
issue raised by Bill C-284 is such a challenge. To this end, we as a 
federal Ministry of Health have taken the appropriate steps to 
support the concerns and efforts of the emergency response 
workers. At the same time the federal government cannot support 
an amendment which has no place in the Canada Health Act.
<P>
	I encourage all hon. members to participate in the discussion of 
this issue with emergency response workers at the constituency 
level and to take appropriate steps to assist them in this important 
and worthy objective.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sharon Hayes (Port Moody-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak on Bill C-284 today, an act to amend 
the Canada Health Act, sponsored by the member for 
Winnipeg-Transcona.
<P>
	The purpose of the bill is ``to incite the provinces to make sure 
that the health care insurance plan of a province provides for the 
obligation for hospitals to disclose to emergency response 
employees who provide emergency medical or rescue services to a 
patient, the name and nature of an infectious or contagious disease 
that the patient might have transmitted to them''. The essence of 
this bill is to ensure the safety of those who work in medical or 
rescue operations who are at risk of being exposed by an infectious 
or contagious disease.
<P>
	The dedication of the people to whom this bill is addressed is to 
be commended and admired. I have talked with different 
emergency response workers and know their dedication and the 
risk they face each time they respond to an emergency. These 
professionals are police officers, firefighters, emergency medical 
technicians and paramedics.
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
	I can agree with the intent of the bill. However, I disagree with 
the the means by which it seeks to accomplish and implement that 
purpose. Specifically, the bill seeks to amend the Canada Health 
Act by adding additional criteria to the list.
<P>
	I must agree with the Liberal parliamentary secretary that the 
Canada Health Act is not the vehicle for this. I will go on to explain 
why.
<P>
	Clause 2 of the bill amends section 7 of the Canada Health Act. 
Section 7 outlines the principles of the Canada Health Act. These 
are public administration, comprehensiveness, universality, 
portability and  accessibility. The bill would add an additional 
criteria to that list and that is the disclosure of infectious or 
contagious diseases.
<P>
	The Reform Party has consistently demonstrated how the 
Canada Health Act has allowed the federal government and others 
to play a carrot and stick game with the provinces. The carrot is the 
money that the federal government transfers to the provinces for 
medicare. The stick is the heavy handedness of the Canada Health 
Act that allows the federal government to financially penalize the 
provinces.
<P>
	Sections 14 and 15 of the Canada Health Act allow the federal 
government and the health minister to financially penalize 
provinces if the minister has found that the province is in violation 
of sections 8 to 13 of the act. These sections deal with the five 
principles, as I have mentioned, of public administration, 
comprehensiveness, universality, portability and accessibility and 
finally, the conditions for the cash contributions or payments to 
those provinces.
<P>
	The bill adds an additional criteria to a list that Reform members 
feel is intrusive already. It adds the disclosure of infectious or 
contagious diseases. By adding it to the program criteria of section 
7 of the Canada Health Act, it would create another basis for the 
federal government to financially penalize these provinces. We 
have just gone through a recent example of how the federal 
government imposes its will on provinces with the issue, debated in 
this House, of private clinics in Alberta and other provinces.
<P>
	Although the purpose and the intent of the bill is commendable, I 
disagree with the way it is designed to legislate that purpose.
<P>
	Reform has a different and fresh philosophy to approach 
medicare in Canada. Our approach, and we call it medicare plus, 
contains the following: first, we reaffirm that the value of medicare 
is the best health care safety net in the world. Second, we would 
define medicare as Canada's comprehensive set of core national 
health standards, publicly funded, portable across Canada and 
universally accessible to all Canadians, regardless of their ability to 
pay. These are essentially the principles that now exist in the 
Canada Health Act.
<P>
	We differ from the Canada Health Act and from the view of the 
government and the approach taken in this bill by removing the 
restrictions and the ability of the federal government to penalize 
provinces within these criteria. That is the plus of medicare plus 
and the third of our proposals. We would give provinces greater 
flexibility to administer and deliver the health services within their 
own respective jurisdiction. That is our general philosophy and our 
approach to federal involvement in medicare.
<P>
	It would apply to Bill C-284 as well. We believe the provinces 
should decide whether or not to pass legislation  on the disclosure 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15944"> 15944 </A></B>
<P>
of infectious or contagious diseases rather than be compelled by a 
federal government through the Canada Health Act.
<P>
	As my colleague mentioned today, in June there was a 
federal-provincial notification protocol established in this area. 
This dealt with blood borne diseases and took into account the 
confidentiality concerns and the procedures that would result. I 
commend the government for proceeding in this direction.
<P>
	One question I have today of the government, as my colleague 
also had, is why this was not proceeded with and then the 
information given to the people discussing the bill today? Again 
this is a reflection of the inactivity in the House or the lack of 
proaction on real measures that need to be addressed within this 
place. This is unfair to Canadians, specifically to the emergency 
response personnel for instance within this very bill.
<P>
<B>(1135)</B>
<P>
	Bill C-284 illustrates once again the failure of the government to 
proceed with substantive steps in the proper areas where Canadians 
need things addressed.
<P>
	Generally my philosophy would be that it is grassroots not 
Ottawa that must reform an ailing health care system in terms of 
the Canada Health Act. Bill C-284 speaks to increased federal 
control over a medicare system that is increasingly unaffordable at 
the federal level. Ottawa's share of our medicare system was 
originally 50 per cent and is now down to approximately 24 per 
cent or less. Its share will likely disappear within 10 to 15 years.
<P>
	The symptoms that we see are bed closures. In my own 
provinces hospitals have closed. There are long waiting lists, up to 
seven to twelve weeks for procedures. There has been a de-listing 
of medical services so that each province may have a different base 
from which to work. There is reduced medical coverage for 
Canadians travelling abroad. As important as any of the others, 
there has been an exodus of some of our expert medical personnel 
from our land.
<P>
	Reform says that the five program criteria should be maintained 
but we have to re-examine the definition of those program criteria. 
We have to allow room for provinces to exercise administrative 
jurisdictions over the funding and delivery of our health care 
system. The crisis in our country is not what is done but of federal 
government intrusion into provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	Today, we think of Canada as a grand old house that has fallen 
into a serious state of disrepair. Today I stand with great trepidation 
as I see the foundations of that house facing a great test. It is true 
that the house of our nation has an unsustainable mortgage. It has a 
cracked foundation. It has serious problems with some of the ways 
that the walls are fitting together and how the communications 
work within that house.
<P>
	However, within the last few days I have seen many Canadians 
speak out with a great love and a newly discovered feeling of the 
importance of this country to them. This is all the more reason that 
I feel today it is time for the government to recognize that there has 
to be a new relationship within this House, new federal-provincial 
relationships outside the Constitution. Our own party has suggested 
20 ways where we can bring provinces and the federal government 
together so that as a nation we can stand together today and 
tomorrow in order to make this country work.
<P>
	Decentralizing those powers includes a medicare system that 
works for all Canadians, that is sustainable and that will be here 
today and tomorrow. I challenge the government to change at our 
medicare system so that it will work. I also challenge the 
government to look at many other things, as we have suggested, so 
that we have a Canada today and tomorrow.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Maloney (Erie, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak on 
the subject of a private member's bill, C-284, an act to amend the 
Canada Health Act.
<P>
	Under the Canadian Constitution the responsibility for health 
care falls primarily under the jurisdiction of the provincial and 
territorial governments. In other words, the provinces and the 
territories have a primary responsibility for the provision and 
delivery of health care services to the people of Canada.
<P>
	This means that they act as planners, managers and 
administrators of their own health care systems. In practical terms, 
this includes negotiation of budgets with hospitals, approval of 
capital plans and the negotiation of fee agreements with medical 
associations. For its part the federal government by law is 
responsible for the promotion and preservation of the health of all 
Canadians. The Department of Health is responsible for bringing 
together parties on health issues of a national and interprovincial 
concern.
<P>
<B>(1140)</B>
<P>
	The federal government also assumes a responsibility for setting 
national policies and for providing health care services to specific 
groups such as treaty Indians as well as the Inuit.
<P>
	It is appropriate when describing federal responsibilities in 
health care to note what the federal government cannot do. It 
cannot interfere in provincial and territorial responsibilities as 
defined under our Constitution. Nor can it be seen to be infringing 
on these responsibilities.
<P>
	Bill C-284 attempts to require provincial and territorial health 
insurance plans to impose a responsibility on hospitals to disclose 
to emergency response employees whether a patient to whom they 
are providing service has an infectious or a contagious disease. I 
sympathize with the concerns of emergency response workers. 
They must be commended for accepting the fact that they are at 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15945"> 15945 </A></B>
<P>
risk  to exposure to diseases that may not be completely 
preventable in serving the public.
<P>
	Indeed my wife and several members of my family are employed 
in the health care field as well as in the emergency response field. 
Therefore I understand and support the motives behind Bill C-284.
<P>
	However, it is the provinces and territories that are responsible 
for all matters dealing with their hospitals. This represents what 
would be perceived as an intrusion on provincial and territorial 
responsibilities under our Constitution. It is not an easy solution as 
one would think. There is in this country a longstanding partnership 
between the federal, provincial and territorial governments with 
regard to health care.
<P>
	The enactment of the Hospital Insurance and Diagnostic 
Services Act of 1957 and the Medical Care Act, 1966-67 
established a framework for this partnership between governments. 
At this time the federal government provides a sharing of the cost 
of medically necessary hospital and physician services in return for 
the adherence of the provincial and territorial health insurance 
plans through the principles of a national program.
<P>
	Federal legislation, the the Hospital Insurance and Diagnostic 
Services Act and the Medical Care Act recognized the 
constitutional position of provincial and territorial governments 
and left each with the responsibility of administering its respective 
plans.
<P>
	Concerns over hospital user fees and extra billing by physicians 
led to the passage of the Canadian Health Act in 1984. This was 
achieved with all-party support. The federal government's aim in 
passing the Canada Health Act was to reaffirm its commitment to 
the original guiding principles expressed in earlier legislation. It 
was also to provide a mechanism to promote the provinces' and 
territories' compliance with the act's criteria, conditions and extra 
billing and user charge provisions.
<P>
	In short, the Canada Health Act was intended to encourage 
reasonable access to necessary health care services on a prepaid 
basis for every resident of Canada. The provinces and territories 
have retained their responsibility of administering their health 
insurance plans under the Canada Health Act. They continue to be 
responsible for negotiations with physicians and hospitals.
<P>
	Since the introduction of government sponsored health 
insurance, physicians have been free of the administrative 
constraints of managed care found in the United States and this 
continues under the Canada Health Act. Hospitals retain the 
freedom to charge for semi-private or private rooms and for meals 
and accommodations for chronically ill patients who are more or 
less permanently resident in hospitals.
<P>
	The Canada Health Act's criteria are known to most Canadians 
and regarded as the defining principles of  medicare. The principles 
of public administration, comprehensiveness, universality, 
portability and accessibility are valued and cherished by Canadians 
who will not accept changes to them. The results of a recent poll 
indicate that support for these national principles remain at an 
all-time high.
<P>
	Provincial and territorial ministers of health share this support. 
On many occasions the provincial and territorial ministers 
reaffirmed their support for the principles of the act and their 
agreement to continue co-operation in interpreting and applying its 
provisions.
<P>
	The Canada Health Act's criteria relate to the organization and 
delivery of health care services at the level of provincial and 
territorial health insurance plans. Bill C-284 proposes to add 
disclosure of infectious or contagious diseases to the Canada 
Health Act's criteria. However this addition deals with a hospital 
requirement, while the Canada Health Act pertains to provincial 
and territorial health insurance plans.
<P>
	If such legislation could be enacted we would be concerned that 
it may give false assurances to emergency workers and their 
families that if they are not informed they are not infected. 
Unfortunately some diseases may not be detectable, at least using 
current methods, until some time after the infection. Solutions 
must be sought to meet this problem.
<P>
<B>(1145 )</B>
<P>
	Health Canada has been involved with the prevention of 
infectious diseases and the protection of emergency response 
personnel for a very long time. Let me give a few examples of our 
recent achievements in this area. In 1994 a national symposium on 
risk and prevention of infectious diseases for emergency response 
personnel was held to explore the risks emergency responders face 
and the preventive and protective activities presently available.
<P>
	In June 1995 a consensus conference was held with the objective 
of establishing guidelines the provinces and territories could use to 
develop and implement an infectious disease notification protocol 
for emergency responders. These guidelines are a good example of 
how the provinces and territories look to the federal government to 
provide a leadership role in issues related to health protection.
<P>
	I also have confidence in the ability of emergency response 
workers themselves, as those who are admirably qualified to find 
solutions, to join with us to alleviate the risk of infection along with 
the provincial and territorial health departments, along with health 
professionals and experts in infectious diseases. Given the large 
burden for our health that emergency response workers carry, I am 
sure that provincial and territorial governments are sympathetic, 
supportive, and eager to co-operatively find solutions. I know I am.
<P>

<P>

<P>
	The evolution of federal, provincial, and territorial relations in 
health care has maintained a distinction in federal, provincial, and 
territorial roles in health care, which is consistent with the 
Constitution's definition of jurisdiction. This is clearly stated in 
the preamble of the Canada Health Act:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>that it is not the intention of the Government of Canada that any of the 
powers, rights, privileges or authorities vested in Canada or the Provinces 
under the provisions of The Constitution Act, 1867 (formerly the British 
North America Act, 1867), or any amendments thereto, or otherwise, be by 
reason of this Act abrogated or derogated from or in any way impaired;</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Some would argue that to pass Bill C-284 would disrupt this 
historical distinction and balance and for this reason it cannot be 
supported by the federal government.
<P>
	I encourage all hon. members to participate in discussions about 
this important concern in their communities in order to find a way 
to protect the emergency response workers whose job it is to 
protect us all. Few would argue the fact that the problem is serious. 
It is incumbent on all levels of government to hammer out a 
solution. The time is now.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Hamilton West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, while I 
wholeheartedly endorse the spirit of Bill C-284, a private 
member's initiative moved by my colleague, the hon. member for 
Winnipeg Transcona, which I had the privilege of seconding, I 
cannot see where we can support his idea to put it through the 
Canada Health Act.
<P>
	Perhaps what we have to do today is not talk about what we 
cannot do. I have to agree with the position taken by the 
parliamentary secretary. She very eloquently put forward the 
reasons we cannot put it through the Canada Health Act, as was 
proposed by the member for Winnipeg Transcona; rather, we 
should find a mechanism, a way to accomplish our goal.
<P>
	Since I was elected in 1988, firefighters from Hamilton and 
across this great country have been lobbying legislators to set up a 
contagious disease protocol. They stress, and all of us who have 
heard their lobby agree, that it should be of national importance, 
which it is; that it must be co-ordinated nationally, and we agree; 
that we should establish national standards and conditions, which 
can happen. We need a way to administer the protocol that is being 
proposed.
<P>
	The international association of firefighters has been meeting 
with provincial and federal representatives since June. They have 
had quite a bit to say about this. There have been some resolutions. 
Progress is being made. Maybe the amendments being put forward 
by the hon. member for Winnipeg Transcona are a worthwhile 
public health objective and need to be examined.
<P>
<B>(1150)</B>
<P>
	The purpose of Bill C-284 is to incite the provinces to ensure that 
the health care insurance plan of a province provides for the 
obligation for hospitals to disclose to emergency response 
employees who provide emergency medical or rescue services to a 
patient the name and nature of an infectious or contagious disease 
the patient might have transmitted to them.
<P>
	As I said at the outset, maybe we have to look at what we can do. 
What we can do is search out a central organization that would 
work with the hospitals to create that information-sharing proposal. 
I wonder if the hon. member for Winnipeg Transcona has 
considered approaching the Canadian Centre for Occupational 
Health and Safety. That particular centre, which is located in my 
riding of Hamilton West, receives a government subsidy, although 
it has been cut back. To its credit, it has been sharing information 
with the private sector and actually selling a product to employees 
and companies, both here in Canada and in the United States, to 
obtain the money it needs.
<P>
	I wonder if the hon. member for Winnipeg Transcona has 
approached the Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and 
Safety, which has created a database of infectious diseases, of 
products different companies across the nation use in their 
workplaces, et cetera. For example, the Canadian Centre for 
Occupational Health and Safety is there for the major corporations 
in product identification. It is also there for an individual 
employee, someone who may be working on the shop floor in 
Winnipeg when a drum spills over and some glop pours out. The 
employee can see that the barrel is marked XT-2000. He is not sure 
what XT-2000 is, so he calls the Canadian Centre for Occupational 
Health and Safety to find out what the product is and whether it will 
be harmful to his health.
<P>
	I wonder if the hon. member for Winnipeg Transcona, in looking 
for a way to accomplish a very credible goal, has looked at the 
options. The parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Health 
made it quite clear today that it is not really in the domain of the 
federal government, but rather a central organization. This could 
address the opportunities the member spoke of, could satisfy the 
needs of the medical emergency personnel and rescue services 
people who are responding to the patient who might have an 
infectious or contagious disease.
<P>
	Maybe we could use this opportunity to dovetail with 
organizations that by consequence are also today forming 
partnerships with the private sector. It is the private sector that 
understands that this database is beneficial. If the private sector 
finds that it is worth while, then it can share its information with 
the Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety, which can 
also share its information with hospitals provincially.
<P>
	Let us germinate the seed today. This is an option the hon. 
member for Winnipeg Transcona can look at. Having seconded the 
bill, I would be more than happy to sit down with him and get 
together with officials in Hamilton at the CCOHS to try to 
accomplish the very  worthwhile goal this member and other 
<P>

	The House proceeded to the consideration of Bill C-7, an act 
respecting the control of certain drugs, their precursors and other 
substances and to amend certain other acts and repeal the Narcotic 
Control Act in consequence thereof, as reported (with 
amendments) from the committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-7, in clause 60, be amended by replacing lines 13 to 15, on page 
44, with the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``portion of an item, after the governor in council has consulted with those 
persons who will be directly affected by the amendment''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I 
understand unanimous consent is being sought to debate the 
amendment, even though it was not moved previously. I indicate to 
the Chair that we do not have any objection to it. We concur, with 
the understanding that we will immediately go to third reading 
after the amendment is disposed of.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Macleod):</B> Mr. Speaker, we are seeking unanimous 
support and agree to third reading going ahead with the same 
support.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Is there unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Macleod):</B> Mr. Speaker, Bill C-7 has been a complex 
bill that has taken some time going through the House. There is 
some vast improvement in the bill by opening up choice in the 
health food industry.
<P>
	However the power to make regulation is still flawed in relation 
to the bill. The particular clause we have zeroed in on is clause 60:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The governor in council may, by order, amend any of schedules I to VI by 
adding to them or deleting from them any item or portion of an item, where the 
governor in council deems the amendment to be necessary in the public interest.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I have a few words to say about that clause. I believe it is 
dictatorial, arbitrary and opaque. Other words that come to mind 
are words like behind closed doors. This ability should not rest in 
the hands of a few. The particular amendment suggested will 
address a significant flaw.
<P>
	One of my colleagues will speak at length on the issue a little 
later.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Hedy Fry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak to the third party 
amendment to clause 60 of Bill C-7.
<P>
	I agree with the hon. member the bill is a complex and at times 
controversial bill. All parties were eventually unanimous in the 
substantive changes and amendments to the bill that improve the 
bill a great deal.
<P>
	However I speak to the specific amendment of the hon. member 
to clause 60 that would read:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``portion of an item, after the governor in council has consulted with those 
persons who will be directly affected by the amendment''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The purpose of the amendment is to get the governor in council 
to consult with those who would be directly affected by a change in 
schedule made by the governor in council.
<P>
	There is already in place a democratic process within the 
machinery of government that answers the particular concern the 
hon. member for Macleod brought forward. Government is 
required to consult with those who will be affected by the proposal 
and the public at large before making any changes.
<P>
<B>(1205 )</B>
<P>
	The only exception to this requirement is where public safety is 
concerned and where on an urgent and emergency basis one needs 
to make a change to the schedule within 24 hours. Even then there 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15948"> 15948 </A></B>
<P>
is a process wherein an emergency scheduling provision in the 
interests of safety of the public would allow it to happen.
<P>
	Turning to the broader process the member is speaking about, 
the process provides for the machinery of government. 
Government is required to prepublish for a minimum period of 30 
days in <I>The Canada Gazette</I>, part I, any proposal to change 
scheduling. The prepublication period may vary, depending on the 
nature of the proposal.
<P>
	For example, if the proposal was to have international 
implications and would therefore have impact on GATT, there is an 
agreement in GATT that there would be a minimum of 75 days of 
prepublication to allow other countries to respond.
<P>
	Not only would interested parties respond if this were done a 
national level. Any citizen at all could provide comments or 
suggestions about the content of the proposal and about their 
concerns on the proposal. Then the government is obliged to report 
to the governor in council on those consultations, the feedback or 
input from parties directly affected, from concerned citizens or 
from the public at large. Also it is to report on the proposed 
remedies to be brought forth to address concerns. If this 
amendment represents a major shift in the original proposal, and if 
the concerned parties that have had input want another shift, there 
is a requirement to prepublish once again to discuss the new shift.
<P>
	All the bells, whistles and hoops have been jumped through in 
the process already so I fail to see what the hon. member's 
amendment would do to improve the process in any way, shape or 
form. It is already public. It is already open to disclosure. If 
disclosure requires change there is a requirement for further 
disclosure and for a further period of 30 days to discuss it. As I said 
before, internationally there is a requirement to prepublish for 75 
days.
<P>
	There is a fail safe mechanism already there to answer the hon. 
member's concerns about the issue.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise today to speak to the amendment to clause 60 of Bill 
C-7. It says that the clause should be amended by replacing lines 13 
to 15 on page 44 with the following:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``portion of an item, after the governor in council has consulted with those 
persons who will be directly affected by the amendment''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The parliamentary secretary responded to the amendment by 
asking why we need it. We already have the proper bells and 
whistles in place to deal with the public consultation process.
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary to the health minister is correct. The 
amendment will put in place the requirement for public discussion 
and public consultation on changes to the bill.
<P>
	In many pieces of legislation the Liberals have succeeded in 
taking more and more power from the people by putting in place 
the ability to make changes to legislation through the governor in 
council. This is one such move on the part of the government. The 
most important example in Bill C-68, the gun control legislation, 
gives incredible power to the governor in council. Bill C-61 deals 
with several agricultural acts and gives the minister and the 
bureaucrats the power to impose fines of up to $15,000 with the 
onus on the people fined to prove their innocence. That is one 
negative point about the legislation. Another is the control given 
through the governor in council without debate happening in the 
House. That is not democratic.
<P>
<B>(1210)</B>
<P>
	Unfortunately the anti-democratic move in the bill that gives 
more power and ability to make more decisions through governor 
in council is not unusual. The government has shown in many ways 
that it does not want to make things more democratic in the House. 
We have seen through what has happened to members who dared to 
vote against their party line or against the government on bills such 
as the gun control bill, Bill C-41. I could name others. These 
members have been punished harshly for voting differently than 
the party position. They have been thrown off committees and the 
Prime Minister publicly threatened to refuse to sign their 
nomination papers. What kind of a democracy is that?
<P>
	The amendment will at least ensure a small amount of 
consultation. Liberal consultation is different from the Reform's 
version of consultation. Reform believes that when we go to the 
people to ask for consultations we really want to hear what they 
have to say and to act on it. The Liberals have shown that is not 
what they see as consultation. For example, in the gun control bill 
the justice minister's idea of consultation was to have meetings to 
which people went by invitation only. Other interested people were 
not welcome. That was complete and utter nonsense. The 
amendment will in a small way give a bit of the power back to the 
people by requiring consultation.
<P>
	I will refer to a couple of other amendments but first I will show 
that this amendment has in a small way dealt with the concerns of 
some of my constituents. I have found that Bill C-7 and the changes 
to the legislation are very important to people in my constituency. 
Many people have come to me in public meetings asking questions 
about specific clauses of the legislation, and this is one of them. 
People have written letters to me that refer to specific clauses of the 
legislation.
<P>
	I will read a letter from one of my constituents. It is a form letter 
but personal comments are included with it. It represents the 
concerns of a wide number of people, often people who want 
access to herbs, spices or other traditional medicines. They do not 
want the pharmaceutical companies or the government to be able  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15949"> 15949 </A></B>
<P>
to limit access to these products in some way. It is very important 
to them.
<P>
	The letter states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I'm writing to request that Bill C-7 be withdrawn.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is what should have happened with the legislation. It should 
have been withdrawn, or at least large parts of it should have been 
withdrawn. It is an omnibus bill that deals with many parts of the 
act. It is so broad or wide ranging that I wonder how the House of 
Commons can be asked to vote on the bill. It would be far more 
useful to have more specific legislation dealing with similar 
concerns.
<P>
	Not all parts of the legislation should be thrown out. There are 
many good parts. However, because it is an omnibus bill and deals 
with a wide range of issues, parts of it should certainly be thrown 
out. The letter refers to the parts this constituent feels should be 
thrown out. A good summary of the legislation is given:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Bill C-7, the Controlled Substances Act, combines the Narcotic Control Act 
with the portions of the Food and Drugs Act. Combining criminal law with 
regulatory health is inappropriate and puts my right to buy natural health 
products in serious jeopardy.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Bill C-7 is a Criminal Code framework which would implicate many common 
herbal remedies and natural supplements because of their ``stimulant'' or 
``relaxant'' properties. I believe that public safety can be ensured without 
Criminal Code restrictions on food supplements-</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1215)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Szabo:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, my understanding 
of the rules of this place is that a speaker must speak to the subject 
matter before the House. We are now dealing at report stage with a 
specific amendment. The member is speaking about the whole bill.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> With the greatest of respect, 
that is a matter of debate and not a point of order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am surprised by the continual 
interruptions on the part of members opposite when we try to make 
a point on behalf of our constituents.
<P>
	It is was important enough to my constituents to write this letter 
to me. That member does not want to let me rise in the House and 
read this letter and show how this amendment has at least in some 
small way dealt with this concern. That is anti-democratic. It is just 
one more thing. It is the Liberal way. It is not democratic and it is 
not what we expect in the House. I become upset when I have this 
type of an interruption.
<P>
	The letter goes on to say:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Further, I object that the control of any bioactive components or synthetic 
analogues of natural herbs by Bill C-7 it will replace criminal sanctions to the 
herbs themselves.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Health Canada should not be allowed to seize, remove or illegalize safe 
products from the shelves of distributors or hold them at the border without 
clear and convincing evidence of a lack of safety or misbranding. Health 
Canada should bear the burden of proof.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I believe that natural herbs and health supplements do not belong in the 
Criminal Code. These products should be considered as dietary supplements 
and regulated as such. Natural substances should not be considered as drugs.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I expect that you will represent my interests and oppose Bill C-7.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	We will of course oppose Bill C-7. If this amendment does pass, 
and I would be surprised if it did not, all it does is put in place a 
consultation process. There is nothing guaranteeing it will be a 
valid consultation process but it is certainly a move forward. The 
onus will be on the government to show that it has consulted.
<P>
	If we as an opposition party ask the government to show us it has 
consulted, it will be forced to at least demonstrate that it has had 
some consultation with all interested parties.
<P>
	Other things have happened with this bill; other amendments and 
really the deletion of one clause I think has been extremely 
important. I credit my colleague, the member for Macleod, for 
successfully having clause 3(1) removed. It is certainly an 
important change to this legislation.
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	Clause 3(1):
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>For purposes of this act a substance included in Schedules I, II or III shall be 
deemed to include any substance;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a) that is produced, processed or provided by a person who intends that it be 
introduced into the body of another person for the purpose of producing a 
stimulant, depressant or hallucinogenic effect substantially similar to or 
greater than that of a substance included in Schedule I, II or III, and that, if so 
introduced, would produce such a substantially similar or greater effect; or</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(b) that is represented or held out to produce, if introduced into a human body, a 
stimulant, depressant or hallucinogenic effect substantially similar to or 
greater than that of a substance included in Schedule I, II or III.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Again I congratulate my colleague for successfully having that 
clause thrown out. That is a substantial change to this bill and it 
will help. Unfortunately there are still so many concerns-

<P>

<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (for the Minister of Health, Lib.)</B> moved 
that the bill be read the third time and passed.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Hedy Fry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in support of Bill C-7.
<P>
	The revisions to the bill, the changes made since it passed second 
reading in the House, combine two quite different approaches to 
the control of drugs. The approaches are different but they are 
actually complementary.
<P>
	The first enshrines an attitude of tolerance, compassion and 
concern for the drug addicted person. The government believes that 
someone convicted of a drug offence, a user who shows genuine 
desire to recover from his or her addiction deserves the chance and 
opportunity to rebuild and renew their lives on a healthy, 
law-abiding basis.
<P>
	This component speaks therefore of rehabilitation and speaks to 
the health aspect of drug use.
<P>
<B>(1225 )</B>
<P>
	The second approach is to reinforce our longstanding 
condemnation of violent behaviour or any drug dealing that harms 
our youth and other vulnerable citizens.
<P>
	The government believes drug offences and the negative social 
impact of drug offences escalate directly in proportion to the age of 
the person, which means the younger the person, the greater the 
social and physical harm that occurs as a result of the use of drugs.
<P>
	These approaches to the control of drugs reflect the spirit of the 
red book ``Creating Opportunity''. A principal objective of this 
book is to strengthen Canadian society by protecting individuals 
from crime and violence on the streets and in the playgrounds.
<P>
	Bill C-7 works to achieve this end. It clearly identifies a need for 
extra protection against crimes around schools where young people 
are involved. However, it goes further in creating opportunity. It 
creates opportunity for offenders to get treatment. It creates 
opportunity for enforcement to be more effective. It creates 
opportunity for the justice system to deal more even handedly with  
the various substances and offences that are the subject of the bill.
<P>
	Bill C-7 is more than a housekeeping bill. It achieves a balance 
between the need for compassionate health and social components 
of drug use and the need to punish and deal with the criminal and 
violent aspects of drug use.
<P>
	True to this purpose, we have brought the Narcotic Control Act 
and parts of the Food and Drugs Act together to deal with 
controlled substances and narcotic preparations. It modernizes 
procedure to a certain extent. It expands control over a wider range 
of substances, but it is more comprehensive than that.
<P>
	In the case of one substance that has caused major concern for 
policy makers and the public over many years, it incorporates a 
revised and more current understanding of how Canadians want to 
deal with marijuana. Cannabis and its derivatives from now on will 
have a distinct schedule in the bill, schedule I(i). Cannabis has been 
set apart from other hard drugs. It is being treated separately.
<P>
	As we will see from this amended bill, government has taken 
very seriously the concerns expressed by witnesses of committee 
hearings and also by members of the House who have come 
together to tell us what they think of the bill. I am therefore pleased 
to say changes and measures have been instituted in order to reflect 
a more Liberal policy with regard to harm reduction, rehabilitation 
and the societal aspects of drug use.
<P>
	Hon. members know the consultative process is inherent and 
very important in the parliamentary committee system. 
Committees collect the views of people on the street. One of the 
strengths of the process is that it brings forward a range of opinions 
and perspectives not necessarily obvious to those who prepare the 
original drafts of legislation. On this note I congratulate all 
members of the subcommittee from all parties and thank all 
witnesses who provided testimony on this legislation.
<P>
	When we start talking about illicit substances such as marijuana 
and cocaine people want to broaden the horizons. Many of the 
witnesses who came to the subcommittee on health were not really 
addressing Bill C-7 specifically. They wanted to put broader issues 
on the agenda such as a more socially responsible approach to 
dealing with cannabis. It is argued there may be times when people 
are guilty of simple possession by aberration. They have been to a 
party, accepted a gift and have been caught. In such a circumstance 
the criminal mark should not be on record for the rest of their lives.
<P>
	It cannot be denied that a large number of Canadians are at least 
tolerant of soft drug use. They have heard a former Prime Minister 
and the President of the United States admit to experimenting with 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15951"> 15951 </A></B>
<P>
marijuana. They see courts routinely granting absolute or 
conditional  discharges for simple possession charges while 
imposing fines for simple traffic violations.
<P>
	Some people in subcommittee were even saying we should 
decriminalize marijuana. However, by international law we cannot 
decriminalize it. We have to consider it a criminal offence but we 
can deal with the consequences associated with marijuana. That is 
one of the changes that has come through in this newly amended 
bill.
<P>
	Specifically for possession of marijuana, 30 grams or less, we 
have reduced the seriousness of the offence. The negative impact 
on someone charged with this offence will be changed. No 
fingerprints or photographs will be taken by police officers. No 
traceable record will appear in national criminal databases. The law 
has been modified.
<P>
<B>(1230)</B>
<P>
	This does not mean that the penalties have been reduced. They 
have not. The penalty for possession of 30 grams or less of 
cannabis continues to be a $1,000 fine or six months or both. It is 
the ancillary impacts that will change. A conviction on this charge 
will not curb one's ability to travel internationally, for instance. It 
will not interfere with getting a job.
<P>
	Another concern raised in subcommittee was to put something in 
the bill to ask the courts to move toward rehabilitation and 
treatment instead of automatically treating all users as hardened 
criminals. Therefore, the introduction of section 11, which deals 
with sentencing, addresses this concern. Judges are encouraged to 
order rehabilitation and treatment in appropriate circumstances.
<P>
	This said, it was not the government's intention that the bill 
would alter or review existing drug policy. It was meant to bring 
aspects of administration up to date from existing legislation that 
dates back to the 1960s, and it gives effect to Canada's 
commitments on the various international agreements dealing with 
narcotics and psychotropic substances.
<P>
	There is a change in penalties for trafficking in three kilograms 
of cannabis or less. Here the maximum penalty is lowered from 14 
years down to five years less a day. The reason for this is not 
because the gravity of the offence has been diminished. In fact, the 
subcommittee wanted to deal with trafficking as harshly. However, 
the lesser sentence achieves another goal: it leads to a streamlining 
of the judicial process. It hastens cases through the courts by 
eliminating requirements for preliminary hearings and trials by 
jury. It is not expected to change actual sentencing patterns. Even 
though the courts have been able to go to 14 years, they have not 
really been giving sentences anywhere near that length.
<P>
	From now on drug charges will represent the true offences. Until 
now, when trafficking has been the issue prosecutors would often 
reduce it to a possession charge,  rather than proceed through a full 
pre-trial and trial by jury. Now prosecutors will be more likely to 
lay the charges they should have been laying. In fact there is no 
intention to give any signal that the penalties that are currently 
being given for the offence are not appropriate. This is not getting 
soft on traffickers. Streamlining the prosecution of these offences 
would be a net gain for the criminal justice process but would not 
mean an actual reduction in sentences, given current practice.
<P>
	I alluded to the approach this bill takes to discouraging violence 
and any drug dealings involving youth. The approach is simply the 
following. Offences under Bill C-7 have penalties attached to them, 
including imprisonment. Judges have discretion in sentencing and 
may choose not to impose a prison sentence in any particular case. 
However, if an offence is accompanied by violence or the threat of 
violence, or if it takes place in or near the grounds of a school, or if 
it involves dealing with someone under the age of 18, the court is to 
consider any of these circumstances an aggravating factor. If it 
decides in such a case not to impose a prison sentence, then the bill 
requires that the court give reasons for such a decision.
<P>
	There are very substantive changes between the current Bill C-7 
we are discussing and its original version. I have mentioned the 
instructions to the court to consider rehabilitation and treatment at 
sentencing and the reduction in the impact of a conviction for 
simple possession of cannabis. The following is a representative 
sample of a dozen or more other changes to the bill.
<P>
	The previous subsection 3(1), which dealt with controlling 
unlisted substances that have an effect similar to scheduled drugs, 
has been completely removed. It has been deleted. It had been 
objected that the conduct subject to criminal sanction in this 
subsection had not been specified enough and that herbs or natural 
extracts might be captured. Removing this subsection should 
remove all doubts on that score to those who sell herbs and have 
been concerned about this. It is no longer going to affect an 
individual even if they thought it might have. Now they need not 
worry on that count.
<P>
	Subsection 30(1) has been amended to ensure that inspectors 
have reasonable grounds to believe that a place is used for an illicit 
purpose mentioned in the bill before entering the place.
<P>
	Paragraph 30(1)(c) is amended to exclude the possibility that 
inspectors can examine a person's medical record and therefore 
infringe on the confidentiality between physician and patient.
<P>
<B>(1235 )</B>
<P>
	Paragraph 54(1)(h) is amended to eliminate any risk that 
regulations made under the act could apply to medical practitioners 
or other professionals who are not targeted. That was a concern 
from those professionals who under the act were licensed to give 
prescription  drugs. However, the definition of trafficking has been 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15952"> 15952 </A></B>
<P>
broadened to include the sale by a licensed practitioner of a 
prescription to obtain drugs.
<P>
	Every one of the concerns raised in subcommittee has been 
carefully examined in the reconstruction of this bill. This is not to 
say that every concern that was expressed has led to an amendment. 
Some were felt to be without foundation, such as the fear that the 
bill would threaten the viability of the existing needle exchange 
program. It was decided after examination that there was no such 
threat and there needed to be no amendment.
<P>
	Other observations or criticisms will be more properly addressed 
in a general drug policy review rather than in Bill C-7. In fact that 
was a recommendation from the committee.
<P>
	It has been suggested by some that this is not a health bill. Many 
of the issues that have come up deal with justice and enforcement. 
It should be made abundantly clear that controlled substances are 
not all bad substances. Many of them indeed are very good when 
used as prescribed. They are important to the health of the nation. 
They are major tools in the medical kit. Drugs and drug abuse are 
basically social and health problems. They find their way, however, 
into the criminal justice system not because they naturally and 
necessarily belong there, but because we have yet to devise a better 
method of control.
<P>
	Prohibition has had very limited success and very high cost. 
Many believe that programs to increase awareness, education, and 
treatment would be more successful for less money and less 
violence in drug enforcement. In fact the main thrust of Bill C-7 is 
that it allows for these controlled substances to be used for medical 
and scientific purposes. We need codeine and morphine and similar 
drugs to treat patients. Unfortunately, they are also subject to 
abuse. Therefore, we need to build into the law how we deal with 
their diversion to non-medical purposes and their abuse potential. 
That is where most of the justice issues come into play in this bill.
<P>
	The bill facilitates the placing of safeguards at all levels of 
production and distribution of high-risk drugs and allows them to 
be used as prescription drugs. This reduces the risk that drugs 
produced for legitimate purposes would be diverted into the illegal 
street market.
<P>
	Canadians will have access, as before, to physicians, dentists, 
pharmacists, and other licensed health care providers for whatever 
drug they need to treat their illnesses. They need not be concerned 
about that. Bill C-7 is not a catch-all for pharmaceutical 
preparations. It does not affect antibiotics, for example. It names 
clearly the drugs it would control, which are generally those used to 
treat pain and many psychotrophic or mood-modifying drugs.
<P>
	By including the concepts of treatment and rehabilitation, this 
bill also acknowledges the important  health dimensions of drug 
abuse. It begins to rebalance that emphasis on substance over user 
and coercion over persuasion. It is not a new policy and it is not 
even a big change, but it is an important shift in perspective. It 
opens the way to alternate approaches and choices in addressing a 
disease that afflicts hundreds of thousands of Canadians and the 
social well-being of Canada.
<P>
	Bill C-7 is meant to control dangerous substances. We want to 
control these substances because in the wrong hands and used in 
the wrong way they can cause great harm to Canadians and to the 
social fabric of this country.
<P>
	I say this even though I recognize that drug use is not a major 
concern for Canadians in general. In fact an Environics poll that 
focused on justice and crime issues last year found that only two 
per cent of respondents said that illicit drug use personally troubled 
them far more than other crimes. This was far behind phenomena 
such as domestic violence, youth gangs, breaking and entering, and 
crimes against children.
<P>
	There is another reason to control these drugs, and I believe it is 
a far more important reason. Many substances we are dealing with 
here have strong medical components. This bill aims to make them 
available to health professionals and their patients for legitimate 
medical purposes. These substances, as I said before, are an 
essential part of our armaments against human suffering. We need 
painkillers, tranquillizers, and similar drugs to treat patients 
suffering from pain, anxiety, stress, depression, and other illnesses 
that in fact are born of our age of worry and anxiety. These are 
substances for medical use.
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
	Because Bill C-7 sharpens the tools we use to control the 
production and distribution of high-risk preparations that can be 
made available safely for prescription drugs does not mean that we 
are condemning those drugs. Patients will continue to have access 
to prescriptions through their doctors and pharmacists. Patients 
will always have what they need to treat illness and the medical 
records of patients will not be violated.
<P>
	Health Canada's goals and priorities have repeatedly found 
support from the Canadian public, who rate the performance of 
health care in the current system at the very top of government 
activities. This is from Ekos Research.
<P>
	Side by side with medicare on Health Canada's priority list is the 
protection against risks to Canadians' health. Therefore, illegally 
obtained and unsafe drugs are among those risks. Drug dependence 
is not only a criminal issue, it is very much a health and social 
issue. With some of these amendments we have tried to bring a 
positive approach to treatment programs for those who are afflicted 
by drug addictions. We support the help and appropriate treatment 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15953"> 15953 </A></B>
<P>
for those who want to get back  their health and resume a normal 
life. We will continue to authorize methadone treatment for those 
who have a drug dependence. Methadone, as members will know, 
is a controlled substance that assists many opiate users to 
re-establish a constructive life. I want to assure the House that is 
not changing.
<P>
	The department is also responsible for the national program to 
reduce the spread of HIV and AIDS. We will not be affecting the 
needle exchange programs, which in many communities have had 
massive positive results and have been so successful in curbing the 
spread of HIV among intravenous drug users. Medical devices such 
as needles were deliberately excluded from criminal sanctions in 
Bill C-7. So this effective public health program in fact will 
continue its good work.
<P>
	The bill protects the rational use of some controlled substances 
as medicines while acting against the illicit distribution of these 
same substances. It recognizes that controlled drugs are 
indispensable and that their availability should not be restricted or 
compromised. It promotes the judicious use of medications by 
indicating ways in which controlled drugs can be handled, 
distributed, and used. These substances are included in the 
legislation, as I said, to protect the health and safety of the public.
<P>
	For example, Bill C-7 makes it possible for cancer patients and 
those who are terminally ill to obtain pain relief from prescribed 
medications such as morphine. In a hospital setting or for 
out-patients under strict medical supervision, even heroin is 
available for the treatment of pain and suffering. This legislation 
ensures that cocaine can be safely used in examination and in 
surgical procedures. Other medications aimed at treating less 
severe but still incapacitating conditions such as migraines are 
contained in the schedule of substances we are dealing with here. 
These will continue to be made accessible under this bill.
<P>
	Some of these drugs are also used on the street and therefore are 
subject to trafficking. While these substances all have the 
opportunity to create good and help patients who are ill, they have a 
strong potential for abuse. It is not surprising that the enforcement 
aspect of Bill C-7 has therefore attracted attention. But we must not 
forget that access to these substances must be preserved for the 
benefit of all those who are afflicted, which may include a majority 
of Canadians at some time in their lives. These substances are 
powerful. They have the power to do good, but also the power to do 
harm. If a drug is prescribed by a physician and if you use it more 
than is prescribed by a physician, the addictive properties of these 
drugs could be forgotten. We do not want that harm to occur to 
patients.
<P>
	As legislators, our task is to find a balance that will maximize 
good and minimize harm. I believe we have struck the appropriate 
balance in this legislation. I urge hon. members of the House to 
support it, as I will.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, good old Bill C-7 
has been with us since my arrival in the House and I have followed 
it with fascination. It was of course a Tory bill introduced before 
this Parliament sat and was opposed then by my Liberal colleagues. 
I watched as it became a Liberal bill and was embraced with some 
degree of enthusiasm.
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
	I invite people listening today to reflect on the parliamentary 
secretary's words during her original speech on this bill. I am sure 
they will find that the parliamentary secretary wholeheartedly 
supported Bill C-7 in its unmodified form. To be kind, that 
wholehearted support was somewhat enthusiastic.
<P>
	This bill has gone through such a dramatic change in the 
committee process. That is what I am going to spend my time on 
today. Can the public influence a bill? The general perception in 
Canada is that the public cannot influence a bill. The fact is that the 
public can influence a bill, not only its tone but its actual final 
outcome.
<P>
	What actually happened during the process of modifying this 
bill? I found, as did many people in Canada, that clause 3(1) and (2) 
could have significant potential harm to the health food industry. 
This clause stated that substances could be deemed to have a 
stimulant, depressant or hallucinogenic effect. It was plunked into 
the bill. Individuals across the country said it was too broad, too 
vague and not specific enough.
<P>
	I received a host of requests for information. As an opposition 
health critic people said to me: ``This seems to us to be a point 
where an opposition critic should step up to the plate''. What did 
we do? We formed a very specific newsletter, which I have with me 
today. It states: ``C-7 threatens choice in health care''. It also 
mentioned areas of this bill that could have a profound effect on 
health care.
<P>
	The newsletters went out along with a request for petitions to 
health food stores and to individuals who wrote asking for more 
information. To me, the outpouring of support for this position of 
choice in health care was profound. I wish I could touch that nerve 
in other areas. I wish I could touch the nerve of the health food 
industry in other areas.
<P>
	People contacted the subcommittee on health. I am convinced 
the committee members could not believe the outpouring. People 
contacted the minister, their MPs and me. Did I have a big role in 
this? I was only able to provide a small vehicle for the outpouring 
of personal sentiment. I do not put myself as a great individual in 
this debate at all, but the focus of the input was fascinating to me. 
The whole issue was choice in health care. Those individuals said: 
``Deny us that choice and you are treading on our toes''.
<P>
	The result and specific part of the bill I found so offensive was 
the ability for legislators to deem  substances such as stimulants, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15954"> 15954 </A></B>
<P>
depressants and hallucinogens to be stricken completely. There has 
not been a great deal of fanfare about that.
<P>
	I want to tell the Canadian public that this was a huge victory for 
those who wanted to choose what they take. There are those who 
say that people could make mistakes in their lives and I agree with 
that. However, when should regulators be involved in someone's 
personal decision making? When there is proven harm, when there 
are potential side effects, and when there is fraud in claims, doses, 
source or contents. Otherwise the public tells the legislators to step 
aside. No one knows better than the individual how they feel and 
what works for them when it comes to things they take into their 
body.
<P>
<B>(1250 )</B>
<P>
	There is a price for this freedom. The price for the freedom is to 
be informed. The public says: ``Government stand aside; we have 
spoken''. I finally say to those who would regulate and legislate in 
this area, no one can be better informed than the citizen who has a 
need which is not met by bureaucrats and legislators, driven by 
internal pain, anxiety or wants. They want to seek out time 
honoured remedies. They said loudly and clearly: ``You will never 
usurp this right''.
<P>
	People find that interesting coming from a physician and 
surgeon, someone who occasionally is criticized for being too 
narrow in focus. I have seen individuals not helped by my 
profession. I have seen individuals seek alternative therapies. I 
have seen individuals beg for the ability to do that. I believe they 
have and need the right to do exactly that.
<P>
	Why did we bring an amendment to this bill, a bill that frankly 
has dramatically improved over the way it first came to this House? 
We brought an amendment because there is still a regulatory 
mechanism, the power to make regulations which still gives the 
government the power it had in clause 3, to deem something to be 
included in the bill without broad public debate.
<P>
	Is the mechanism of public consultation sufficient? In my view it 
is not. When something is put into <I>The Canada Gazette</I> for 30 days, 
it can be missed. Things have been missed in the past. There needs 
to be a greater flag. I would have preferred to have had those 
amendments come to the parliamentary committee studying health 
related issues. That would have been a better step. My basic 
premise is that legislators should at least be involved. It should not 
be an almost behind the doors process.
<P>
	I will strongly state to anyone who will listen that the power to 
make regulations can be passed with virtually no public scrutiny. 
Powers delegated to the governor in council are broad, vague and 
border on dictatorial. Our subcommittee recommended that this be 
reviewed. I would like to hark back to the parliamentary secretary's 
comments when she said that the public scrutiny which is  present 
today is just fine. Why would the government which controls this 
subcommittee agree to review if those powers are just fine? Those 
arguments are inconsistent.
<P>
	I am also very sceptical of the committee recommendation. I 
think that recommendation is going to fall into a black hole. I am 
going to give an example of why I think that will happen.
<P>
	The first duty in the health committee was to look at order in 
council appointments. I ask a question in the health committee that 
if we were going to review these order in council appointments, 
how many of them had been turned down in history. The answer 
was that members looked at me as if I were crazy. Surely the 
committee would not have the power to turn down an order in 
council appointment. I asked: ``Why are we doing it then? Strike a 
subcommittee on order in council appointments''.
<P>
	My premise was that the committee should review appointments 
at the appointment stage rather than at the nomination stage. Sure 
enough we have gone through a whole host of witnesses and the 
recommendation of the subcommittee was that order in council 
appointments, if they were to be reviewed by the committee, 
should be done at the appointment stage. There would be no power 
taken away from the government. If everyone on the list were up to 
snuff, there would be a checkmark beside each name. It would be a 
good time to review. Then the government could choose which 
individuals it wanted from those.
<P>
<B>(1255 )</B>
<P>
	I asked the question in high school class after high school class: 
If you were asked to review something, would you want to have 
that review be meaningful? The kids nod to me. We would think it 
was nonsense to do it any other way. Where has that 
recommendation that order in council appointments be referred to 
to the health committee gone? It has gone into a black hole 
somewhere, into government reorganization.
<P>
	That indicates to me how cynical the government process 
sometimes can be. If a group of high school kids can see that it 
makes sense, it surely must make sense to the legislators. I will 
watch with profound interest the recommendation from the 
committee to review this power to make regulations. If it falls into 
the black hole as well, I will be greatly disappointed.
<P>
	Bill C-7 has come a long way. If the power to make regulations 
were righted, I would support it. On the basis it is not righted, I will 
not support it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
gives me great pleasure to speak on behalf of Bill C-7, an act 
respecting the control of certain drugs, their precursors and other 
substances, and to amend certain other acts and repeal the Narcotic 
Control Act in consequence thereof.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15955"> 15955 </A></B>
<P>
	This bill received first reading in February 1994 and passed 
second reading in April 1994. At that time it was referred to the 
House of Commons Standing Committee on Health which in turn 
struck an all-party subcommittee. I was appointed as the chair to 
study that bill, to receive witnesses from all parts of Canada 
representing major interest groups and to receive and consider 
submissions from major interest groups and Canadians from all 
walks of life. The committee received dozens of submissions and 
literally thousands of letters for its consideration.
<P>
	As a consequence of our consultation and discussions, a number 
of questions and concerns were raised. The committee took the 
interventions very seriously and requested answers and 
explanations from officials. The bill is the responsibility of the 
Minister of Health but numerous aspects relating to enforcement 
and justice matters necessarily involve the solicitor general's office 
and the Ministry of Justice.
<P>
	Officials from all of the ministries were very actively involved 
in the review of this bill after second reading and co-operated fully 
throughout the process. I want to give special thanks to them, 
particularly to Mr. Bruce Rowsell, director of dangerous drugs, 
health protection branch, Health Canada; Carol Langlois, project 
manager, bureau of dangerous drugs, health protection branch, 
Health Canada; GÃ©rard Normand, counsel, national security group, 
Department of Justice; Mr. Paul Saint-Denis, senior counsel, 
criminal law policy section, Department of Justice; and Ron 
Dykeman, senior policy analyst, policing and law enforcement in 
the solicitor general's office.
<P>
	The role of parliamentarians and their powers of influence as 
members of Parliament and members of standing committees of 
this House has changed dramatically in this Parliament. The 
subcommittee charged with the responsibility to study Bill C-7 
demonstrated that the proposed legislation is subject to change. 
Indeed Bill C-7 has been changed in many important ways to 
address the legitimate concerns of Canadians.
<P>
	As a result of our work, the committee has sought amendments 
on a number of critical elements of the bill. I am pleased to inform 
the House that the government through its relevant ministries has 
brought forward substantive-I emphasize 
substantive-amendments which fully satisfy the concerns raised 
by the committee. Some of the areas relate to the whole aspect of 
rehabilitation and treatment: the issues raised by practitioners, 
particularly by the Canadian Medical Association; the integrity of 
needle exchange programs; confidentiality and access to 
information; the scheduling and particularly the criteria for 
scheduling of products; the aspect of criminal records; the issue of 
fortified drug houses.
<P>
<B>(1300 )</B>
<P>
	I could tell members that one of my colleagues from Edmonton 
came before the committee and made a plea on behalf of the law
<P>
enforcement agencies of Edmonton to advise us of what is called 
fortified drug houses.
<P>
	Very briefly, fortified drug houses are dwellings that have been 
altered substantially to ensure that enforcement agencies would not 
get ready access in the event that they have determined that there 
were illegal or illicit activities transpiring within that dwelling.
<P>
	Initially, the bill could not address that. Reasons were given but 
the committee did not accept them. Thanks to the intervention of 
our colleague and member for Edmonton West, this bill now 
provides the mechanism necessary for our law enforcement 
agencies to deal with the serious problem of fortified drug houses.
<P>
	We also dealt with some complex matters to do with hybrid 
trafficking offences. I can tell members that the bill has changed 
significantly since second reading with regard to the amounts and 
the penalties.
<P>
	As has been mentioned, we dealt with the deeming provisions 
under section 3.1 which I will speak to more fully a little later. We 
also dealt with section 59, the administration procedure for 
adjudication, a very important section.
<P>
	Very briefly, the work of the committee was quite extensive, 
quite broad on a number of fronts. I am pleased to inform the 
House that the bill, as amended, received the support of all parties.
<P>
	Some 69 amendments were made to a bill that contains 56 pages, 
94 clauses and a large number of schedules listing drugs and 
various other aspects. We believe that we have returned to the 
House a better piece of legislation which effectively meets the 
intended objectives of Bill C-7.
<P>
	The subcommittee actually went beyond its mandate to address 
Bill C-7. Not only did we discharge our responsibilities with regard 
to the bill as was directed by the Standing Committee on Health, 
but we also made a further report to the Standing Committee on 
Health putting forward certain recommendations flowing from the 
work we did in considering the provisions of Bill C-7.
<P>
	In brief, I would like to outline what those additional 
recommendations were. The first recommendation was that an 
expert task force be formed to devise rational criteria for schedules 
1 to 7 of the control of drugs and substances act.
<P>
	We would like to see this task force include the assistance and 
the consultation from organizations such as the Addiction Research 
Foundation, the Canadian Centre for Substance Abuse, the 
Canadian Pharmaceutical Association, the Canadian Medical 
Association and the Canadian Foundation on Drug Policy, not to 
mention the Canadian Medical Association,  particularly, and any 
other relevant bodies. We would like them to form a special task 
force 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15956"> 15956 </A></B>
<P>
with a mandate to establish precise criteria for the scheduling of 
substances under this act.
<P>
	As a number of speakers will mention in speaking to the bill 
today, it deals with a large number of drugs. As was dealt with in 
the report stage motion with regard to governor in council changes 
to regulations, as members will see, it is quite an onerous task to 
deal with the changes that would have to occur to scheduling if we 
have to go through committee every time a certain drug arises.
<P>
	The second recommendation has to do with Canada's drug 
policy. I am going to talk quite a bit about drug policy because I 
believe that Canadians should understand more fully the intent and 
the rationale for Bill C-7 and how it relates to Canada's drug policy, 
indeed the Canadian drug strategy.
<P>
	The subcommittee on Bill C-7 recommends that the House of 
Commons Standing Committee on Health undertake a 
comprehensive review of the existing drug policy. I am pleased to 
report that the Minister of Health has already informally given her 
concurrence that a comprehensive review of our drug policy should 
be conducted.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	The final recommendation has to do with the motion that was 
moved at report stage by the member for Macleod. It deals with the 
scrutiny of regulations and orders made by governor in council. 
This motion, in fact an amendment, was dealt with at 
subcommittee. Based on the conversations we had with all 
members and the debate that was held, it was clear that the question 
being raised was not generally relevant only to Bill C-7, but rather 
a matter of principle. A number of the previous speakers have 
referred to that principle: what can this place do and what 
authorities can it second in terms of amendments to legislation.
<P>
	The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Health outlined 
very clearly that there is a mechanism in place for the exposure of 
changes proposed, whether they be regulations or other changes.
<P>
	More important, those changes are not substantive changes to 
the legislation and to the intent of the legislation. It is more 
important that those governor in council authorities be available so 
that changes can be made which are consequential to other changes 
that occur and that things can happen quickly. I will comment a 
little later, particularly with regard to section 3.1, the deeming 
provision, on new drugs and the reason why we have to pursue 
avenues to be able to address new drugs as they come on line. It has 
to do with technology and it has to do with the sophistication of 
those that produce illicit drugs.
<P>
	We have asked the Standing Committee on Health to direct a 
question to the government House leader whether the House of 
Commons standing committees could have the authority to approve 
or at least to review all relevant regulations or orders made by the 
governor in council prior to coming in force. I believe that 
recommendation satisfies the member for Macleod. He withdrew 
the amendment at subcommittee and supported the principle of 
assessing whether or not governor in council orders are being 
abused.
<P>
	It is a valid question and that is why the committee agreed with 
the member for Macleod to pose the question to the government 
House leader, so that all members of Parliament could more fully 
understand the mechanics and the rationale for governor in council 
orders.
<P>
	We believe that all committees should make appropriate 
recommendations consequential to the work they have done in 
studying legislation on what they have heard from the people of 
Canada. I am very proud that this committee took on itself to 
produce a supplementary report to the bill, which I feel is going to 
add substantially to the role of parliamentarians.
<P>
	I wish to move more specifically to the bill. The parliamentary 
secretary very eloquently outlined a number of the technical 
aspects of the bill. I want to go back to the genesis because I know 
that for many members on all sides of the House their first 
exposure to this bill was the old Bill C-85 from the former 
government. It is a draconian Mulroney bill.
<P>
	It is time for us to move away from the partisan apprehension 
about certain legislation because there are important reasons for 
Bill C-7 to be before this place and to be passed by this House.
<P>
	Bill C-7 forms part of the national drug strategy. It is a 
multi-year program set up to combat the illicit drug trade within 
our boundaries. The bill consolidates and supplements the 
provisions found in the Narcotics Control Act and Parts III and IV 
of the Food and Drugs Act.
<P>
	The supplementary provisions are necessary for a very important 
reason and that is because Canada must pass certain changes to its 
drug legislation so that we can be in conformity with certain 
international obligations to which we are a party.
<P>
	Those treaties are three. The first is the Convention on Narcotic 
Drugs of 1961. That treaty dealt with things such as the cultivation 
of the coca bush.
<P>
<B>(1310 )</B>
<P>
	The second treaty was the Convention on Psychotropic 
Substances, dated 1971. Among other things, it dealt with the 
expanded control over amphetamines.
<P>
	Finally, the so-called Vienna convention, is the United Nations 
Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic  Drugs and 
Psychotro-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15957"> 15957 </A></B>
<P>
pic Substances, dated 1988. Among other things, it deals with the 
import and export control over precursors.
<P>
	Why is Bill C-7 so important? That is a question which members 
of Parliament must understand for their own edification because of 
the concerns which have been raised at second reading and 
throughout the genesis of the bill.
<P>
	Because Bill C-7 provides for the scheduling of drugs which are 
controlled or restricted, it attracted substantial attention from 
groups and individuals who wanted to address Canada's drug 
policy with a view to taking a softer stance on drug possession and 
use and to treat it as a health problem rather than a criminal 
problem. This was the argument.
<P>
	Our drug policy is reflected in Canada's drug strategy. Seventy 
per cent of our spending is directed at rehabilitation and treatment 
alternatives. Bill C-7 is part of Canada's drug strategy and 
addresses the enforcement aspects of our drug policy.
<P>
	Many of the witnesses and interveners were critical of Bill C-7 
because they wanted the opportunity to fully debate the overall 
drug policy, of which Bill C-7 is simply a part. Their interests were 
beyond the purview of our subcommittee but their concerns were 
noted in our recommendations which I referred to earlier.
<P>
	The most important rationale for Bill C-7 was to bring our drug 
laws into compliance with the international conventions to which 
we are a party. It is this aspect on which I would like to elaborate.
<P>
	Canada has been in violation of its treaty obligations for many 
years. As such, it has increasingly come under criticism by its 
treaty partners and the International Narcotics Control Board. This 
is the first time that a jurisdictional body has mentioned, so I would 
like to highlight the International Narcotics Control Board.
<P>
	Over the past 80 years a worldwide system to control drugs 
subject to abuse has developed gradually through adoption of a 
series of international treaties. The key multilateral conventions 
concurrently in effect are, as I mentioned: the 1961 single 
convention on narcotic drugs which was modified by the 1972 
protocol; the 1971 convention on psychotropic substances; and the 
United Nations convention against illicit traffic in narcotic drugs 
and psychotropic substances, which was adopted in 1988. Each of 
these treaties has built on regulations already in place and has 
advanced international law.
<P>
	From the beginning the principal objective of drug control 
treaties has been to restrict the use of these drugs to medical and 
scientific purposes.
<P>
	The International Narcotics Control Board, known as the INCB, 
is an independent and quasi-judiciary body mandated to apply the 
United Nations conventions on drugs. It was created in 1968 by the 
1961 single  convention on narcotic drugs. Its predecessors were 
created by previous conventions on drugs, dating back to the 
League of Nations. The board is responsible for promoting the 
application of drug control treaties by government. These treaties 
set out its tasks, which are essentially of two types.
<P>
	First, with respect to the legal manufacture, trade and sale of 
drugs, the board ensures that there are sufficient quantities 
available for medical and scientific purposes and that none are 
misdirected from legal sources to illegal trafficking. To that end, it 
administers a narcotics evaluation system and a system of 
voluntary evaluation of psychotropic substances and monitors 
international drug trading through a statistical reporting system. 
Moreover, it monitors the measures taken by governments to 
control chemical products that can be used in illicit manufacture of 
drugs, assisting them in preventing their being channelled toward 
illicit trafficking.
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	The second area of the mandate is with respect to the illicit 
manufacture and trafficking of drugs. In this regard, the board 
detects weaknesses in national and international control systems 
and helps to improve the situation. As well, it is responsible for 
assessing what chemical products used for illicit drug 
manufacturing might be placed under international control.
<P>
	Our failure to comply, particularly in the area of control of 
benzodiazepines, was clearly singled out in the 1994 report of the 
International Narcotics Control Board presented to the United 
Nations on February 27, 1995. I would like to refer to that report of 
the International Narcotics Control Board for 1994 to the United 
Nations. I want to quote from this report because I want for once 
and for all to demonstrate clearly to all members why it is so 
important that Bill C-7 is passed by this House.
<P>
	Paragraph 89 states: ``A few parties to the 1971 convention, 
including Canada, Luxembourg, and New Zealand, do not yet 
control international trade in all benzodiazepines. This represents a 
violation of the treaty obligations under the 1971 convention. The 
board has been in communication with those countries for a 
number of years, but their response has thus far been insufficient. 
The board reiterates its request to those countries to begin 
controlling without further delay their imports and exports of all 
benzodiazipines listed in the 1971 convention.''
<P>
	The report further states in paragraph 180: ``Although Canada 
ratified the 1971 convention in 1988 and the 1988 conventions in 
1990, national legislation is not yet in conformity with some of the 
provisions of those conventions and the Canadian authorities have 
not been fully implementing those provisions. There are 
indications that Canada is a source of benzodiazepines entering the 
rest of North America.''
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15958"> 15958 </A></B>
<P>
	Paragraph 182 states: ``In Canada, organized gangs trafficking 
in metamphetimines, PCPs, and lysergic acid diethlamide, known 
as LSD, are increasingly becoming involved in illicit trafficking 
in precursors and other chemicals.''
<P>
	The final reference comes in the appending news release issued 
in conjunction with the INCB report. It states: ``The black market 
in the United States is another main target for diversion and 
smuggling of benzodiazepines. Canada, where imports and exports 
of these substances are not yet controlled, appears to be the main 
source of benzodiazepines diverted in the region. In one such case a 
broker company in the Bahamas established as a front by drug 
traffickers obtained from 1992 to 1994 large quantities of diazepam 
tablets from a Canadian origin to a local wholesaler. The company 
claimed that the tablets were to be exported to other countries in the 
Caribbean. In fact they were smuggled into the United States.''
<P>
	There are a number of other references. I think all members 
would understand clearly that Canada has been embarrassed in 
front of the United Nations, through the World Health 
Organization, through the International Narcotics Control Board, 
because we have not met our obligations under the international 
treaties to which we are a party.
<P>
	Bill C-7, once passed, will in fact bring Canada's laws up to date 
and in fact satisfy all the provisions of those treaties to which we 
are a party.
<P>
<B>(1320 )</B>
<P>
	In March 1995 I had an opportunity, along with the 
parliamentary secretary for the Minister of Health, to meet with 
representatives of the INCB to discuss our deficiencies and to 
review the progress of Bill C-7. I am pleased to advise that they 
were satisfied that Canada had finally developed a piece of 
legislation that was going to address those concerns. We are 
looking forward very much to advising our treaty partners that our 
laws are now in order with regard to those treaties. That is the most 
important reason for this piece of legislation.
<P>
	Finally, I would like to make some brief comments about certain 
issues that attracted substantial attention throughout the 
subcommittee's work. The first issue, which I think has been on the 
minds of a number of members on all sides of this House, is our 
approach to illicit drugs. Many criticized Bill C-7 initially because 
they alleged that it reaffirms a criminalization and interdiction 
approach to illicit drugs instead of a public health approach.
<P>
	As I mentioned, Bill C-7 forms only part of Canada's drug 
strategy, under which 70 per cent of our efforts are indeed directed 
at rehabilitation and treatment as alternatives. Bill C-7 also now 
includes, which it did not at second reading, a specific section 
addressing and promoting a rehabilitation and treatment approach 
to  illicit drugs. Bill C-41, the omnibus sentencing bill, also makes 
reference and encouragement to the courts and provides that 
alternative to the court system to ensure that wherever possible and 
appropriate, rehabilitation and treatment are desirable.
<P>
	Some also argue that a softer approach should be taken on illicit 
drugs because they cause fewer health problems than alcohol and 
tobacco, which were omitted from the bill. Alcohol and tobacco are 
no longer omitted from Bill C-7. If we are to be successful in taking 
a hard line on their use under our laws, we cannot get soft on drugs. 
Health impacts are not the only consideration. Far too many lives 
have been ruined by drugs, which costs our system billions of 
dollars annually in health, social, and justice programs. We will 
continue to work with our treaty partners in the World Health 
Organization, the UN, and the INCB to fight the war on drugs.
<P>
	An awful lot has been said today with regard to subclause 3(1), 
which has to do with a deeming provision. In simple terms, it 
basically states that if a drug or a substance is the same as or 
similar to an illicit substance, it would be deemed to be covered by 
the act. The member for Macleod and some other speakers tended 
to paint one picture. I would like to provide a different version of 
the realities having to do with subclause 3(1).
<P>
	The subcommittee and members of Parliament were literally 
swamped with letters and petitions from the distributors and users 
of natural and herbal remedies, as was stated by the member for 
Macleod. Industry leaders were alarmed because the bill referred to 
substances that had a similar stimulant or depressant effect to listed 
substances but were not themselves listed.
<P>
	All products sold to the public through natural and herbal 
remedy outlets have been approved for use in Canada under our 
existing laws and jurisdictional authorities. The effect of these 
substances we are talking about is so minuscule relative to the 
potency of the drugs covered by this bill that there was never any 
interest or intent to even mention herbal remedies and products 
such as camomile tea or ma huang. These are very mild stimulants 
or depressants, many of which are included in everyday cough 
syrup. There was never intent in the bill. In fact, there is a very 
important reason why the bill initially attempted to deal with 
unnamed or unknown substances.
<P>
<B>(1325)</B>
<P>
	For those who have a need and a desire to use natural and herbal 
remedies, I say that if they can be obtained legally before Bill C-7, 
they will still be obtainable after Bill C-7 passes. The bill does not 
affect those.
<P>
	I do want to comment on the misinformation that was generated 
by certain parties with regard to subclause 3(1). We have received 
some 4,000 letters and petitions from people with regard to this. I 
saw the trade magazines, which stated and showed very clearly that 
if  the bill passes stores will be closed and remedies will only be 
available from a doctor. They stated that these remedies will all be 
illegal and will never be available again. With 4,000 Canadians 
being driven to write to the committee, and I do not know how 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15959"> 15959 </A></B>
<P>
many wrote to other members of Parliament, imagine the alarm 
that was raised because of this misinformation.
<P>
	I wonder how much the industry had to do with trying to raise 
this concern simply for business reasons so that people would go 
out and stock up on these products. There was absolutely no basis 
for concern. I believe that kind of approach to political 
opportunism is totally inappropriate when we are dealing with the 
people of Canada on matters that are important to them.
<P>
	Subclause 3(1) was intended to cover substances that were 
chemically very similar to listed substances and produce the same 
or similar effect but were not themselves listed. The rapid changes 
in the technology of drug production makes it necessary for us to 
respond quickly to new drugs. If new drugs are to be developed and 
they are chemically very close and not on the schedule, it will take 
a long time to get them on the schedule and covered by the 
legislation.
<P>
	Governor in council orders allow at least a period of 
approximately 30 days to get something on a schedule. As the 
parliamentary secretary pointed out, if there were international 
implications or feedback or input had to be received from outside 
the country, that I believe would be extended to 75 days. Those are 
the reasons we need this.
<P>
	Although the provisions of subclause 3(1) would have been 
helpful, there was sufficient concern within the committee about 
the violation of a fundamental legal principle that requires that 
conduct that is subject to criminal sanction must be specified 
clearly in the act. This is the reason why subclause 3(1) had to be 
removed. Deeming a provision and saying it was the same or 
similar did not name a substance, and it was potentially going to 
cause a problem. The provision was dropped from the current bill, 
although I suspect it will have to be reconsidered should problems 
arise with new drugs arriving on the streets of Canada.
<P>
	Very briefly, the commercial production of hemp was raised with 
the committee. Substantial lobbying was done to have Bill C-7 
permit the commercial production of hemp. Given the time I have, 
I would simply indicate to those who are interested that this 
particular bill does not at present permit the commercial 
production of hemp. There is a window whereby if it were deemed 
appropriate a mechanism could be triggered. However, this process 
could take years. I would simply say with regard to the commercial 
production of hemp that it is a long way off, if indeed it is 
appropriate at all.
<P>
	Finally, I want to comment on the subject of marijuana. Not 
surprisingly, a number of Canadians urged the committee to 
decriminalize marijuana. They  argued that the penalties were too 
harsh and did not reflect the attitudes of most Canadians or the 
lenient practices of the courts or the police.
<P>
<B>(1330)</B>
<P>
	No evidence was presented to us on the attitudes of Canadians. 
Not dealing with the drug policy in our committee, none was asked 
for as well.
<P>
	However, there is no disputing the courts were clogged. This bill 
deals with that by changing the process for simple summary 
convictions for simple or first time possession. There is fast 
tracking for dealing with those offences.
<P>
	The bill, passed by the House at second reading, included a 
provision that simple possession of cannabis was a criminal 
offence. As such, any proposal to decriminalize marijuana would 
have been ruled out of order.
<P>
	The committee could not even have dealt with the question 
because it was a change in drug policy. This committee had no 
mandate to deal with drug policy.
<P>
	The issue is one of drug policy. More important, under the 
provisions of the various international treaties to which Canada is a 
party marijuana possession must be a criminal offence. As such it 
is very unlikely Canada will consider such a change.
<P>
	A recent article in the <I>Telegraph Journal</I> in New Brunswick 
reported: ``For possession of small amounts of cannabis, the 
amended sentence is six months and a $1,000 fine instead of seven 
years and a $2,000 fine''. That simply is not true. It is 
misinformation and may lead the reader to believe the bill proposes 
the law to be more lenient on simple possession.
<P>
	Under the existing Narcotic Control Act the maximum penalty 
for simple possession of marijuana on first offence and by 
summary conviction is $1,000 and six months imprisonment. That 
is the existing law. Under Bill C-7 the penalty is identical, no 
change. We did not deal with drug policy.
<P>
	Attitudes of many Canadians toward marijuana were developed 
many years ago when many failed to realize the technology of 
breeding plants has allowed producers to drastically increase the 
potency of marijuana by increasing its THC content, 
tetrahydrocannabinol.
<P>
	Marijuana is about 15 times more potent today than it was 10 
years ago. Marijuana today is as potent as cocaine was 10 years 
ago. Let there be no confusion, marijuana is a dangerous drug 
which can have serious health impacts. Its possession or use even 
in small amounts continues to constitute a criminal offence in Bill 
C-7 and in the laws of Canada.
<P>
	I thank the members of the subcommittee for their due care and 
diligence in addressing Bill C-7. I believe we have made a better 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15960"> 15960 </A></B>
<P>
piece of legislation and demonstrated once again that all members 
have the opportunity to  significantly influence the development of 
effective legislation for Canada, which as we all know includes 
Quebec.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> We will now proceed to the 
next stage of debate in which members will be entitled to a 
20-minute maximum subject to 10 minutes of questions or 
comments.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Roger Simmons (Burin-St. George's, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am very pleased to rise in support of this bill. Like its 
predecessor, Bill C-85, this bill is intended to improve and 
modernize the drug abuse provisions currently contained in the 
Narcotic Control Act and the Food and Drugs Act.
<P>
	I believe all of us here recognize the need for some reform in this 
area. Parts of the legislation are more than three decades old. It is 
obvious we cannot fight the drug problems of the 1990s with 
30-year old legislation.
<P>
	Some members have raised concerns about various aspects of 
the bill, particularly the health provisions which constitute the 
major part of the bill. Maybe those members are not aware that 
many of the concerns they have expressed have already been 
addressed by changes incorporated in Bill C-85 last year.
<P>
	Although it is for the Minister of Health to respond to those 
concerns which have not yet been addressed, it is necessary to 
emphasize two points regarding the health provisions before I turn 
to the smaller but important law enforcement component of this 
bill.
<P>
	This bill must not be looked at in isolation. It is not a standalone 
piece of legislation. It is the last and most important in a series of 
pieces of legislation designed to support the Canada drug strategy.
<P>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
	This federal program is a ten-year, $480 million campaign 
launched back in 1987 to fight substance abuse and drug trafficking 
in Canada. As part of that strategy Bill C-7 is an important element 
of the government's overall campaign to curb substance abuse.
<P>
	Some members have raised alarming images of innocent doctors 
and pharmacists unable to practise their professions, of violations 
of doctor-patient confidentiality and of the potential for law 
abiding citizens to be prosecuted for the use of everyday substances 
such as caffeine. Of course nothing could be further from the truth. 
I believe that even the members who mouth that kind of fear know 
they are engaging more in fear mongering than in fact 
dissemination.
<P>
	The initial health regulations to be proposed under this new bill 
will be identical in effect to those which currently exist under the 
Narcotic Control Act and parts III and IV of the Food and Drugs 
Act. Further, all of these existing regulations were developed in 
close co-operation with the people they most affect, the doctors, the 
pharmacists and the veterinarians. We are  not reinventing the 
wheel, we are simply building on a solid and proven foundation 
with the advice of the people most directly concerned.
<P>
	The bill would eliminate ambiguity and broaden the scope of 
existing legislation so that governments and police services can 
respond effectively to the Canadian drug scene of the nineties. 
Undoubtedly new health regulations will eventually be 
promulgated but not before they have been developed in full 
consultation with the people most directly involved. That can 
hardly be described as acting in haste or with lack of forethought. 
This is simply acting with common sense.
<P>
	The same common sense has been applied to the police 
enforcement aspect of the bill. Any police officer on the street will 
tell us that drug traffickers today use increasingly sophisticated 
methods to evade police efforts aimed at halting their deadly trade. 
To keep up with the traffickers the police need equally 
sophisticated investigative techniques such as reverse sting or 
sell-bust operations.
<P>
	I hope my friend from Edmonton is getting all of this.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hanrahan:</B> You are going slow enough, Roger.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simmons:</B> Good to see you. We meet here every day at the 
same time.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I certainly do not want to 
diminish the friendliness that arises in the Chamber through debate 
but I urge members to please direct their interventions through the 
Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simmons:</B> I thought I had done so, Mr. Speaker. If I did not, 
I apologize. I believe I was referring to my friend from Edmonton 
in the third person.
<P>
	During this type of sting operation it is frequently necessary for 
the police to sell small quantities of drugs to traffickers to establish 
credibility and further investigations. These techniques already 
exist but at present have no specific legislative basis and 
consequently are open to legal challenge. The bill would ensure the 
police have an appropriate statutory basis on which to mount 
operations against drug traffickers in a manner consistent with the 
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
<P>
	I know an hon. member has argued such authority already exists 
for all police services under section 18 of the RCMP act and he 
asked why we need this new provision. The answer is simple. First, 
section 18 of the RCMP act applies only to the RCMP and not to 
any other police service. Second, section 18 of the act does not 
provide a clear statutory authority to the RCMP for mounting 
undercover drug operations.
<P>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
	It only imposes a duty on the RCMP alone to enforce the law 
using powers that already exist under other statutes such as the 
Narcotic Control Act. Clearly there is a world of difference 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15961"> 15961 </A></B>
<P>
between this broad statutory  obligation and similar obligations in 
provincial police acts and the specific authority needed by all 
police services, federal, provincial and municipal, to carry out sting 
operations, an authority provided for in this bill.
<P>
	It is also important to note that the police enforcement 
regulations contemplated in this bill build on the existing narcotic 
control regulations and the food and drugs regulations. Both sets of 
regulations authorize police officers to possess narcotic and 
restricted drugs when directly related to police work.
<P>
	What is new is that the bill removes ambiguity that exists in the 
current legislation and gives police services a firm and clear 
statutory base for carrying out undercover drug operations.
<P>
	Again, we are not acting in haste here. The text of new police 
enforcement regulations have been published in the Canada 
Gazette, part I, to allow time for consultation and comment from 
all interested parties. Consistent with this, I am also pleased to 
announce that the solicitor general has provided to his provincial 
and territorial colleagues a discussion paper on the enforcement 
provisions of Bill C-7. This paper was also made public to 
members of the House and to the public. The paper outlines the 
policy underlying the new police enforcement regulations that will 
be made pursuant to this act.
<P>
	Again, this is an example of a government committed to 
consultation and the careful and methodical development of 
legislation that answers the needs and concerns of all stakeholders. 
That is how the government does business and how it should do 
business.
<P>
	There have also been concerns that Bill C-7 may permit an 
unwarranted intrusion by the federal government into provincial 
areas of jurisdiction, in this case the conduct of provincial and 
municipal police anti-drug operations. That concern is without 
foundation. Bill C-7 expressly recognizes that both the federal and 
provincial governments have clearly defined jurisdictions in the 
area of drug enforcement. The authority of the provincial ministers 
responsible for policing over provincial and municipal police 
services is expressly stated in the bill.
<P>
	Domestic issues aside, the bill is also important in that it will 
allow us to fulfil our international obligations. Canada is, after all, 
a signatory to three UN international conventions designed to 
counter substance abuse and drug trafficking: the single convention 
on narcotics drugs, a convention on psychotropic substances and 
the convention against illicit traffic in narcotic drugs substances. 
These international conventions are crucial in the fight against drug 
traffickers.
<P>
	Drug trafficking is an international problem requiring 
international action. We need only look at reports such as the 
RCMP national drug intelligence estimate to realize how true that 
statement is. Money laundering through  international banking 
systems, illegal drug routes criss-crossing the entire world and 
drug production centres ranging from South America to the Middle 
East all emphasize that international co-operation and 
co-ordination are necessary to effectively fight drug trafficking. 
That is why it is important Canada fulfil its international 
obligations to the best of its ability.
<P>
	The bill will give our police services the tools they need to do 
their jobs properly and to ensure they are at least as effective in 
their anti-drug operations as their counterparts in other countries.
<P>
	Aside from providing the police with a statutory basis for 
carrying out undercover drug operations, the bill also provides 
three other measures that will assist the police in their anti-drug 
activities. First, the bill will provide for controls on the import, 
export, production and distribution of controlled substances while 
at the same time allowing for the use of substances for medical, 
scientific and industrial purposes.
<P>
<B>(1345 )</B>
<P>
	Second, the bill will provide a control on the import and export 
of precursors, which are chemical substances used to produce 
controlled substances.
<P>
	Third, the bill will provide for the forfeiture of any property used 
to commit such offences and for a comprehensive search and 
seizure mechanism consistent with the Canadian Charter of Rights 
and Freedoms.
<P>
	I hope in my remarks during the past few minutes that I have 
made it clear the police enforcement provisions of Bill C-7 are a 
carefully considered set of measures designed to give police the 
powers they need to do their job properly. The provisions do not 
embody any new and exceptional powers, contrary to what has 
been suggested in the Chamber. The provisions do not infringe on 
provincial jurisdiction, contrary to what has been suggested during 
the course of the debate. The provisions are subject to consultation 
and review. They balance the needs of the police against the 
interest of the community as a whole.
<P>
	In short, it is modern legislation designed to respond to the 
demands of a modern world. Our police services deserve all the 
support we can give them, particularly when it comes to fighting 
drug traffickers. In the past we have shown our support through the 
passage of the proceeds of crime amendment and the Seized and 
Restrained Assets Management Act. Speedy passage of Bill C-7, 
the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, would both complement 
the previous two pieces of legislation I have mentioned and be a 
further demonstration of our commitment to support the police in 
their fight against the drug trade.
<P>
	Therefore I have much pleasure in inviting my colleagues on all 
sides of the Chamber to give their unfettered support to this 
excellent piece of legislation as expeditiously as possible.
<P>

<B><A NAME="15962"> 15962 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Middlesex, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it gives me great pleasure today to address Bill C-7. The 
problem of addiction and those who profit from addiction troubles 
the nation, my constituents in Lambton-Middlesex and people 
throughout Canada. Speaking as one who was elected to represent 
the same constituents, it troubles me.
<P>
	The illicit drug trade and those who live off its avail exact a 
heavy toll, especially on that segment of our population at the 
greatest risk: our youngsters, a prime and favourite target of those 
dealing in illicit drugs. Drugs destroy families. They destroy 
careers and they destroy futures. They also destroy young lives. 
Perhaps most of all, whilst doing so they put cash into the hands of 
criminals.
<P>
	In the early eighties there were more casual drug users among 
young people. While we see today a steady decline of casual drug 
use, there remains a hard core group of heavy drug users. What is 
worse is that those who make up the majority of the group are the 
youngsters hardest to reach.
<P>
	Street youth today are consuming far more drugs than frequent 
drug users who are still in school. The battle against illicit drug use 
is being waged in our cities, where the problem is most visible, 
through programs and high profile media campaigns. It has also 
been carried out in smaller communities across the country.
<P>
	Do we need more compelling reasons to advance the case against 
drug abuse? These people, the young, the abused, school dropouts, 
street kids, the unemployed and off reserve aboriginal youth are 
hard to reach.
<P>
<B>(1350 )</B>
<P>
	It therefore follows that the critical path to addressing the issues 
of substance abuse lies in education, prevention, treatment and 
rehabilitation. We must also strike at the root of the problem. We 
must equip law enforcement professionals with the tools needed to 
deal effectively with those who prey on the addicted. This bill 
provides the tool. We must promote sound law enforcement if we 
are ever to advance in the broader social goal of maintaining safe 
and peaceful communities. The bill provides the means of 
accomplishing this goal.
<P>
	We have also heard how the bill looks to the future. First, it 
provides for flexible framework for controlling the import, export, 
production, distribution and use of controlled substances.
<P>
	Second, it provides a mechanism that will allow us to implement 
our international obligations and to restrict the production or trade 
of regulated substances to the medical, scientific and industrial 
purposes.
<P>
	Third, it enhances enforcement of the law by the police and the 
courts as it provides the police with the necessary tools to enforce 
the law and provides for the  seizure and forfeiture of property used 
in offences involving controlled substances.
<P>
	Additionally, by reaching a broader range of controlled 
substances, the new legislation will help make it more difficult for 
drug dealers to reach children and will strengthen sentences handed 
down by the courts. It will make it easier for the police to arrest 
people who deal in illegal drugs.
<P>
	Drug dealing in and around schools and in or near public places 
usually frequented by minors will constitute an aggravated factor at 
the time of sentencing. This means that judges will have to justify 
their decision when not imposing a jail sentence.
<P>
	The new bill also places safeguards at all levels of production 
and distribution of controlled substances. This should ensure that 
they are not diverted from medical, scientific and industrial 
channels to the illegal street market.
<P>
	Right now as we debate the bill designer drugs are being 
produced in some clandestine laboratory and cannot be subjected to 
prosecution until they are included in the schedules. These designer 
drugs have the same basic properties as more familiar substances 
such as stimulants, tranquillizers and painkillers. However their 
chemical properties have been slightly altered. The result is that 
these substances are not covered by existing legislation and can be 
sold with impunity.
<P>
	Under the bill law enforcement officials will no longer have to 
wait for the drugs to appear on statutory schedules to stop criminals 
from selling them. So-called precursors, legal substances used in 
the manufacture of illicit substances, can also be obtained in large 
enough quantities through devious means.
<P>
	The bill contains enhanced controls for anabolic steroids. 
Studies in the United States and Canada have shown clearly that the 
problem of steroids is not confined to the high stake arenas of 
international competition. This was confirmed by Justice Dubin's 
findings. High school and college athletes use steroids in hopes of 
winning athletic scholarships or to shape up more quickly. 
Recreational athletes, adolescents and adults alike use steroids to 
improve their physique.
<P>
	It is no secret that even taken in limited doses for legitimate 
medical purposes steroids can cause serious side effects. 
Information from law enforcement agencies suggest that most 
steroids used by athletes are not prescribed by physicians. The 
mixture sold on the street may be of inferior quality or could pose 
unknown health risks.
<P>
	Under the proposed act not only will it be easier to arrest and 
convict traffickers but it will enable governments to seize and 
forfeit the proceeds of crime and property used or intended for the 
purpose of committing a drug related crime.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="15963"> 15963 </A></B>
<P>
	It is only through the adoption of the measures of education, 
prevention and law enforcement that we will have the necessary 
means to foster healthy communities free of addiction, 
degradation and criminal oppression.
<P>
	Children are entitled to grow up and develop in a supportive and 
caring environment, one which spawns honest, healthy and 
productive lifestyles. The bill before us is one way we can help to 
promote such a climate for the children of Canada.
<P>
<B>(1355)</B>
<P>
	At this point I stress three particular concerns brought to the 
attention of the subcommittee during its study of Bill C-7 with 
respect to the definition of practitioner. A number of witnesses 
appearing before the subcommittee, in particular the Canadian 
Medical Association, had grave concerns. We have addressed those 
concerns by setting out the definition of practitioner in clause 2 and 
by specifying that a practitioner be a registered and licensed 
individual. We have removed any possibility of the regulated 
activities of professionals being equated with trafficking.
<P>
	The next issue is subclause 3(1) as originally drafted in the bill 
that deals with the effect similarity of substances not covered in 
any of the bill's schedules. Concerns over the particular subclause 
were raised by many groups and individuals. Their perception was 
that certain herbal products might be inadvertently covered by it.
<P>
	Because of these concerns the subcommittee agreed to delete 
subclauses 3(1)(a) and (b) entirely. Essentially the effect similarity 
provisions have disappeared and we believe this would definitely 
erase all concerns regarding herbal products.
<P>
	I will respond to some criticisms raised by members of the 
opposition during debate at second reading. Both the official 
opposition and Reform members identified the absence of 
regulations as a fundamental impediment to obtaining a full 
understanding of the impact of the legislation. The activities of 
pharmacists, physicians, dentists and veterinarians are currently 
subject to the regulations under the Narcotic Control Act and parts 
III and IV of the Food and Drugs Act.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The member will have time left in the debate after 
question period. However, it being 2 p.m., we will now proceed to 
Statements by Members.

	<B>Mr. John Murphy (Annapolis Valley-Hants, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, over the last 128 years Canadians have built a country that 
is the envy of the world. We have built a  land that is prosperous 
and a country based on shared values such as peace, compassion 
and tolerance.
<P>
	We are also a nation profoundly attached to remaining a united 
country, a nation that includes Quebec. The mutual social, 
economic and political benefits of a united country or a united 
Canada have been clearly stated by the leaders of the no campaign.
<P>
	All Canadians from coast to coast have spoken from their hearts. 
They have reached out to say loud and clear that we want Quebec to 
stay. Now is the time for Quebec to look at the facts. When it does 
so, I believe Quebec will reject confusion, uncertainty and 
separation.

	On this important day I believe Quebec will clearly express its 
intention to remain in a united Canada.

	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, today the people of Quebec are making a decision that 
will affect not only Canadians living in Quebec but all Canadians. 
Our country will be profoundly changed regardless of the outcome 
of the Quebec referendum.
<P>
	There are two ways to confront change: first, to resist at every 
opportunity, drawing comfort from that which is familiar; and, 
second and more difficult but potentially much more rewarding, to 
accept the inevitability of change, to embrace change and thereby 
have the opportunity to manage it.
<P>
	Our country is poised at the precipice of such change. We have 
an opportunity to put aside past partisanship, past bias, and to look 
to the future with an open mind.
<P>
	We have an historic opportunity to fashion a new federation that 
is flexible enough to accommodate our different visions, strong 
enough to weather life's storms, and gentle enough to be a beacon

	<B>Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon-Clark's Crossing, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the health minister has repeatedly stated her 
government's commitment to maintain the quality of health care. 
However, with federal government programs cut by a staggering $7 
billion over three years and more to come after, the government's 
commitment to equal and quality health care for all Canadians is 
simply unbelievable.
<P>
	The Reform Party wants a two-tier health system, a good one for 
the rich and a poor one for everyone else. Both will lead to the end 
of the health care system we all treasure.

	The minister should show some leadership on the question of 
health promotion, which the World Health Organization defines 
as the process of enabling people to increase control over and to 
improve their health.
<P>
	The province of Saskatchewan leads the field in Canada on the 
front of health promotion and health prevention. Even American 
insurance companies are more committed to health prevention than 
the minister is. It is not anything new; we have been hearing this for 
years.
<P>
	With the continuing federal cuts, the challenge to continue to 
provide equal access to quality health care is a serious one. It is 
surely time for the government to begin looking at concrete 
methods of saving money and improving health care through a 
concerted initiative toward preventative health care.

Canada.
<P>
	Last week in the Parry Sound council chamber, the Canadian 
flag, flanked by the flags of Ontario and Quebec joined that of the 
town of Parry Sound. Mayor Cunningham pointed out the inclusion 
of the Quebec flag, noting its special significance at this point in 
history. She went on to say: ``It represents our tie to Quebec and our 
wish and hope that Quebec remain a part of Canada, our 
appreciation of its differences and what it adds to the nation''.
<P>
	The mayor went on to quote a local columnist who had noted that 
many individuals would feel as if they had lost a substantial part of 
their identity and their sense of Canadianism if Quebec were to 
separate.
<P>
	Mayor Cunningham reflects the vast majority of constituents in 
my riding who believe in the unity of Canada. They know that 
Confederation has worked for all parts of our nation and recognize 
that our unity and prosperity depends on a no vote today.

Montreal.

Canadians are watching and hoping for a strong no vote in Quebec. 
Reformers believe that no means not only no to the separatists, but 
no to the status quo as well.
<P>
	We must all acknowledge the problems that have led us to this 
point, starting with the top down style of federalism that dictates to 
provinces and people, instead of bottom up grassroots democracy.
<P>
	The problems of ever increasing taxes, the enormous debt, 
unacceptable levels of unemployment and a failing criminal justice 
system are the result of failed policies of the past.
<P>
	Reform has recently published 20 proposals for a renewed 
Canada. Without constitutional change, we would give power back 
to the provinces in language and culture, in natural resources and 
manpower training.
<P>
	We would give Canadians direct democracy through recall, 
referendum and free votes in this House.

doing so, say yes to a renewed Canada.

of a huge 10-foot unity poster which was put together by the grade 
5 and 6 class of Caradoc North Public School in Caradoc township 
near Strathroy, Ontario.
<P>
	The idea for this poster which consists of 400 pairs of hands and 
400 accompanying signatures came from the children. Its theme of

Speaker, we Canadians are lucky. Our country's political and 
democratic institutions are sound and have the confidence of the 
people. They have served us well in a long history. They were used 
to resolve some of the most fundamental conflicts any society can 
face, the role of government in private lives and the power of 
centralist institutions in conflict with regional aspirations.
<P>
	The resolution to these and many other conflicts were never 
supported by all Canadians. Before votes, they were discussed 
widely and heatedly. They divided families, friends and regions. 
But after the votes were counted, the democratic decision was 
accepted. Losers licked their wounds and resolved to fight again by 
the same rules.
<P>
	This democratic tradition will be tested severely when the votes 
are counted today, when the stakes are higher than they have ever 
been before, when many fear the end of Canada.

<P>
	The good news is that Bounjan Inthavong, that bad guy from 
Laos who participated in the murder of young Kirby Martin by 
beating him with a baseball bat has been deported. The minister 
of immigration assisted me in that deportation and I thank him 
for that. I hope the next time it will not take a year and a half 
to get his act in gear.
<P>
	The bad news is that there are many more to deport, like Karel 
Kral and Hector Lopez. Standing in the way of these deportations is 
an inept, incompetent refugee board.
<P>
	Most Canadians do not know this but these refugee boards are 
not required to look at criminal convictions of non-Canadians at 
refugee hearings, only the consequences of sending them back to 
the receiving countries-

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, regardless of the outcome of the Quebec referendum, 
Canada must go on with important changes in the federal system. 
The priorities of the Canadian people must be met. The federal debt 
has risen to over $560 billion. Canadians are staggering under an 
oppressive tax burden. Our health care system is on the critical list. 
Canadians are increasingly concerned about their public safety.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs. Is 
the government willing to make changes, real changes, in these 
important areas to prepare Canada for the 21st century?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
the Environment, Lib.): </B>Thank you, Mr. Manning, for this vote of 
confidence in Canada.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we saw on Friday and again throughout the weekend the 
power that Canadians can exert when they work together. Tens of 
thousands of Canadians joined together in a common cause and 
voiced a common concern. They want a united country and a 
Canada that is open to change. On that point I think I can speak for 
every member of this House when I say that we love this country 
and we will fight for change within a united Canada.
<P>
	Is the government prepared to invite greater public input and 
greater public participation, like we saw on the weekend, in 
developing and implementing a Canadian agenda for change?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, certainly we can agree with 
the Reform Party on one point. The show of strength of Canadians 
from across the country who converged on the city of Montreal to 
show their solidarity with Quebecers and to show Quebecers that 
not only is Canada good for Quebec, but Quebec is a very key part 
of Canada, with that we can certainly agree.
<P>
	We look for the continued support of the leader of the Reform 
Party to implement an agenda where Canadians can feel at home in 
any part of their country, in any language.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in order to address many of the concerns on the Canadian 
agenda there needs to be a realignment of responsibilities between 
the federal and provincial governments.
<P>
	Canadians want the control of the financing of services, like 
social services that affect their daily lives, to be in the hands of the 
level of government which is closest to them. They want the federal 
government to play a co-ordinating role in the establishment of 
national standards and a stronger role in the area of international 
trade on which so many jobs and incomes depend.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs. In 
the days following the referendum is the government prepared to 
fundamentally rethink its relationship with the provinces and 
realign important federal and provincial responsibilities?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, there was one message 
which came out very loud and clear from the people who gathered 
in Montreal from every corner of the country. The message was 
that they were  tired of political fights. This was not a discussion 
among politicians. It was a heart to heart talk among the people of 
Canada. I personally spoke to a lady in a wheelchair who came 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15968"> 15968 </A></B>
<P>
from Peace River, Alberta with her husband. She met me in the 
elevator and she said:
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
``Ms. Copps, I do not speak French, but if you could tell Quebecers 
their being part of this country is important, tell them, because their 
Canada is my Canada''. And that is the message we must give 
Quebecers today, not the message that Canada does not work. 
Canada can change. Canada will change. And it will change with 
the heart of Canada inside it: Quebec.

	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, whatever the outcome of the referendum today, Canada's 
deficit crisis remains. The difference between the government's 
spending and revenues is nearly $100 million every 24 hours of 
every week, of every month, at least for this year.
<P>
	Can the Minister of Finance assure the people of Canada that 
whatever the outcome of the referendum, he has decisive plans for 
the prompt elimination of the deficit?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the government has a 
clear plan to reduce the deficit and to move from 3 per cent of GDP 
to a balanced budget. We have followed our plan.
<P>
	Despite the changes in the economic environment, as the finance 
minister says, come hell or high water we are going to meet our 
targets in reducing the deficit. The best way of doing that is what 
we have done, to keep our feet to the fire with rolling two year 
targets. We have done that and we are going to continue doing it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, whatever the outcome of the referendum today, Canada's 
debt will still be $560 billion. Our generation imposes an 
irresponsibly high burden on young Canadians.
<P>
	Can the minister assure young Canadians that he has decisive 
plans to deal with the burden of the debt on young Canadians?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, if the Reform Party were 
really interested in the financial state of the country, instead of 
using question period on this very important day to score cheap 
political points, it would be working with the Government of 
Canada to  keep Canada together which is the best message for the 
Canadian dollar that we can expect.

	<B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question 
is directed to the Deputy Prime Minister.
<P>
	I think it is fair to say that citizens in all provinces and territories 
today are concerned about what they hear of the government's 
plans to reduce the unemployment insurance program, reduce 
pension coverage, reduce health care funding, reduce 
post-secondary education funding, reduce support for all social 
programs and last, high interest rates and high unemployment 
levels.
<P>
	Knowing that this is in place and these are the trends, why should 
Canadians in any province and territory today be hopeful about the 
future?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
the Environment, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the hon. 
member for his question, because it gives me a chance to repeat the 
message I sounded loud and clear in the GaspÃ© on Saturday.
<P>
	It was that GÃ©rald Larose, who for 25 years has worked for the 
sole cause of separation, is spreading false versions of the federal 
government's policies on unemployment insurance. I can assure 
the hon. member, as I did in the Magdalen Islands yesterday, that 
the documents prepared by GÃ©rald Larose and the CSN are pure 
separatist propaganda and of no value in the current debate.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
supplementary question is also for the Deputy Prime Minister and 
concerns integrity in government and particularly in this 
government.
<P>
	The Deputy Prime Minister promised Canadians that if the hated 
GST was not abolished immediately that she would resign her seat. 
Why has the Deputy Prime Minister not resigned her seat?
<P>
<B>(1425 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, when I hear a member of 
the New Democratic Party from British Columbia talking about 
integrity, I want to say ``bingo''.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Under the ``N'' for New Democrats.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Copps:</B> I will say that during the election campaign I gave 
my word to the people of my riding that if we did not scrap the GST 
before the next election, I would resign and I intend to respect that 
promise.

	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, regardless 
of the outcome tonight, the government should proceed with 
important, positive and constructive changes in the area of 
taxation.
<P>
	The Liberal red book clearly states that fairness, simplicity and 
harmonization should be the key objectives of Liberal tax policies.
<P>
	If they want to meet this promise, when will the Minister of 
Finance commit his government to full parliamentary review of our 
convoluted, complicated, confusing income tax system?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, compared to some 
other tax systems, ours is model of simplicity. We review it 
every-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peters:</B> Have a pack of yahoos taken over the seats over 
there?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, let me try 
again.
<P>
	The charter of rights and freedoms has 7,000 words, the Bible 
773,000 words, the Income Tax Act has 1,200,000 words. Our 
current system of taxation has become an enormous social 
experiment which can no longer be understood, much less justified. 
Given that the United States is looking at flat tax reforms being 
brought forward by almost every Republican candidate for the next 
presidential election and this parliamentary secretary jokes about 
simplicity, when will the government follow suit and offer 
Canadians some hope in the form of tax reform and tax relief?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, every time someone 
proposes the flat tax, I ask them: Are you going to pay more taxes 
or less taxes under a flat tax system? They always answer one way. 
They are going to pay less. I do not know who is going to pay the 
taxes under a flat tax system if that is the case.
<P>
	I know under the Reform Party plan who will pay more taxes. 
The poor and the middle class are going to pay more and the 
wealthy are going to pay less because that is the Reform Party 
platform.

	<B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is directed to the Minister of National Defence.
<P>
	Yesterday, the first Canadian Forces flight to leave Bosnia 
arrived in Quebec City. A second flight will arrive today. These 
members of the peacekeeping force have worked under very 
difficult conditions in an extremely difficult situation.
<P>
	Could the minister tell the House about the role these Canadians 
have played in saving the lives of civilians and opening the door to 
peace in a region torn by war?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank 
the hon. member for his question. I wish to commend all members 
of the Canadian Forces who worked in the former Yugoslavia 
during the past four years.
<P>
	They served with great distinction, and we are proud of all 
members of the Canadian Forces.
<P>
<B>(1430)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is not very well known that Canada now has joining among its 
citizens upon the return of members from the armed forces more 
veterans from armed conflict at any time since the Korean war. The 
men and women who have served in Bosnia and Croatia have seen 
terrible hostility. They have seen a society that has been ravaged.
<P>
	They have brought the best principles of civility, tolerance and 
compassion of a united Canada to bear upon their service in that 
area.

I have a supplementary for the minister.

deployment of Canadian peacekeeping forces in Bosnia?

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as the Prime 
Minister has said, Canada would consider participating in any force 
set up to help keep the peace in Bosnia after the appropriate peace 
settlement is negotiated. That is an option we are keeping open and 
one that we will consider.
<P>
	Canadians appreciate that we have worked very hard in that area 
for the last three or four years and that we have contributed much. 
That does not mean to say we would not be prepared to continue 
our co-operation with any new force.

<HR>

<P>
united Canada both today and for  the future. I know the Liberals 
share our vision for a more decentralized federation.
<P>
	Regardless of today's vote, to indicate an end to the status quo 
what specific powers and changes is the Minister of Human 
Resources Development prepared to offer to the provinces in the 
area of social programs?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was interested in the opening 
question of the leader of the third party asking us to engage 
Canadians in a major debate.
<P>
	Up to now the Reform Party has opposed the major public 
participation that we encourage in looking at the changes to social 
programs. I am glad to see there has been a change in attitude on 
the part of the Reform Party.
<P>
	One of the most important lessons out of the dialogue that has 
taken place with hundreds of thousands of Canadians is when they 
are talking about decentralization there is much talk about giving 
the individual more choice, providing more resources in the hands 
of individual Canadians and local communities to allow them to 
help shape, design and customize employment programs and social 
programs to meet the requirements of their own local communities.
<P>
	As the hon. member will know, we have already taken a major 
step to fundamentally decentralize the operation of the Department 
of Human Resources Development which serves 11 million 
Canadians. It is the largest service delivery organization in the 
country. We have already announced those steps to bring the locus 
of responsibility, accountability and decision making to the local 
level so that we can work in partnership at the local level with 
individuals.
<P>
	That is an indication of the kind of changes we want to make.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
French, please.
<P>
	The Reform Party would like to offer more hope to Canada and 
all the provinces, including Quebec. We believe we must 
decentralize control over social programs. Canadians are calling 
for it and so are the provinces. We want the provinces to have the 
final say over training, education and social assistance programs.
<P>
	Will the minister of human resources be consulting in this 
regard?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as the hon. member for 
Calgary Southeast knows, we have, in the past year, offered all of 
the provinces the option of full responsibility for training so they 
would have all the flexibility they need to manage this area of 
jurisdiction. I  set up a negotiating process with all the provinces 
and many agreements have been reached.
<P>
<B>(1435)</B>
<P>
	As far as unemployment insurance is concerned, I hope that, 
with the reform, there will be a new system, a new network for 
Canadian jobs. There will be a lot of opportunity to continue 
negotiating with the provinces, the unions, businesses and social 
groups in order to come up with a new approach to developing an 
employment system for all Canadians.

<P>
	Jaswant Khalra, a human rights activist who appeared before

approaches to the Indian authorities regarding this case.

regardless of the outcome of today's referendum, Canadians

release of violent offenders is one issue that will not go away.
<P>
	Can the solicitor general explain to Canadians why a first degree 
murderer is allowed to appeal his parole eligibility after serving 
only 15 years of a life sentence?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, section 745 has  been part of the 
Criminal Code for almost 20 years. The debates which 
accompanied its introduction those many years ago disclose a will 
on the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15971"> 15971 </A></B>
<P>
part of Parliament to provide the possibility after 15 years for 
persons to go in front of a jury to ask for permission to apply for 
parole in certain circumstances.
<P>
	What must be borne in mind is this is not the right to parole. This 
is simply a provision permitting a prisoner to go before a jury 
drawn from the community to test the question of whether they 
should be permitted to apply for parole to the Parole Board.
<P>
	That was the will of Parliament when that provision was adopted 
15 years ago.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
murderers Jim Peters and Robert Brown raped, stabbed to death 
and burned the bodies of their victims Laurie Boyd and Debbie 
Stevens. The Boyd and Stevens families are outraged to think that 
Peters could be eligible for a parole or even for parole review after 
serving only 15 years.
<P>
	Since the solicitor general says he cannot intervene in the 
decision making process, will he support the repeal of section 745 
of the Criminal Code and ask his party to support it as well?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, over the last two years I have met 
with dozens of victims of violent crime, women whose husbands 
have been killed, children left without parents, men and women 
whose children have been lost to violence.
<P>
	I have listened to the message those Canadians have expressed. 
As part of Bill C-41 we changed section 745 to ensure that the 
courts on application for permission to apply for early parole will 
be obligated to hear from the families of victims as a factor to be 
taken into account in making that decision.
<P>
<B>(1440 )</B>
<P>
	There are those who say that is not enough. Let me respond to 
the hon. member further. When the private members' bill to repeal 
section 745 came before the House there was in essence a free vote 
on that subject. That bill has has now gone to committee. I have 
encouraged the committee to look broadly at the whole subject and 
make recommendations. We shall pay close attention to those 
recommendations once they are made.

	<B>Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon-Clark's Crossing, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Deputy Prime Minister. 
Canadians everywhere well remember the members of the present 
government's forceful opposition to the previous Conservative 
government's cutbacks on  health care, post-secondary education 
and social programs when in opposition.
<P>
	Yet since moving from the opposition benches to the government 
side there has been a change of heart. This government's cuts to 
health care, post-secondary and social programs are the deepest in 
the last 50 years. While implementing an 8 per cent cut across the 
board, there is a full 25 per cent cut in these three areas.
<P>
	Does she feel that tearing down the very institutions which 
define us as Canadians and which we hold dear is the way to build a 
strong, unified country?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
the Environment, Lib.):</B> No, Mr. Speaker. On a day that all 
Canadians should be rallying to support Canada, on the eve of a 
very critical vote for all of us, I am rather surprised the NDP has 
joined the chorus of nay sayers on the Reform side of the House.
<P>
	I can only hope that between now and the time the polls close 
tonight in Quebec the message will not be coming out-the one 
that seems to be coming from the opposition benches-that Canada 
is in a mess and that it does not work.
<P>
	The people of Canada have stated loud and clear they want 
universal health care available to everyone. The government has 
taken that suggestion against the opposition of certain premiers and 
certain political parties. We will fight to ensure that every single 
Canadian has access to health care because that too is part of the 
Canadian dream.

taken, any pieces of legislation brought forward, we need to have 
evidence on which to base that legislation. It is necessary to have 
these surveys. I am a very careful with money but there are times 
when we have to spend those dollars.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the minister is 
fond of saying we want a U.S. style health care system.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> No she isn't.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Wrong party.
<P>
<B>(1445)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Macleod):</B> It has very little to recommend it, frankly. 
Canadians are looking at a system much more like that in Europe. 
There they have a public system complemented by the private 
system. The costs go down and the access goes up.
<P>
	Is the minister polling to improve medicare or simply to protect 
her legislation?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
medicare in this country is about more than money. It is about more 
than cheap politics. It is even about more than health care.
<P>
	Medicare concerns our self-understanding as a people and as a 
country. It concerns our identity as a fair, just, compassionate, and 
pragmatic people. It is an identity that was fashioned by our 
commitment to shared fundamental values. It is an identity that is 
cherished by every Canadian.
<P>
	Medicare recognizes the very best of what we are as Canadians. 
Without the medicare system we have now, Canadians would lose a 
very important mirror on themselves. We will not allow that.

	<B>Ms. Shaughnessy Cohen (Windsor-St. Clair, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister for International Trade.
<P>
	Last February an American senator assured us that a plan to 
impose a fee on Canadians crossing into the States was ``as dead as 
Elvis''. Elvis may be dead, but I think he has been appearing in 
Washington before a Senate committee, because they are talking 
about moving ahead with this plan.
<P>
	Will the minister please tell us what the government is doing to 
persuade the Americans not to tax Canadians entering their fair 
country?
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> We want Elvis.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Roy MacLaren (Minister for International Trade):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I believe there have been a few sightings recently. In fact 
the House leader, who is something of an expert in these matters, 
has reported one such sighting.
<P>
	The United States Senate judiciary subcommittee did indeed 
agree to a dollar tax on people entering the United States, but when 
it goes to full committee it is unlikely to carry. We are quite 
confident that when the full committee reviews the 
recommendation it will not go forward.
<P>
	In any event, I would add that we have consistently pursued our 
point of view with the United States government, which is that, as 
the member suggests, such a measure would be in conflict with the 
United States commitments under NAFTA, a point that my 
colleague, the Minister of National Revenue, made when he visited 
Washington recently.

	Four years ago the Canada-Quebec accord was signed, which

live with a no. That will be tough.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Marchi:</B> Mr. Speaker, our Prime Minister has made it 
abundantly clear that change has been a defining characteristic of 
this government.
<P>
	With respect to immigration, we have not only talked about 
change, we have actually gone out there and done it. There happen 
to be seven provincial agreements with the federal government on 
immigration. We are actively negotiating with the three other 
provinces that do not have an agreement. British Columbia and 
Manitoba are already well entrained and Ontario is advancing very 
nicely.
<P>
<B>(1450)</B>
<P>
	We also talked to the provinces about renewing the way we 
integrate, so we will be moving from a position of not only Ottawa 
knows best, but going local, because if it does not happen locally it 
does not work nationally.
<P>
	We have talked to the provinces and we are working with the 
provinces on promotion and recruitment from abroad and also with 
respect to giving additional powers to the provinces.
<P>
	We will have more to say when we announce the levels on 
Wednesday afternoon.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley, 
Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is encouraging to hear that the Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration is willing to let the provinces have 
more control in immigration.
<P>
	I would like to know if the minister, when he announces the 
immigration projections for the new year on Wednesday, is going 
to allow the provinces to have input in the immigration levels of 
their provinces.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, not only will they have input 
from Wednesday on, I have actually discussed with and written to 
every one of my provincial counterparts to consult with them as to 
what the numbers ought to be and, beyond the numbers, what 
categories there should be in this country and what kind of latitude 
the provinces should have.
<P>
	For instance, with Manitoba, along with the Minister of Human 
Resources Development, we have been discussing very intensely in 
the last number of days and weeks its need for garment workers. 
That is not solely an immigration matter, not solely an HRD matter, 
and not only a matter for the province; it is a matter for 
governments in general to get their collective acts together.
<P>
	We are moving in the right direction. We recognize that it is a 
shared jurisdiction. I would hope the hon. member would stand up 
and applaud our efforts.

of this report?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, normally I would want the 
secretary of state to give the answer because she has done yeoman's 
service in ensuring that the young people of this country have been 
provided with new opportunities for employment. However, in her 
absence, as it comes under my general responsibilities, I would like 
to answer.
<P>
	At this time we have over 200 projects operating in the country 
in which young people have been given an opportunity for 
community experience as well as being able to earn a stipend so 
they can return to school. Over 80 per cent of the young people 
involved in the first year have indicated that they will be using the 
experience they have gained plus the honorarium they have earned 
to return to school, to start their own businesses, or to gain further 
employment.

Columbia is aboriginal issues. Among the provincial political 
parties there is a growing divergence of views on aboriginal issues.
<P>
	With the current lame duck NDP administration in the waning 
days of its mandate, will the Minister of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development assure the House that he will not entertain 
completion of any comprehensive agreements, such as the Nisga'a 
claim, until there is a new administration with a fresh mandate?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this government is prepared to 
entertain anything on which there has been consultation, which 
looks feasible, which will result in something better than when we 
started, and which takes into consideration the history of the 
aboriginal people. I see nothing in the proposal of the Reform Party 
that suggests that it has adhered to any of those four criteria.
<P>
	The Nisga'a have been waiting almost 80 years for justice, and 
now the Reform member is saying do not do anything until the

	I want to point out that the native people in this country have 
expressed their love for Canada in the last week by the Montagnais 
voting 99 per cent no, the Inuit voting 95 per cent no, and the Cree 
voting 96.3 per cent no. Do we treat them and their sense of feeling 
for this country by saying do not deal with them, but wait for the 
next provincial election? My answer to the hon. member is no, 
absolutely not.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Duncan (North Island-Powell River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this month the B.C. Minister of Aboriginal Affairs 
publicly stated that settling B.C. land claims will cost $10 billion. 
The federal minister's department this month estimated costs of $5 
billion. My numbers tally with those of the provincial minister.
<P>
	When there are radically different estimates on such a critical 
issue, does the minister not agree that the public deserves financial 
transparency and a cost-benefit analysis on this issue?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, what the public needs is some 
straight talk from the Reform Party.
<P>
	The member for Athabasca, who sits on the Reform Party's 
policy committee, said: ``The Europeans came to this country 300 
years ago, opened it up and settled it. Because we did not kill the 
Indians and have Indian wars does not mean we did not conquer 
these people. If they were not in fact conquered then why did the 
aboriginal people allow themselves to be herded into little reserves 
in the most isolated, desolate, worthless parts of this country?'' 
That is what has happened in B.C., Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	The hon. member now says we should not do anything. Well now 
is not the time to take that position. I wish the Reform Party would 
support the BCTC legislation, which they may, so we can start 
negotiating and doing the job we were elected for: to support the 
very people the Reform Party represents. This hon. member has 
half a dozen to a dozen First Nations in his riding. It is about time 
he realized that they are Canadians and voters and they have 
grievances that we must begin to resolve.

	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Deputy Prime Minister.
<P>
	The Deputy Prime Minister talked earlier about fighting for 
medicare. I do not doubt the Deputy Prime Minister's commitment 
to medicare. However, I would like to ask her a question. Do she 
and the government not see that if this government continues the 
trend toward unilateral withdrawal of the federal government  from 
the fiscal partnership that medicare also was-it was not just a 
partnership with respect to standards and services-they will be 
unable to maintain national standards because they will lose the 
critical moral edge they need and the Reform Party will win by 
default?
<P>
	We have to fund medicare as well as fight for it. When will this 
government start funding medicare so that we can save it?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we have stated unequivocally that we would continue to fund 
medicare in this country with stable, ongoing funding.
<P>
	There are many myths out there, and one has to do with the 
decrease in funding by the federal government. Since we have been 
in power, we have not decreased the funding at all.
<P>
	Let me give the member an example of what is happening in 
Alberta in terms of our share of funding for health care 
expenditures. When we took office, the level of federal funding in 
Alberta was 33 per cent of their health care expenditures. The 
following year it rose to 37 per cent of their health care 
expenditures. This year federal funding for health care in Alberta, 
as our share of their spending, will be 40.6 per cent.

<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank 
the hon. member for Ottawa West for raising the issue.
<P>
	Canada is world renowned for having one of the best retirement 
systems in the world yet one disadvantaged group in our country is 
single, elderly women. In recognition of that fact, Liberal 
governments have, in successive years, improved the security of 
low income elderly women. The result is that retirement incomes 
for elderly women have been drastically improving over the last 10 
or 20 years. The proportion of low income elderly women has 
declined significantly.
<P>
	That is in contrast to the proposal on pensions from the Reform 
Party which would have the opposite effect of making the single, 
elderly woman less well off.

Speaker, I raise a point of order to seek the consent of the House for 
a small amendment to the Standing Orders which I think every 
patriotic member will support.
<P>
	All of us participated enthusiastically today in the singing of ``O 
Canada''. Many of us, if not all of us, would like that to become a 
regular feature of the House just like the flag.
<P>
	Eighteen months ago an amendment to this effect was referred to 
the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs but 
nothing came of it.
<P>
	I, therefore, seek the unanimous consent of the House for the 
following motion:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Standing Order 30(1) be amended by adding immediately after the word 
``upon'', the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>On Wednesdays, immediately after Prayers, the Speaker shall cause Canada's 
national anthem to be played or sung in the House.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Standing Order 30(2) be amended by deleting all the words after the 
word ``prayers'' and substituting the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Or on Wednesdays after Canada's national anthem has been sung or played, 
the business of the House shall commence.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>And that the clerk be authorized to make any consequential amendments to

want to congratulate the hon. member on his very helpful 
suggestion.
<P>
	I can indicate to him that having given me some notice this 
morning of the fact that he intended to raise the matter, although I 
did not have the specifics of the motion he had planned I spoke 
with the chief government whip who, as he knows, is a member of 
the procedure and House affairs committee which I have the 
honour to chair. The chief government whip indicated to me his 
enthusiasm for the suggestion and he is quite prepared to consider 
it in committee. While I am happy to take the hon. member's 
motion under advisement, it would be inappropriate to make 
changes to the standing orders of the House here on the floor 
without notice.
<P>
<B>(1505)</B>
<P>
	Normally notice is given of these motions if they come at all 
through other than the committee. I think it appropriate that the 
committee take the matter under advisement and report to the 
House and I will undertake to see that the committee does study it 
at an early date.
<P>

it but if it is on the same subject the House has decided.

the national anthem in the House of Commons.
<P>

the Liberal Party is opposed to the merits of the resolution. The fact 
that unanimous consent was denied only means that it was denied 
with respect to the process that the Reform Party is following to-

	<B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Lambton-Middlesex has 
about 10 minutes left in her speech.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Middlesex, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the regulations made initially under the new legislation 
will not differ substantially from those that currently apply to such 
activities under the existing legislation.
<P>
	One of the purposes of the regulation making power is to enable 
the government to respond quickly to changing professional 
practices. The flexibility provided by regulations will ensure the 
availability of such drugs for appropriate medical and scientific 
purposes while complying with international drug control 
conventions.
<P>
	Any changes in the regulations will only be made following full 
consultation with all affected parties using a regulatory 
consultation process that has been used for years by the 
Department of Health. Both the official opposition and the Reform 
Party member suggested there would be inconsistencies between 
various provisions of the bill and the charter of rights and 
freedoms.
<P>
	One of the aspects of the bill identified as giving rise to charter 
challenges relates to the powers of inspectors under part IV. 
Reference was made to the interim order provisions of section 34 
which permit the Minister of Health to act to limit professional 
drug distribution activities where there is substantial risk of 
immediate danger to the health and safety of Canadians. In addition 
the requirement to answer an inspector's questions was equated 
with self-incrimination in a criminal context.
<P>
	In reply the solicitor general pointed out to members that the 
Minister of Justice must examine every bill for compliance with 
the charter before it is tabled.
<P>
	Inspections that we are referring to here are inspections 
conducted to determine whether regulated persons are complying 
with the requirements under which they carry on their business or 
their profession. There are many acts, both federal and provincial, 
which confer broad powers of entry on inspectors in the interest of 
ensuring public health and safety.
<P>
<B>(1515)</B>
<P>
	These provisions are not criminal law in the true sense, but 
administrative provisions that either have an independent existence 
or are incidental to criminal law. The applicable charter principles 
are not those that apply to criminal law provisions, but those that 
apply to administrative inspection regimens.
<P>
	These types of provisions have been in force in Canada under 
federal drug control legislation for over 80 years. They effectively 
establish a federal regulatory scheme that governs the distribution 
and use of scheduled drugs  in Canada in a manner consistent with 
limiting their diversion to the illicit drug market and consistent 
with Canada's international obligations under the United Nations 
drug control conventions currently in force in Canada.
<P>
	Contraventions of designated regulations give rise to a hearing 
before an adjudicator as indicated in part V of the bill. It may result 
in a ministerial order which should effectively prevent a 
reoccurrence. No penalty of fine or imprisonment applies to a 
breach of these provisions of the regulations. Charter principles 
that would apply if imprisonment were available as a penalty are 
not applicable here.
<P>
	Another area of criticism relates to the impact of the bill on 
physician-patient and pharmacist-patient confidentiality. Both 
members identified access to confidential files of patients as an 
unacceptable interference in the private lives of honest citizens. 
There is very little new here.
<P>
	For over 30 years, under the narcotic control regulations the 
Minister of Health has exercised legislative authority to require a 
practitioner to provide any information concerning a patient treated 
with narcotics to the bureau of dangerous drugs, including the 
diagnosis, history and prescribing information relevant to the 
patient. This is the very information inspectors are being 
authorized to copy. Similarly, pharmacists are required to report 
prescriptions every two months to the bureau of dangerous drugs. 
Approximately 4.2 million prescriptions are reported to the bureau 
each year.
<P>
	Subject to legitimate program activities required under the 
current and proposed legislation to protect public health and safety, 
physician-patient and pharmacist-patient confidentiality is and will 
be fully maintained. This information currently obtained is also 
subject to the Privacy Act, which prohibits its use or disclosure by 
any official except in accordance with that act. The Privacy Act 
ensures that all information collected by the federal government for 
program purposes is treated confidentially.
<P>
	Concerning the so-called doctor shopping or double doctoring 
offence, the official opposition member cited evidence given by the 
Canadian Medical Association before the legislative committee 
which examined Bill C-85. It was argued that Bill C-7 would be 
unsatisfactory to doctors as they would be included within the 
ambit of clause 5(2). The Reform member asserted that this 
provision would mean that seeking help for an addiction would be a 
crime.
<P>
	In fact, the criticism was accepted by the committee and it was 
proposed that the provision be changed to essentially return to the 
existing section found in the Narcotic Control Act. As a result, the 
provision now refers only to persons who receive prescriptions 
from doctors.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15978"> 15978 </A></B>
<P>
	The Reform member's comments are difficult to understand. 
Clause 5(2) of Bill C-7 as it now stands could not be applied to 
a person who goes in any one month to only one doctor for his 
medical requirements. This provision deals not with dependent 
persons seeking help, but rather with dependent persons who are 
seeking drugs from many doctors but help from none.
<P>
	We all understand that control of controlled substances is a 
complex matter which requires a carefully constructed legal basis 
in order to be effective, judicious and fair. I believe this bill is a 
most appropriate instrument for the administration of the laws and 
regulations we need.
<P>
	We are dealing with an aspect of society which demands proper 
protection of the innocent, the inexperienced and the vulnerable. It 
also demands forceful prosecution of the exploitive, the criminal 
and the ruthless.
<P>
	I believe this bill strikes just the right balance between these two 
requirements.
<P>
<B>(1520 )</B>
<P>
	While we continue to minimize harm through education and 
prevention, and while we continue to show compassion for victims 
through treatment and rehabilitation, we must also strike at the 
criminal heart of this problem. In passing this bill, we will be 
making contributions to successful battles against drug abuse now 
and well into the future.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Maloney (Erie, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I welcome the 
opportunity to speak on this bill today. This bill concerns 
controlling drugs and substances and addresses one of the most 
compelling issues with which society is faced today, the issue of 
drug abuse. Constituents in Erie riding have demanded action and 
this government has responded.
<P>
	As each member of the House is only too aware, drug abuse and 
the untold suffering it causes knows no geography, no 
socioeconomic class, no social graces. The problem is widespread. 
It strikes hard and with devastation. It destroys families, careers 
and lives. We must stop this waste.
<P>
	According to a United Nations survey, trade in illegal drugs is 
second only to world trade in arms. This is a very sobering fact. 
The incidence of drug abuse rises considerably among teenagers 
and young adults who are school drop outs, unemployed, or 
homeless. Do not be fooled. This disease, this cancer is in our 
schools as well. Ask your children. Ask your grandchildren. It is 
truly frightening.
<P>
	While recognizing that there is a need to emphasize demand 
reduction, it is important that the Government of Canada 
complement these efforts with drug law enforcement and crime 
prevention.
<P>
	This bill is intended to consolidate, modernize, enhance and 
streamline the government's drug control policy underlying two 
current acts of Parliament and to fulfil Canada's obligations under 
three international conventions.
<P>
	In 1961 the government of the day enacted the Narcotic Control 
Act as a follow-up to the single convention on narcotic drugs. In 
anticipation of the 1971 convention on psychotropic substances, in 
1961 and 1969, Parliament passed parts III and IV respectively of 
the Food and Drug Act. In essence, much of our existing legislation 
framework is now more than 30 years old and must be reviewed. It 
is for this reason among others that this legislation is necessary.
<P>
	Furthermore, as a signatory to three international agreements on 
the illegal drug trade, Canada is obligated to the terms of the single 
convention on narcotic drugs of 1961, the 1971 convention on 
psychotropic substances and the relevant parts of the 1988 United 
Nations convention against illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and 
psychoactive substances.
<P>
	Consequently, the controlled drugs and substances bill is 
designed to achieve three prime objectives. First is to provide the 
government with the flexibility required to better control the 
import, production, export, distribution and use of controlled 
substances. Second is to provide the mechanisms needed to 
implement our obligations under international agreements. This 
relates to the restricted production or trade of internationally 
regulated substances destined for medical, scientific and/or 
industrial purposes. Third is to enhance the ability of the police and 
the courts to enforce our laws.
<P>
	The bill provides for the seizure and forfeiture of property used 
in offences involving controlled substances. It also allows for the 
restraint and forfeiture of fortified drug houses. The use of fortified 
drug houses for the purposes of drug trafficking is an increasing 
problem.
<P>
	The houses are generally family dwellings that have been 
modified for use as centres for drug trafficking. They are veritable 
fortresses of crime. The houses are fortified by adding steel doors, 
boarding up windows and adding cement walls. In some instances, 
trap doors are used to exchange money and drugs so that there is no 
contact between the trafficker and the purchaser. The purpose for 
building such houses is to delay or prevent entry by police. During 
the extra time it takes the police to gain entry, any evidence of drug 
dealing is destroyed.
<P>
	The existing Narcotic Control Act and the Food and Drugs Act 
do not effectively deal with emerging trends in drug abuse. We 
must be able to adapt to rapidly changing criminal activity. These 
trends see the appearance of new illicit or new designer drugs 
which can escape effective control under current law. Their 
methods, their tactics and their products are forever undergoing 
change. We must respond and quickly. We  need flexible legislation 
which 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15979"> 15979 </A></B>
<P>
allows those on the front lines of enforcement to adapt quickly to 
these new developments as they occur.
<P>
<B>(1525)</B>
<P>
	For example, one of the more recent developments in the drug 
underworld is the production and illicit sale of so-called designer 
drugs. Designer drugs are potent substances with chemical 
structures slightly different from substances presently controlled 
by the Food and Drugs Act and the Narcotic Control Act, 
substances such as stimulants, tranquillizers and pain killers. Yet 
these drugs affect abusers in similar ways and can lead to the same 
health and social problems produced by more conventional drugs. 
Much harm can result from the abuse of these drugs. Primary 
targets are often school age children.
<P>
	The manufacture and sale of the designer drugs can be a very 
profitable business. Under the current Food and Drugs Act and the 
Narcotic Control Act drugs must first be listed on a schedule to the 
act. This regulates the conditions for the sale of that particular 
substance in Canada.
<P>
	Only once a given substance is listed can it become an offence to 
sell it. To correct this deficiency the controlled drugs and 
substances bill proposes the inclusion of analogues to cover these 
substances. Analogues are non-listed substances that have highly 
similar chemical structures to those of listed substances. Under the 
proposed act new illicit drugs appearing on the street which fit this 
description will be covered automatically.
<P>
	The bill also permits the control of precursors. Precursors are 
chemical substances used to produce controlled substances. New 
provisions contained in the bill will enable authorities to regulate 
the import and export of these substances.
<P>
	Other sources of drugs sold on the street are substances intended 
for medical or scientific use. They may be stolen from a hospital, 
obtained through illegal prescriptions, secured by obtaining 
numerous prescriptions from different doctors for the same ailment 
or via a forged prescription.
<P>
	People who deal in diverted pharmaceutical drugs are collecting 
very large profits. This bill enhances present controls that deal with 
this issue. Under this bill the monitoring of the distribution of 
drugs will continue.
<P>
	We know there exists a criminal element which is using more 
and more sophisticated networks to illegally produce, sell, export 
and import controlled substances in Canada. These people buy 
property and consumer goods to further their criminal activities 
and bolster their personal wealth. As I see it such people should be 
prevented from retaining illegally obtained capital and goods.
<P>
	The bill before us today in tandem with the proceeds of crime 
legislation strikes at the heart of criminal enterprises. Together the 
legislation will enable the courts to strip criminals of profits and 
property illegally amassed through drug dealing. Traffickers will 
no longer be able to flaunt their Rolex watches, fancy cars and 
mansions, flashy boats and planes, and rightfully so.
<P>
	Trends in illegal production, distribution and use of controlled 
substances change frequently and quickly. This bill is designed to 
deal with current problems and to anticipate future needs. This bill 
proposes a significant strengthening of our current legislative 
framework.
<P>
	Nonetheless I believe this bill merits the support of all members 
on all sides of the House. Given what is at stake, I submit 
Canadians expect no less of us.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Bonnie Brown (Oakville-Milton, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
my pleasure today to speak on Bill C-7, the controlled drugs and 
substances bill. I would like to discuss for a few moments the 
rationale for this legislation, in effect why Canada needs this bill 
and why the government is appealing to members of this House to 
support it.
<P>
	The current situation the world faces regarding illicit drugs is 
unsettling. The problem of addiction and those who profit by 
addiction troubles the nation. It troubles my constituents and 
speaking as one who is elected to represent those same 
constituents, it troubles me. The bill is a major contribution to 
effective law enforcement and prosecution of offenders as it 
consolidates, enhances and modernizes current drug legislation.
<P>
<B>(1530)</B>
<P>
	It is true in many communities that there has been some decline 
in drug abuse among the general population, but there are also 
some distressing trends. Some abusers are taking much more 
potent drugs and the results are very harmful. Others are using 
drugs in very dangerous combinations.
<P>
	There has been continuing inclination by youngsters to adopt the 
dangerous practice of taking anabolic steroids to try to build up 
their bodies. Unfortunately, prompted by constant and uncritical 
coverage in the media, uninformed people have come to abuse the 
drug without thinking of the consequences and equally 
unfortunately dealers have responded to this new demand.
<P>
	Abuse has now spread to gymnasiums and high schools, putting 
at risk the health of young men and women. As is common in drug 
dealing, the anabolic steroids may be adulterated, raising the risk 
even higher.
<P>
	The bill is designed to provide the government with improved 
means to prosecute people who deal illegally in anabolic steroids. 
It furnishes a framework to target purveyors of poison, the drug 
dealers who are the instruments of destruction of too many young 
citizens.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15980"> 15980 </A></B>
<P>
	Despite a gradual decline in the abuse of most drugs, there are 
several alarming trends emerging on the horizon. Many drugs 
which are abused today are extremely potent with more potentially 
damaging consequences. Abusers are consuming drugs by much 
more dangerous means and they are using drugs in more 
dangerous combinations.
<P>
	There is a growing frustration among law enforcement officials, 
community leaders from across the nation and Canadians in 
general. They are calling on provincial governments and the 
Government of Canada to assign a higher priority to dealing with 
drug abuse and its costly impact. Demands are being made for 
more severe sentences, a streamlining of the judicial system and 
assignment of the proceeds of drug crimes to help finance 
education and enforcement programs.
<P>
	Court delays and complexities of administering the law have 
only helped to fuel the public's growing concern. Some law 
enforcement agencies have declared that the costs of enforcing the 
law against drug dealers have become high.
<P>
	The government recognizes that these concerns require 
deliberate and sustained action, including combating the evil of 
addiction on three fronts: education and prevention, treatment and 
rehabilitation, and enforcement and control.
<P>
	Bill C-7 corrects the deficiencies of existing drug control 
legislation. It encompasses all listed substances and declares them 
illegal for other than legitimate medical, scientific or industrial 
use.
<P>
	In conjunction with the proceeds of crime legislation adopted in 
1988 and proclaimed on January 1, 1989, the bill will empower the 
courts with the right to confiscate all property and capital 
accumulated as a result of or used in the commission of drug 
related crimes. This will provide police forces and the judiciary 
with the tools they need in a manner consistent with the charter of 
rights.
<P>
	With the bill Canada will fulfil its international obligations 
found under the 1961 single convention on narcotic drugs, the 1971 
convention of psychotropic substances and an international treaty 
governing the trade of illicit drugs.
<P>
	The proposed bill can become an effective instrument in 
enforcing the law and controlling the import, export, production, 
sale, distribution and possession of illegal drugs. The bill seeks to 
update, enhance and consolidate a section of the Food and Drug 
Act and the Narcotic Control Act, both passed long ago in the 
sixties.
<P>
	While the whims and wants of society have become more and 
more sophisticated since that time, unfortunately so has the 
network of drug producers and dealers.
<P>
<B>(1535 )</B>
<P>
	The bill is designed to correct certain anomalies and 
shortcomings in our current law. In so doing it will enable law 
enforcement agencies to deal more effectively with a cunning, 
determined and resourceful adversary, the dealer in illicit drugs.
<P>
	The new main provisions of the bill include controls on the 
import and export of precursor chemicals used by drug 
manufacturers. These chemicals include substances, usually not 
themselves psychoactive, which criminals can change easily into 
illicit drugs.
<P>
	The bill also provides for provisions to control the production, 
sale, distribution, import and export of androgenic-anabolic 
steroids; provisions to control the possession, production, 
distribution, sale, import and export of designer drugs developed 
by dealers for the purpose of evading current laws; provisions to 
search, seize and have forfeited property used or intended for the 
purpose of committing drug offences, also known as offence 
related property including fortified drug houses.
<P>
	The bill also includes a complete scheme for obtaining search 
and seizure warrants; the expansion of offences concepts relating to 
trafficking and production; the enhancement of control over 
disposal of controlled substances including forfeiture; new 
provisions to control the possession, production, distribution, sale, 
import and export of designer drugs; provisions which will 
facilitate Canada's commitments under the international 
conventions; and treatment by the courts of drug dealing in and 
around schools and other public places frequented by children and 
dealing drugs to minors as aggravating factors at the time of 
sentencing.
<P>
	The principal purposes of the bill are to provide one 
comprehensive act for the drug control policy of the government 
and to provide for the enforcement and control aspects of Canada's 
drug strategy.
<P>
	I will review briefly the seven principal parts of the bill as well 
as the introduction. Part I sets out the offences and punishment 
commensurate with breaking the proposed new law. The particular 
offences may include possession, trafficking, importing and 
exporting, production, possession of property obtained as a result 
of certain offences, and the laundering of proceeds obtained as a 
result of certain offences.
<P>
	Part I also sets out specific aggravating factors to be considered 
by the court at the time of sentencing. These are directed 
particularly at drug dealers who target children, those who use 
weapons and violence, as well as those who have previous drug 
related convictions. This part also included a purpose clause 
dealing with sentences and, more particular, encouraging 
rehabilitation and treatment in appropriate circumstances.
<P>
	Part II deals with enforcement of the proposed act by police. 
This includes provisions relating to search, seizure  and detention 
of property or illegal substances, forfeiture of offence related 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15981"> 15981 </A></B>
<P>
property, as well as a complete scheme for protecting innocent 
third party rights over such property and forfeiture of proceeds of 
drug related crimes.
<P>
	Part III outlines procedures for disposal of controlled 
substances. Part IV covers administration and compliance.
<P>
	There are seven parts to the bill and its most important provision 
is that it moves Canada 30 years in time from the sixties to the 
nineties. It codifies and empowers police while at the same time it 
protects citizens. It gives us a Controlled Drugs and Substances Act 
that has merit and is enforceable.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Notice was given to another Speaker and I was 
just given a paper indicating that the member for Oakville-Milton 
is splitting her time with the hon. Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Prime Minister. The parliamentary secretary has approximately 9.5 
minutes.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Jean Augustine (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime 
Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak on Bill C-7, a bill in 
which many in Etobicoke-Lakeshore have an interest. I am 
talking about individuals who work in the areas of education, 
prevention, rehabilitation, treatment, enforcement and control. 
Those individuals are very interested in the general types of control 
substances outlined in Bill C-7.
<P>
<B>(1540)</B>
<P>
	Narcotics are covered under the Narcotic Control Act, as well as 
some from the 1961 single convention. Examples of drugs in this 
group are cocaine, opium, codeine, morphine and marijuana. 
Controlled drugs, as defined under the Food and Drugs Act, are 
stimulants such as amphetamines and sedatives such as barbituric 
acid. Restricted drugs come under the Food and Drugs Act, the 
so-called designer drugs, as well as the anabolic steroids, the 
precursors and the drugs from the 1971 convention on psychotropic 
substances.
<P>
	The majority of the substances are diverted from legitimate 
manufacturers and then illegally imported and sold. Until recently 
dealers have been able to sell the steroids at up to 20 times their 
prescription value with little risk of getting caught.
<P>
	The amendments to the Food and Drugs Act and its appended 
regulations contained in the bill have resulted in 42 
androgenic-anabolic steroids and their derivatives being classified 
as controlled drugs.
<P>
	In the grim world of the effects of illicit drugs on the lives of 
abusers can be severe. This is the crux of my argument. If the 
effects on the lives of the abusers can be severe, the penalties 
proposed for convicted dealers in the most dangerous drugs should 
be severe. Sentences for the most serious offences of trafficking, 
importing or exporting narcotics remain life imprisonment in the 
bill.
<P>
	We know that the specific provisions of the bill have been given 
the close scrutiny they deserve by a subcommittee on Bill C-7 of 
the Standing Committee on Health. I will comment on the work of 
that committee. Members heard from many national groups and 
associations representing a community of thousands of people, as 
well as officials from the departments of health and justice.
<P>
	I will quickly list some of the groups that made representations 
before the committee: the Canadian Medical Association, the 
Canadian Pharmaceutical Association, the Canadian Association of 
Chiefs of Police, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the 
Canadian Centre on Substance Abuse, the Department of Public 
Health, the city of Toronto, the Addiction Research Foundation, the 
Canadian Bar Association, the Canadian Foundation for Drug 
Policy, Lambton Families in Action for Drug Education, the 
Quebec Bar Association and the Criminal Lawyers Association, et 
cetera. Many groups appeared before the subcommittee.
<P>
	The subcommittee fully addressed each and every concern with 
the intent of improving the bill before us today. Several 
amendments were made at committee stage. Some particular issues 
of discussion resulted in amendment. The main amendments to Bill 
C-7 are the ones in which my constituents are interested.
<P>
	The amendments create a new offence for possession of 
marijuana and hashish involving certain quantities. They create a 
new offence for trafficking in marijuana and hashish in certain 
quantities. They provide for a purpose clause dealing with 
sentences and, more particular, they encourage rehabilitation and 
treatment in appropriate circumstances.
<P>
	The aggravated circumstances section has been expanded to 
cover in or near public places usually frequented by minors. This 
means that when an offender has been convicted in those 
circumstances a judge will have to give reasons for not imposing a 
jail term.
<P>
	The amendments will delete subsection 3(1), which was meant 
to cover non-scheduled substances having or presented as having 
the same effect as scheduled substances. There were some 
apprehensions among other things that it might cover herbal 
products.
<P>
	At the same time there is a limit on the ability of inspectors to 
examine the records so that they may not examine the records 
pertaining to the medical condition of patients.
<P>
<B>(1545 )</B>
<P>
	The bill clarifies those situations where a practitioner would be 
considered to be trafficking by providing that unless authorized by 
the regulations it will be illegal to sell a prescription to obtain a 
scheduled substance. Several things have been done and several 
amendments have been made to the original Bill C-7.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15982"> 15982 </A></B>
<P>
	I am confident that the current situation facing Canada today 
as it relates to drug abuse will prompt each member of this place 
to consider the facts in his or her own constituency, to reflect on 
the implications for the future, and to respond accordingly by 
supporting this bill.
<P>
	Through education and prevention we must continue to inform 
our young people, alerting them to the seductive snares of 
addiction. Through rehabilitation and treatment we must reach out 
and free those already trapped in the nightmare of dependence and 
desolation. Through enforcement and control we must strive to 
disinter the roots of those criminal enterprises that prey on the 
young and defenceless, those who otherwise risk being enticed into 
a never-ending cycle of addiction and deprivation.
<P>
	The bill gives the police new authority without giving them 
sweeping authority. It gives us greater power to prevent dangerous 
substances from entering the country. It gives us the tools to help 
ensure that justly prosecuted criminals do not benefit from their 
crimes.
<P>
	I submit that passage of the controlled drugs and substances bill 
is but one step toward a healthier and safer tomorrow. It is 
nonetheless a very important step in the right direction. I urge all 
members from all sides of this House to give this bill the scrutiny it 
richly deserves. Anything less would be an abdication of our 
responsibility.
<P>
	Let us pass this bill so the government can get on with its 
mandate to protect and promote the health of Canadians in a way 
consistent with what we have a right to expect. I call on everyone to 
support this.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
listened to some excellent presentations today on Bill C-7, an act 
respecting the control of certain drugs, their precursors, and other 
substances and to amend certain other acts and repeal the Narcotic 
Control Act in consequence thereof.
<P>
	On balance, I find myself in support of all the concerns raised. 
Members have pointed out some of the highlights of this legislation 
and its attractiveness. As the previous speaker has just mentioned, 
it is one step toward a healthier and safer tomorrow. On that there is 
no question.
<P>
	However, it does pose a more fundamental issue. Yes, this bill 
takes some steps to fight drug dealers in their pushing of illicit 
drugs and illicit substances of all kinds. Some time or other we 
have to have a debate that asks why so many people, particularly 
young people, are attracted by these illicit substances. What is it 
about their lives and the way they view the world that makes 
abusive substances such an attractive option? What are the causes 
of drug abuse? What are the causes that enable drug dealers and 
drug pushers to make such lucrative incomes in our country? That 
is the debate that is absent here.
<P>
	If we believe that passing legislation and getting tougher on drug 
dealers is going to solve this problem, we have to admit that it will 
not. Yes, indeed it is a step closer. Yes, we have to get tougher. I 
particularly like the section of the bill that refers to those 
traffickers and so on who are trafficking illicit substances in or near 
a school, on or near school grounds, or in or near any other public 
place usually frequented by persons under the age of 18 years.
<P>
	To say that those convicted who have been pushing their illicit 
drugs in and around schools will obviously receive a harsher 
sentence is an excellent start. However, I do have to say that until 
we as a Parliament start addressing the fundamental causes of drug 
abuse we are not going to solve the problem. I do not think we want 
to feel too good about ourselves, that passing this legislation is 
going to be a major step toward the elimination or reduction of the 
use of illicit drugs. As the previous speaker said, and I think very 
accurately, it is a small step in the right direction.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	I have two concerns about this legislation. One is the fact that 
once again we missed the opportunity to deal more effectively with 
marijuana and the use of marijuana. We all appreciate that this 
legislation began under the previous Mulroney administration and 
was brought forward by this administration with very few 
amendments at that point.
<P>
	At that point one of the hopes a lot of people had, particularly 
those involved with the court system and with the real world of 
illicit drugs and substances on our streets, was the possibility that 
marijuana would not be listed in the same penalty class as heroin 
and cocaine, that perhaps now was the time to follow the call from 
the police and so on in terms of the decriminalization of this 
substance. I am not saying the legalization; I am talking about the 
decriminalization.
<P>
	Alas, Bill C-7 continues the tradition of treating marijuana 
possession as a criminal offence. All of us have known probably on 
a personal basis friends and constituents who now possess criminal 
records for having had in their possession a small amount of 
marijuana. They are lumped into the same category in many cases 
with cocaine dealers and that problem element in our society. This 
was a missed opportunity.
<P>
	I want to make a few comments about the herbal remedies that 
were once a major part of this legislation. It is fair to say that 
increasingly Canadians are turning away from traditional medical 
systems and sources to more natural ways. The herbalists are 
coming into their element and coming into their time. People 
realize that many of the substances we use in the traditional 
pharmaceutical way are in fact derivatives of natural substances. 
Increasingly today physicians will say that many Canadians are 
taking advantage of natural herbs to solve some of their medical 
problems.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15983"> 15983 </A></B>
<P>
	The lobbying that went on by those involved in herbal medicine 
was quite astounding. I suspect all of us received numerous 
petitions and letters and visits from people who were concerned 
that this legislation in its previous state would have eliminated a 
whole set of possibilities that herbalists were using. I particularly 
refer as an example to Natural Way Herbs, headed up by Mr. Jim 
Strauss and his son, who led a tremendous campaign from the 
western part of Canada to point out to parliamentarians that many 
of the substances that were being eliminated under this legislation 
were in fact being used very successfully today to resolve people's 
medical problems.
<P>
	I can say that I am aware in a personal way of dozens and dozens 
of people who found the traditional, if you like, medical approach 
to their illnesses and physical problems were failing and yet found 
the solution in the use of natural herbs. I thank Mr. Jim Strauss and 
his son, seventh generation herbalists, for the contribution they 
make to their community and their patients. As a result of much of 
this positive lobbying, the herbal remedies continue to be regulated 
by the Food and Drugs Act. That was a good change in this 
legislation.
<P>
	I will leave it at that. It is appropriate that we get on with this 
legislation. For those two reasons, I will oppose the legislation. 
That is not to say that there are not a whole set of very positive 
elements in the legislation. I want to acknowledge that. But the 
hassle the natural herbalists experience today is partly as a result of 
lobbying by the traditional health care system and the international 
pharmaceutical companies. We have to be aware that there is a 
holistic approach to solving medical problems and that the natural 
way, the use of natural herbs, is one way. We ought to be taking 
more steps to encourage that, as opposed to hindering it.
<P>
<B>(1555 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. Hedy Fry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to respond briefly to the 
two very important points the hon. member just made. One had to 
do with herbal remedies. It was the last one, so I will deal with it 
first. I will be very quick.
<P>
	There never was in Bill C-7 anything that impacted on the use of 
herbal remedies in health food stores. That was disinformation and 
misinformation, whichever way we want to look at it. The sale of 
herbal remedies in health food stores is dealt with in parts I and II 
of the Food and Drugs Act. This bill only deals with parts III and 
IV, so it never was going to impact on it. We removed that whole 
section because of so much disinformation and so much concern. 
We thought if we struck that whole clause it would in fact allay 
these fears.
<P>
	The second point the hon. member made was regarding the cause 
of young people using drugs. That is such a multifactorial question. 
It deals with so many other issues. As a result of that and as as 
result of looking toward that kind of broader prevention and 
long-term strategy, the hon. member should know that a 
recommendation came out of subcommittee to the Minister of 
Health asking that Canada's complete drug strategy be reviewed. 
This is obviously going to deal with some of those issues.
<P>
	I would be distressed if I thought the hon. member would 
withhold voting on what is a very important and a very creative and 
progressive bill for two reasons that actually I hope I have 
answered to his satisfaction, one of which will be dealt with and the 
other of which never existed at all.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Riis:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the member's response to my 
latter issue and I accept what she says as being accurate. 
Disinformation was prevalent across the country and caused undue 
alarm to a lot people unnecessarily. I am pleased she has pointed 
out how that was dealt with. However, I do not accept quite so 
easily her latter comments that there has been a recommendation to 
have a broader approach to combating drug abuse in our country.
<P>
	Perhaps the record will show that this is the crucible where 
critical debate takes place in Canada. This is the centre where 
government and on occasion opposition members through 
opposition days and perhaps even private members' initiatives 
bring forward the issues we feel are important. By and large, we 
acknowledge that the government sets the agenda for most of what 
goes on in this House. But I do not recall in all my years in 
Parliament ever having a debate on the fundamental causes of 
substance abuse in our country. In other words, yes, debate takes 
place on specific pieces of legislation, but I am talking about the 
fundamental causes of drug abuse, like poor housing opportunities, 
poor educational opportunities. We all know the causes, as opposed 
to the symptoms.
<P>
	I appreciate what my hon. friend is saying. I do look forward to a 
time when we say to ourselves in this country that passing 
legislation, imposing stiffer sentences, and getting tough on drug 
dealers is only a small step to resolving the growing substance 
abuse in our country.
<P>
	I was disturbed recently when I was attending a number of junior 
high schools in the constituency of Kamloops. After the formal 
talks and presentations I arranged a lunch get-together with 
students who were interested in talking about issues. In every high 
school concerned students raised the matter of drug abuse in their 
schools. These were junior high schools, not senior high schools. 
Their views were that large percentages of the students were 
becoming regular drug users, and of course cigarette use was 
leading this initiative.
<P>
	As parliamentarians, all of us are concerned about this issue. Are 
we doing anything to come to grips with the fundamental causes of 
this growing use of drugs in our society? I think not. As a matter of 
fact, if I were going to  be truthful with myself today I would say 
that we are taking a number of steps that will enhance drug abuse in 
the future, will make life more miserable for more Canadians, 
tougher for more Canadians, and will abandon more young people 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15984"> 15984 </A></B>
<P>
as a result of policies that are being considered or brought forward 
in these times.
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	I appreciate the minister's intervention but perhaps in six months 
we will look at the record of Parliament and ask ourselves how 
much time we spent as elected representatives dealing with the 
fundamental causes of drug abuse in our country.
<P>
	That is the way we will measure whether we are taking this 
seriously.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
parliamentary secretary answered the first two items. I simply 
advise the member that under the three international conventions to 
which Canada is a party and to which Bill C-7 addresses the 
problem we have with, for instance, benzodiazepines, it is required 
that simple possession and use of marijuana remain a criminal 
offence. This is not an option for Canada in terms of opting out, as 
the member might suggest.
<P>
	We did not miss an opportunity. What we did was bring our 
legislation into line with the requirements of the international 
conventions to which Canada is a party.
<P>
	With regard to the attitude, I agree with the member. There is no 
question we have to look for every opportunity. Our national drug 
strategy spends 70 per cent of the moneys available to it on 
rehabilitation, treatment and prevention programs, most of which, 
as with regard to tobacco, directed at our young people, those most 
susceptible to these problems.
<P>
	I agree with the member that there should be a review. Our 
subcommittee of which I was the chair has recommended to the 
Standing Committee on Health and to the minister that a 
comprehensive review of Canada's drug policy and our overall 
drug strategy be conducted.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Riis:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the intervention by my hon. 
friend. I accept gratefully the comments he has made.
<P>
	A number of major initiatives have been taken as a result of our 
relatively comprehensive drug strategy. Let us also acknowledge 
that as a result of the transfer payment reductions now being 
imposed on the provinces, many of the programs they have in place 
will have to be curtailed or abandoned as a result.
<P>
	On one hand we might be expanding and on the other hand we 
are making it more difficult for provincial jurisdictions to continue 
their programs.
<P>
	I quote the Prime Minister when he was the justice minister in 
Pierre Trudeau's government in 1980, referring to marijuana 
decriminalization: ``It is our intention to bring about changes 
which will serve to  lessen the severity of penalties for possession 
of this substance''.
<P>
	Granted my friend has said what is true, but in 1980. This 
legislation does not do that. It continues with the same penalties we 
have had in the past.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Hedy Fry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am distressed to hear the hon. 
member make the statements he did because I agree in every way 
with what he has said with regard to young people and the use of 
drugs.
<P>
	As a family physician, I can tell members that nothing has been 
of greater concern and has caused me more pain over my 25 years 
of practice. Voting against this bill would serve neither of the hon. 
member's objectives. It will really be throwing the baby out with 
the bath water.
<P>
	See this bill as a scaffold. See the recommendation the 
committee made to review this strategy as an open door to make 
very important changes that will be necessary. This is a 
springboard. It may not be all that he does, but voting against the 
bill will certainly throw away the opportunity.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Riis:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have been here for a few years and I 
have heard the same comments time and again that in dealing with 
major problems facing our country this is a tiny baby step in the 
right direction.
<P>
	This issue inflicts so much pain for so many people, for so many 
families, that not to do whatever possible to combat this is perhaps 
questionable in terms of our work here.
<P>
	I do not take these slight steps in the right direction with much 
enthusiasm but I accept that what she is saying is accurate.
<P>
<B>(1605 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sue Barnes (London West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it gives 
me great pleasure to speak today on Bill C-7, the controlled drugs 
and substances act.
<P>
	Bill C-7 consolidates and supplements the Narcotics Control Act 
and parts III and IV of the Food and Drugs Act. It combines a 
regulatory scheme for drugs used in medicine with the criminal law 
regime for illicit substances.
<P>
	The bill is a reintroduction of Bill C-85, the Psychoactive 
Substance Control Act, introduced by the Conservative 
government in the previous Parliament. Bill C-85 died on the Order 
Paper in the last Parliament due to the election call. While it was 
reintroduced into this Parliament by the Minister of Health, aspects 
of it fall under the concerns of the Department of Justice and the 
Solicitor General of Canada.
<P>
	One main object of the bill as originally conceived was to bring 
our drug laws into conformity with provisions in certain 
international agreements we had signed. These agreements include 
the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15985"> 15985 </A></B>
<P>
Single Convention on Narcotic  Drugs, 1961, the Convention on 
Psychotropic Substances, 1971, and the relevant portions of the 
United Nations convention against illicit traffic in narcotic drugs 
and psychotropic substances, 1988.
<P>
	In keeping with the spirit of these instruments, Bill C-7 adopted 
an interdiction and criminalization approach to the production, 
traffic and the possession and use of illicit substances.
<P>
	The legislation was also supposed to cohere with Canada's drug 
strategy which had been unveiled in May 1987. The key object of 
the drug strategy is to reduce harm to individuals, families and 
communities caused by alcohol and other drugs. Canada's drug 
strategy was designed to place greater emphasis on reducing 
demand for illicit substances through prevention, education and 
drug treatment programs instead of relying solely on the 
interdiction efforts of police and penal institutions for the reduction 
of the supply of illicit drugs.
<P>
	In contrast to these methods, harm reduction seeks to reduce the 
harm caused by those who have a problem with substance abuse, 
including harm done to themselves, to their families and to other 
persons. It takes a public health approach to the problem of drug 
abuse rather than a moralistic, punitive one which views such abuse 
as criminal in and of itself.
<P>
	The bill passed second reading and was sent to a subcommittee 
of the Standing Committee of Health in April last year. As 
members will recall, the red book promised us that MPs would be 
given a greater role in drafting legislation through their work on 
House of Commons committees. The work done on Bill C-7 by the 
subcommittee chaired by the member for Mississauga South and 
the participation of other parliamentarians in making significant 
changes to the bill despite its having passed second reading is a 
perfect example of this commitment put into action.
<P>
	Officials from the departments of health and justice have 
explained that the bill was a consolidation of existing legislation 
and that the changes it contained were required to fulfil the 
international agreements we had signed. They emphasized that our 
international partners were exerting pressure on us to pass this 
legislation.
<P>
	As the subcommittee analyzed the bill more closely and listened 
to the arguments of witnesses a variety of issues began to emerge. 
Although there was not a single unanimous view, nonetheless 
members of each of the three parties expressed similar concerns 
about the substance of the bill, as did other parliamentarians 
including me.
<P>
	As many Liberals see it, Canada's approach to illegal drugs has 
required adjustment for some time. At different times the Liberal 
Party of Canada has in non-binding party resolutions advocated 
certain fundamental changes to our drug policies. To simply 
consolidate and thereby reaffirm existing approaches to  drugs 
would be to miss an important opportunity to effect modern 
rational policies on drugs.
<P>
	What were the concerns some had with the original Bill C-7? 
Bill C-7 is a complex piece of legislation. In my view the following 
were among the most important concerns. First, the bill lacked 
provisions for rehabilitation and treatment options for sentencing 
as an alternative to incarceration or fines. Second, the bill 
categorized illicit substances according to outdated schedules.
<P>
	Third, the bill reaffirmed lengthy maximum prison terms and 
increased the fines for the simple possession of cannabis in contrast 
to current court practices and evolved societal attitudes.
<P>
	Fourth, Bill C-7 included a deeming provision for illicit 
substances which seemed to us to contradict the fundamental legal 
principle that conduct subject to criminal sanction should be 
specified clearly in acts.
<P>
	Let us deal with these concerns. First, the bill lacked provisions 
for rehabilitation and treatment options for sentencing as an 
alternative to incarceration and fines. Many members felt Bill C-7, 
drafted under the lead of the Department of Health, did not 
squarely address the public health dimensions of the illicit drug 
problem. Among experts in public health and addiction research, 
the consensus has emerged in recent years which emphasizes a 
strategy called harm reduction. It emphasizes the broader reduction 
of harms to society caused by illegal drug use, as well as by 
inappropriate institutional responses to drug problems.
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	As the experts know, a harm reduction approach seeks to reduce 
the harm caused by those who have a problem with substance 
abuse, including harm done to themselves, to their families and to 
other persons. It evaluates strategies for dealing with illicit 
substances in part by situating them within the context of substance 
abuse generally, including that of alcohol and tobacco. A less 
ideological perspective on the problem begins with honest 
epidemiological comparisons to strategies for dealing with such 
legal and potentially very dangerous substances.
<P>
	Harm reduction initiatives include needle exchange programs, 
methadone treatment, counselling and rehabilitation efforts. 
Education efforts which stress the health risks associated with legal 
and illegal drug use are also important in the prevention of drug 
dependencies or addictions.
<P>
	I contrast this approach with what I would call prohibitionism. 
One treats the consumption of drugs as a moral evil where criminal 
sanction is seen as the only appropriate response. Rather than 
recognizing the users of illicit substances as endangering their 
health and taking appropriate steps to help them, the prohibitionist 
perspective would treat them solely as criminals who  require the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15986"> 15986 </A></B>
<P>
threat of criminal penalties and a criminal record to deter them 
from such behaviour.
<P>
	Were this an effective approach, the United States with its heavy 
emphasis on interdiction and punishment would be nearly drug free 
by now. As we know, the number of prisoners in jail for drug 
offences in that country continues to grow with little sign of any 
stemming of the insidious drug trade or the use of illegal drugs.
<P>
	Despite being part of Canada's drug strategy which emphasizes 
harm reduction as its primary goal, Bill C-7 in its original form did 
not mention or encourage judges to consider rehabilitation or 
treatment as alternatives to fines or incarceration for those 
convicted of possession of illicit substances. This was a concern 
now remedied.
<P>
	Criminal sanctions should not be our only tool for dealing with 
illicit drugs or for changing the habits of persons who are addicted 
or at risk of drug addiction. Prohibitionism toward drug users on its 
own arguably inflicts greater harms on individuals and families 
than the harms it purports to prevent. We should also bear in mind 
the far greater number of deaths and amounts of disease associated 
each year with the use of such legal drugs as tobacco and alcohol. 
In my opinion the sums and energies we expend in fighting the use 
of illicit drugs should be allocated with due regard for their overall 
impact on population health.
<P>
	Wisely and responsibly, the government has amended Bill C-7 to 
include a clause that addresses rehabilitation. Clause 11(1) 
declares: ``The fundamental purpose of any sentence for an offence 
arising under part I is to contribute to respect for law and the 
maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society, while encouraging 
rehabilitation and treatment in appropriate circumstances of 
offenders and acknowledging the harm done to victims and to the 
community''.
<P>
	The second concern I raised was that the bill categorized illicit 
substances according to outdated schedules. No one would dispute 
our drug policy must be reflective of current scientific knowledge. 
The parliamentary committee repeatedly stressed the schedules 
proposed in Bill C-7 are outdated. This was put forward by 
witnesses. While they are housed in the 1971 UN convention, their 
arrangement derives from public policies of the 1920s when policy 
makers knew relatively little science about the nature, the effects 
and the potential for societal harm posed by these drugs.
<P>
	The most serious example of the lack of pharmacology reflected 
in the schedules was the placement of cannabis in the schedule I of 
the UN convention. Schedule I is supposed to be reserved for the 
most socially harmful drugs such as morphine, heroin and opium.
<P>
	Heavy regular use of cannabis can certainly sap motivation and 
affect short term memory. Many will contend that while it may be 
carcinogenic, the risks of  the light use of cannabis do not appear to 
be significantly worse than those associated with moderate use of 
legal substances like alcohol. While we have heard calls from some 
for decriminalization, in my opinion dependency on marijuana 
should be strongly discouraged. Nonetheless, the drug schedules 
used in Canada should reflect the best scientific knowledge we 
possess. We should not be obligated to accept outdated schedules.
<P>
	In response to the concerns raised, the bill has been amended to 
incorporate an additional schedule, I(i), which deals exclusively 
with cannabis and its derivatives. Read together with the new 
penalty provisions which I shall discuss next, this amendment takes 
cannabis out of the company of far more deleterious drugs like 
heroin and cocaine while keeping it within the realm of the 
Criminal Code. In a minute I will also discuss the international 
schedules and our response to that issue.
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	The third concern with the original Bill C-7 was it reaffirmed 
maximum prison terms and increased the fines for the simple 
possession of cannabis, in contrast to current court practices and 
involved societal attitudes.
<P>
	Should pot smokers have the threat of a lengthy jail term 
hanging over their heads? Is this the best way to discourage use? 
Does it make Canada safer? Does it make it healthier?
<P>
	As originally drafted, Bill C-7 retained a maximum penalty of 
seven years for simple possession of cannabis. It doubled the fine 
for a first offence and more than doubled it for a second offence. 
These maximum penalties contrasted with what is generally now 
meted out by Canadian courts for a first time offence, which is 
usually a small fine and sometimes an absolute discharge.
<P>
	It is estimated that we charge over 40,000 people a year with 
simple possession of cannabis, a costly burden on the court and the 
police systems. This represents approximately 3 per cent of the 
estimated over one million regular cannabis users in Canada.
<P>
	Further, while 3 per cent of those charged will face incarceration, 
over half a million Canadians have criminal records because of 
cannabis convictions. These people can apply for pardons in due 
course, since the convictions that they have can be a serious 
hindrance for employability and for travel. Penalties tend to vary 
with different police officers, the judges, the regions of the country 
and the socioeconomic status of the accused. Would that it were not 
so, but it is true.
<P>
	In many communities across Canada, the courts, the legal 
profession, the police on the beat and the average person do not 
appear to view cannabis possession as meriting the severe penalties 
set out for it in existing law. Reaffirming these penalties would 
effectively express our legislator's faith in the existing penalty 
structure. What signals should such reaffirmations send to our 
courts? When law lags behind court practices and societal  attitudes 
<P>

<B><A NAME="15987"> 15987 </A></B>
<P>
and such laws come up for review, the laws must be adjusted, not 
reaffirmed.
<P>
	Penalties for offences under the act should be proportionate to 
the social and personal harm they entail. In keeping with this 
principle, the bill has been amended to incorporate a new schedule 
which establishes threshold amounts of cannabis for the offence of 
simple possession. Persons charged with possession of lesser 
amounts will be subject only to summary conviction proceedings, 
with a correspondingly lower range of penalties. This is still a 
criminal conviction and I stress this. However, in those cases 
involving the lesser amounts with simple possession charges, there 
will not be fingerprinting, there will not be photography or entering 
into a CPIC system for tracing purposes.
<P>
	By reducing penalties and recommending treatment and 
rehabilitation alternatives in Bill C-7, we send a clear signal to the 
courts encouraging them to pursue the available harm reduction 
avenues.
<P>
	The fourth concern I originally mentioned, that the bill as 
originally drafted included a deeming provision for illicit 
substances which appears to contradict the fundamental legal 
principle that conduct subject to criminal sanction should be 
specified clearly in acts.
<P>
	The deeming provision in Bill C-7 allowed new, previously 
unscheduled substances to be deemed by regulators to belong to a 
particular schedule and the attached penalty provisions to come 
into force at that point. The bill would have extended a definition of 
controlled substances and their analogues beyond drugs cited in the 
schedules, to such drugs as were deemed by regulators to have an 
effect substantially similar to, or greater than, schedule substances.
<P>
	Using this provision, the government would thus have been able 
to adopt regulations to control, govern and limit the use of as yet 
undesignated substances. This would be a significant departure 
from current provisions of the Narcotic Control Act and the Food 
and Drugs Act, the offences and associated punishments set out in 
these acts would apply only to such drugs as are specifically cited 
in the attached schedules. The purpose of this provision would be 
to allow regulators to respond quickly to the introduction of new 
so-called look alike drugs on our streets.
<P>
	While this purpose is laudable, it has yet to be shown that this 
problem of undesignated drugs is out of control and in guarding 
against it, we must be careful not to trample on other fundamental 
legal principles. Citizens must know what the law is beforehand, so 
that they can govern their behaviour accordingly. If something is 
illegal, then there must be a law saying so unambiguously. To 
declare <I>x</I> a crime after the fact is unacceptable.
<P>
	Further, many consumers and vendors of natural health remedies 
expressed concern that this provision  could allow regulators to 
declare these products included in restricted or banned schedules. 
This provision, in fact, only dealt with parts III and IV of the Food 
and Drugs Act and herbs have historically been covered by parts I 
and II. Accordingly, this provision has been deleted now as the 
amended act Bill C-7 by the government.
<P>
<B>(1620 )</B>
<P>
	I have dwelt at some length on the substantial improvements that 
members were able to bring to this bill after second reading.
<P>
	Most of my remarks have concerned the demand side of the drug 
equation. There is also the supply side to consider. Bill C-7 
introduces three important measures to combat drug trafficking. 
First, it includes a provision whereby judges are required to take 
aggravating factors into account when sentencing. Written reasons 
will now be required of a judge who fails to impose a prison term in 
the presence of any one of a list of aggravating factors.
<P>
	The court will be required to regard as aggravating factors: first, 
use of a weapon or use of threat of violence; second, trafficking on 
school grounds or to a minor or in or near public places frequented 
by minors; third, any previous convictions of a drug offence and 
fourth, using the services of a minor in the perpetration of a 
designated substance offence. It is anticipated and hoped these 
provisions will deter drug dealers from using weapons, threatening 
violence, selling to young people or recruiting their services.
<P>
	Second, schedule V in Bill C-7 introduces the notion of 
precursor substances, adding them to the list of controlled 
substances. This innovation keeps us in line with our international 
obligations under the single convention on narcotic drugs, 1961 
and the 1988 Vienna convention.
<P>
	Precursors do not by themselves produce any psychotropics or 
psychoactive effect but can be converted or used to produce 
designer drugs, look alike drugs or scheduled substances. 
Regulations enacted to control the import and export of precursors 
would attempt thereby to thwart the production of psychoactive 
substances in Canada and elsewhere. Canada has become a conduit 
for these and we owe it to our international partners to put a stop to 
this.
<P>
	Finally, Bill C-7 allows police to use reverse sting measures, that 
is selling quantities of drugs to dealers for the sake of making 
arrests. Under the regulations of the Narcotic Control Act police 
officers have been permitted to possess drugs as part of their 
undercover work but without legislative authority to sell. Quite 
reasonably they wish to have clarified that they are so permitted by 
including a clause exempting them from the criminal provisions of 
the new act. That has been done.
<P>
	Legislation is an evolutionary process as it should be. I believe 
that Bill C-7, as amended, has come a long way. The subcommittee 
has also recommended that a  comprehensive drug policy review be 
undertaken by a parliamentary committee. Further, there has also 
been a recommendation that a task force of experts be established 
to examine and redefine the criteria for the the scheduling of drugs. 
Thus Canada could be a leading force in the modernization of 
international drug scheduling.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="15988"> 15988 </A></B>
<P>
	Although I admit to not being an expert in these matters, I do 
know that it is the time to look forward to a drug policy appropriate 
to the 21st century, one that incorporates criminal law, 
enforcement, public health and modern societal attitudes.
<P>
	I publicly commend our ministers, the subcommittee members 
and our colleagues in the House of all parties in the development of 
the bill as deliberated today and I will support it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Reg Alcock (Winnipeg South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
listening to the remarks of the member for London West we see the 
excellence that is brought to the work of this Chamber.
<P>
	I want to speak very briefly on the process rather than the 
substance of this bill. For me the bill personifies and represents 
everything that is good about what we said we would do when we 
came to this House.
<P>
	The very low number it has, Bill C-7, should indicate to 
members that a considerable amount of time has elapsed between 
the time this bill was introduced and today. The reason for that is 
quite simple. We said when we campaigned in the election in 1993 
that we would introduce processes that allowed backbench 
members to get involved in a hands on way with the drafting of 
important legislation, which is exactly what happened with this 
bill.
<P>
	The members for Vancouver East, Beaches-Woodbine, 
Oakville-Milton, Fredericton-York-Sunbury, London West, 
Etobicoke-Lakeshore, Saint-Denis, Lachine-Lac Saint-Louis 
and many others spent hundreds of hours arguing through the 
articles of this bill. They were concerned. This bill is a holdover 
from the previous government. As many members have said, when 
they first heard the testimony they thought something was wrong, 
that the bill did not meet the test that we campaigned on.
<P>
	Members of this House worked exceptionally hard with the full 
support of three ministers, the Minister of Justice, the Solicitor 
General of Canada and the Minister of Health. They struggled to 
improve the bill and have it reflect the principles and the values 
which our party brings to this House.
<P>
	In so doing, we received tremendous support from staff in the 
various ministries. I want to single out an individual, Mr. Paul 
Genest, from our research bureau who put in all of those hours with 
each of these members as they thought through, argued through and 
worried about the details. It is not easy being a backbencher and  
approaching legislation in the face of a cadre of experts, lobbyists 
and in this case people from other countries who come in and say 
that the legislation must be written in a particular way to meet their 
particular needs. It took a long time. It took much thought. It took 
very hard work.
<P>
	I believe we have produced legislation that will, as the member 
for London West has suggested, put Canada in the forefront of 
leading the war on drugs from a perspective of harm reduction and 
not simply following the U.S. model that was established earlier in 
the eighties under Ronald Reagan.
<P>
	This whole process has been an exercise in excellence and one in 
which our caucus should be very proud. I want to thank those 
members on the staff and in this caucus who worked so hard to do 
what we said we would do when we came here and that is allow 
every member of this House a hand in drafting important 
legislation.
