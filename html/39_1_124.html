      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have lobbied successive governments for over 30 years to achieve some basic fairness for their members.

    </p><a name="Para506470"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It makes no sense for trades persons to be out of work in one area of the country while another region suffers from temporary skilled labour shortages simply because the cost of travelling is too high.

    </p><a name="Para506480"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the budget does little for average Canadians. It offers much less than claimed and much less than meets the eye. Indeed, never has a finance minister done so little with so much.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506481"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the government has no plan to build a better Canada for ourselves and future generations of Canadians. Instead of doing what is best for Canada and Canadians, the government has done exclusively what is best for the Conservative Party in full re-election mode.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506482"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a shotgun budget. It is as if the finance minister shut his eyes, held a shotgun into the air, pulled the trigger, and hoped that he hit as many targets as possible. It is an unfocused budget. It is a directionless budget.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506483"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only time the Conservative government has engaged in broad based tax changes it moved in the wrong direction. </div>
    </p><a name="Para506484"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In budget 2006, the government increased the income tax rate on the first $35,000 of income from 15% to 15.5%. One of the biggest disappointments of the budget is that despite its enormous surpluses, the government saw fit to maintain that higher income tax rate.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John Williamson, president of the Canadian Taxpayers Federation, and traditionally not a great friend of Liberals, put the point as follows, and I quote: “The fellow working the line or anyone with a salary income and no children will receive no tax relief.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that the government offered a new child tax credit worth a maximum of $310 per child. It turns out that the cost of this tax credit, at $1.4 billion per year, is almost exactly equal to the cost of the income tax hike that the minister left intact. We can say that these two measures cancel each other out.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506490"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only other major tax measure was the working income tax credit. It is a program to put money into the pockets of the working poor and help them climb the welfare wall. This is an excellent measure that was borrowed from the previous government, albeit in watered down form.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506491"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, we always supported this program. We introduced it, but the government watered it down. Indeed, the government's maximum benefit for a family is $500 a year. I am not sure that is enough to scale the welfare wall, but at least it is in the right direction.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506492"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other than that, the budget contains a hodgepodge of small targeted tax measures amounting to $700 million, or less than $50 per taxpayer per year.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506493"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My problem with the tax relief for ordinary Canadians is twofold: it is small potatoes and it continues in this government's tradition of narrowly based, politically motivated tax credits, rather than tax relief for all.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506494"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite its attempts to appear centrist, even liberal, the government's meanspirited ideology revealed itself in who it decided not to help. There is no direct assistance for undergraduate students. Sure, the budget has some money for Canada's top 4,000 graduate students, but the vast majority get nothing at all.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506495"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps most shameful of all, there is only a pittance for Canada's aboriginal people. As National Chief Phil Fontaine put it: “We're extremely disappointed, frustrated, because it's obvious that those that did well today are those that are considered important to this government. Those that are viewed as unimportant did badly, and we did badly.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506496"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no mention at all of the homeless or social housing. Critical for working families, in 2006 the Conservatives promised 125,000 new child care spaces over five years. Fourteen months into its mandate, Canadian families are realizing this promise was not worth the paper it was written on. There have been zero spaces created in the past year. Since this 2006 plan was a total flop, why should Canadians believe the government's so-called new strategy will work any better?</div>
    </p><a name="Para506497"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tax relief and other assistance for ordinary Canadians has been minimal in amount and highly selective in its direction. Phil Fontaine put it well: “Those who are potential Conservative voters do well. Others do badly”.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion, the main difference between the leaders of our two parties is simple. The Liberal leader would govern with an eye to the future by making what he felt to be the best choices for our country and current and future generations.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506499"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservative leader, on the other hand, governs according to his sole purpose: winning the next election. The budget makes this difference very clear, and it is because of this difference that the Liberals oppose this budget. When the Liberals came to power in 1993, they had to clean up a $42 billion deficit inherited from the Conservatives. The strategy they were forced to adopt to deal with that mess was not necessarily a vote-getting strategy, but it was in this country's best interest, and Canadians got on board.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506500"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberal strategy produced excellent results. Among other things, it paved the way for the budget surpluses the Conservatives inherited when they came to power in 2006. Armed with the biggest budget surpluses a new government had ever had at its disposal in Canada's history, the Conservatives had a golden opportunity to create a new national plan that would open a lot of doors for this country, a plan that would look nothing like the one the Liberals implemented when there were huge deficits, a plan that would give Canada plenty of momentum for the 21st century, a plan focused on creating on a stronger, more competitive economy, a more just society and a healthier planet.</div>

Two days ago the finance minister declared, “We are going to resolve once and for all this continuing problem we have had, this bickering between governments in Canada about fiscal imbalance”. Only yesterday he said, “The long, tiring, unproductive era of bickering between the provincial and federal governments is over”. Well, not quite.</div>

How does he justify that? Will he apologize to Canadians for that mismanagement?</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The biggest fiscal imbalance in this country's history was the $42 billion deficit that the Liberals inherited from the Conservatives back in 1993. How dare the member speak of fiscal imbalance when she is a member of the party that bequeathed to us a $42 billion deficit, which caused <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> to say that Canada was heading for third world status. The Liberals, as a consequence of that huge inherited fiscal imbalance, took many years to clean up that mess, to restore Canada's credit rating from a downgraded level that had been achieved by the Conservatives to AAA, and to leave the Conservative government when it assumed office in the strongest fiscal condition of any new government in the history of this country.</div>

    </p><a name="Para506556"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I can say is that it was a really devastating and stupid decision. When we were in government doing expenditure review, the bureaucracy presented us with that same option. We said no because it would have an extraordinarily negative effect on tourism to the extent that the money the government would lose by tourists not coming to Canada and generating tax revenue would be greater than the money saved by cutting the program. </div>
    </p><a name="Para506557"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe Canada is the only OECD country that does not have such a program. It puts us at an extraordinary disadvantage in the tourism industry. It is not as if that is the only blow to the tourism industry caused by the government. Because it has spared no opportunity to poke China in the eye, the Chinese, according to the media, are refusing to return our phone calls in terms of negotiating a tourism agreement which would see tens of thousands of Chinese tourists come to Canada. I do not know how many, but the Chinese typically do things in large numbers.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506558"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is a double blow to the tourism industry dealt by the government.

    </p><a name="Para506574"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since that date, we in the Bloc Québécois, with the Parti Québécois government of the time and the entire National Assembly of Quebec, have fought hard to achieve progress on this issue, one that is fundamental for Quebec.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506575"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yesterday, for the first time, by proposing a first step toward resolving it, the federal government has supported recognition of the fiscal imbalance by taking concrete action.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506576"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the unequivocal proof that a strong Bloc Québécois presence in Ottawa pays off for Quebec. This is especially true when there is a minority government. It also illustrates the difference between the Bloc and the other federal parties. </div>
    </p><a name="Para506577"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the Liberals and Conservatives fight over who will take power in Ottawa, the Bloc is fighting to get powers back for Quebec. That is what makes all the difference. This is not an easy job; it has taken us five years to get the first step—and this is just the first step—toward a resolution.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506578"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This first step toward a resolution is why we are going to vote for the budget. We are going to do this because Quebeckers are the ones who will benefit from the progress made, and they have already been waiting a long time for it. As usual, we are going to be responsible and pragmatic.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506579"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reality, however, demands that we say that there is still a long way to go to eliminate the fiscal imbalance. </div>
    </p><a name="Para506580"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The government and the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister </A>have not honoured their commitment. </div>
    </p><a name="Para506581"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the senator and <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78776,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78776&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Public Works and Government Services</A> said on Sunday that the fiscal imbalance was going to be resolved once and for all, he was trying to deceive the public and his allies, Mario Dumont and Jean Charest. </div>
    </p><a name="Para506582"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he said in his speech that the case had been heard and it was over, the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78777,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78777&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">finance minister</A> was deluding himself. He has shown himself to be completely disconnected from the reality of Quebec and the reality of the facts. He was in fact immediately contradicted, not only by André Boisclair, but also by Jean Charest and Mario Dumont. </div>
    </p><a name="Para506583"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are therefore not going to give up the fight. We sovereignists will never give up. We are going to continue our work to have the transfers for post-secondary education increased. We are going to continue to call for an equalization formula that takes 100% of natural resources into account, that is, all natural resources. </div>
    </p><a name="Para506584"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most importantly, we are going to continue to fight for the essential thing, a fiscal transfer. Yesterday, on that essential point, no concrete progress was achieved. </div>
    </p><a name="Para506585"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fight against the fiscal imbalance has been led by sovereignists. In 1977, René Lévesque was the last premier of Quebec to get a fiscal transfer. Lucien Bouchard fought at every opportunity to restore transfers to Quebec after Jean Chrétien's Liberals slashed them in the 1990s. It was Bernard Landry who created the commission on fiscal imbalance and who was successful in creating a very strong consensus on this issue in Quebec, but also in Canada. Here in Ottawa, were it not for the Bloc Québécois, the fiscal imbalance would not even be an issue.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506586"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have made this an issue and we are very proud of this. Some people might be surprised at sovereignists working so hard to solve problems that are created by Canadian federalism, but there is nothing surprising about it. Quebec sovereignists believe that what is good for Quebec is good for the sovereignist plan. Sovereignists do not believe that the worse things are, the better it is. We act responsibly, in the best interests of Quebeckers. </div>
    </p><a name="Para506587"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is nothing surprising about this, because eliminating the fiscal imbalance means giving Quebec its freedom. Because the only real, lasting solution to the fiscal imbalance is a fiscal transfer of the GST and tax points. What Quebec wants is its own revenues.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1050"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1050"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1055"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1045"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1050">(1050)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para506588"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yesterday, we were only paroled with conditions. Yesterday, the government only granted conditional revenues to Quebec, subject to Ottawa’s goodwill. The past has taught us that Quebec is at the mercy of decisions made here. Everyone remembers the brutal cuts in transfer payments that took place in the 1990s, the cuts to equalization payments made since 2000, and the agreement on child care that was torn up by this government. No new independent source of revenue was granted to Quebec. </div>
    </p><a name="Para506589"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In choosing to present his budget in the middle of the Quebec election campaign, the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> of Canada decided to intervene and to influence the citizens of Quebec. We can not say strongly enough how callous and unacceptable it is for the Prime Minister to try to buy the votes of Quebeckers in this way. </div>
    </p><a name="Para506590"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Government members may think, in light of the remarks of Mr. Dumont and Mr. Charest, that Quebec has abandoned its demand for fiscal transfers. They are wrong. Because of the election, Mr. Charest kept a stony silence yesterday on the essential point: transfer of the GST and income tax points. He was trying to save face with six days left until the election. </div>
    </p><a name="Para506591"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, we should remember that when he was leader of the Conservative party, he never stopped saying—quite rightly—that the solution lies in the transfer of tax points. </div>
    </p><a name="Para506592"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the 2003 leaders’ debate, he swore, hand on heart, that in his heart, in his gut, in his mind, he was firmly convinced that the solution was the transfer of tax points. </div>
    </p><a name="Para506593"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That was still the case a few months ago. Yesterday, his silence on this question was painful. He folded his arms and kept silent for campaign reasons. In doing so, he no longer qualifies for the position of Premier of Quebec. </div>
    </p><a name="Para506594"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The behaviour of Mario Dumont is more troubling. Yesterday, he, too, was silent on the matter of fiscal transfers. That is extremely troubling for a sovereignist leader, because a transfer of the GST and tax points would translate into independent revenues for the Government of Quebec, which Mario Dumont refers to as own-source revenues. I am certain that Mr. Dumont would not contradict me on that point. </div>
    </p><a name="Para506595"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More troubling still, Mr. Dumont demonstrated a selective recall of history on the issue of federal spending power. He called for a re-opening of the Constitution to entrench limits on that power. </div>
    </p><a name="Para506596"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am very eager to hear the government’s and the Prime Minister’s answer to Mr. Dumont’s request. The demand in the Séguin report was very clear: counter the federal government’s spending power with an unconditional right to opt out with full compensation. That is our solution. </div>
    </p><a name="Para506597"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The government has refused to do so. I can understand how embarrassing this is for Mr. Dumont. It is sad to see these two leaders of Quebec parties backing down because the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> has cornered them. </div>
    </p><a name="Para506598"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we know, the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> wants to choose the questions reporters may ask. He wants to choose the judges and the immigration officials. Now he would like to choose the Premier of Quebec. I have news for him: it is Quebeckers who choose their premier. </div>
    </p><a name="Para506599"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have more news for him: on March 26, there will be a new Premier of Quebec, the only one who did not back down yesterday, the only one who did not give up, the leader of the Parti Québécois, André Boisclair. But he will not be alone. All of us in the Bloc Québécois will be there for Quebec. That is how Quebec wins: with sovereignists who stand up for it. </div>
    </p><a name="Para506600"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to finish by emphasizing that the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> did not keep his promise to eliminate the fiscal imbalance in the budget. He did not keep this promise, just as he broke his promise to offer Quebec a seat at UNESCO similar to the one it has in the Francophonie. Quebec does not have a seat at UNESCO; it can sit in and speak only when it agrees with Canada. When it does not, it is told to go away. That is not showing respect for Quebec. </div>
    </p><a name="Para506601"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the government’s Quebec members say that the fiscal imbalance has been eliminated, they are just showing once more that the interests they defend are their own and those of their government, not the interests of Quebec. </div>

It is time to do some real governing. Now is the time. There is a lot to do. The government needs to get back to work on the fiscal imbalance by proposing a tax transfer to Quebec and by increasing transfers for postsecondary education. It needs to re-balance the Canadian mission in Afghanistan. It needs to come up with an environmental policy based on polluter pays along with a territorial agreement and a carbon trading exchange in Montreal. </div>
    </p><a name="Para506603"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The government should also provide accessible employment insurance for workers and create an independent employment insurance fund. It should transfer moneys to Quebec and the provinces for social housing. It should institute an income-support plan for older workers to ease their way to a decent retirement. There is a lot to be done. We for our part will continue to provide solutions and to speak out responsibly every time and on every issue on Quebec’s behalf and with its interests alone in our hearts and minds. </div>

    </p><a name="Para506609"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, we always have to wait on a decision made by Ottawa before doing the books because there is no precise mechanism, such as income tax points or GST points, to ensure that Quebec has the autonomy of deciding its own priority with its own money. </div>
    </p><a name="Para506610"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are supporting the budget, it is because there is $3.2 billion on the table, but not on a permanent basis. We have to wait on a decision from the federal government. It could change. We have seen that in the past, but we are taking that money.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506611"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very hopeful that next Monday we will have a sovereignist government in power in Quebec, under André Boisclair. With that money, we will be facing the challenges of offering Quebeckers the services they deserve. We will be facing the huge challenges in health services and education. We will also be offering Quebec a real solution to stop the discussion about fiscal imbalance by making Quebec a sovereign country, and we will use that money to serve Quebec because it is our money.</div>

We are aware of them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506616"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Quebec will receive $3.2 billion as a response to the fiscal imbalance. Let me be clear: this money is not being allocated in a satisfactory manner, since there is no permanent mechanism such as a combination of tax points and GST points.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506617"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That being said, a sovereignist government in Quebec could use this $3.2 billion for social housing, narrowing the gap between the rich and poor, improving post-secondary education and improving health care.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506618"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course we will continue to fight on the issue of employment insurance.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506619"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem with the NDP is that in its view everything goes through Ottawa. That is where the problem lies. For example, as far as the fiscal imbalance is concerned, the NDP likes Quebec well enough, but not enough to say that 100% of natural resources should be included in the calculation because the NDP wants to protect its votes in Saskatchewan, and possibly in Newfoundland and Nova Scotia.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506620"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not have that problem. We do not have to establish our financial priorities based on all the Canadian provinces. We want out money, all our money. With this money we will be able to make Quebec a sovereign and prosperous country, where social justice will outshine the rest of Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506621"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we look at what the NDP has done in the provinces and what the PQ did when it was in power, there is no comparison. Saskatchewan does not even have anti-scab legislation, and the NDP was in power there for decades.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506622"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can be proud, as progressive people, to have a party such as the Parti Québécois, to have a party such as the Bloc Québécois and to one day very soon have a country like the country of Quebec.</div>

We know, after 28 years of service, that you have every right to make this decision and pursue other dreams, but it does leave us sad and wondering who will fill your big footsteps, who will serve as dean of the House in a way that commands the respect that you do, who will offer us the leadership you give to all of us in terms of political issues, spiritual matters and just sheer human compassion for everyone in our society.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506624"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We offer to you, Mr. Speaker, our sincere thank you, gratitude and appreciation for your years of service.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506625"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me start off this very important budget debate by indicating that I stand here on behalf of all of my colleagues in the New Democratic Party as proud Canadians determined to make a difference, to keep our country together, to pursue an agenda that ensures unity above all founded on the principles of human compassion and concern and to build a nation of sharing and caring to ensure that the principles of equality of opportunity and condition are spread and enveloped everywhere across the country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506626"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We stand very much today out of grave sadness and concern with the budget. We had hoped that the present administration would have learned from its first year in government, that it would have read the pulse of Canadians, that it would have found the real priorities of Canadians and reflected this in the budget. I know with the first budget Canadians were prepared to give the government leeway, to be somewhat patient in terms of results, but they are not prepared, after a whole year, to see such a wasted opportunity.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506627"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians, without question, are being left more and more on their own and are feeling less and less secure.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506628"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is interesting that 49% of Canadians believe they are just one or two missed paycheques away from poverty. It is an incredible statistic for a country as wealthy as Canada. Despite a growing economy and despite the fact that this is a land of wealth and possibilities, the gap between the rich and the rest of us is growing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506629"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point of the budget should have been to close that gap, to make life more fair and affordable for all Canadians. It should have dealt with the embarrassing situation of so many in this wealthy country living in absolute abject poverty and homelessness. It should have dealt with the fact that so many low and middle income Canadians are feeling a deep and profound sense of worry, fear and insecurity.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506630"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The average earnings of the richest 10% of Canada's families raising children is now running at 82 times that earned by the poorest 10% of Canada's families. This is up from only 31 times, 30 years ago. The after tax income gap has never been this high in at least 30 years and it has grown faster than ever since the late 1990s.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1110"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1110"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1115"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1105"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1110">(1110)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para506631"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look a little further. Only the richest 20% are making real gains from Canada's economic growth, with the majority of those gains concentrated in the top 10%. That means the vast majority of us, middle income and lower income Canadians, are being left out and left behind.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506632"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some interesting research done lately, the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives tells us that ordinary Canadians are aware of this widening gap and that 85% of us want to do something about it. Canadians want their government to take action to close the gap to keep Canada and Canadians together.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506633"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past decade when this gap was allowed to fester, widen and grow, we have had consecutive governments that have ignored this very fundamental issue. Whether we are talking about 10 years of Liberal governments or now a year and three months of Conservative government, the result is the same.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506634"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Governments have avoided the problem. They have closed their eyes to the realities around them, turned away from people in need and ignored the most vulnerable among us. They took the easy way out, passed legislation and brought in budgets that tinkered with the situation, dealt with the fringes of the issues and touched the edges of the situation, but they never came to grips with the real economic and social realities happening in this country. </div>
    </p><a name="Para506635"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Governments failed to realize that in fact we were on a path in this country that was contrary to everything we know about our history, contrary to what built this great land, what kept us together and what urged our pioneers to go through such hardship in order to build this land.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506636"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have ignored the fundamentals of cooperation and community, of compassion and concern, in order to let a few accumulate wealth and receive all the benefit. We have let governments cater to that sentiment. We have let governments build on this notion of survival of the fittest, this notion that perpetuates the idea that life is a jungle, that all we need to do is work hard and we will make it, and that everyone is given an equal chance.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506637"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That does not fit with the reality, does it? </div>
    </p><a name="Para506638"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to tell the House about a young man in my constituency, Jordan Scott, who recently wrote an article that has been acknowledged as an important essay and a contribution to the fabric of our community. He is 18 years old. He lives in my community, Winnipeg's north end. He lives in a community that is low income and primarily urban aboriginal, close to the heart of downtown Winnipeg.</div>

<td><small>--the residents of the North End are hard-working, upstanding citizens who, through no particular fault of their own, are marginalized because of race and ethnic background. Many of Winnipeg's urban Aboriginal people have moved here from Northern reserve communities, where unemployment reaches staggeringly high proportions in excess of 80%. Once here, they are unable to find jobs because of a lack of skills or education. Lack of work results in high poverty levels, which lead to frustration and despair. Often people turn to drugs and alcohol to escape the frustration in their lives. In turn, paying for these negative supports can and does lead some people to the criminal path, as the lack of work means of a lack of financial resources to pay for the bad habits they turn to as an escape. It is truly a vicious cycle, and once a person is caught up in it, it is very difficult to get out.</small></td>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can see what Jordan Scott is asking of government. He is not asking for a handout. He is not asking for government to give something to people who are down and out. He is asking for the means and the tools by which he and others can help themselves to be prosperous members of our community, to be contributing citizens in our society and to be responsible adults in a very complex world. He is asking government to take the scarce resources that we have by way of this budget and invest those resources in education, training, literacy, child care, counselling, and supports for youth at risk and single parent moms who are struggling to make a difference.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506652"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He will be very disappointed with yesterday's budget, because the government chose not to make those strategic investments that would actually make a difference. It chose instead to tinker around the edges, to scatter the money, and a lot of it, in a hundred different places, to sow the seeds over a vast territory but not on fertile ground. It chose not to concentrate that money in areas that would produce the biggest bang for the buck and reap the greatest rewards. </div>
    </p><a name="Para506653"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That should be the role of government. Is that not the job of government? To make a difference, to plant the seeds and to give money where it actually can produce other results? Is that not what we should be talking about here today? Should we not be talking about taking the money that is now going to corporations, $9 billion worth of it, started by the Liberal government, $9 billion in corporate tax cuts, and instead investing it in child care and education and housing?</div>
    </p><a name="Para506654"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for this budget, what everybody is asking us is this: how can we not support a budget that has so much money? Let me tell members how. We cannot support a budget that does not make a real difference in the lives of Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506655"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Conservatives can point to this tax-back policy after they have put all of the available flexibility and all of the surplus dollars against the debt, basically, without coming back to this place for any kind of input, which is something they demanded when in opposition. We remember how they belittled and belaboured the point about lowballing, a concern we shared. </div>
    </p><a name="Para506656"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact is that the Liberals continually lowballed the surplus and then, without due consideration for parliamentary process or checking with the people of this country, just let that money go against the debt. It was pretty galling to sit here and listen to the Liberal critic for finance talking about vision, long term planning and ideas and imagination when he was part of a government that for 10 years took every bit of flexibility and surplus and put it against the debt without checking to see what the priorities of Canadians were.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1120"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1120"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1125"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1115"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1120">(1120)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para506657"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today the Liberals talk about the short-sightedness of the government. The Liberals, over 10 years, took $80 billion in unanticipated surplus, which is beyond money that goes against the debt, I remind members, and put that against the debt. Even though it is raining in this country, they would not fix the roof. Even though people are suffering, they would not help Canadians to help themselves, not at all. </div>
    </p><a name="Para506658"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this budget, as we know, the gap is at its biggest when it comes to aboriginal people. I have talked about Jordan Scott and his pain at seeing a government that does not recognize what is staring it in the face: the obvious way to help people help themselves so they can reap all kinds of benefits down the road.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506659"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This budget is invisible when it comes to women. It is a perfect example of the government going forward one little step and then going back two. What did the Conservatives do? They took money from the women's program. They put a bit back. They added a little to it but nothing that would make up for what they did to destroy a program that actually advances the equality of women in a country that should be embarrassed by the fact that the average woman in this country makes $24,000 a year.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506660"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask them to tell me how that woman who is in the first tax bracket is going to get any of that money for the child tax credit. Is that woman going to get any of the supposed advantage from any of this tax-back policy? Nada. Nothing. No way. This budget does not address those who need it most.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506661"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That money, that $310 per person that goes to all families, including those making a million dollars, could have been pooled and invested in a program that would actually create real child care spaces for all those working parents who are desperately trying to find secure, quality places for their children.</div>

    </p><a name="Para506663"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:</b> That is something we are still focusing on after 10 years of broken promises by the Liberals and now they are hollering because they brought it in at the last dying days of their government and are blaming this on us.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506664"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am sick and tired of Liberals blaming other people for their mistakes. It is time they recognized that I am not their mother. I am not responsible for their deficiencies. They ought to recognize the fact that they caused this problem, and they have a great deal of explaining to do to Canadians for breaking a promise four elections in a row.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506665"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other invisible group in this budget is obviously people with disabilities. The minister has brought in a tax credit. We do not deny that a tax credit makes a bit of difference. The tax credit promised in this budget is a tiny step in the right direction, but the vast majority of people living with disabilities do not have that kind of income to invest in a plan to draw on at some time in the future. They are dealing with the here and now. There is nothing in this budget that provides any kind of national income support program, or even hints at it, to deal with the real issues facing people with disabilities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506666"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we are talking about new Canadians, again, this budget pretends to deal with it by setting up an office regarding foreign credentials, but does it deal with the prosperity gap between new Canadians and immigrants and refugees coming into this country, the gap that is growing between them and those who have been here for a considerable period of time? Or the gap between them and immigrants who came to this country 30 years ago when in fact the gap was much narrower?</div>
    </p><a name="Para506667"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Statistics Canada has released a study on the growing income gap between new immigrants and Canadian-born people. The report examined the financial situation of immigrant families, assessing their economic condition and the extent of their chronic low income and impact of changes in education and skills, and found in fact that low income rates among immigrants during the first year in Canada were “3.5 times higher than those of Canadian-born people”. There is a gap here that has to be addressed.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506668"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I look at my constituency, which is one of the most ethnically diverse in the country, and when I talk to the Punjabi community or the Filipino community and hear their frustrations at not being able to get jobs and decent incomes in the areas for which they have training, experience and commitment, it drives me crazy that after 13 years of Liberal and Conservative governments we still do not have a way to recognize their experience and their credentials and ensure that they have access to good paying jobs.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From start to finish, the budget does not address the prosperity gap. It does not build a nation founded on the fundamental principles that built this land: cooperation, compassion, caring and sharing. In fact, it is very heavy on rhetoric. It has a lot of ink about families and working people but when it comes to actual expenditures and budgetary measures, the prosperity gap widens.</div>

    </p><a name="Para506685"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to mention that I raised in the House the fact that the credit for bus passes, which only applied to monthly users and unfairly discriminated against those who purchased weekly bus passes, had to be changed and the government did that.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the child care front, it is still dismally addressed in this budget with $1 billion cut before our eyes.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we go through the budget we see nothing on housing. It has no housing strategy and no national transit strategy. It has nothing on employment insurance and does not establish a $10 minimum wage. It has no poverty reduction strategy. It has no plan to end student debt.

    </p><a name="Para506692"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The budget provides no significant new money for aboriginals. We see only one-quarter of the money we wanted for child care. We see no money for autism.

    </p><a name="Para506696"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of honesty, I want to touch on the child care issue to which the member spoke. The myth that those members have been spreading is that somehow their institutionalized version of child care would be free for every family in the country. This is nothing but a myth. I think they are being dishonest with Canadian families when they spread that myth.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506697"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What they are not telling Canadian families is that their form of child care will only apply and be made available to families who live within large and medium sized cities like Vancouver, Winnipeg, Toronto, Edmonton and Calgary. What about the families who live in The Pas in Manitoba, in Winkler, Manitoba, in Steinbach, Manitoba? The member knows very well that the institutionalized child care system that her party talks about will not be established in these smaller communities. They know it cannot be. Why are they not being honest? </div>
    </p><a name="Para506698"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our universal child care system provides $100 per month for every child under 6 years of age in all of Canada no matter where the family lives, whether it be in The Pas, in Winkler, in Cluculz Lake, British Columbia, Nazko, Wells, Barkerville, out in the Chilcotins or in Anahim Lake. Every family in this country, whether they live in a remote rural area or a downtown city area, receives the universal child care. Canadian families need that. They do not need some program that will only provide day care or child care to families who live in the city. </div>
    </p><a name="Para506699"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why does the member want to discriminate against rural families and not provide them with child care and not support the universal child care program of the Conservative government that addresses the needs of rural families everywhere in Canada?</div>

    </p><a name="Para506701"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, he should be clear that the New Democratic Party has not talked about providing free child care to everyone. We have talked about building a national child care program that provides high quality, accessible and affordable spaces and settings for children, and that includes spaces in remote communities in northern Canada, rural Manitoba, eastern fishing villages, the whole range.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506702"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member needs to be absolutely clear about how this works. In the case of a province like Manitoba, the money that comes from the federal government goes to non-profit community organizations that establish day cares that are run by parent boards. We are talking about child care spaces in urban settings, yes, in rural Manitoba, in co-ops, in workplaces, for shift workers, child care for special needs, the whole range. We are not talking about institutionalized day care. We are talking about child care that is nurturing and ensures good care while parents work.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506703"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seventy per cent of working women with children under the age of 6 do not have access to those spaces and therefore make precarious, uncertain arrangements for their kids which has them worrying all the time about their kids' safety. They are under constant stress about juggling work and family responsibilities. </div>
    </p><a name="Para506704"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NDP's opposition to the budget comes with a determination to convince the government to have both a child care policy and family policy, not to take away from those people who choose to stay at home full time and who, yes, need to be acknowledged and supported, but at the same time to recognize the working parents with children who need to be cared for, loved, nourished and educated.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506705"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the NDP is asking is for the government to put back what it took out of the budget, the $1 billion that would have gone so far to create the kinds of settings and spaces that would meet the needs of children in Minnedosa, Winkler, The Pas, Winnipeg, in every city, town and village in this country.</div>

    </p><a name="Para506707"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very pleased to lead the debate on budget 2007. This is a historic budget. It puts us firmly on the road to achieve a stronger, safer, better Canada to which we all aspire.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506708"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Budget 2007 addresses the priorities of Canadians. It restores fiscal balance with the provinces and territories. It protects and preserves our environment. It reduces taxes for hard-working families. This budget is about helping our country achieve its full potential. This budget is also about the principles and beliefs that make us uniquely Canadian, principles and beliefs that this budget will help us to preserve and instill in our children and in the generations to follow.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506709"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last fall Canada's new government introduced advantage Canada, our long term economic plan to improve our country's economic prosperity and secure for all our citizens a quality of life second to none. Budget 2007 sets that plan in motion. The result is a strong Canada today and an even better tomorrow. It focuses on delivering positive practical and real results for Canadians and their families. </div>
    </p><a name="Para506710"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Advantage Canada commits to create five distinct advantages for Canada: a fiscal advantage, an infrastructure advantage, an entrepreneurial advantage, a knowledge advantage and a tax advantage. It is on these advantages that I wish to devote the bulk of my time today before turning briefly to other important parts of budget 2007. Budget 2007 proposes to take concrete action on all five advantages.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First is the fiscal advantage. Our goal is to create a strong foundation of good management on which to build sustainable prosperity. That means continuing to reduce debt, to do our part as the federal government to eliminate Canada's total government net debt in less than a generation. Budget 2007 will take us closer to this goal.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506712"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada's new government plans to reduce our national mortgage by $9.2 billion this fiscal year. Added to last year's debt reduction of $13.2 billion, that means a total reduction of $22.4 billion in the first two years alone under our government's watch.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506713"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This government means business about tackling Canada's debt. As a result, the federal debt to GDP ratio will fall to 30% by next year, 2008-09. We are firmly on target to reach our objective of 25% by 2012-13.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506714"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In advantage Canada we promise that because lower debt will mean lower interest payments, we will use interest savings to lower taxes for Canadians. We call this the tax back guarantee. Budget 2007 proposes to make the tax back guarantee the law of the land. It will also lead to some $1 billion per year in further personal income tax relief for Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506715"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Advantage Canada also pledges to achieve an infrastructure advantage for Canada. We will create a modern, world class infrastructure that facilitates a seamless flow of people, goods and services across our roads and bridges, through our ports and gateways and via our public transit. </div>
    </p><a name="Para506716"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Budget 2007 makes a historic investment of more than $16 billion over seven years in infrastructure. Including the funding provided earlier in budget 2006, federal support for infrastructure will be a total of $33 billion over that period. By any measure, that is a tremendous commitment. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1140"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1140"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1145"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1135"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1140">(1140)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para506717"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at some of what that investment will deliver. To help fund municipal priorities such as roads, public transit and water, budget 2007 will transfer $2 billion per year to municipalities from 2010-11 to 2013-14 by extending the gas tax fund. This is a total of $8 billion toward municipal infrastructure. In addition, budget 2007 allocates $6 billion to the new building Canada fund, investments in gateways, border crossings and public-private partnerships.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506718"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to the creation of an entrepreneurial advantage in Canada, budget 2007 takes action on several fronts to build a more competitive business environment, especially for small businesses. We will continue our efforts to reduce unnecessary regulation and red tape by significantly reducing the number of tax remittances small businesses must file each year.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506719"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will lower taxes to unlock business investment and open new market opportunities through a new global commerce strategy. We will work with the provinces and territories to eliminate interprovincial barriers and promote a freer flow of people and goods within Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506720"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creating a knowledge advantage is another key to our success as a nation. Canada's new government recognizes that our people are our greatest asset and it goes without saying that human capital is critical to a successful national economy. Accordingly, budget 2007 will help create a workforce that is the best educated, most skilled and most flexible in the world. It invests $1.3 billion to chart an ambitious new course for establishing scientific and technological leadership for Canada. It increases federal funding for post-secondary education by a full 40% and it invests $500 million a year in training.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506721"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For families saving for their children's education, budget 2007 makes registered education savings plans, RESPs, more attractive by eliminating the $4,000 limit on annual contributions. The budget also increases the lifetime RESP contribution limit from $42,000 to $50,000. The budget also increases the maximum Canada education savings grant annual amount from $400 to $500. That is our contribution to each family saving for their children's education. And there is more for families.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506722"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Families will also benefit through the actions in budget 2007 to create a tax advantage for Canada. As the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78777,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78777&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">finance minister</A> noted yesterday, Canadians pay too much tax.

    </p><a name="Para506723"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Budget 2007 proposes to reduce taxes for Canadian families and to make the tax rate on new business investment more internationally competitive. The working income tax benefit announced in budget 2007 will reward and strengthen incentives to work. More than 1.2 million low income Canadians will benefit from this measure.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506724"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Budget 2007 also proposes a new working families tax plan. This plan will end the marriage penalty, so-called, for single earner families. The budget proposes a new $2,000 child tax credit that will provide parents up to $310 in tax relief for each child under 18. More than three million Canadian families will benefit from this credit and 90% of those families will receive the maximum amount of relief.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506725"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over 80% of relief provided by the working income tax benefit and the working families tax plan will go to Canadians earning under $75,000. Some 230,000 low income Canadians will be removed from the tax rolls. That is in addition to the 655,000 low income Canadians removed from the tax rolls as a result of tax reductions in our 2006 budget. What this means is that many more low income Canadians will be better able to meet the needs of their families through this government's recognition of the challenges they face. </div>
    </p><a name="Para506726"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will enact the tax fairness plan we introduced last year to provide over $1 billion in additional tax savings for Canadian seniors by increasing the age credit amount and allowing pension income splitting.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506727"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the business side of the ledger, budget 2007 will reduce the tax rate on new business investment to encourage investment, job creation and assist Canadian businesses to compete globally.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manufacturing and processing businesses are a particular focus of budget 2007. They have faced difficulties of late given the strong Canadian dollar and rising challenges from international competition. To help them make the major investments needed to overcome these difficulties, budget 2007 proposes that they be provided with a special two year write-off for their capital investments and machinery and equipment from now until the end of 2008. We also propose to increase the capital cost allowance rate to 10% from 4% for buildings used in manufacturing and processing, and to 55% from 45% for computers. </div>
    </p><a name="Para506729"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will improve tax fairness by tightening the rules that apply to the foreign source business income of Canadian companies. </div>
    </p><a name="Para506730"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will also strengthen the Canada Revenue Agency's ability to deal with international tax evasion. We want a fair tax system for all Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506731"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Achieving these five advantages will make Canada a stronger country. However, we also need to make Canada safer. To that end, budget 2007 significantly enhances Canadians' security at home and ensures Canada plays an even more effective leadership role in world affairs in three key strategic areas: defence, public security and international assistance.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506732"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the area of defence spending for example, budget 2007 proposes to increase environmental allowances for men and women of the Canadian Forces who are serving Canada in army field units. It proposes to create several new operational stress injury clinics for members of the military and their families.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506733"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The budget also makes significant investments to ensure that veterans get better services, including through the establishment of a veterans ombudsman.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506734"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians want to live in safe and secure communities. Budget 2007 proposes important measures to help prevent crime and ensure public safety. Among other important investments, budget 2007 proposes to allot $64 million over two years to establish a new national anti-drug strategy with an emphasis on youth, prevention and treatment, and $14 million over two years to combat the criminal use of firearms.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506735"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Canadians, we take pride in our role of reducing global poverty and promoting international peace and security. Budget 2007 will increase the resources Canada's new government has already devoted to this international assistance. It starts with the establishment of a three point program to enhance the focus, efficiency and accountability of Canada's international assistance efforts.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506736"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, this year's budget confirms the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister's</A> announcement of $200 million in additional support for reconstruction and development in Afghanistan with the focus on new opportunities for women, on strengthened governance, enhanced security and combating illegal drugs. </div>
    </p><a name="Para506737"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The budget also invests an initial $115 million in the innovative advance market commitment led by Canada, Italy and the United Kingdom to create a pneumococcal vaccine that could save millions of lives in Africa and developing countries throughout the world.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506738"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A stronger Canada, a safer Canada will help us build a better Canada. Budget 2007 proposes to invest in the things that make Canada great and reflect the values and beliefs that define us as a nation. </div>
    </p><a name="Para506739"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the environment, Canadians want their government to ensure that we have a clean and healthy environment in which to raise their children. Budget 2007 takes action to preserve our country's natural beauty, clean our air and help reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506740"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A key initiative is the Canada ecotrust for clean air and climate change which will provide $1.5 billion to the provinces and territories for projects that result in real reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and air pollutants.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506741"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Budget 2007 provides a rebate of up to $2,000 per vehicle to encourage people to buy new fuel efficient vehicles. The budget also introduces a green levy for gas guzzlers. It provides $36 million over the next two years to help get older polluting vehicles off the road.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1150"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1150"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1155"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1145"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1150">(1150)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para506742"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians also want their governments to help members of our society who need it. That is where Canadian values shine through. </div>
    </p><a name="Para506743"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Budget 2007 focuses on initiatives to help and protect those Canadians who need it most. As I mentioned earlier, this includes the working income tax benefit of up to $1,000 per family or $500 for individuals to help people get over the welfare wall and strengthen incentives for obtaining and keeping a job. </div>
    </p><a name="Para506744"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact is, for a single mother struggling to get by, getting a job can mean losing 80¢ on the dollar through higher taxes and reduced benefits. We want to help people over the welfare wall and help them achieve the dignity and independence that comes with a job.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506745"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada's new government also recognizes the challenges faced by those raising a child with a severe disability. Budget 2007 introduces a new registered disability savings plan to help parents and others save for their child's future when they are no longer able to care for their child.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506746"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Canadians we are proud of our universal health care system and Canada's new government has committed to sustaining it. The Canada health transfer will increase by $1.2 billion this year to bring to $21.3 billion federal support of provincial and territorial delivery of health care as part of our ongoing commitment to the 10 year plan to strengthen health care.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506747"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Budget 2007 takes further action to strengthen and modernize the health care system: an investment of $400 million for Canada Health Infoway to support the development of electronic health records that will reduce the chance of medical errors resulting from incomplete information and up to $600 million for provinces and territories which have made commitments to implement wait time guarantees.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506748"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, fiscal balance has been the subject of much debate over the last while. Budget 2007 takes action to restore fiscal balance in Canada through a comprehensive and historic plan. </div>
    </p><a name="Para506749"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This plan also restores fiscal balance between taxpayers and government by cutting taxes and implementing our tax back guarantee so that the government only raises the revenues it needs to fulfill its responsibilities. It restores balance between governments by providing long term, equitable and predictable funding for shared priorities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506750"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This plan will renew and strengthen the equalization program. Payments to receiving provinces will grow to almost $12.8 billion in 2007-08, $1.5 billion higher than in 2006-07. It will also strengthen and renew the territorial formula financing program. </div>
    </p><a name="Para506751"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will deliver greater fairness through a commitment to equal per capita cash allocation for the Canada social transfer and the Canada health transfer, and increase federal funding to the provinces and territories for things that matter to Canadians, priorities such as post-secondary education, child care, infrastructure and the environment.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506752"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It provides long term, predictable funding for infrastructure with more than $16 billion in new funding over the next seven years. </div>
    </p><a name="Para506753"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will make governments more accountable by clarifying roles and responsibilities and respecting jurisdictions. It will strengthen our economic union by acting on the Advantage Canada plan.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506754"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, it builds a stronger federation in which all governments come together to help Canada reach its full potential. That is what budget 2007 is all about, making life better for Canadians and their families.</div>

I wish the Conservative government would support the alternative budget proposed by the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives that would provide the CBC with $20 million in start-up money and $22 million for annual operating expenses. This funding would go a long way to assist the CBC to be our national voice. Without this type of funding, the CBC is destroying its own infrastructure to survive. </div>

    </p><a name="Para506773"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The success that we have had in this is pointed out by the fact that we, in our first budget, took 655,000 low income Canadians completely off the tax roll. We have now taken another 230,000 Canadians off the tax roll in this budget. For those who were not paying taxes to begin with, who were the very lowest income people, we reduced the GST which will help them. So, our help for those who are most vulnerable, who need help the most, is very strong.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506774"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, I would point out that fixing the fiscal balance will now restore the provinces' ability to deliver services for the most vulnerable in our society, services that were gutted by the cuts that were made by the former Liberal government. Fixing the fiscal balance means more programs and stable funding for the programs on which the most vulnerable in our society in each of our provinces depend the most. </div>
    </p><a name="Para506775"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a budget that is very much about people, about supporting people, and about ensuring that our families can succeed and can meet their responsibilities in a way that helps all of society.</div>

    </p><a name="Para506784"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again this year I am pleased to speak to the Conservative budget. Last year I raised many concerns with the budget and I have the same concerns this year. This budget, once again, fails to provide an overarching vision for Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506785"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The budget fails to provide any measures for medium or long term sustainability for Canada. It seems to be a budget that is catering only to the partisan interests of the governing party for a federal election campaign, which Canadians do not want.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506786"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am familiar with the issues that the finance minister addresses in the budget. My background for over 20 years was in the financial services industry. I have sat at the kitchen and boardroom tables with families struggling to make ends meet and families looking to maximize their investments. This background and awareness gives me a unique perspective on the Conservative budget. </div>
    </p><a name="Para506787"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The budget does not really do much to help most Canadians in an effective way. This is certainly one budget that tries to be all things to all people and is nothing to anyone in the end.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506788"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I begin commenting on the budget today, I want to provide some context. Last year's budget increased taxes. Beginning in July, Canadians found that they were paying more in income tax because of the marginal tax rate increase and the basic personal exemption decrease. Not only do we find a budget that is high in spending, but we find taxes for individual working Canadians are still excessively high. This makes the finance minister's second budget a tax and spend budget. </div>
    </p><a name="Para506789"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of us were optimistic and hopeful that the Conservative tax increases would be rolled back and with very high income tax revenues and large surpluses, Canadians might even find their taxes lowered significantly. This did not happen. The tax relief that the minister pretended to deliver yesterday is very little when last year's increases are factored in.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506790"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first item I wish to address today is child care. It was with great fanfare that the government shelved the national child care program, which the previous Liberal government put in place with the provinces. Instead, Canadian families are receiving, after tax, less than $100 per child per month. On the news last night, a family in Ontario was profiled and the parents said that they were able to buy a few packs of diapers with that money. This is not good enough for Canadians. How does this help single parent families? How does this help families that are struggling to make ends meet?</div>
    </p><a name="Para506791"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government says that the budget is about families, but it has eliminated one of the best social programs in 50 years in terms of truly helping families. My daughter works part time at a child care centre. She witnesses first-hand the struggles families are facing and how they struggle to bear the great cost of child care.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506792"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seniors were certainly one of the groups that was looking for some help from the minister yesterday. I often hear from seniors in my riding who are concerned about the sustainability of public pension plans, which they depend on for making ends meet.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506793"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To be sure, some seniors will benefit from the measures in yesterday's budget, but let us remember that hundreds of thousands of single seniors, many of them women, will not benefit at all from the policies of the government. The Government of Canada's tax plan for seniors should be one that benefits all seniors equally.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506794"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Closely related, another matter that has greatly concerned seniors is the government's income trust decision of October 31. The decision to tax income trusts has wiped out more than $25 billion in savings overnight and reversed the key Conservative campaign promise. Many seniors invested their money based on their promises and their faith in the Conservatives cost them thousands of dollars of their hard-earned savings.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have repeatedly heard from many constituents that they are concerned about the state of Canada's environment. As I have mentioned before, residents in <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78451,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78451&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Oak Ridges—Markham</A> have a particular interest in environmental matters for a couple of reasons.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506796"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, my riding is the home of the beautiful Oak Ridges Moraine. This natural preserve is held dear to many in my riding and those who visit the area. Another reason why constituents are so concerned with the environment is their residency in the GTA. We seem to experience more and more smog days every year and longer and longer commute times to work in the city.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506797"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My constituents are disappointed. There is very little in the budget that will truly make a difference to the environment. The tax break on environmentally friendly vehicles is a good idea, along with corresponding tax penalties for large vehicles, but most important, there is no overarching vision or plan for how the government will address this serious issue.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506798"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recall in last year's budget the minister announced that the government environmental plan was under development. Let us bear in mind that the environment was not an original priority for the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A>, but as public opinion polls started to report that Canadians were increasingly concerned about this issue, he changed his tune. Still we have not seen any results and the legislation the Conservatives unveiled last fall went over like a lead balloon. In fact, the legislation was so bad it had to be sent to a special committee for improvement.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506799"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government says that it is a party that wants to get tough on crime. The Liberal Party has taken a strong position on criminal justice matters so far in this Parliament and supports seven of the government justice bills, and the budget finds some strategies that target white collar and drug crimes as well as more money for CSIS and corrections. It is my view that rather than rhetoric, the government should get down to business and truly implement justice strategies that will make Canadians safer.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506800"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberal justice plan provides safer communities to Canadians and frees up time for Parliament and its justice committee to carefully study the other bills in the government's justice agenda with which we have serious concerns.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506801"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why does the government not accept the Liberal offer to fast track justice legislation originally offered last October as an attempt to get effective criminal justice legislation passed through Parliament as quickly as possible to protect Canadian communities? Why is the government choosing confrontation and partisanship over safer communities? Canadians have not seen results now in two of the Conservative budgets.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506802"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will continue to do what I can to bring the concerns of my constituents here to the floor of the House of Commons and pressure the government to act in the best interest of Canadians.</div>

    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para506810"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a government that has tried to walk and even run before it could properly crawl into the hearts, minds and pockets of Canadians.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><a name="Para506811"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This government has preached responsibility. This government has preached fiscal responsibility and a competitive and efficient economic union. However, in this budget the government forgot about women, retirees and seniors. It forgot about our humanitarian commitments to the most underprivileged. This government did not present a clear vision for immigration and the role of newcomers to Canada in the building of our society, whose population is rapidly aging. This government has a hidden agenda.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506812"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hidden agenda is the government's eagerness to please everyone while trying to steal a little here and there from the wallets of Canadians, without any thought to the real impact of these last-minute attempts to please.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506813"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This government has no vision of Canada's future, because it has not stopped to think about it. It is short-sighted. This budget does not unite Canada; it divides it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506814"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the newspaper headlines this morning I saw:</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para506815"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Families frown on measures”.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This not so new government tells us it is investing in Canadians, preserving and protecting our environment and improving the quality of our health care system for all. Yet it ignores the plight of seniors who are falling through the cracks of Canada's medical system without proper home care for the elderly.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506818"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I congratulate the government in seeing the values of the new horizons program, which was established by the former Liberal government, and for expanding it. Let us not forget, and sometimes corporate memory is lacking in this chamber, it was the former Conservative government that attempted to deindex the pensions of seniors. If it had succeeded, that measure would have worsened the plight of seniors. This is a piecemeal budget that lacks direction, sound policy and practical options.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506819"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Missing from the budget is a more thoughtful and cohesive plan to ensure that the system responds to the needs of seniors, seniors as caregivers, seniors who are less and less able to provide for their daily needs.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Budget 2007 is certainly based on the Conservative government's unreal idea of equality by the creation of a partnership fund with a miserly $20 million so there could be real action in key areas such as the economic status of women and combating violence against women and girls.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506824"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where has the government been?

So the government said to take $20 million and go and partner, in other words beg other federal departments for top ups, to improve women's economic status and reduce partner violence. None of this makes any sense, not to me anyway, and I am sure not to the 52% of women who live and work in this country. </div>
    </p><a name="Para506825"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This budget further compounds insult and injury to women of this country. The government ignored the recommendations of the federal task force on pay equity created by our Liberal government. The task force recommended the expansion of employment insurance parental leave coverage. On September 18 last year the Conservative government said no. </div>
    </p><a name="Para506826"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government in its last budget saw fit to cut $45 million from the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation budget. Various studies emphasize the link between stable, affordable housing and women's personal safety and economic participation, yet the Conservative government went so far as to reduce by $200 million in federal contributions those moneys over the previous year that would have helped to create new affordable housing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506827"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Canadian Research Institute for the Advancement of Women, abuse in the home can drive women and girls into the streets. The lack of housing puts women and girls at even further serious risk of physical and sexual violence and early death. That is Canada's not so new government. The Conservative not so new government wants women, single women, self-employed women, isolated women, women and girls who are sexually exploited, immigrant women, women who are seniors, to no doubt thank it for these handouts.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Minority linguistic communities also lose out in this budget. As the Liberal critic for la Francophonie and official languages, I feel that this government has constantly ignored Canadians in minority linguistic communities in this bilingual country. </div>
    </p><a name="Para506829"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By getting rid of the early childhood day care programs set up by the previous Liberal government the Conservatives have at the same time swept aside the principle of increasing the number of day care spaces in these communities, which was at the heart of our agreement.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506830"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This government does not see Canada as a bilingual country. These measures, even though they sound praiseworthy, do not go far enough to achieve language development results. And certainly not in two years. </div>
    </p><a name="Para506831"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the studies show us, it takes a minimum of seven years for a language to be properly developed in a child. I am talking about language development in environments conducive to such learning. Does the government really intend to fulfil its obligations under the Action Plan for Official Languages? </div>
    </p><a name="Para506832"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In committee I heard complaints from minority linguistic communities that are worried about not being able to offer services to parents and their children in their mother tongue. </div>
    </p><a name="Para506833"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have heard about children whose mother tongue is that of the minority—French obviously—who have to go to an English-language high school because either the provinces are not fulfilling their obligations under federal-provincial-territorial agreements, or they are not allocating the funding necessary to ensure that the programs are maintained. </div>
    </p><a name="Para506834"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Budget 2007 allocates $52 million over the next two years in preparation for the 12th Francophonie Summit, taking place in 2008. This budget is actually offering very little, indeed no incentive, for francophones in Canada who wish to move to minority linguistic communities or even to encourage newcomers from francophone countries to settle in areas of the country where French is the language of the minority community. </div>
    </p><a name="Para506835"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirty million dollars will not change the situation. Canada needs a strategy planned by its government that shows Canadians the importance of maintaining, promoting and developing pride in Canada, whose distinguishing characteristic as a nation is bilingualism. </div>
    </p><a name="Para506836"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That means that services and the possibility of learning both official languages should be accessible and available where Canadians are living and where newcomers choose to settle in this fine country of ours. </div>

We have gone a long way in the past year and of course we are looking toward the future again and dragging along some political parties that are either embarrassed or too ashamed to vote with us on some of these initiatives. Today we have heard folks talk about supporting certain parts of it but that it is a piecemeal approach and so on. That is what budgets are all about. Of course, nobody can agree with everything.</div>

    </p><a name="Para506842"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a successful budget. We already know that. Endorsements have been coming in from people from coast to coast to coast on what they like in the budget. Of course, in a lot of initiatives there are things some would like to see fleshed out even more. We will get to those.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As have many members, I have been inundated by calls from the media at home as to what I like, what I do not like and what people are saying about the budget. Everybody is saying that the budget is very successful, with the exception of the premier of Saskatchewan who is looking for a hill to die on in the next election. He cannot seem to get a disagreement going with the leader of the opposition in Saskatchewan so he is targeting us. He has decided that he needs a fight that he can take to the people of Saskatchewan. The unfortunate part for him is that there is commentary and polls ongoing over the Internet and on talk shows and without exception, 60% to 66% of Saskatchewan people are saying that we did the right thing. </div>
    </p><a name="Para506845"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We followed through on our campaign promise which was to remove 100% of the non-renewable resources. We did that. We also said building on that, that no province would be left behind. There would be no more one-off politically stacked deals which the former Liberal Party finance minister made with certain provinces in order to try to stack the decks at election time. There are no more of those. We also said that it would take a consensus of the provinces to move ahead with changes. We could not put it in last year's budget. We gave them a year to try to come up with some sort of agreement as to how they wanted to proceed along those lines. All of us in the House know that they could not agree.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506846"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to the removal of the non-renewable resources, there are only a few provinces that have them to any degree that would make a difference and the rest have hydroelectricity and different things like that. They are saying they want it left as it is. What we did is we came up with the best of all worlds scenario by giving provinces like Saskatchewan the option of 100% exclusion of non-renewable resources in their fiscal plan, or 50% inclusion. That allows Saskatchewan to make that choice on a year by year basis, whichever is better for the bottom line and the people of that province.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506847"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knowing Mr. Calvert, the premier of Saskatchewan, as I do, he is more inclined to shut down the burgeoning resource sector, sit back, hold his hand out and say that somebody has to help him. That is the socialist attitude out there in that province.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506848"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saskatchewan people are pioneer stock. They enjoy the fact that Saskatchewan is a have province now. We finally jumped over that glass ceiling, as it were, and we are now playing in the big leagues with potential, second only to Alberta and maybe even equal to Alberta, because we have not tapped the resources that we know are still there.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506849"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a real problem with the attitude in Saskatchewan that somehow we have to look to Ottawa to help us all the time. I for one am thrilled and I know most of the people in my constituency are thrilled to be part of that have movement, to start to open up those oil and gas reserves, the diamond mines, the uranium, the potash and everything else that we have going in that non-renewable envelope.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506850"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that we will be able to bring our kids home when we develop those jobs in Saskatchewan like we would and should under a different regime. I have been having a bit of a running battle with them. They are saying we betrayed our promise, that we out and out lied according to some of them. I am here to tell them it is absolute hogwash. It is all election jargon. It is all politicking. If the premier and his finance team and government relations folks want to die on that political hill in the next provincial election, I would be more than happy to help them carry the flag up that hill and plant it for them.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a number of other things that are just great for Saskatchewan. It is actually the largest winner when we break it down on a per capita basis. There is some $230 per capita in new spending for the province of Saskatchewan alone.There is a lot of talk about Quebec always getting all the money, especially with an election in Quebec. The new spending in Quebec amounts to $91 per capita. We can see the disparity. The problem is when we talk economies of scale. Of course the NDP does not want to do that; it wants to be very selective. It says we are not getting enough, but when we break it down per capita, we are doing extremely well. I know most people out there are thankful for that.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a huge movement in this budget on something for which we have been asking, which is the biofuel strategy. It is there and rolled out. Producers in my riding are phoning in asking when and how and saying that we should get rolling with this. They want to get shovels in the ground and concrete poured this summer to start moving ahead with ethanol and biodiesel.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506853"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a bit of a shortfall in Saskatchewan. Only the provinces of Alberta and Ontario moved ahead with their components on ethanol and biodiesel. Saskatchewan is sitting back. I heard the provincial minister of agriculture say the other day that as a province Saskatchewan cannot compete. What a defeatist attitude. I categorically deny and will not accept that ever. </div>
    </p><a name="Para506854"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The farmers in Saskatchewan are some of the best in the world, bar none. We know they are looking for a role outside the Canadian Wheat Board to move ahead with a lot of products, specifically high starch wheats for the ethanol industry. There is talk of some new barley development. There is also the whole canola industry feeding into biodiesel. It is a win-win-win situation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506855"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our budget we came forward with a 10¢ on biodiesel and 20¢ on ethanol production subsidy, if one wants to call it that. Once we get rolling on that, we are asking the provinces to kick in their share to get close to what the Americans do. We need to parallel their system to make sure the factories and plants are built on the north side of the border. </div>
    </p><a name="Para506856"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have done our share. Alberta has actually topped up its share. Ontario has done the same. They are buying market share right now. Saskatchewan is saying that as a province it cannot compete. It is time to get past that ideology, move on and say that we have rolled up our sleeves and are ready to do it. I know that people in Saskatchewan are ready to tell the provincial government to lead, follow, or get the heck out of the way. We know that an election will take place there very soon.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506857"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are seeing infrastructure problems across the country. A few years ago the Canadian Chamber of Commerce identified some $65 billion in round numbers of an infrastructure deficit, roads, bridges, sewer, water, all those types of things. We have doubled infrastructure spending in this budget. Last time we came up with a four year program that said we would spend $16 billion. We have now upped that to $33 billion, the largest input into infrastructure which we know is crumbling in this country. We are trying to head that off and slow it down. We have seen overpasses collapse in Quebec. We have seen boil water advisories in way too many communities on and off reserve across this country. We are addressing those things in this budget. Of course Saskatchewan will be a beneficiary of a big chunk of that cash as well.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ecotrust turns the corner on getting on top of pollution as a whole, not just the Kyoto accord. I have always been one of the most outspoken folks saying that Kyoto does not get it done. It does not go far enough. It was good that it brought the environment to the front of our minds, but it did not get the job done. Even the Liberal wannabe leaders were critiquing the leader who did win, saying that as the environment minister he did not get it done. We are. The money is there. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Municipalities in Saskatchewan are quite concerned that the money has to flow through the province. The province of Saskatchewan is alone in charging a stipend, a percentage on these flow through moneys. It is a bit of a ripoff. The municipalities' only critique of this budget is why it cannot be sent to them directly. They are tired of paying the godfather in Regina and would like to see the money on their own desks so they could do more with it. That is the initiative we are looking to see.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506861"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are seeing the parties in the House playing politics with it. NDP members are saying they cannot support it. Today I happened to be on a talk show before and after the leader of the NDP and he went on with his predictable rant. I cannot understand when he says there is nothing in the budget for seniors. CARP, the Canadian Association of Retired People, has endorsed it saying it is a great step ahead and that we are moving the right way. The Canadian Federation of Independent Business is saying that it is great for small business and we are finally getting on top of that. That and tourism are my portfolios. I am happy to say those businesses are looking at this budget with a lot of favour. </div>

Canadians gave the Conservatives a new mandate on January 23, 2006. I am happy to be here delivering the programs that Canadians are asking for in a way they can make use of today and tomorrow.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This budget does not even come close to correcting the fiscal imbalance. Many of us were surprised to see that nothing at all is to be done in several areas. For example, they completely ignored poverty.</div>

I prefer to think of it as an incremental step.

    </p><a name="Para506876"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She knows full well that we are also starting 13 years back. We had a decade of drift. We are starting to get back on track. When I look at the record of the Liberal Party and the illustrious finance minister carving $25 billion out of the health and social transfers to the provinces over the number of years that he was the finance minister, that was much more intrusive than anything we have ever done in a budget. We are actually putting that money back. We are ramping it up at 6% a year and ensuring that the growth in population is reflected in government transfers.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506877"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She talked about older workers. We have done more about the manufacturing sector in here. In fact, I saw the quotes from Perrin Beatty today saying that finally we are recognizing that manufacturing is in peril in this country. They are saying that we have gone a tremendous way in addressing that, with the expedited capital cost allowance and the capital gains changes we are talking about. The business tax structure that we are putting in place will be so much more small business friendly, as they said. We had a great recommendation from the CFIB. </div>
    </p><a name="Para506878"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are addressing the so-called welfare wall to get people off the welfare rolls and back into the workforce with programs that are very inventive and exciting.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506879"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she talks about not sharing enough with the provinces, I am not sure how that comes across when the extra moneys we are putting into training and education will be administered by the provinces, when the extra moneys we are putting into child care spaces will be administered by the provinces and when the infrastructure moneys that we are doubling will be administered by the provinces. I am not sure how she gets at the fact that we are intrusive when we are working hand in glove with the provinces to build a stronger Confederation and a much stronger Canada.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To that end, we have made some significant changes in the tax code. A tremendous number of people will be removed from the tax codes altogether. From the last budget, topping up with this one, we have seen some changes to the termination of RESPs, which has been lifted from age 69, which the Liberals kept ratcheting back, up to age 71.

It is also a budget that strengthens both Quebec and Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506892"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is it that we can say Quebec and Canada will be stronger after this budget? First of all, because we have resolved the fiscal imbalance issue. While the party opposite, the Liberal Party, refused to even recognize that notion, we of the Conservative Party, through the voice of our <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A>, recognize that a fiscal imbalance did exist in this country. Indeed, the federal government had a lot more money than the provinces, which was affecting their flexibility. </div>
    </p><a name="Para506893"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am going to focus on the province of Quebec right now, since I am a member from Quebec. What we have just done today is hand over $4.1 billion over two years to Quebec, which is additional funding to correct the fiscal imbalance. What is most interesting about all this is the fact that the Bloc Québécois was asking for $3.9 billion over three years. They have approximately 50 members here in the House of Commons. For 14 years, they have been making all kinds of requests, without ever getting any results, without ever being able to do anything themselves, because they are always in opposition. All they can do is complain.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506894"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 14 months, with our <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> and 10 members from Quebec, we have resolved the issue of the fiscal imbalance with this payment of $4.1 billion over two years. I would like to be in Quebec Premier Jean Charest's shoes today. If $4.1 billion over two years had just been added to my coffers, I would be very proud of the federal government. Indeed, that would give me plenty of flexibility to better meet the needs of the province of Quebec and its citizens.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506895"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to talk about a few other aspects of this budget that I also find interesting. There is the issue of families. To the Conservative Party—as a member of this party—family has always been very important to us. Last year, the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> granted $1,200 for children six and under, for child care. It is up to the parents to decide how to use that money, whether they prefer to have someone come into their home to care for their child or whether they want to send their child to a day care. It is up to the parents and they get $1,200 a year for that purpose.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506896"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year, we approached this from another angle to address children 18 and under in one family. A $2,000 tax credit will be given for every child 18 and under to help families better position themselves to meet the immediate needs of their children. A $2,000 tax credit represents roughly $350 in cash that people will receive per child.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506897"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other thing we are doing for families involves RRSPs. We know that we will increasingly need older workers since there are fewer and fewer people in the job market and there will be a labour shortage. In that context, if our seniors want to continue to work on a temporary basis, and want to continue to be active in society and become involved, the age limit for RRSPs is being raised from 69 to 71. People will be able to continue to contribute to their RRSPs and not have to withdraw from them until they are 71.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506898"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other interesting aspect as far as family is concerned, has to do with workers. A $500 benefit will help support workers in the labour market. We realize that these people have expenses to get to work, that they invest and need more help. In this context, we are giving a $500 benefit to our workers.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506899"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Often little is done for truckers. We know that the previous governments decreased their help. When truckers are on the road and have to stop at a restaurant for food, only 50% of their meal expenses were deductible. We are going to raise this from 50% to 80%. This is another step in helping our truckers.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506900"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the environment, some have talked about it. All manner of grand proposals were made. But when it came time to take action, they backed off. Our government decided to show that it is taking all this seriously. What are we doing about the environment? First, there is the $1.5 billion Canada ecotrust established this year to improve our air quality and also to clean up our lakes, rivers and oceans.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506901"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also have about $4.5 billion in global environmental initiatives for this year.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1250"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1250"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1255"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1245"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1250">(1250)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para506902"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One measure that may have particularly impressed citizens yesterday is promoting the purchase of energy efficient vehicles in order to reduce greenhouse gases and improve air quality. This will be accomplished by providing a credit of $2,000 for the purchase of such automobiles.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506903"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why are we doing this? If we do encourage Canadians to choose these vehicles when making a purchase, and we contribute to improving air quality, this in turn will encourage businesses to carry out even more research into renewable fuels and improving the environment in Canada. This measure shows that we are serious and that we want to push companies to really work harder in this area.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506904"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is also something that not many opposition members probably even noticed. That is festivals. There will be an additional $30 million a year for them. As a result of the sponsorship scandal, this entire area had been overlooked. People were asking us to do something to support festivals in the regions of Quebec. There are big events in Montreal, of course, but there are also festivals and other events regionally. These people were asking for government support. Thirty million dollars will therefore be earmarked for them. I know that a lot of people will be very happy to hear this. When we see the budget breakdown, we will see how it will all work out. </div>
    </p><a name="Para506905"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am Minister of the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec, and when a budget is introduced, I almost automatically look at what it means for the regions. </div>
    </p><a name="Para506906"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are two aspects. First, there is the manufacturing sector, that is to say, the companies that produce goods and services. </div>
    </p><a name="Para506907"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We just told our companies—like those in the forest industry, for example sawmills, pulp and paper and various manufacturers—that they will be able to write off the investments they make in new equipment over the next two years more quickly and that they will be able to do so in just two years. If these companies do it in two years, it will mean a return on their investment. This will be attractive to them. If they take action—and we believe that they will thanks to this measure—the regions of Quebec are going to see new investment in sawmills, pulp and paper plants and other manufacturing. This measure should also make our companies more competitive on foreign markets, more productive, and therefore more profitable. It applies to small and medium-size companies, of course, but also to large manufacturers. </div>
    </p><a name="Para506908"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other aspect to which I wanted to draw the House’s attention concerns our farmers. What are we doing more specifically for our farmers and for our fishers and small businesspeople? </div>
    </p><a name="Para506909"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ceiling on the capital gains exemption had been fixed at half-a-million dollars per year for nearly 20 years. We have just raised that to three-quarters of a million dollars. As a result, our farmers will now have an opportunity to transfer a farm to their children or other people who could take over the business. The same applies to fishers, which is important, and also to small businesses. </div>
    </p><a name="Para506910"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Farmers were complaining about the Canadian agricultural income stabilization program. They wanted changes. We told them we would make changes; and we have done that. We will replace the program, so to speak, with a support system for farmers. This year, as a matter of fact, we are adding $1 billion in agricultural support. </div>
    </p><a name="Para506911"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, there is the infrastructure program. People are more or less aware of what goes into an infrastructure program. First, there are big projects, such as major highways. We have set aside $16 billion for those; altogether, $33 billion over seven years to strengthen the infrastructure program. </div>
    </p><a name="Para506912"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Quebec, more precisely, the federal government recently invested $40 million to support Phase III. At present, many regional projects are waiting to start. No doubt, shortly after its election, the new government in Quebec will match our investment of $40 million. That will enable us to support specific projects. </div>
    </p><a name="Para506913"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In substance, it is a good budget. It is not a show-off budget; it is serious and credible. </div>
    </p><a name="Para506914"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I understand very well why the Bloc Québécois has decided to support us. Indeed, they knew perfectly well that voting against this budget was not an option. At the same time, we have a right to question their presence here in this House of Commons, to the extent that, in addition, they confirm that they will support our budget. </div>

    </p><a name="Para506916"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister bragged—and I can understand why—that this was important for the manufacturing sector, because the capital cost allowance will be accelerated for new investments. However, this applies particularly to big businesses, big companies.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506917"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He made reference to paper manufacturers and different types of industries. When we are talking about small and medium-sized enterprises, these are very big SMEs, very big industries.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also talked about tax exemptions for capital gains. Once again, it is at the end of the cycle. Yes, the changes are made within SMEs and families.

That sector is targeted, but this measure is not just for big companies. </div>
    </p><a name="Para506922"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion, in the sawmill industry, if he were from the Saguenay—Lac Saint-Jean region, he would know that this measure is being very well received. Yesterday already, forest industry stakeholders were saying how much they liked this measure.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506923"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other thing I would like to point out to the member, who is his party's regional economic development critic, is that investing an additional $30 million in festivals gives my department more room to manoeuvre. </div>
    </p><a name="Para506924"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, giving $15 million to the National Optics Institute in Quebec City also gives my department room to manoeuvre. Who will benefit from these investments? The regions of Quebec.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506925"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you know, I have implemented the Blackburn plan. The Blackburn plan includes six new measures to help the seven regions whose populations are shrinking to grow, to create new businesses and to diversify their economic activity. </div>
    </p><a name="Para506926"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go ahead and laugh, but I am the one signing off on these files. Giving entrepreneurs a $100,000 non-repayable contribution to help cover start-up costs is not small potatoes. This money comes from taxpayers and we want to manage it very carefully. That is why we implemented six new measures to support economic development in the regions of Quebec. Those regions are: Saguenay—Lac Saint-Jean, the Lower St. Lawrence, the Gaspé and the Magdalen Islands, northern Quebec, the North Shore, Abitibi-Témiscamingue and Mauricie, as well as 21 RCMs. We are supporting these regions because economic development's mission is to help vulnerable regions, regions with shrinking populations. I am proud of the six measures put forward in the Blackburn plan.</div>

It will allow us to clarify a number of things being spread around by the Conservatives and the other opposition parties about the position taken by the Bloc Québécois.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506935"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, when the Bloc Québécois was created to represent Quebeckers in this House, it remedied a deficit, the democratic deficit that meant that the 45 to 50% of Quebeckers who had chosen the option of sovereignty for Quebec, who believed that they had no future in the Canadian federal system, were not represented in the House of Commons. This was an extremely significant crack in the democratic system. That is the primary source of our legitimacy. Anyone who does not recognize this is opposed to democracy and has no respect for the 50% of Quebeckers whose choice is sovereignty for Quebec.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506936"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second source of our legitimacy is the fact that we are the voice of Quebeckers in this House. We are the only ones who have the independence that is needed so as not to compromise our principles as all the other parties have to do, setting aside the interests of Quebec, of Quebeckers, often to please lobby groups, and in particular those from Western Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506937"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe that these two factors are a sufficient and complete explanation for the legitimacy of our presence here. Anyone who questions this might really wonder about what their democratic vision of a country like Canada is based on.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506938"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1993, we made a breakthrough on that democratic deficit when we came here to Parliament, for what is hoped will be as short a time as possible. Yesterday, we made a partial breakthrough on the fiscal imbalance by making a number of gains that—and we must be very clear on this point—are insufficient, but are nonetheless significant enough that the Bloc Québécois is comfortable in supporting this budget. </div>
    </p><a name="Para506939"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is nothing new in this, and it has nothing to do with the present state of affairs. Our position has nothing to do with the election in Quebec or the fact that a federal election is imminent. Even though the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> is going around saying that he does not want an election, he is still trying to provoke the opposition into bringing him down. </div>
    </p><a name="Para506940"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are ready for a campaign. Everyone knows that in Quebec, our party is the one that is ahead in the polls. Our party is ready to go into an election. We have done this based on our game plan, which has been common knowledge for a year. </div>
    </p><a name="Para506941"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the last federal budget, my colleague at the time, Yvan Loubier, who was the Bloc critic, explained it clearly. We supported the budget in 2006-2007 because it contained a promise to resolve the fiscal imbalance in the present budget. Since then, we have made known exactly what our expectations are. They relate to three things. Unfortunately, our first concern has been addressed only partially.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506942"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, federal transfers to the provinces have to be restored to the level they were before the Liberal cuts in 1994-95 and 1995-96. Yesterday, a step was taken toward this goal, but it is still not enough. Everyone has seen how the university and college community reacted, from the presidents of universities to university and college professors and student associations. Transfers for post-secondary education and social programs have not provided the money that everyone was expecting, including the provincial governments. On this point, there is a weakness that will have to be corrected and that will be corrected, because the Bloc Québécois will continue to dog the Conservative government's heels to have transfers for post-secondary education and social programs restored to 1994-95 levels, which will take $5 billion more for Canada as a whole and $1.2 billion for Quebec. What has been announced is barely a few hundred million dollars, and that is quite simply not enough.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506943"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is our first concern. The second deals with the power to limit and eliminate spending power in provincial jurisdictions, particularly in Quebec. </div>
    </p><a name="Para506944"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the budget it was merely given lip service.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1305"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1305"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1310"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1300"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1305">(1305)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para506945"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to read, on page 141, where it says, “Budget 2007 reconfirms the Government’s commitment to limit the use of the federal spending power to—” But no provisions were made. Will this be a law? As Mr. Dumont asked, will the Constitution be reviewed to eliminate this interpretation that the federal government has spending power in provincial and Quebec jurisdictions? In 2006, we had exactly the same sentence. We got absolutely nowhere on that issue. It is just lip service. But that is not a problem, the Bloc Québécois will use this to force the government, the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> and the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78777,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78777&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Finance</A> to introduce legislation so that provinces that do not want the federal government encroaching on their jurisdictions can opt out with no conditions and with full compensation. This is what managing and limiting federal spending power really is. This is what the Séguin commission asked for, it is what the governments of Quebec have asked for, and it is what the Parti Québécois government will ask for as of March 26.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506946"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is why we are prepared to support the budget, as I mentioned. We will continue to strive to settle this issue once and for all, but we must also have a partner that can stand up in Quebec City and who is capable of making his demands known clearly. Yesterday we saw the reaction of the three party leaders. Only one of them said what was actually one of the solutions to the fiscal imbalance, and that is to limit and restrict the federal government’s power to spend in the provinces’ jurisdiction. It was Mr. Boisclair, the leader of the Parti Québécois, who said that. </div>
    </p><a name="Para506947"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We want to continue the fight on the fiscal imbalance but we need a strong ally in the Government of Quebec. So we hope that on March 26, the Parti Québécois can take up the torch of Quebec’s traditional demands concerning the restriction and limitation—and elimination in a way—of the federal government’s power to encroach on the provinces’ areas of jurisdiction. I reiterate this because we know what the solution is; it is simple. All it takes is the possibility to opt out unconditionally, with full compensation, of a federal initiative in areas of provincial jurisdiction. This is our second concern. As may be seen, we once again get just two lines, as in the previous budget.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506948"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third issue unfortunately is completely missing from the budget. Members must bear in mind that that was not a gift we got yesterday. It is our money which is finally coming back to Quebec, money that the Liberal government had unfairly used for other purposes—and my colleague from Chambly—Borduas mentioned it—in particular to pay down the debt when there are plenty of other concerns and priorities in Quebec and Canada. This is the fact that it is not at all logical for Quebeckers to pay taxes to Ottawa that are then transferred back so that Quebec can assume its constitutional responsibilities in health, education, post-secondary education and social programs. </div>
    </p><a name="Para506949"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We believe it would be logical—and I think that anyone with a bit of common sense and no particular biases, a federalist bias, will understand this matter of federal visibility in Quebec and in the provinces—that the part that corresponds to the transfers for health, post-secondary education and social programs should be returned to the provinces and to Quebec in the form of tax points. For example, transfer of the GST to Quebec was the suggestion made by the Séguin Commission. This would be simple to do because the Quebec revenue ministry already administers the goods and services tax as it does the Quebec sales tax. This should be transferred to ensure that Quebec now has the autonomy, the partial independence necessary to assume it own responsibilities in its own areas of jurisdiction without fearing that, as in 1993-94 or in 1995-96, a government, whether Liberal, Conservative or—why not dream—New Democratic, will decide to cut these transfers unilaterally and thus cause huge problems. You know how all the Canadian provinces are experiencing financial problems and have trouble balancing their budgets. </div>
    </p><a name="Para506950"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I see them saying in the document, for example, that the provinces, overall, had a surplus of X, you realize that about 80% of that surplus comes from Alberta. That is distorting the reality of the situation. In fact, when Quebec does manage to balance its budget, it is often because it has been forced to sell some assets. Mr. Audet was forced to sell $800 million of assets last year to balance his finances. He is already forecasting a shortfall of $900 million in his financial framework for next year. We believe that Quebec must have its own revenue sources that are controlled by the National Assembly, and that are not subject to the sword of Damocles, which is the unilateral desire of the federal government to do whatever it wants, in the belief that it knows better than others what they need. </div>
    </p><a name="Para506951"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We had another example. One might have said that it was under the centralizing Liberals, and so forth. But no, when the Conservatives took office, what did they do? They tore up the agreement on child care. That deprives Quebec of $270 million as of this year. That is the reality of the situation. Once again, we are talking about an area of jurisdiction that belongs to Quebec. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1310"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1310"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1315"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1305"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1310">(1310)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para506952"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fight that we want to lead seeks not only to limit the spending power of the federal government; not merely to ensure that transfers are restored to the levels they were before the Liberal cuts—with indexation, obviously—but also to ensure that, within its jurisdiction, Quebec and the National Assembly can make decisions on spending, without having to account to anyone but the citizens of Quebec. As I have said, we will continue the fight. </div>
    </p><a name="Para506953"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we heard this afternoon, the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78770,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78770&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Industry</A> and the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78777,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78777&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Finance </A>believe that it is a done deal. Well, it is far from it. Those who think it is a done deal are completely disconnected from reality. In any event, in my opinion, the Conservatives are disconnected from Quebec. They use a certain surface polish to try to show that we are a little different from the others; but when you scratch that surface, you realize that it is the same centralizing federal government. Red or blue, the national parties in Ottawa are all centralizing. When you read the budget carefully, it is full of intrusions into Quebec’s areas of jurisdiction. One need only consider the Canadian Securities Commission. There will be a major constitutional problem if the federal government wants to proceed. That is very clearly spelled out in the Canadian Constitution. </div>
    </p><a name="Para506954"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who think that it is over are mistaken. In fact, no one in Quebec said that it was over. Everyone may have said that the step is more or less of interest. However, no one asked the Bloc Québécois to vote against this budget: not the three leaders of the political parties who are in the midst of a provincial election, not the leaders of the labour unions, not the business associations or even the student associations. The latter could have said to the Bloc Québécois that there is almost nothing for post-secondary education and that the members should vote against it. They understood that there was something in the increased transfers for students. No one has asked us to vote against the budget. Yet no one believes that it is over and that the fiscal imbalance has been resolved and is a closed issue. Far from it. We will continue the battle. Quebeckers do not believe that the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> has kept the promise he made in the 2006 election.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506955"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, one step has been taken. It is a small step, but a step nonetheless. We must now continue forward. As I mentioned, in the coming months the government must make a commitment to increase transfers for health, post-secondary education and social programs. Not only do we need an increase in transfer payments but we also need a piece of legislation, a law, that will provide a framework for the federal government's spending authority. The government will also have to prove that it is willing to negotiate with the provinces—Quebec in particular—to transfer the tax room that corresponds to federal transfer payments for health, education and social solidarity.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506956"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the time being, this small step is sufficiently valuable for the Bloc Québécois to feel comfortable in supporting the budget. However, we must realize that not only is it not over but that it is the beginning of a process initiated by the sovereignists. It is important to remember this. Personally, I had never before heard Mr. Dumont speak of the fiscal imbalance. Yesterday was the first time. However, it is true that Mr. Charest has pressured the federal government to resolve the fiscal imbalance.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506957"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While he did not use the expression "fiscal imbalance", Mr. Bouchard had also started talking about the problems caused by the unilateral cuts in transfers from the federal government to Quebec. However, it must be recalled that it was the Parti Québécois government of Bernard Landry that created the Séguin Commission, and that that commission achieved consensus in Quebec. I point this out because we are going to be hammering that theme. The Séguin Commission recommended three things: bringing transfers from the federal government back up to the level of before the cuts, taking inflation into account; circumscribing the federal government's spending power; and negotiating the transfer of tax room so that the Government of Quebec would have the independent revenues that it needs in order to meet its own responsibilities. </div>
    </p><a name="Para506958"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So it was Mr. Landry who took that initiative, and it was the Parti Québécois that took up the battle. Obviously, it was the battle of all Quebeckers, and all parties in Quebec clearly understood this, and there was one unanimous motion after another in the National Assembly demanding that the federal government respond to Quebec's expectations. Yesterday, we got a first step toward a response. However, and I repeat, I can assure you that no one in Quebec thinks that this case is closed. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1315"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1315"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1320"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1310"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1315">(1315)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para506959"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the Conservatives think that, they will have a serious surprise in the next election. I can assure you of that. </div>
    </p><a name="Para506960"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would perhaps like to conclude my presentation by pointing out that we are not at all satisfied when it comes to equalization payments. Certainly, for this year, the figures are attractive. We are talking about $1.6 billion. That is not everything that Quebec had called for, however. </div>
    </p><a name="Para506961"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I remind members that Quebec had called for calculation of equalization payments to be based on the 10 provinces—which we have achieved—and on 100% of renewable resources. I do not understand why the federal government, with its new structure, with a two-tier equalization system, two choices, two options, has not given the provinces that want it the option to get amounts based on 10 provinces and 100% of revenue from the provinces, including non-renewable resources. That did not take anything away from Saskatchewan, Alberta or Newfoundland and Labrador, but it allowed Quebec to get its true share of equalization payments. Remember that equalization is not paid by Albertans or Ontarians, but by Canadians and Quebeckers. It is not a gift from the West. It is simply the concrete expression of what is written in the Canadian constitution. </div>
    </p><a name="Para506962"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You know that the spirit of equalization was distorted by the Liberals, but it is there in the Canadian Constitution. This is not something the evil sovereignists made up. It is a decision that was made by Canadians and Quebeckers in order to ensure, throughout the Canadian political federation, that for an equal tax burden, the revenue is equivalent.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506963"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That also needs work. There needs to be an equalization formula that not only takes into account the 10 provinces, but also 100% of revenues, including non-renewable natural resources. That is the work that lies ahead of us.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506964"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said in the beginning, a year ago we announced that our decision on whether or not to support the Conservative budget would depend on the response, or the beginning of the response, to the fiscal imbalance problem. Yesterday, as I was saying, we were able to announce our support for the budget because of that very aspect. </div>
    </p><a name="Para506965"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is clear that a number of issues were forgotten in this budget and the Conservative government will also have to answer for that in an election campaign. There is a lack of assistance programs for older workers. We do not need a whole new series of studies, as the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78744,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78744&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Labour</A> was saying. I believe the Standing Committee on Human Resources, Social Development and the Status of Persons with Disabilities has done a number of studies on this issue. There was even a motion passed unanimously in this House before the last election. We now have to take action. We are talking about a program that costs practically nothing, between $75 million and $100 million. When we consider that the federal government's income exceeds $230 billion, this is a drop in the bucket and yet necessary for decreasing the economic insecurity that a number of regions in Quebec are experiencing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506966"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take, for example, my own region. In my riding, in northern Lanaudière, there is a municipality called Saint-Michel-des-Saints. At one time, there were two big Louisiana-Pacific plants there, a sawmill and a waferboard plant. Louisiana-Pacific closed these two plants for reasons related to economic conditions, namely, the slowdown in residential construction in the United States. The unemployment rate in that municipality and the neighbouring municipality of Saint-Zénon is around 40% to 50%. Those people will be collecting the last of their benefits in August. If the Bloc's bill had been passed, they would have been able to collect for at least five more weeks. </div>
    </p><a name="Para506967"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of those workers are over 55. Their only option now, because there is no other employer, is to leave the region. This exodus of older workers, on the heels of the youth exodus, will happen because they will be forced to go somewhere else to try to earn a pittance. We could easily enable them to exit the labour market in a dignified manner with a certain degree of financial security that would allow them to stay in their communities. With just a little money, we could keep all of these communities alive. This is about dignity, a concept that has been thrown out the window.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506968"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing here about social housing. Many of the programs cut during the $1 billion round of cuts have not been revived or have been revived in a way we consider unacceptable. </div>
    </p><a name="Para506969"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So there is a lot of work to do, and I hope nobody gets the wrong idea about the Bloc's support.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc's support will be limited, based on what we announced a year ago—and therefore no surprise—and based on what we read in the budget concerning transfers to Quebec for next year.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This good budget, and this good budget for Quebec in particular, is not the result of the work of the Bloc.

It is the result of people who want to work together for a strong united Canada and that is why all citizens in all provinces will benefit under this new budget.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member mentioned the desire to limit the federal spending power.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, we agree with that, but what the member I think is talking about is for one level of government to make all the decisions with another level of government to provide the money. That is not the way it works. That completely tears at the concept of accountability. The people who make the decisions have to raise the money from the taxpayers who are affected by those decisions, so that there is real accountability.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506976"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member mentioned funding for education and did not like the money for education. However, it is a 40% increase for education and that amount will grow by 3% every single year. The whole fiscal balance has been put now back on a principled long time reliable basis.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506977"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the member not think that having principled long term reliable funding going into the province is not a good thing for the people of Quebec?</div>

I spoke at length about the work of the Parti Québécois, the Quebec government and other parties in the National Assembly, but I forgot to mention the work of the Bloc Québécois. I did mention it briefly, but I would like to emphasize the fact that, if the Bloc Québécois had not been present in this House, no one would have ever said anything about the fiscal imbalance. How many times, on opposition days or during question period, did the Bloc Québécois call on the government to resolve this issue?</div>
    </p><a name="Para506979"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still to this day, the leader of one party—the Liberal Party—refuses to recognize the existence of the fiscal imbalance. I understand very well that, from his point of view, there is nothing in the budget, because he does not recognize the beginning of a solution to a real problem. Clearly, he cannot see that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506980"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to post-secondary education, the expectations of the provinces and the education network were definitely not met. The provinces were asking for $2.2 billion and the education network estimates that $5 billion is needed to cover national needs for post-secondary education. Quebec requires $1.2 billion. It is not even close. They are talking of a little over $100 million. This is quite unacceptable and some work will have to be redone. I do not wish to frighten the Parliamentary Secretary, but I can hardly wait until the Standing Committee on Finance meets to prepare the next budget—that will start soon enough, as she well knows—to see the reaction of the education network, whether in Quebec or the rest of Canada, to yesterday's announcement.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506981"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to spending power, the following is found on page 142 of the budget:</div>

In Manouane, there is an Attikamekw community with which I work. They have a great need for social housing. This year, for example, I believe they were able to build 15 housing units because there was a surplus in the program. However, they need another 50 housing units.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506988"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The birth rate may be falling in the rest of Quebec and maybe Canada—I am not familiar with the figures—but not in this community.

    </p><a name="Para506992"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have not really seen, in this budget, a Canadian literacy initiative that would fund new workplace and community programs that would strengthen adult skills in reading, writing and basic math. There is no workplace skills strategy that would provide financial support for innovative pilot projects. </div>
    </p><a name="Para506993"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There really are no labour market partnership agreements that would expand apprenticeship programs; literacy programs; workplace skills development; and support for immigrants, aboriginals, older workers and other employees who face labour market barriers.

Nonetheless, in our opinion, the key players, the major stakeholders in finding solutions to these significant social problems are the provinces, Quebec in particular.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506997"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We want to have transfers without conditions. Obviously we would prefer to have equalization transfers, or money sent to the Government of Quebec so that it can assume its own responsibilities, including a certain number of the problems that have been raised.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506998"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, literacy is not a federal government responsibility. The federal government has a responsibility to transfer money to Quebec so that it can have suitable literacy programs. The federal government has a responsibility to literacy coalitions. That is why we criticized the last fall's program cuts of over a billion dollars.</div>
    </p><a name="Para506999"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to work on resolving the fiscal imbalance so that Quebec has all the means necessary to deal with the problems raised by the hon. member.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507000"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that sense, we support the budget, even though the initial response is inadequate, as I have already explained. Nonetheless, it is by resolving the fiscal imbalance, by transferring the tax base revenues to Quebec—the provinces that want to benefit from this will follow suit—that Quebec will have the means to deal with all the problems she has raised. </div>
    </p><a name="Para507001"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Social programs, learning and literacy are not federal government responsibilities. The government's responsibility is to properly redistribute wealth across the Canadian political federation, which it still has not done.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507002"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion, this will never happen because the federal government, regardless of its political stripes, will always want to have a stranglehold. There is still the good old-fashioned idea that Ottawa knows best, when in fact it manages practically nothing as far as social programs are concerned.</div>

    </p><a name="Para507004"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to start by addressing the fact that I personally feel this is the best budget that the people of Canada, and particularly the people of Alberta, have seen for a generation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507005"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For far too long, we have suffered at the hands of a Liberal government that chose the privileged class over hard-working Albertans who work 60 hours a week to keep our province prosperous. For far too long, we Albertans have had to deal with Liberal governments that chose to pit one region against another for partisan purposes. For far too long, Alberta has suffered at the hands of fiscal mismanagement from successive Liberal governments that promised everything and delivered nothing. At the end of the day, they just did not get the job done.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507006"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning the page, however, today is a great day for Canadians. With the release of budget 2007, Canadians will finally have fiscal balance. Thanks to Canada's new government, we have rectified Liberal negligence by providing a budget that has something in it for everyone. From families to farmers to seniors to military personnel, this budget leaves no rock unturned.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507007"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Canada's new government is giving back to Canadians. We are putting money back where it belongs: in the hands of hard-working Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507008"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the province of Alberta alone, fiscal balance is being restored with over $3 billion in 2007-08. Our government is giving provinces the resources they need to deliver the front line services that matter to all Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507009"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, we have a government that respects the role of the Constitution and the role of municipalities and the provinces.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507010"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During my first term in office, I have had the privilege of knocking on many doors. One such door I want to tell a quick story about was in Redwater. I was talking to a nice young lady by the name of Carrie Fischer. When I knocked on her door, I asked if I could go in and elicit her support. She said certainly, but she had a message she wanted to give me first. I sat down at her kitchen table, across from her three young children, and listened to her talk about how she felt she had been mistreated for years by the Canadian system of taxation. She felt that as a married mother who stays at home to look after her children she had been penalized because her husband goes off to work.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507011"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am proud that our <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> has listened to those people sitting around kitchen tables. Hard-working families are the backbone of this country and Canada's new government recognizes this. </div>
    </p><a name="Para507012"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Families in Alberta and across the nation will enjoy a new $2,000 child tax credit that will provide more than three million families with tax relief of up to $310 per child. In Alberta, parents will save an estimated $173.2 million.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507013"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albertan families will also enjoy a new “working income tax benefit” of up to $500 for individuals and $1,000 for families. This will benefit Alberta workers, with over $55.2 million going back into their pockets.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507014"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is not all. Alberta residents will save roughly $30.2 million with an increase in the basic spousal amount that will provide tax relief of up to $209 to a supporting spouse or a single taxpayer supporting a child or relative.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507015"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alberta taxpayers will also save $13.5 million with an increase in the RRSP and registered pension plan maturation age limit from 69 to 71 years of age. This is well over $272 million back in the hands of Alberta families alone. </div>
    </p><a name="Para507016"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The buck does not stop there. Canada's new government is just getting started.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507017"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Farmers and homegrown biofuel producers will also have their fair share of what it means to have a government that not only listens to their problems but also acts on those problems.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507018"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One billion dollars will be committed to farmers for the improvement of national farm income programs. Of that commitment, $600 million will go toward contributory-style producer savings accounts.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507019"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is exactly what farmers in my area are asking for. In Westlock--St. Paul, we have some of the most progressive, advanced, hard-working farmers in the world. They feel they need a system like this. They feel that we need to make some of these changes to help get rid of the CAIS program and move on to a new style of program. This is exactly what they are looking for.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507020"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While there will be an additional $400 million paid directly to producers to help address high production costs, Alberta farmers will receive roughly $210 million of these initiatives. That is $1 billion and $210 million more than the Liberals ever gave Canadian and Alberta farmers respectively.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Homegrown biofuels producers will also be able to put their hands on the money, given the $2 billion in incentives for renewable fuel production over a seven year span. A renewable fuels operating incentive program will bring stability, allowing the domestic ethanol and biodiesel industry to finally flourish and compete with national and international markets. </div>
    </p><a name="Para507022"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The program will provide 10¢ per litre for domestic renewable gasoline, ethanol, and 20¢ per litre for domestic renewable diesel production for the first three years. By bringing over 20 new world class biofuels facilities to Canada and creating over 14,000 new jobs in rural communities, this provides a new market for over 200 million bushels of Canadian grains and oilseeds.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had the privilege this summer of going around my riding to many town hall meetings and talking to hundreds of different producers.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would be very remiss if I did not speak on one of the most pertinent issues in my riding: the men and women of our armed forces. It has been my biggest privilege as a member of Parliament in this first 14 months to serve and to have the opportunity to deal with many of the men and women from CFB Edmonton and from CFB Four Wing, Cold Lake. I have taken a lot of time to listen to what these men and women have to say to us and to what they have to tell their government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507026"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to tell another quick story. When I was in Bon Accord during the campaign, I was knocking on doors. Like most politicians, I was a little nervous at the beginning. A man walked up to me and said, “Is that a politician coming up here? If it is, I've got something to tell him”. He happened to be a sergeant in our armed forces, with over 20 years' experience. He was very perturbed. He said that we send our armed forces over there and give them difficult missions, which they do not mind, and they do not mind being worked hard or being put in harm's way because that is why they signed up, but he said they do mind us not giving them the means, the tools and the equipment to do their jobs properly.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507027"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am proud to say that I had the opportunity to go back this summer to talk to that same gentleman.

    </p><a name="Para507028"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am proud to say that we are putting in $60 million per year to level out the allowances paid to soldiers serving in army field units. This is very important for the men and women of CFB Edmonton. There is also $10 million for operational stress injury clinics, showing that we are concerned about the men and women not just while they are in theatre but also when they are out of theatre. </div>
    </p><a name="Para507029"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is $19 million going to the veterans ombudsman to help ensure the enhancement of the veterans' bill of rights. Probably most important, as I have already stated, there is $175 million in budget 2007-08 for the Canadian Forces Canada first defence plan.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507030"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am running out of time. The budget has so many tremendous things to talk about, but I will wrap up by mentioning municipalities. I served as a town councillor in the community of Barrhead and had the privilege of dealing with many of the concerns that come forward at the local level. One of the biggest concerns is that municipalities are never given the funding or the tools to do their job.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507031"></a><p>

Most important for Albertans, they have increased the transfer by $171 million by per capita funding. That is very important.</div>

    </p><a name="Para507042"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As members know, the Liberal Party started the infrastructure programs and the gas tax programs, which are very popular in municipalities. They are absolutely essential. We fought and fought with the Conservatives to extend those programs in the long term. We are very happy that they have been extended from five to seven years, as is the FCM, but we were looking for a longer extension and so were Canadian municipalities. I would like the member to comment on the comment from the Federation of Canadian Municipalities that there is no long term solution, no long term extension like we were looking for.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member was praising the military.

I represent not a small number of them. Over 7,000 men and women in our Canadian armed forces are housed right in my riding. They are ecstatic with the measures taken by the government. They are hoping that we are in for a long time so that we can continue to fix the neglect of 13 years of Liberal government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507045"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I really want to make sure I address the question on the gas tax funding, because I think the member brings up an excellent point. It was a Reform-Alliance proposal in the first place that finally drove the Liberals to put this funding in place. Now we, as a Conservative government, have only expanded that program. I think the steps taken by this government and the extra infrastructure dollars are very positive. I know that my municipal councillors and municipal reeves, to whom I talk on a daily basis, thank us and ask us to continue with this great work.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A recent decision was made to delete a full time clerk position in the Grand Forks post office, which has resulted in large lineups.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Ms. McGee, big business is lobbying fiercely for privatization of our postal services. We must not let this happen. Privatization means higher postal rates, uneven service standards and quality, fragmentation of our delivery network and possibly a decrease in mail security.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507090"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a bad move for everyone. We need not look any further than our own B.C. communities to see how bad privatization really is. Highways are not being looked after and public health care and the environment are under attack.</div>

Allow me to summarize only some of its key elements. </div>
    </p><a name="Para507343"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, there were $7 billion in tax savings. </div>
    </p><a name="Para507344"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, having been married 21 years and being the father of five children, let me speak of our support for families. There is a $2,000 child tax credit for each child under the age of 18. Ninety per cent of Canadian families will benefit from this tax credit and 180,000 taxpayers will be removed from the tax rolls as a result of this measure. In addition, there is a working income tax benefit of up to $1,000 per family to help low income working families.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507345"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, we have eliminated the $4,000 limit on annual contributions to registered education savings plans. We have provided $6 million a year to combat the sexual exploitation of children and human trafficking.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507346"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having personally served in the Canadian military for 20 years, I am pleased to reiterate that there are $3.1 billion for national defence over the next three years. There are $60 million for operational allowances for our brave men and women serving in operational theatres overseas.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507347"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are appointing a veterans' ombudsman. We are providing $19 million in 2007-08 and $20 million a year after that to improve services to veterans. Not only do we salute our men and women in uniform, but we stand by them and are taking action.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507348"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the MP of a rural riding representing farmers, there are $1 billion in new funding for farmers, $400 million paid directly to producers to help with the high cost of production and $600 million in federal funding to kick-start new producer savings accounts. We are increasing the lifetime capital gains exemption to $750,000 from $500,000, therefore increasing the rewards of investing in farming. This is the first time it has been increased since 1998.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507349"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78777,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78777&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Finance</A> correctly stated, Canada's farmers do not just feed our country, they feed the world. It is time we provided the kind of support that these decent, hard-working people of integrity deserve. We have heard from our farmers and listened to them, but most important we have acted.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507350"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are a government of action and our budget is a budget of action. There are two words that best describe our budget: it delivers. Canadians could not be happier. Finally, they have a government that is acting for them. That is our Canada. Voilà notre Canada.</div>

    </p><a name="Para507361"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me highlight some of the numbers associated with our budget.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507362"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are $39 billion in funds dedicated over seven years to restore the fiscal balance, the fiscal balance that the Liberal Party has consistently denied exists.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507363"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have already mentioned that for families, we are introducing a $2,000 child tax benefit for every child under the age of 18 to assist hard-working families. This will remove 180,000 taxpayers from the tax rolls and it will benefit 90% of Canadian families.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507364"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a number of other initiatives as well. We are talking about the working income tax benefit. This will benefit 1.2 million low income working families. There are $6 million in additional funds for the RCMP to protect our children from sexual exploitation and human trafficking. I also mentioned the support for our military.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507365"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a budget that delivers for Canadians. Our government is a government of action and our budget is a budget of action.</div>

It had a zero deficit on the backs of the people who lost their jobs. It has taken $51 billion away from the working people who lost their jobs.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507367"></a><p>

There were a few areas with which I was pleased, and I will touch upon those. Overall, the budget did not just fail Ontario, but it failed other provinces in many ways. Danny Williams, the Premier of Newfoundland and Labrador, was very explicit with his comments the other day.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507373"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Earlier today in question period the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',105835,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=105835&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of the Environment</A> talked about how he had not heard anything from Ontario members. The debate has just started.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507374"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me quote what Premier Williams had to say. He said, “The Prime Minister has betrayed the people of Newfoundland and Labrador” and he commented about Conservative MPs in his province. I think we got the message very well.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507375"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Premier MacDonald made the same kind of comment, but he was a bit more diplomatic in his choice of words. He said that the Conservative government had fundamentally been unfair.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507376"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to Ontario, the government has reneged on its commitment to transfer $6.9 billion to the province. That was tossed out. I am disappointed that the voice from the provincial legislature has not been what it should have been, but a few crumbs were thrown its way, so it seems to be satisfied for now.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507377"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the new Conservative government took over, it simply threw out all the commitments that had been made. I mentioned the one with respect to Ontario. Now I will mention the Kelowna accord, which is important to all of us as a nation. It reflects on what we are as Canadians, looking after the needs of all Canadians, especially our first nations people. A $5.1 billion written commitment was literally tossed out. </div>
    </p><a name="Para507378"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our health care system is probably the most important issue to each and every one of us in this place. As we have an aging population, we must ensure that programs are supported and that sustainability and long term funding is there.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507379"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me remind members what we did in our budget of 2005. The current <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78772,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78772&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Health</A> was asked not too long ago about funding and his response was that the government would continue to support the efforts that the Liberals had put forth in their last budget. Therefore, no new money per se was put into health care delivery.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507380"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that subject, I must compliment the Conservative government for putting $300 million toward cervical cancer treatment. This is similar to the immunization program the Liberal government brought in two budgets ago and it was applauded throughout the country. I must give credit where credit is due and for me. Given what is going on internationally, I think this is a very wise investment.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier today in question period a member from the Conservative Party asked a question about how the government would address the environment, the carbon issue, CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, et cetera. When the Conservatives were elected, for a year or so the then minister of the environment was continuously asked by us what her plan was since her government had tossed out our recommendations. The current leader of the Liberal Party had put a plan in motion, offered it to the new government, but that plan was tossed aside. Every time we asked a question about the government's program, we were told we would have a made in Canada solution.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, of course, we realized where the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> of today stood on it. I would like to quote for the record his idea of carbon dioxide. He said, “Carbon dioxide does not cause or contribute to smog, and the Kyoto treaty would do nothing to reduce or prevent smog”.

He also made another statement on October 11, 2002. He said, “Carbon dioxide is not a pollutant”. </div>

    </p><a name="Para507385"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said in my opening statement, whenever we ask constructive questions their rebuttal is that we have done nothing. I was pleased that it was not I but the New Democratic member who said that we balanced the budgets. He used the analogy of the EI, which is another area I want to touch upon. </div>
    </p><a name="Para507386"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recall what we inherited. We never entered this chamber and criticized the then Conservative government for creating high debts, high deficits and high unemployment. We just simply pulled up our socks and did what we had to do. I recall the corporate community out there saying to lower the unemployment premiums and give them a break and they would invest in creating jobs.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507387"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me remind all of us here, both those who are new and those of the class of 1993, that since 1993 we kept on reducing the EI premiums year after year. I heard nothing in this budget to address that area. At that time, members will recall, there was an unemployment rate of about 11.7% or 11.8%. As recently as 2006, when we lost the government, the unemployment rate had been reduced to 6.2% or 6.3%. Indeed, it was the lowest unemployment rate in well over 30 years.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507388"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78777,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78777&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Finance</A> rebutted that in his comments. He said that we are at 6% unemployment. I compliment him on the fact that we have gone down 0.2%, as we are headed in the right direction, but I am very disappointed as a former employer to know that these rates have not been addressed. I believe he has an obligation to address that area.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507389"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to tax relief, I asked a question some time ago. The lowest rate that we as the Liberal government had at that time was 15%. What did the new Conservative government do when it assumed office? It brought the rate up to 15.5%, yet again the Conservatives stand up and say they have been lowering taxes. According to the math I was taught, 15% is less than 15.5%.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507390"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had the privilege of chairing the Subcommittee on International Trade, Trade Disputes and Investment for Canada. In those recommendations, we talked about our CAN-Trade initiatives. Canada can compete internationally. Yes, we produce goods and services to address the needs of our people here in Canada, but part of being competitive and part of creating new jobs within our country means that we go outside our borders to market our goods and services, thus creating economic prosperity for people.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1525"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1525"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1530"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1520"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1525">(1525)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para507391"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, through the recommendations, the Liberal government committed $485 million over five years. In their budget the Conservatives committed “$60 million over two years”. I am just amazed at how they are able to camouflage it and present it to the nation as a great thing that has happened. What this simply means is that the Conservatives are putting in one-third, or two-thirds less than what we were putting into this program. I ask them to tell me, then, how we are going to be able to have the tools, the means and the ways to compete.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507392"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, what the Conservatives have done is literally camouflage all these figures. I am disappointed that they have provided nothing for housing. I am very disappointed that they provided very little to a small number of students in post-graduate programs. That does not make for a competitive country.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On May 14, 2006, a <i>Meadow Lake Progress</i> editorial stated that with the 2006 budget, northern Saskatchewan communities “have been left behind”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507411"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The editorial listed three major ways in which our communities have been left behind: first, no specific help for forestry workers and communities in Saskatchewan; second, nothing to help farmers with spring seeding; and third, abandoning the Kelowna accord.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507412"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is unfortunate that a year and a budget later, little has changed. Once again, Saskatchewan forestry workers and industry have not been given any specific assistance, farmers will not receive any help for spring seeding, and of course the Kelowna accord has not been honoured.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507413"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Northern Saskatchewan is once again being left behind.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507414"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this budget is even more of a disappointment for northern Saskatchewan because of all the Conservative broken promises. Income tax rates have increased and income trusts have been taxed. There are no plans to reduce health care wait times. The promise of removing non-renewable resources from the equalization formula has been abandoned.</div>

    </p><a name="Para507416"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the <i>Western Producer</i> reported on March 15, 2007, farmers and the provinces know they are being played as pawns by the Conservatives with the budget as well. This has given rise to frustration and cynicism.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Farmers know that the Conservatives are playing political games by claiming the budget must be passed in order for money to flow. Farmers need assistance with spring seeding now to pay for fertilizer, fuel and other costs of production.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507418"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> can and should deliver the money now but is leaving the producers waiting. There is no reason to wait. This aid needs to be delivered now. Farmers who need the aid now might not be in business by the fall or next year.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507419"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We must make no mistake: for the current government, farmers are on their own.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507420"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On top of that, the farmer savings accounts that require provinces to buy in were unilaterally introduced by the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> without consultation. Provinces were caught by surprise by the announcement. No timelines or details have come out yet, making the announcement an empty headline.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507421"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, during the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister's</A> photo op in Saskatoon, he could not resist taking potshots at the Saskatchewan premier even while admitting he needed the premier's support to create these savings accounts. So much for creating goodwill and working together.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507422"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation for Saskatchewan forestry workers, the industry and the communities is also deeply disappointing. In the past year, the Conservatives did not announce any Saskatchewan-specific plans to help workers or businesses. In the softwood managed trade agreement, they left $1 billion of illegally collected duties in American hands and traded away half of Saskatchewan's traditional U.S. market share.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507423"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With tough market conditions, forestry workers and industry deserve a strategy about how to move forward. The Liberals had responded to this challenge by creating the five year and $1.5 billion forest industry competitiveness strategy. This strategy offered long term stability and a plan to build sustainability for forestry communities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507424"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Conservatives abandoned that strategy. This has meant incredible hardship for Big River mill workers, who have been out of work for the past year, and uncertainties for Meadow Lake mills. The pain and uncertainty for these workers are real and the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> needs to offer his support to them.

    </p><a name="Para507425"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Northern Saskatchewan has also been hurt by broken Conservative promises. The Conservatives breaking their health care wait time promise by not offering any timelines or plans and the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78772,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78772&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">health minister's</A> lack of leadership on health issues have hurt rural and northern communities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507426"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, other challenges also need immediate attention. Accessibility to treatment and facilities remains a major concern. Recurring doctor shortages in Spiritwood led to its hospital closing, forcing residents to travel at least an hour to get emergency care. For remote communities, there is double the hardship.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507427"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for taxes, the Conservatives broke their word to lower taxes, hiking the lowest income tax rate to 15.5% in the last budget and refusing to cut it in this budget. Also, the amount that people can earn tax free has been lowered and the Conservatives refuse to increase it to the levels the Liberals had it at. This move has meant that tax credit savings for Canadians have been cancelled out or that their taxes have actually increased.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The broken income trust promise has been a bitter disappointment as well, as many relied on the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A>'s promise not to tax income trusts.

    </p><a name="Para507429"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But breaking the equalization promise is perhaps the most bitter of all for Saskatchewan. For over two years, Conservative members of Parliament had vocally advocated excluding non-renewable resources. The member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78869,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78869&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Battlefords—Lloydminster</A> changed from saying that “people were getting angry about equalization” to saying it was priority 11 out of 10. The member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78722,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78722&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre</A> switched from introducing a motion in support of the promise to saying he would “be happy with whatever announcement was made” by the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A>. </div>
    </p><a name="Para507430"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this broken promise it is clear that not one of them is willing to speak up for Saskatchewan. Their voices do not even amount to a whisper in the government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507431"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considering the amount cut by the Conservatives by scrapping the child care agreements and the Kelowna accord, the income tax rate hikes and personal tax free amount decreases and social program cuts to literacy, museums and youth investments, Saskatchewan is not even at a break-even point because of this broken promise.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507432"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for aboriginal issues, the scrapping of the Kelowna accord and the meagre funding for first nations, Métis and Inuit, despite the quickly growing aboriginal population, hurts Saskatchewan in particular. The last year had already been very disappointing for aboriginal Canadians. Only $150 million of new money was specifically dedicated to first nations, Métis and Inuit. With cuts to INAC and aboriginal health and languages totalling at least $220 million, this means that funding was cut by about $70 million, a net loss over the course of the last year.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507433"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What a loss scrapping the Kelowna accord has been. There has been more of a loss than simply the $5.1 billion that was budgeted for economic development, housing, water and health. It is more than the loss of the new consensus reached between premiers and the aboriginal leadership. </div>
    </p><a name="Para507434"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The investments in the Kelowna accord would have provided increased economic development for all of Saskatchewan; more jobs for aboriginal and non-aboriginal workers, as investments in housing and water would have created a need for construction workers, water treatment specialists and housing firms; more economic activity, particularly for all northern Saskatchewan communities, as business opportunities would be created to meet the needs of suppliers, workers and capacity. Most important, investments in our youth for education and child care would have enabled aboriginal youth to achieve their goals in post-secondary education because they would have the necessary supports from their communities for funding and services.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507435"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the narrow and short-sighted vision of the Conservatives never saw the Kelowna accord for the opportunity it held for Saskatchewan. They saw it as something to cut. With this cut they have cut down the aspirations of many first nations, Métis and Inuit youth, youth who deserve much better, youth who are the competitive advantage of a new Saskatchewan. Without investing resources, this will increase the social pressures upon which these young people have to survive and battle every day.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507436"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few weeks ago I was in Sandy Bay, a community that suffered through several suicides by despondent youth. The small community was in shock, reeling from the loss of so many lives. Many spoke about how they needed hope, jobs and something to do, someone to talk to. Community members came together in the face of this tragedy. The many divisions of the town joined together: Métis, first nations and municipal; health, justice and leadership; youth, elders and parents. They all came together for a common cause, the young people who needed the attention in order to survive and prosper in the new Saskatchewan.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507437"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what the Kelowna accord was about for Canada, all Canadians united, working together, a meeting ground, an understanding, a commitment to get the work done that needed to get done. </div>
    </p><a name="Para507438"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At their meeting, Sandy Bay residents spoke of their considerable need. They need resources for health, basic infrastructure, community halls, youth centres and such. Will they be able to achieve that? Only if we, the Liberals, the NDP, the Bloc and Conservatives commit once and for all to respect that it is people in those communities that have the answers and we exist only to empower them. We cannot afford to waste any time.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am proud to stand here and speak to our government's 2007 budget, “Aspire”. The contents of this balanced budget will undoubtedly allow Canadians to aspire to great things as it will cut taxes for hard-working Canadian families. The budget will invest in priorities like health care, the environment and infrastructure, including roads, bridges and public transit. It will restore fiscal balance by giving the provinces the resources they need to deliver the front line services that matter to Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507454"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is amazing that Canada has a $1.5 trillion economy. This means a responsible government must make choices that strike the right balance.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507455"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we promised in “Advantage Canada”, our government's long term economic plan for Canada, we will take historic action by moving to restore fiscal balance through long term, predictable funding. We have done just that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507456"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know the citizens in my riding of Simcoe—Grey will appreciate the fact that we are reducing the tax burden and making life a little easier for hard-working Canadian families. With initiatives like the tax back guarantee and our working families tax plan, there will be a little more money in the pockets of every Canadian. I am very proud of our government and our <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A>.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507457"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After 13 years of the Liberal Party's look the other way policies, we are cracking down on corporate tax avoiders to restore some semblance of fairness to Canada's tax system. As the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> said last weekend, “We will let the Liberals defend the vested interest and the loopholes of those associated with the previous government”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507458"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This budget is all about making our strong economy even stronger and providing the necessary tools so Canadians from all walks of life can reach their full potential.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507459"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada's new government knows that by creating a climate of hope and opportunity, Canada can be an example to the rest of the world of what a truly great, prosperous and compassionate nation can be. It is in this vein that I am particularly proud.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507460"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, International Trade and Sport, I am proud to be part of a government and a ministry that are once again making Canada a respected name on the international stage.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507461"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether it is in sport or international affairs, as Canadians we take great pride in our historical reputation on the international stage whether it be as world medallists, diplomats, peacekeepers, or soldiers on the battlefield.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507462"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In sport, I am proud that we will accelerate our contributions to the own the podium program. This exciting initiative will ensure Canadian athletes can achieve success in international competition, especially at the Vancouver Olympics in 2010.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507463"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are proud to make a significant investment in Canadian heritage sports, such as lacrosse and three down football. This money will ensure Canadian-specific sports will continue to thrive in Canadian society.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507464"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the international stage, Canada is once again respected, whether it is our ardent defence of human rights in consular cases, such as the defence of Mr. Celil in China, or our commitment to the people of Afghanistan, our commitment to the many peacekeeping missions in which we are currently engaged, or our commitment to reducing global poverty and aiding international peace and security.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507465"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In last year's budget we committed to doubling our international assistance by 2010-11 from what it was in 2001-02. I am proud to say that budget 2007 will increase the resources devoted to poverty reduction and international peace and security by establishing a three point program to enhance the focus, efficiency and accountability of Canada's international assistance efforts. We will provide $200 million in extra support for reconstruction and development in Afghanistan, with a focus on new opportunities for women, governance, enhanced security and combating illegal drugs. We will also invest $115 million in the innovative advance market commitment led by Canada, Italy and the United Kingdom to create a vaccine for pneumonia, expected to save more than five million lives by 2030.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507466"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our government is committed to helping Canadian companies succeed in global markets. The global commerce strategy offers real solutions to challenges arising from the global economy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507467"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Budget 2007 provides $60 million over two years to advance three core objectives: negotiate bilateral agreements with our trade partners to improve market access for our exports; protect and promote investment; and facilitate science and technology cooperation. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1550"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1550"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1555"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1545"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1550">(1550)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para507468"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will also reinforce our presence in the U.S. market by directly engaging the private sector and networking with governments. We will enhance commercial services in new markets by opening offices in Asia.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507469"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, the government will introduce new measures to enhance Export Development Canada's ability to make strategic equity investments in order to encourage greater participation by small and medium sized Canadian businesses in emerging market opportunities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507470"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to mission security, our government takes the responsibility to ensure the safety and security of our diplomats seriously. The realities of today's world mean we need to strengthen the security of our missions to advance Canada's interests in a more complex world.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507471"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To this end, budget 2007 will invest an additional $11 million over the next two years to enhance the critical infrastructure of foreign missions. Enhancements will include improvements to closed-circuit televisions, exterior lighting, enhanced visitor screening, vehicle barriers and more rigorous surveillance.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507472"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada, to put it plain and simple, is making the world a better and safer place for all citizens of this planet. Canada's contributions in particular to Afghanistan are helping to rebuild a nation that has for decades been a country torn apart by war and the tyranny of the Taliban. But things are changing in Afghanistan.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507473"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike the decade of darkness under the Liberals, Canada's Conservative government is once again ensuring we live up to our UN and international obligations. Budget 2007 will help Canada to aspire to great things and we will continue to work with our partners in the international community to help rebuild Afghanistan.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507474"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the opposition plays politics with our troops, our aid workers and diplomats on the ground, this government is getting the job done by committing real support to our men and women on the ground whether they are soldiers, diplomats or aid workers. Unlike the Liberals who just talked the talk and did not back any of their words up with money or support, this government is walking the walk and we are putting our money where our mouth is and we are getting the job done.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507475"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me remind the opposition of Canada's successes in Afghanistan which can only remain successes if we remain committed to the mission. Five million children, one-third girls, now go to school. This is a 700% increase since 2001. We have 363,000 teachers and now they have teaching materials. Over seven million Afghan children have been immunized. We also have microfinance programs for over 300,000 Afghans. It is important to note that 72% of these microfinance programs are for women who have started their own businesses.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507476"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have four large water reservoirs and 55 pipe schemes that have been built to provide 1.3 million Afghans with water. We have 100 kilometres of irrigation canals that have been rehabilitated, 150 kilometres of new roads and bridges, 50 kilometres of electricity lines, and 10 transformers and 42 generators.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507477"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada's new government is getting results in Afghanistan where the former Liberal government simply did not. This is real progress and it was the vision of the Afghanistan compact which was for a secure, self-sufficient and democratic Afghanistan to realize the aspirations of its people.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507478"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Budget 2007 also demonstrates our commitment to strengthen Canada's aid program. We will strengthen this program both in terms of financing and improvements to ensure that our aid dollars are actually reaching those who need it most. Last year we committed to doubling our aid budget by 2010 from the 2001 levels, but with our budgets 2006 and 2007 combined. We have gone beyond this doubling commitment by providing $635 million in additional aid resources.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507479"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While adding more aid money is indeed helpful, what is also important is ensuring that these aid dollars and aid resources work more effectively. Aspire 2007 lays out a clear and impressive agenda to do this by strengthening the focus and improving the efficiency and accountability of our foreign aid.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507480"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am conscious of my time, but let me reiterate just how proud I am of this government as we aspire to do great things for and on behalf of Canadians. Once again the pride of Canadians is on the rise. No longer are they governed by a government embroiled in scandal that distracted the nation from doing everyday business.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507481"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada's new government is creating a climate of hope and opportunity. We can be an example to the rest of the world of what a truly great, prosperous and compassionate nation we can be.</div>

The minister talked about the own the podium program. There was no new money for own the podium. The money was accelerated and that was it. Nothing for the road to excellence program.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has made substantial commitments to sport in Canada. In particular, he referred to summer sports. In fact, every year we give $45 million to summer sports and over 1,200 athletes receive direct funding from Sport Canada to help them achieve their goals in order to win at the Olympics or compete internationally. The hon. member is quite wrong.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to own the podium, we recommitted our support for it. Own the podium wanted us to advance to it the money it needs.

The government presenting the budget is quite rightly proud of it and of course the opposition parties have difficulty recognizing its positive nature. </div>
    </p><a name="Para507499"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to focus on the sheer statistical reality of this budget. People can argue about whether they think a certain thing is a good idea or not, but there are some things this budget will accomplish which will be of truly historic proportion and that should be noted and acknowledged.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507500"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First and most important is the whole aspect of fiscal imbalance. For decades and possibly for more than a generation, there has been this question of fiscal imbalance. Most Canadians, myself included for many years, have had difficulty understanding it because it is a complex issue, but because it is complex does not mean there is no solution to it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507501"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fiscal imbalance is the situation where in the perception of the provinces and territories there is an abundance of taxpayer dollars lodged at the federal level. They feel it should be spread around on an equal basis in such a way that they will have the capacity to deliver essential services. </div>
    </p><a name="Para507502"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is acknowledged that from time to time in the history of a country various provinces or territories may or may not have the capacity to deliver approximately comparable services. At times when they do not have that capacity, there is this sharing at the federal level of the dollars that sit there. It is a constitutional item. That is in essence what the program talks about.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507503"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For perhaps a generation or more federal governments have used this as a political tool and it has been built up by an ad hoc system of how much money should go to a given province at a given time. The <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> and the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78777,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78777&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">finance minister</A> made a commitment to once and for all come up with a formula-based, rules-based program where there would not be any argument anymore, or so they thought and hoped, and where there certainly would not be a sense of depending on which party was in power could affect how much money a province would receive. </div>
    </p><a name="Para507504"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They came up with a formula based on recommendations in the O'Brien report that at least took the argument out of whether a province received preferential treatment or not. That has happened. This is of historic proportions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507505"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We now have a formula in place in the area of equalization that is rules-based and formula-based, and one which has taken out the ad hoc system which has been used by previous governments just to try and bend the will of people for political gain.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507506"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that formula now in place some provinces are indicating that they are not happy with it. Some concerns have been raised in British Columbia. Even a good friend of mine who is a minister in the government there has raised some issues. The issue of British Columbia's share is an interesting one because British Columbia is called a have province. </div>
    </p><a name="Para507507"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we are talking about provinces, countries, cities or individuals, prosperity and poverty do not happen by accident. An exception to that rule would be a windfall of some kind for a province, or a country, or an individual. Then there will be prosperity at least on a temporary basis. A disaster can strike an individual, a city, a province or a country and there can be poverty at least on a temporary basis. Other than these instances, both prosperity and poverty occur in most cases because of certain principles being applied or not applied.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507508"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people of British Columbia finally rid themselves of the socialist government that had plunged that province into an economic morass for years. I was in Alberta at the time and business was coming from B.C. in streams because of the poorly thought out, socialistic approach to governance and to economic issues. B.C. was spinning down and becoming a have not province. </div>
    </p><a name="Para507509"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been a Liberal government there for a few years, and I use the word Liberal because that is what it calls itself so it is with some reticence obviously, and is it perfect? No it is not. No government is perfect. The trend has been reversed and there is economic prosperity. Things have turned around. Is there prosperity for everybody? No. It is not perfect, but it is a lot better than what it used to be.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1605"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1605"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1610"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1600"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1605">(1605)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para507510"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With its new government, British Columbia, hopefully, will never need to draw on the equalization formula. However, should something happen, by accident or some other reason, that turns things around economically in British Columbia, the same formula that is being applied to Quebec, to Ontario and to Newfoundland and Labrador today, will be applied to British Columbia.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507511"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In spite of the adjustment, $4.7 billion will go to British Columbia this year because of this formula. A member just said that is a lot of money. We have $3.1 billion just in the health transfer alone and another $1.3 billion in the social transfer which is for post-secondary education and other issues related to that. B.C. is definitely benefiting from this particular budget. </div>
    </p><a name="Para507512"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has also been raised that there is nothing in the budget for British Columbia this year for the pine beetle infestation problem. This is a problem that was ignored by the federal Liberals when it first was identified quite a number of years ago. Now it has devastated the forest industry in many of our communities and a commitment was made last year, which is being maintained, a $1 billion commitment over 10 years to deal with the beetle infestation problem and all of the negative effects of it. The money was announced last year and it is there again this year.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507513"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those were some of the issues that people in British Columbia have raised. I am pleased to see the benefits that the people of British Columbia will be receiving from this particular budget.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507514"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at some of the approaches to prosperity and how the budget is based on those principles. The government recognizes the importance of families and the importance of children and the costs that go with that. Though we are told children are a blessing, and those of us with kids will generally acknowledge that, though from time to time we have our moments, but to acknowledge the raising of children there is a child tax credit in place of $2,000 per person for every child. That money is in addition to last year's child care benefit that is in place. That means $174 million for British Columbians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507515"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another thing of historic proportions that happened in this budget is that the so-called marriage penalty has finally been eliminated. The process by which a working spouse would be graded at one level of taxation, a spouse who is working in the home, which is also full time if not overtime, was not given the same benefit as two individuals living together under the same roof. We and families have been asking for years why we have that marriage penalty. We took that out and we raised the spousal benefit. It is the first time in history that has happened at the federal level. Thirty-five million dollars will go to B.C. just because of that adjustment alone. </div>
    </p><a name="Para507516"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On day care, $250 million was committed across the country, $87 million of which will land in B.C. for the creation of child care spaces, along with the program that will continue to allow parents to be compensated for the child care of their choice. It will no longer be the Liberal type approach of one way only. It will be a proper approach of allowing the parents to decide.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507517"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For farmers, $60 million will land in B.C. because of what we are doing on the farm programs in this budget. </div>
    </p><a name="Para507518"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For seniors, another thing of historic proportion, we have raised the level at which they can maintain their retirement savings, not just until 69 years old when they must transfer their money into a RRIF but up to 71. It was not too many years ago that the Liberals knocked it down from 71 years old to 69. We have raised it back up, along with income splitting.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507519"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is $30 million for the Great Bear Rain Forest. </div>
    </p><a name="Para507520"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cities will be able to have predictability because the formula now related to the GST. It is not just 57% of the GST rebate that goes to cities but now it will be 100%. The gas tax formula will now be maintained into the future for years.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507521"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People in Penticton, Summerland, Westbank, Merritt, Logan Lake, Naramata, Peachland--I hope I have not left anyone out--the hard-working, locally elected officials will have some predictability in terms of what they can see in terms of growth in infrastructure because our region is growing. It is the most beautiful region in all of Canada with the most wonderful people. People from the entire country are going there, not just to retire but to invest and to grow. </div>
    </p><a name="Para507522"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This budget will meet the needs and the environmental needs that we are so concerned about.</div>

    </p><a name="Para507524"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A partnership was developing with the federal government based on the recognition that the very objectives that the member outlined, in terms of cities and communities, could be best met by working in partnership with those levels of government.

    </p><a name="Para507525"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the member agree with that particular perspective and does that mean that those partnerships that evolved in a non-partisan way are being abandoned and that we will not be able to get on with governance within this federal system that will serve the interests of communities across the country, in particular with respect to the social and infrastructure objectives that the member has outlined?</div>

As we know, in our country, which has three levels of government, municipal, provincial and federal, there can be and there is a lot of overlap. I am sure the member will agree, just as do my constituents, hard-working people raising families, looking to their retirement, going to school or whatever they might be doing, are not that concerned with which level of government is administering. They just want to know that their needs will be met in the most efficient way. </div>

One of those areas is the 2,500 police officers who have been promised to municipalities across the country. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I met with the mayor of Vancouver this morning and explained to him that he needs to take those concerns to the provincial level so we can translate that down into what will be the needs for the province and at the municipal level which they can channel that way. Some programs go direct to the cities, like the national crime prevention program for which we delivered dollars just last week into British Columbia. There is no abandonment here but there is a desire to have it nice and clean and efficient in terms of working.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The concern I have is that it is only in for the 2007 year and this infrastructure piece will be required at a much more significant cost if it is to have tunnelling and other types of environmental important work that is necessary to meet the needs of the municipality and also the proficiency of the amount of traffic that goes along this trade route.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did this not get multi-year funding similar to the project team, for example, which received three years of multi-year funding to actually oversee this?

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the last two weeks that the House was not sitting, I spent every day talking to people at their doors and in my community office, meeting with groups and attending community functions. Everywhere the message was the same. People are increasingly recognizing the existence of a prosperity gap in Canada. They do not feel that they are benefiting from the economic growth they keep hearing about, and they are right. The numbers back them up.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507537"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only is there a growing gap between the rich and the poor, there is also an alarming erosion of economic security for middle class Canadians. I stood in the House yesterday, before the budget was tabled, and relayed what ordinary Hamiltonians told me that their priorities were for achieving some fairness. Now that we have the budget in hand, I would like to evaluate it in that context.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did the budget close the prosperity gap for people on Hamilton Mountain who are working hard and playing by the rules but who are finding it harder and harder to make ends meet? Let us look at each of the items I raised yesterday in turn.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I spoke about the desire among my constituents to see some significant property tax relief through federal investments in urban infrastructure. In a community where our aging infrastructure is leading to regular flooding, poorly maintained roads and constant struggles to expand public transit while keeping fares down, Hamiltonians had hoped for a serious investment in our city. Ratepayers cannot afford to shoulder the additional burden of these essential investments solely on their property taxes.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507540"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are precisely the hard-working families that the government says that it wants to support, but instead of making the infrastructure investments that would relieve our local tax burden, the infrastructure spending that the budget actually entails is money that will flow to the provinces, not directly to the municipalities, and it must be spent on public-private partnerships.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507541"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For anyone not familiar with the significance of the P3 stipulation, let me just remind them of Highway 407 where a public asset was turned into a toll road to satisfy the voracious revenue appetite of the private sector. That arrangement is costing Hamiltonians dearly and the last thing we need are more such infrastructure investments that end up costing us over and over again.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507542"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On public transit, the budget is virtually silent. There is absolutely no new dedicated money for transit. In short, the most basic needs of our municipality have gone unmet.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507543"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, I called yesterday for a manufacturing sector strategy. Hamilton has lost thousands of decent paying jobs as a result of restructuring and plant closures. Not only is the budget silent on strategic investments to Canada's industrial heartland, but it ignores the plight of displaced workers as well.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507544"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This budget offers no support to older and laid off workers. It is silent on employment insurance. It fails to protect the wages and pensions of workers in cases of commercial bankruptcies. To add insult to injury, it keeps in place almost $9 billion in corporate tax cuts over the next four years. Clearly, this budget was written more for those at the boardroom table than for hard-working families around the kitchen table.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507545"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Equally galling is the fact that this budget fails to address the needs of transient workers. We have significant labour shortages in parts of our country with decent paying jobs beckoning workers from other regions but this budget does nothing to remove the barriers to accessing those jobs. </div>
    </p><a name="Para507546"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is particularly true for workers in the building trades who often go to job sites for a limited amount of time until a project is complete. The building trades have been lobbying for over 30 years to be able to deduct their accommodation and meal expenses from their income taxes when they work at a job site that is more than 80 kilometres away from their homes. They and I had hoped that this issue would be addressed in this budget.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507547"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a private member's bill, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2553163,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2553163&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-390</A>, on the floor of this House that would do precisely that. I had indicated to the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78777,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78777&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Finance</A> that I would be happy to see progress on this issue regardless of whether it was through the passage of my bill or through a government initiative. In the end, the government sat on its hands. Again, it could not help but add insult to injury by increasing the meal allowance for long haul truckers from 50% to 80%.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507548"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the building trades have asked for is a little bit of fairness. The government's inaction comes as a slap in the face.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507549"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third issue my constituents raised with me was the gouging that has been happening at the pumps. For people who require a vehicle to get to and from work each and every day, nothing has had a more direct inflationary impact on their household budgets than the price of gasoline.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507550"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where is the federal watchdog to ensure that hard-working families are not being hosed? Where is the relief? Instead, ordinary Canadians learned yesterday that they do not rate. Instead of helping them make ends meet, the government continued its billion dollar subsidies to the oil and gas industries for the next three years, with a complete phase-out not even in the picture until five years after that.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1620"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1620"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1625"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1615"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1620">(1620)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para507551"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, the rich are getting richer while hard-working Canadians are struggling to make ends meet. The budget did nothing to close the prosperity gap.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507552"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about those who are living at or near the poverty line? Yesterday's budget created the working income tax benefit, purportedly to help the lowest income earner. In fact, it does nothing to help those who are making the minimum wage. While serious initiatives to help the most vulnerable in our communities are always welcome, the government should have sent a resounding message that in a country as wealthy as Canada it is completely unacceptable that someone who is working 40 hours a week at minimum wage is still living below the poverty line.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507553"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the absence of showing a willingness to move toward a living wage by setting the federal minimum wage at $10 immediately, the budget has done little to close the prosperity gap.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507554"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also called yesterday for investments in post-secondary education. Again, the government would want hard-working Canadians to believe that it has moved aggressively on this file but let us take a closer look. These investments create scholarships for graduate students, but do nothing for those who are working on their first degree. These are precisely the students who are weighing whether they can afford to get the education they need to participate in the knowledge based economy against a potential average student debt of more than $24,000.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507555"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A budget that does not address student debt and student loans does nothing to enhance access to post-secondary education for children in modest and middle income families.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507556"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to yet another key priority for residents on Hamilton Mountain, it is good to see that the government is at least taking baby steps forward with respect to the environment. However, it is obvious that the government has not spent a great deal of time thinking about this issue and is offering little more than the symbolic gesture that the Liberal leader gave Canadians when he named his dog Kyoto. There is no serious commitment in the budget to the Kyoto accord, to mandatory fuel efficiency standards or short, medium and long term targets for cutting greenhouse gas emissions. </div>
    </p><a name="Para507557"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following is perhaps the biggest missed opportunity in the budget. The Conservatives are offering a $2,000 tax credit on the purchase of green cars, but sadly the vast majority of these vehicles are being built in Japan and in the United States. Indirectly they are subsidizing foreign car manufacturers. Instead what they should have been doing is investing in the environment and in Canadian jobs by supporting the production of green cars right here in Canada, but nowhere in the budget do we find an auto sector strategy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507558"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, the carbon tax that is going to be imposed on vehicles that are not fuel efficient is going to impact the very middle class families that the government says it wants to help. Parents who are driving their kids to hockey, soccer and baseball games are buying the minivans. Neither the $310 child tax credit nor the $500 children's fitness tax credit will compensate for the up to $4,000 surtax on their minivans.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507559"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have one last point on the environment. I was pleased to see the cleanup of Hamilton Harbour get at least a cursory mention in the budget, but an $11 million allocation for cleaning up contaminated sediment in Hamilton Harbour as well as the Niagara River, the Detroit River, St. Marys River, Thunder Bay, Peninsula Harbour, St. Clair River and Bay of Quinte is clearly wholly inadequate. The city of Hamilton alone had asked the federal government to contribute $30 million toward the cleanup of Randle Reef.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507560"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Equally inadequate is the government's investment in health care. While some new initiatives are being funded, the top of mind concerns of families in Hamilton are not being addressed. There is no mention in the budget of training and hiring new health care professionals to deal with the doctor shortage. There is no investment in pharmacare to help people with their drug costs. There is no investments in home care to allow seniors to live independently in their own homes longer and to take some of the burden off their children who all too often are becoming primary caregivers by default. There is no investment in long term care despite the fact that many acute care beds in our hospitals are tied up needlessly because chronic care beds are not available.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507561"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seniors whose tax dollars built our health care system deserve to have it be there for them at a time in their lives when they need it most. The same is true with respect to their retirement income. The budget is a disgrace when it comes to its treatment of seniors. It brags about the fact that it allows seniors to work longer when in reality most seniors only continue to work because they cannot afford to retire. In Hamilton 25% of seniors live in poverty and 36% of single women over the age of 75 live in poverty, none of whom I might point out can benefit from pension splitting because they either never had or no longer have a partner or a spouse.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507562"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Announcing through the budget that seniors should now count themselves lucky because the government will allow them to be Wal-Mart greeters is hardly a strategy for allowing seniors to retire with the dignity and respect they deserve.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507563"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seniors had hoped for increases to the OAS and GIS. They had hoped that the tax rate for the lowest income bracket would be dropped from 15.5% to 15%, where it was before the budget of the Conservatives of last year. They had hoped for new affordable housing and expanded public transit. They had hoped to reimbursed for all the full amount that the government shortchanged them as a result of Statistic Canada's mistake in calculating the consumer price index. None of these things were delivered in the budget.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By definition, seniors cannot wait forever. For a government that supported my seniors charter in June last year, it has shown itself contemptuous of both the will of the House and the very real needs of seniors.</div>

    </p><a name="Para507567"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This morning the leader of the NDP was interviewed on national television about the budget. He was asked the question, “What things do you support?”.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is my frustration. I had assumed we were going to have a robust and also a fulsome, forthright and honest debate on the issue. Perhaps I was expecting too much.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507569"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will simply reiterate the question I asked her leader this morning. I am looking at the budget highlights. I am looking at a working income tax credit of $1,000 to help the working poor over the welfare wall. I am looking at extra support for parents of disabled children so they can set up something like an RESP. There is a $2,000 family tax credit for each child under the age of 18. I am looking at some extra support for seniors such as increasing the RRSP age to 71 from 69.</div>

Transfers to the provinces can help people on welfare. There are single people who are living on $268 a month. For example, in New Brunswick, a person with a disability receives $468 a month. How can a disabled person live on an amount like that? </div>
    </p><a name="Para507585"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Conservative budget they are ready to give $9 billion in tax reductions to big corporations. Oil companies are among those large corporations. How many Canadians are happy to know each day, as they put gas in their vehicle, that gas costs them more than $1 a litre? Oil companies will again be able to save money on their taxes while the people who are putting gas in their vehicles are paying high prices. That is taxpayer money. </div>
    </p><a name="Para507586"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Conservative government allocated $8 billion for post-secondary education. Students asked for $2.2 billion in support. Since 1991-92, the cost to students has risen by 153%. Last week, I was in Fredericton and I met with the post-secondary students association, which asked us to support their demands. </div>
    </p><a name="Para507587"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The government claims that it is paying down debt and balancing the budget, but in reality it has shifted the debt to future generations. They say they want to pay off the debt so that future generations are not stuck with it. But what is the government doing? It has downloaded it to the students. However, those students are not just anyone; they are not strangers. They are our children. These are the young people who will be the leaders of our country one day. They are the ones who will be working to build up our country. And, what are we doing? We are paralyzing them financially. This budget will not help them because their costs will increase. </div>
    </p><a name="Para507588"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, there is absolutely nothing for a home care program, nothing for long-term care. One of our colleagues said earlier in the House that hospital beds are filled with people who have long-term illnesses and who could be in nursing homes. But there is no money in the budget for that, absolutely no money for that. </div>
    </p><a name="Para507589"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Conservative government says that thanks to income tax reductions, young people will be able to claim up to $310 per year. It will amount to about $310. They can claim $2,000, which will mean an income tax reduction of $310. </div>
    </p><a name="Para507590"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are talking about $310 per year for child care. This is an area in which the government has slashed spending. We had asked for a national child care program, because at present it can cost parents as much as $500 or $600 a month. In Quebec, it may be $35 a week, but look at what is happening in the other provinces in the country. This government is the one that slashed funding, that refused to create national child care centres. Talk to those people to see whether they agree. </div>
    </p><a name="Para507591"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for increasing the minimum wage to $10 as proposed, this is about working people, about poverty. Some people have to have three jobs to get by, because they are working for minimum wage at $6 or $7 an hour.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1635"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1635"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1640"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1630"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1635">(1635)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para507592"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There would be something in this budget if the government were proposing a bill to raise the minimum wage. </div>
    </p><a name="Para507593"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In terms of the economic development of Atlantic Canada and the ACOA, there is absolutely no surplus to help small and medium-sized businesses to establish and create jobs in Atlantic Canada, for example, as is the case in northern Ontario or western Canada. There is absolutely nothing to help rural regions. There is nothing for anyone but the big companies: $9 billion. </div>
    </p><a name="Para507594"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I cannot avoid talking about the $51 billion surplus in the EI fund when there is absolutely nothing for working people in Canada who are losing their jobs and absolutely nothing to change the system under which only 32% of women and 38% of men are eligible for employment insurance. There is a $51 billion surplus. </div>
    </p><a name="Para507595"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a surprise that I cannot avoid talking about. I was disappointed to learn that the Bloc Québécois was going to support this, when there is absolutely nothing in it for workers who have lost their jobs, and absolutely nothing for employment insurance. </div>
    </p><a name="Para507596"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I recall Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',1815922,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=1815922&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-48</A>, which the NDP had negotiated with the minority Liberal government. We had agreement for $4.6 billion: $1.6 billion was allocated to post-secondary education; $1.5 billion was allocated to affordable housing; $900 million was earmarked for infrastructure in cities and municipalities; $500 million was being given to countries in need; and $100 million was to be used to protect employees' wages in bankruptcies. </div>
    </p><a name="Para507597"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bloc Québécois voted against Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',1815922,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=1815922&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-48</A>, which was good for ordinary people. Today, it is going to vote with the Conservatives, when there is no change to employment insurance. This is the second time that the Bloc members have told us that we are the ones who have abandoned working men and women. They have had two opportunities to do the right thing, but they voted with a right-wing government that is not committed to helping working men and women or to social programs. </div>
    </p><a name="Para507598"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Conservatives cut the court challenges program on September 25, 2006; they cut funding to Status of Women, and they cut funding for literacy programs.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507599"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today the Bloc is going to support a government that made all these cuts and has done absolutely nothing, as I said, for working people and employment insurance. The Bloc accused us of being in bed with the Conservatives. I would say that they are in the hot tub with the Conservatives and having a fine old time. It is a disgrace. </div>
    </p><a name="Para507600"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some say today that the Conservatives gave Jean Charest money for the elections in Quebec, where there will be a tax cut. Jean Charest announced it on television. There will be a $700 million tax cut. But when people go to the hospital in Quebec, they are stuck in the hallways because there are no available beds and services. </div>
    </p><a name="Para507601"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mario Dumont said that he wanted to privatize health care in Quebec. Is that what he will do with the billions of dollars being sent to Quebec? We hope not. </div>
    </p><a name="Para507602"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We could have had programs to help Quebec and all the provinces in Canada. I do not know what has become of the Bloc members when they unite with a right-wing government that is the furthest to the right we have ever seen and that makes cuts in ways we have never seen before. </div>
    </p><a name="Para507603"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw it happen. I was in the House yesterday. When it became apparent that the Bloc would support the Conservatives, almost all the Bloc members were virtually hiding their heads beneath their desks. They were so ashamed. I know them well, my friends in the Bloc, I know them very well and I know that they are uncomfortable. They do not feel very good. They feel terrible. </div>
    </p><a name="Para507604"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This all needs to be seen in context. Why should we not support the Conservative budget? Because there is nothing for the middle class, nothing for seniors and nothing for people who are ill here in Canada. That is why we will not be supporting the Conservative budget. </div>

If we look at the budget item by item, it is the people in Canada who have the least in terms of economic wealth who get nothing. They are the poor in our country. They are the seniors who are the most vulnerable. They are families with children who earn less than $36,000. As for pension splitting for seniors, if a senior's pension is less than $36,800, he or she is already at the lowest marginal tax rate and therefore it does not benefit the senior.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507606"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We could look at this item by item and say that this budget really targets and focuses in on those who can afford to pay some tax. It does not help the poor. It does not help seniors who are vulnerable and cannot help themselves. It does not help the unemployed. It does not help stimulate the economy. It does not help make Canada a better place. There is no vision.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507607"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder if the member could suggest to us, however, why his party still supported the taxation of seniors who invested in income trusts to the extent that income trust investors collectively lost about $25 billion because the NDP supported the government in the taxation of income trusts and a very serious broken promise.</div>

I would like to address a question to him. Why did the Liberals bring in the loophole for business that created this mess that people got into? That is what happened. The Liberals created that mess. They brought in a loophole for their friends.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507609"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us not forget that the Liberals had a minister of finance who for many years did not even pay his taxes to our country. That is the type of government we had for 13 years. I wish I could have raised the question with the member instead of him raising it with me, because the Liberals created the problem. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have had people coming to us and saying that maybe they were wrongly advised about not leaving their money there. As one person said, “I left the money there, it kind of calmed down, and I got my money back”. As for ordinary people, that is not what hurt the most, like the member is talking about. The Liberals created that mess. It was during the election of 2006 that it came out what they had done. They created it and they cannot blame the NDP for saying that we do not want those types of loopholes for businesses in our country.</div>

For all the years that I have been in the House, he takes the opportunity to go to a recurrent theme, which is employment insurance. In his particular area, I know, micro business and the opportunity for seasonal employees to start their own businesses is a very attractive inducement. </div>
    </p><a name="Para507612"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing as a strategy, which would look at areas like his constituency, his region and his province, that is an inducement to workers to work through co-ops or the tax system, and they are continuously taxed at a higher level with respect to employment insurance. I wonder if he would like to expand on that, because there is a huge absence in this budget of anything that would come close to meeting the needs of workers in his particular area.</div>

    </p><a name="Para507614"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Businesses have a responsibility when they hire people. If they cannot keep them 12 months a year, they have a responsibility to pay into a program to make sure that if employees get laid off and no longer have a job they will be given the opportunity to get a job for their families. It is not just for businesses to make money. The working people, who help them do business and get rich, get nothing if they lose their jobs.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is that the government had a $51 billion surplus. It was during the time the Liberals were in power, starting in 1996. There was a $51 billion surplus on the backs of the workers and business people. Jobs were not created through ACOA. That is the problem with this budget. There is no extra money for ACOA to help businesses create jobs. That is where the problem is in this budget. There is nothing for the Atlantic provinces so it can create those jobs.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservative budget has failed Canada's most vulnerable people. Those who need government most have once again been ignored by the Conservative government.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead of reaching out to those who are homeless, or instead of investing in affordable housing or post-secondary education, or ensuring that poverty among first nations would be eliminated, the Conservatives chose to ignore and sideline them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507619"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was supposed to be a budget, from what I recollect of what the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> said, that would be discussed around kitchen tables.

It is a budget in which the rich will only get richer and the poor only poorer.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507620"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the chief economist at RBC Financial, Craig Wright, best summed up this budget when he said:</div>

</div>
    </p><a name="Para507622"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is evident from this quote that this budget was not looking at Canada's future. This is a budget that is a step backward, a step backward for the children of Canada, for the most vulnerable of Canada, for our first nations communities, for the homeless, and for those who really needed the government most.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507623"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me talk about child care. The Conservatives have spoken quite often about choice in child care, but what choice has a Conservative government really given hard-working Canadian parents when they have failed to deliver a single child care space?</div>
    </p><a name="Para507624"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The $250 million that has been given to the provinces and territories is really a mere drop in the bucket compared to the $1.2 billion that would have been invested by the previous Liberal government. One needs to ask oneself, does this Conservative government really believe in early learning and childhood development?</div>
    </p><a name="Para507625"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have seen over the last 24 hours that child care advocacy groups across the country are saying that the Conservative plan has offered little money or absolutely no money and no accountability to ensure that child care spaces are going to be created.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507626"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all recollect the 2006 campaign when the Conservatives promised the creation of 125,000 child care spaces over five years. Now, as we take a look 14 months later, we see that not one child care space has been created. </div>
    </p><a name="Para507627"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadian families have very quickly realized that this was yet another Conservative promise made and another Conservative promise broken. Unfortunately, this time, that broken promise has impacted thousands and thousands of Canadian children across the country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507628"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we take a look at this particular budget, we see that the government talks about creating 25,000 new child care spaces. Twenty-five thousand actually sounds like a large number, but one only has to take a look at a few examples. </div>
    </p><a name="Para507629"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can take a look at the city of Ottawa, which actually has a centralized child care waiting list. Parents across the country and parents living in Ottawa can actually add their child's name to one particular city list to ensure that it appears on a central list. As for this list, in Ottawa alone, the number of children waiting for a child care space is 10,000. There are 10,000 children in Ottawa waiting for a child care space. This is for only one city in Canada.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has simply acted as an ATM machine. It has thrown money at families by giving them $100 a month and now it is throwing money at the provinces and territories. The only thing that is evident while the government acts as an ATM machine is that there has not been an action plan. There has been no leadership to ensure that we deliver the child care spaces that children and Canadian families so desperately need.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many child care advocacy groups and many Canadian families talk about the fact that when the Liberals were in government they actually sat down with the provinces and territories and came up with a $5 billion investment in an early learning and childhood development plan to ensure there would be quality, universality, accessibility and a developmental component so that our children, the future leaders of our country, would get the very best.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507633"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What did the Conservatives promise? They gave $100 a month that is actually taxable. Now that Canadian parents and families are filling out their tax forms, they realize they actually have to give money back to the government. The $100 a month was really about $66 a month for some families. This is absolutely no choice because where can any Canadian family or parent find child care at $66 a month?</div>
    </p><a name="Para507634"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only choice that Canadian parents and families have been left with is that they can either stay at home or pay for child care out of their pocket, but the problem and the dilemma there is that there are no child care spaces. It is quite clear from this budget that the promise to Canadian families and parents for child care and the delivery of child care spaces was actually a smokescreen.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear throughout this Conservative budget that the government has failed Canada's most vulnerable. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can talk about the issue of foreign credential recognition.

They have not talked about establishing this agency.</div>

But the Conservative government has failed to get the job done and those new Canadians still continue to wait.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507641"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can talk about health care. The Conservatives talked about the implementation of a wait time guarantee, but it is quite unfortunate in reading the budget that health care was not one of their top priorities. Instead the Conservative government is trying to blackmail the provinces and territories into signing on by waving $612 million, but if they decline, that $612 million will go out the window. </div>
    </p><a name="Para507642"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians want to ensure that they have the most effective and efficient health care system, but the government must believe in that type of system. It must invest in health care to ensure that the wait times guarantee is actually implemented. Once again the Conservative budget failed in ensuring that they would deliver quality health care for Canadians across the country. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, it is clear that the Conservative government's budget was only good for one table around the country and that was for the CEOs who sit at the boardroom table, not for the average hard-working Canadian. The Conservatives have once again sidelined those who need the government most.</div>

When the Conservatives talk about the $2,000 tax credit and they talk about the fact that some families will get back $310, when we do the math it is about 80¢ a day. We cannot even buy a cup of coffee for 80¢. The families that really need it most, the lower income families, are not going to benefit from this.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507649"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the Conservatives really wanted to help lower income families, they would have ensured that they invested in the areas that are important to those low income families. They would have invested in the creation of child care spaces which would have ensured the empowerment of Canadian parents who want to be part of the workforce and also provide high quality child care.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507650"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must also say it was a Liberal government that actually ensured that Canada had one of the best financial records in the G-8. It was a Liberal government that delivered a $42 billion investment in health care to ensure that we would have a wait times reduction. It was a Liberal government in consultation with the provinces and territories that invested $5 billion in early learning and childhood development to ensure that we would invest in our future: our children.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, I would like them to tell me exactly how they would get this government-run child care system into every little rural spot of the country so that Canadian families who do not live in the big cities where the Liberals' friends are would be able to take advantage of some child care benefit that would have been offered to them by the failed Liberal government.</div>

We look for transparency and honesty in the books, and we do not get them. It struck me that when the Liberal government replaced the Conservative government there was a mantra that developed around the country that Conservative economics were about as phony as a $3 bill along with their NDP allies. Because of that alliance we are again heading in this direction.</div>

Over the course of that 13 year period when the Liberals were in government, there was an increase in the number of jobs being created. There was a total of about 250,000 to 300,000 new jobs being created every single year, so much so that there was a labour shortage all across the country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507696"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That came as a result of real hard facts, very good economic management and fiscal management of the books. We would not have seen this kind of nonsense in Liberal books, but it is back again in the Conservative books.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am going to suggest to all members opposite that they take a real close look at the vision of the country they are putting forward. One thing that emerges is that the Conservative government wants to wash its hands of all nation building instruments and the financial resources that are associated with those nation building instruments that make this country whole, together and tight. It has decided it wants nothing to do with government, and will let the provinces and the marketplace handle itself on its own. If people are looking for government, they should change the present one.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also knows that in the budget pension income splitting is provided for seniors, but if one earner's income is less than $36,800 a year, splitting that amount of pension does not benefit the families at all because they are already paying the lowest marginal tax rate.</div>

As an accountant, he understands who is going to profit by some of the tax measures, some of which are just simply rhetorical. There is a lot of smoke and mirrors as my colleague says from Vancouver, and she is absolutely right. It is mostly smoke but there are some mirrors. Some of the things the government has announced, re-announced, repackaged and re-announced again. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact of the matter is that people can say they have been given a $2,000 tax credit, but if they are not earning the money that is required to turn that into revenue, it is not real money. It is a boondoggle yet again. It is an opportunity for the minister to say that the government is taking care of everybody, but there is actually no money flowing.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the government is not going to give seniors an opportunity for income splitting that actually produces a real result, then it is nothing more than empty rhetoric, which is exactly what the government is doing.</div>

    </p><a name="Para507705"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I sit here as part of Canada's new government, I find it quite interesting to hear how the Liberals opposite always want to talk about the past. This budget is about the future. It is about the future and how it is going to benefit Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507706"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is about the future and how Canadian families are going to rise up beyond the shackles of the taxation that the Liberal Party foisted on them in years gone by. It is about how we are going to grow a country. It will be a nation of people working and thinking independently, where there is a freedom of thinking for people so that they can do things for themselves and do not need the government to do it for them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507707"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to highlight a few points that impact my constituents, the people of Brandon--Souris, in this particular budget, and I think the members opposite will probably see themselves in some of the reflections that I am going to relate to them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507708"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. member:</b> Tax those income trusts.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507709"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Merv Tweed:</b> Regarding agriculture, one of the largest portions of the economy in my community of Brandon--Souris, in 2006 this government committed to putting half a billion dollars into the agriculture program, and we have put $1.5 billion into it. We saw the need. We saw the hardship put on these farmers over the past several years by the empty promises of a Liberal government and we fulfilled our commitment. We have delivered three times what we promised and agriculture has finally started to see the light. The agriculture industry is looking forward to the opportunities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507710"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did we stop there? No. In this budget in 2007, we are increasing the amount by another $1 billion.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507711"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is going to go to immediate relief from the suffering they have endured over the last three or four years. We are going to add $600 million to a savings account that is going to be shared with the producers to offset some of the hurt they have in the shortfalls, in those times when depressed markets sometimes impact their ability to earn money. We are going to put in an immediate $100 million to offset some of the costs, particularly the costs that have gone up in the past several months.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507712"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only that, we are shining a light on the agricultural community, and that has not happened for years in this country with the previous government. I have never seen the optimism that I am seeing now in the communities I represent. With the announcements we made yesterday on renewable fuel production, our producers are fired up. They are optimistic. They are talking about the opportunities they have to become independent, to become part of an ownership team that is going to build and produce ethanol, the fuel of the future. Not only that, they are going to provide the food that feeds the world. They are going to see tremendous opportunities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507713"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We listened to the industry and what they asked us to do and this government has delivered it. I am looking forward to many new announcements in the constituency of Brandon--Souris and across Canada, where producers are stepping up to help themselves, to help their families and to help Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507714"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shilo is one of our largest employers. We are very proud to have these troops in our community. They represent many of the troops who have served in Afghanistan and who will continue to serve around the world. I would suggest that the men and women I represent from that community are no different from those on any of the other bases across Canada. These are proud men and women. For the first time in many years, they are seeing a government that is actually responding to their needs. For far too long we have sent these people into dangerous situations under-equipped and under-prepared. Now they are saying thanks to the Canadian government and saying that it has delivered.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507715"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this budget, we are delivering $60 million per year to bring the environmental allowances to soldiers. That basically means they are going to be equal to their comrades in the air force and the navy. They are going to get the pay they deserve for the dangerous positions that they put themselves in, not only in fighting for the rights and freedoms of Canadians but in fighting for the rights and freedoms of people around the world. I am very proud of them. I am very proud to be a part of a government that announces a budget that supports them, that hears what they have to say and that listens to their needs.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507716"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In dealing with our armed forces in this budget, we also are going to create five military operational stress injury units to deal with the impacts of what these young men and women go through when they have to go across the world to serve. We have to provide for them. This is going to deal with the stress injuries related to their service, but it will also provide support to their families.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507717"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also providing $19 million this year for the veterans ombudsman's office that is going to be established and $20 million per year after that to enforce and make sure that the veterans bill of rights serves the people that it was designed to serve.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to talk about infrastructure. The government has announced $16 billion more in this budget, bringing it to a total of $33 billion to help communities across Canada. The Liberals talked about it, but we delivered.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507719"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Communities across Canada are going to see their roads, highways, public transit, bridges, sewer and water systems and the green energy that we all want for Canadian communities and families. We are going to deliver it. This budget is getting it done for Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507720"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know I have limited time, but I do want to talk a little about families. I think it is important to look at what has been done and what more can be done for families across Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507721"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Budget 2007 provides $5.7 billion in relief to families and individuals. The budget will implement a $2,000 child tax credit. This will create $1.5 billion in new tax relief to families. The Liberals talked about it, but we delivered.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507722"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The budget announced $550 million for the WITB project, the working income tax benefit that the minister talked about. This project takes the people who are trying to push themselves over the welfare line to a working line without punishing them for doing it. This project helps them to make that step up. I support this.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507723"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last budget there was a decrease from 7% to 6% in the GST and we provided more than a billion dollars in tax relief to Canadian seniors and pensioners.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507724"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How does that impact Manitobans? Under restoring the fiscal balance, it will provide Manitoba with $3.1 billion of relief. I can tell the members opposite that even with a provincial NDP government Manitoba is thrilled with the government's announcement. The province is happy to work with us and happy to see what we are doing for the people of Manitoba. I am proud as well, because not only does it affect the people of Manitoba, but it also impacts the people of <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78716,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78716&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Brandon—Souris</A>, whom I represent.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507725"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this budget, we are talking about $1.8 billion in new equalization transfers. We are talking about $350 million in the Canadian social transfer, which includes additional funding for post-secondary education and child care.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507726"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are talking about $83 million for infrastructure. Does anyone realize how much that builds in a province like Manitoba? This is tremendous news.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507727"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are talking about $54 million from the Canada ecotrust for clean air and climate change.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507728"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Things are only getting better for the people of Manitoba, the people of <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78716,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78716&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Brandon--Souris</A> and, indeed, people all across Canada. </div>
    </p><a name="Para507729"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have committed $10.8 million over the next three fiscal years to the government of Manitoba to implement a human papillomavirus immunization program, which will combat cervical cancer. This is something that the province of Manitoba has asked this government to do and we are delivering.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507730"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government will contribute $170.5 million to complete the expansion of the Red River Floodway. I want to get into that just briefly. Talk about empty promises from the members opposite: the money pledged was never on the books of the Liberal government. The money was never there. This government found it and delivered it to the people of Manitoba. I am proud to be a part of that. When the members opposite talk about all the false promises that they have made to Canadians, they were just that, false promises.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507731"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Manitobans, the $2,000 child tax credit will save them $54.1 million. These are tremendous savings.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507732"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have pledged $16 million in additional corporate income tax relief from the temporary two year writeoff for manufacturing equipment. That is what manufacturers across Canada asked for. We delivered it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507733"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It only gets better for Canadians. It only gets better for Manitobans. It only gets better for the people of <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78716,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78716&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Brandon--Souris</A>.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507734"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In closing, I know I have limited time but I do want to talk briefly about what was alluded to by some of the members in almost a joking manner. It is with regard to the share of meal expenses that long haul truck drivers can deduct. In 1995, the Liberal government, in an attempt to slash and cut spending, did so with social transfers in health, and not only there: it did so on the backs of truckers. That government reduced truckers' ability to claim a per diem for their meals.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507735"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the largest trucking industries reside in the province of Manitoba. This is something that this industry asked us to do. The trucking industry asked us to look at it. The industry said that truckers had paid their share and had done their duty, done their time, and the industry asked the government to look at it. We did and we delivered on it. The people of Manitoba and the trucking industry across Canada will benefit from this.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If some members opposite think this is trivial, if they think it is a small amount, they should talk to the people involved who are going to receive this benefit. They are happy. Their families are happy. It puts more money in their pockets at the end of the day. That is what a budget is all about.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507737"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everybody wants to talk about what budgets do for people. If we allow people to have the money to make their own financial decisions at the end of the day, that is the sign of a good budget.</div>

    </p><a name="Para507747"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To begin, it is important to understand the context of the Kelowna accord. The <i>Meadow Lake Progress</i>, in its July 23, 2006 editorial, stated it best, “There is no underestimating the importance of the agreement”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507748"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Kelowna accord represents an historic consensus brought about by the commitment of the previous Liberal government to meaningfully engage and collaborate with first nations, Métis and Inuit leadership, along with the provincial and territorial governments, to address the challenges faced by aboriginal Canadians and by extension, Canada itself.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507749"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This effort, initiated by the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78571,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78571&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">LaSalle—Émard</A>, was unprecedented. It signified a high-water mark in aboriginal state relations. Never before had the political leadership of our country committed to moving together, setting meaningful benchmarks and stable funding relationships.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507750"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This historic consensus remains intact. All first nations, Métis and Inuit leadership as well as the premiers remain steadfastly committed to the Kelowna accord. Only the Conservative government lacks the commitment needed to meet its goals.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507751"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The support for the Kelowna accord is also unanimous with the provincial political leadership in Saskatchewan. The Saskatchewan Party, the NDP and the Saskatchewan Liberals are all resolutely in support of the Kelowna accord. In fact, the NDP government and the Saskatchewan Party opposition joined together in March 2006 to pass a unanimous motion in the Saskatchewan legislature, urging the federal Conservative government to fully implement the Kelowna accord. Saskatchewan has committed to the accord because it knows the potential of its aboriginal population and the opportunities it presents.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507752"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first nation and Métis population is the fastest growing segment of the Saskatchewan population. By 2045, the aboriginal population is set to be a majority in the province of Saskatchewan. This emerging population is well poised to become the leaders of a prosperous new Saskatchewan, particularly with baby boomers retiring and the economy in Saskatchewan and the west heating up. However, investments and strategies are needed to be put in place for education, housing, health and economic development.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507753"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Kelowna accord made those investments and allowed communities to design strategies to respond to their own unique challenges, something that is absolutely critical in giving and empowering the communities to come up with the solutions because this is from where the best solutions come. This is exactly what the Kelowna accord was designed to do. Moreover and more important, it set the stage for greater collaboration in the future, setting a road map for moving beyond the goals of Kelowna with a relationship based on mutual respect and recognition.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507754"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a disappointment that the Conservative government does not seem to understand the full opportunity to strengthen the economy in western Canada and engage first nations, Métis and Inuit people to their fullest capabilities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507755"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The July 23 <i>Meadow Lake Progress</i> editorial also captured the risks of abandoning the accord stating:</div>

</div>
    </p><a name="Para507758"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To allow that relationship to deteriorate now, after it has been slowly evolving and improving over the last 50 years, would be a terrible betrayal of the progress that been made by the first nations, the Métis and the Inuit of our country who at the table with the prime minister and the premiers of our country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507759"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This relationship has moved from first nations, Métis and Inuit being completely ignored by governments in the past to where they stood tall and demanded recognition, to a phase where mutual respect and collaboration became the norm. The Kelowna accord marked the culmination of this relationship building.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507760"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservatives' refusal to implement the Kelowna accord and their inability to form any sort of replacement plan is a huge disappointment, particularly because they promised to honour the goals of it.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, the abandonment of the Kelowna accord is only one aspect of a general larger backward trend of Conservatives choosing to become increasingly confrontational, ignoring their fiduciary duty to first nations, Métis and Inuit people.

In INAC alone, the Treasury Board estimates that $600 million is spent on administrative costs, and INAC admits only 82% of the grants and contributions actually make it out. </div>
    </p><a name="Para507766"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister is also mixing up the entire amount going to Métis and Inuit as well as first nations and ignores the cuts that have occurred without consultation or notice. For instance, budget 2006 dedicated only $150 million in new money for “aboriginal investments” as $600 million for housing was already dedicated through Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',1815922,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=1815922&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-48</A> and passed by the previous Liberal government. However, spending cuts, totalling at least $220 million directly, were imposed on aboriginal programs, including health and languages funding. This means that first nations, Métis and Inuit actually lost $70 million in funding last year, not even including the terrible loss that the Kelowna accord represents.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507767"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even more disappointing, the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',79007,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=79007&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Indian affairs minister</A> has made a bad situation worse by neglecting his fiduciary responsibilities. The <i>Calgary Sun</i> reported that a child and family welfare service executive in Calgary confirmed that INAC had been forced to redirect “non-core funding” such as those budgeted for child welfare to deal with the water crisis on reserves. Yet many communities are still under a boil water advisory and the minister has admitted he has failed in achieving his targets.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507768"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These meagre amounts in new spending for this year are an even bigger insult. They do not address population growth or inflation rates. They ignore the scope of housing, water, child welfare and health funding concerns evident in the first nations, Métis and Inuit communities. They do not make up for literacy and youth employment program cuts that had been made. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunities are still there, though. We encourage the government to respect and implement the Kelowna accord as it passes the House tomorrow night, as I am confident it will. However, regardless of the Conservatives' commitment to the Kelowna accord, the agreement still lives on as a goal and achievement. More than the funding, more than the benchmarks, the Kelowna accord represents a historic time when first nations, Métis and Inuit were respected and empowered to take leadership on behalf of their communities.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The so-called Kelowna accord is the product of a meeting held more than a year ago of the former prime minister, the provincial and territorial premiers and several national aboriginal leaders. </div>

The release lists several proposed investments that total more than $5 billion over a period of five years. </div>
    </p><a name="Para507777"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the former government says that it meant this to be a statement of the amount of money it wished to spend, there was no consensus among participants regarding how the money was to be disbursed. There was no detailed plan on how the government would allocate this new funding and how it would ensure that these resources would be spent wisely and produce measurable results.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507778"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, the provincial and territorial premiers and national aboriginal leaders who attended the Kelowna meeting clearly indicated in subsequent statements that considerably more work was needed to develop specific policies, programs and implementation plans.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507779"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The challenges that face aboriginal peoples in our country are simply too daunting to be overcome through unfocused, unaccountable spending. A more considered approach is required if we hope to improve socio-economic conditions and to ensure that aboriginal peoples have a standard of living comparable to that of other Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507780"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada's new government has developed and begun to implement precisely this type of approach. It is based on practical solutions, targeted expenditures, clear roles and responsibilities, measurable results and accountability, all fundamental elements of prudent, effective administration.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507781"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the short time this government has been in office, our pragmatic, results based approach has generated tangible results for aboriginal peoples. In fact, the number of achievements is too vast for me to recount in the time that is available to me this evening.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507782"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead, to illustrate the success of our approach, let me use the last time that the House debated Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2181694,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2181694&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-292</A>, on October 18, 2006, as a reference point. Let me share with the House just a few examples since that date of how this government has taken concrete steps to begin to improve the quality of life of aboriginal peoples in Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507783"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October 20, Bearspaw First Nation in Alberta opened a state of the art water treatment plant. This achievement stems directly from the plan of action to ensure safe water supplies for first nation communities announced by the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',79007,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=79007&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development</A> last March.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507784"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the House is no doubt aware, soon after this government came into office we learned that more than 200 first nations communities had drinking water systems that were classified as high risk or worse. To address this crisis, Canada's new government devoted some $450 million to address issues affecting quality of life, including safe drinking water.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507785"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to this vital budgetary measure, the minister and the Assembly of First Nations appointed a three member expert panel to provide legislative options for safe drinking water in first nations communities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507786"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On December 7, the minister tabled in the House the expert panel's findings and recommendations, along with a report that outlined progress made on all aspects of the government's plan of action. This includes the removal of several drinking water advisories, improvements to a number of water treatment plants, and increased assistance and training for plant operators. The minister is now considering the panel's recommendations and I expect we will be hearing more on the government's initiative.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along with helping first nations communities to overcome such crises, this government is working to ensure a brighter long term future for these communities. Indeed, when it comes to land claim settlements, we are living through an extraordinary period of Canadian history, particularly in British Columbia.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507788"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In recent months, negotiating teams have achieved a series of unprecedented agreements. </div>
    </p><a name="Para507789"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October 29, federal, provincial and first nations negotiators initialled the Lheidli T'enneh final agreement, the first settlement reached through the British Columbia treaty process. </div>
    </p><a name="Para507790"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On December 8, the minister was in Delta, B.C. to attend the initialling of the Tsawwassen First Nation final agreement, the first final agreement for a B.C. first nation whose traditional lands are situated in an urban area. </div>
    </p><a name="Para507791"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On December 9, the minister witnessed the initialling of the Maa-nulth First Nations final agreement, the first final agreement in British Columbia that involves more than one first nation community.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507792"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy to report that the successful resolution of land claims is not restricted to British Columbia. On December 1, the government signed a land claims agreement with the Inuit of Nunavik resolving a claim over offshore areas in northern Quebec and Labrador that had dragged on for more than 13 years.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507793"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada's new government has also partnered with first nation groups in Quebec to improve school performance among students from first nations communities in the province.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507794"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A landmark memorandum of understanding signed on October 26 will lead to incentives for first nation schools to create stimulating learning environments, enhance teaching quality and improve accountability to parents and students.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507795"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Education is also the focus of a historic bill that received royal assent on December 12 of last year. The First Nations Jurisdiction over Education in British Columbia Act will enable first nations communities in B.C. to assume increasingly greater control over on reserve education. It is an important step in ensuring first nation students receive a high quality education that respects their languages, cultures and traditions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507796"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On December 13, our new government introduced in the House another significant piece of legislation: Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2590516,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2590516&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-44</A>. By repealing section 67 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, the bill would ensure that all members of first nations communities will have the legal authority to defend their human rights, a power that all Canadians should be entitled to enjoy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507797"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite these and other significant achievements, I readily concede that much work remains to be done to ensure that aboriginal peoples have living standards comparable to those of other Canadians. Both the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> and the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78767,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78767&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development</A> recognize this fact but action to help aboriginal peoples achieve this objective does not come from legislation based on a news release presented at the close of a meeting.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507798"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Genuine progress is difficult. It requires clear thinking, diligent effort, patience and collaboration. Canada's new government will continue to work in concert with our aboriginal, provincial and territorial partners to achieve this progress. Together, we will create practical solutions. We will allocate appropriate funds. We will establish clear roles and responsibilities. We will set goals and we will achieve them.</div>

    </p><a name="Para507808"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The previous speaker thinks that there were no numbers to back up the Kelowna accord. How quickly he forgets what the people who were the driving force behind this accord told the committee.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507809"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is how the $5.098 billion in the accord was to be spent: $1.8 billion for education over the next five years. That is what first nations would have received for early childhood, primary, secondary and post-secondary education. There was $500 million for scholarships for post-secondary studies and training; $1.05 billion to promote innovation in on-reserve education; $150 million for off-reserve initiatives in the public school system; $50 million to improve education in the north; and $100 million to prepare children for school. That is what the accord included for education.<sup></sup></div>
    </p><a name="Para507810"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For housing, the Government of Canada would have invested $1.6 billion in improving housing conditions over the five years following the Kelowna accord.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1830"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1830"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1835"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1825"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1830">(1830)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para507811"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of that $1.6 billion, an amount of $600 million was planned for the transformation of social housing on-reserve; $300 million to support new federal-provincial-territorial partnership agreements for aboriginal housing off-reserve; and $300 million for housing partnerships. </div>
    </p><a name="Para507812"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As well, $400 million was planned for water supply and other infrastructure, as well as an acceleration of the first nations water management strategy. In addition, $1.3 billion was to be allocated for health programs over the next five years, including $870 million to stabilize the first nation and Inuit health system; and $445 million to promote transformation and to build capacity. </div>
    </p><a name="Para507813"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our neighbours across the way will say that no numbers were given, but that is false. </div>
    </p><a name="Para507814"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore, there is also the matter of economic development. The federal government was to invest $200 million over the next five years to promote the economic development of aboriginal people, including $12 million toward accelerating the regulatory regime under the First Nations Commercial and Industrial Development Act for commercial and industrial activities; and, $188 million for economic development framework initiatives. </div>
    </p><a name="Para507815"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I hear the present government tell us that no numbers were given, that it was put together haphazardly and that there is no obligation to respect it, I find that shameful. I hope that the first nations who are listening to us tonight heard clearly all the amounts that I have just quoted. I was not there when the Kelowna accord was signed but our research and the witnesses who testified in committee have enabled us to know exactly what amounts were involved. </div>
    </p><a name="Para507816"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If that was not enough, the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78571,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78571&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">LaSalle—Émard</A>—who was the Prime Minister of Canada when the Kelowna accord was signed—was asked whether, in addition to the $6 billion annual budget for the Department of Indian and Northern Affairs, he had included in his budget funding needed to implement this accord. His answer was “Yes”; he had allocated $1.2 billion per year for the next five years. </div>
    </p><a name="Para507817"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do the first nations need? They need $1.2 billion per year. Although the present government wants to make us believe otherwise, it has not invested an additional $1 billion in native peoples and nations.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507818"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are we doing? Not only are we creating a huge fiscal imbalance with regard to the first nations, but we are also creating a huge social imbalance. That is what the current government will have to address. </div>

There is an additional $150 million for the first nations. That is it. That is nowhere near the $1.2 billion per year. Given that the Kelowna accord was signed in November 2005, there should have been $1.2 billion in 2006, $1.2 billion in 2007, and we should have seen an additional $1.2 billion in the budget just tabled. We are not even close to the $3.6 billion that the first nations should have received. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to put some things in context. There are some fundamental differences in the understanding of what happened at that historic moment in Kelowna. I want to quote from Justice Thomas Berger's book <i>A Long and Terrible Shadow</i>. This is in the context of the Nisga'a agreement, but I think his analysis captures the challenges that are facing us. Justice Berger, in talking about Chief Justice Davey's inability to comprehend the true nature of native culture and native claims, said:</div>

<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>It results in an attitude toward Native people that exasperates them when it does not infuriate them. This attitude is sometimes manifested in an attempt to preserve Native culture and sometimes in an attempt to eradicate it, but it is always manifested in a patronizing way. It assumes that Native culture cannot be viable in a contemporary context. This is the crux of the matter. Native people insist that their culture is still a vital force in their own lives, that it informs their own view of themselves, of the world about them, and of the dominant society.</small></td>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That particular quote applies to the fact that there are Conservative members of the House who deny the reality of the important work that led up to Kelowna. They deny the reality of 18 months of work, when provinces, the federal government and native leaders from a number of organizations from coast to coast to coast met to talk about the elements that were important for people to come together and agree upon, to talk about the important elements around budgetary requirements. </div>
    </p><a name="Para507828"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservative government denies that oral tradition. It denies the validity of the handshake. It denies the validity of a consultation process. Instead, it quibbles about whether or not there was a signed document.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507829"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I know is that in the province of British Columbia where I live the premier of British Columbia, the former prime minister and the leadership council of British Columbia actually signed an agreement based on their understanding of what happened in Kelowna. They signed a tripartite agreement that transformed the discussions in Kelowna into tangible benchmarks. They had a plan. There were results that they were hoping to achieve through the efforts that happened in Kelowna.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507830"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we are facing here is a fundamental difference in a cultural approach. The Conservative government out of hand dismisses that cultural approach to negotiating a deal. I urge the Conservative members to take a second look at what is culturally appropriate for first nations, Métis and Inuit peoples across this country and accept the fact that there is a consultation process that can end up in tangible results that work for all parties.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507831"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is much material and numerous reports on the state of affairs in first nations, Métis and Inuit communities across the country. I could use up my entire time in talking about the desperate poverty, but I will only highlight a couple of points.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507832"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Assembly of First Nations issued a report, “Royal Commission on Aboriginal People at 10 Years: A Report Card”. Overall the government response over 10 years has been a dismal failure. Overall the report card was an F, a complete failure. I will talk about a couple of points here. It was a bit of a reality check. </div>

I would like to thank the members who voted for it. </div>
    </p><a name="Para507861"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to thank the aboriginal leaders, from coast to coast, who spoke publicly in favour of a fundamental improvement in the situation of their fellow citizens.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para507862"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Kelowna accord is not simply important because a group of people, the federal government, the prime minister, ministers, provincial and territorial premiers and leaders, and the leaders of Canada's aboriginal people, the Métis nation, the first nations, the Inuit, came together at Kelowna. It is important because at that historic moment the nation came together and said that the lack of decent water, the lack of decent housing and the lack of economic opportunity is not acceptable.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507863"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard members of the opposition parties speak here tonight. I would ask members of the government if they think it is acceptable that one million Canadians, the youngest and the fastest growing segment of our population, should at the same time have the highest incidence of infant mortality, the lowest life expectancy, that they should have the highest incidence of AIDS, tuberculosis and diabetes.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><a name="Para507864"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do they think the dropout rate among aboriginals in our country should be double—and almost triple— that of other Canadians?</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para507865"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kelowna is about saying to the youngest segment of our population that they have the right to the same educational opportunities as other Canadians. It says that in a world in which we must compete with other countries which are showing great productivity and great growth, we believe that every single Canadian counts.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507866"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kelowna is also about the way in which it was arrived at. Members of the current government witnessed it on television with their own eyes. All of the political leaders in this country came together to say that we will no longer impose upon the aboriginal communities of this country our way of looking at things, that we will work with them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507867"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kelowna is important for its objectives, but it is also important for the way in which it was arrived at, the 16 to 18 months of fundamental discussions in community after community, in province after province, in territory after territory, as to how in fact this great partnership between us as Canadians should work. That is what Kelowna is all about. </div>
    </p><a name="Para507868"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For members of the government to stand here and say that that never happened is a denial of a fundamental reality and a historic coming together.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507869"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very proud of the Kelowna accord and I am very proud of the members of Parliament who have supported it.</div>

    </p><a name="Para507884"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as I was concerned, the answers I received on November 28 were insufficient.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507885"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In March 2000, the U.S. government's “Country Reports on Human Rights Practices” severely criticized Beijing for “further backsliding on a dismal human rights performance”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507886"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there was some reason to hope that China's human rights record might be improving in light of the Olympic Games, it just does not seem to be the case.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507887"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that raising the issue of China's record on human rights is important and in fact critical, but the government's criticism is causing a communication breakdown between our countries.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507888"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A real dialogue about issues is not about accusations of cancelled meetings, using the press as the medium. It is an honest, open and accountable process that takes times and sets meaningful objectives.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507889"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, Huseyin Celil has been in prison for more than one year. We continue to call for a high level delegation to go to China. We do not want to send diplomatic officials to stake out the courtroom, as the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> has suggested. It seems to be less than appropriate to do that. We do want the Chinese government to take our demands very seriously.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507890"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to read for the information of the House some material posted in the <i>Toronto Star</i> and written by Errol Mendes. Entitled “China won't yield to lectures from us: Top Canadians and business leaders must persuade Chinese that their trade interests are best served when Beijing adheres to the rule of law”, the article stated that the Prime Minister recently expressed anger, doing so because:</div>

    </p><a name="Para507914"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we all know, this bill proposes the creation of a wage earner protection program for workers whose businesses have gone bankrupt.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507915"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For quite some time now, the Bloc Québécois has been working with the United Steelworkers on proposals to amend the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, in order to ensure that employee wages and pension funds are the first debts in line to be reimbursed when companies go bankrupt.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507916"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why the Bloc Québécois was eager to support Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',1859128,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=1859128&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-55</A> when it was presented in this House a year and a half ago, in spite of the bill's imperfections and our many reservations.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507917"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, certain principles of social justice were included in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',1859128,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=1859128&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-55</A>: employees must be paid for the hours they have worked; unlike large corporations, workers have nothing but their salary as a source of income; workers' pension funds are sacred.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507918"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the benefit of the people listening to us now so that they understand, I would just like to go back over the bill a little bit and especially the wage earner protection program. </div>
    </p><a name="Para507919"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The federal government would cover up to $3,000 of the unpaid wages due to employees when their employer goes bankrupt. The payments made under this program are taxable but take other contributions into account. </div>
    </p><a name="Para507920"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This means that regardless of the value of the employer’s property, employees will get most if not all their unpaid wages. The Department of Industry estimates that $3,000 will cover 97% of the unpaid wage claims. </div>
    </p><a name="Para507921"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In return, employees who receive a WEPP payment will have to forfeit to the federal government any right they have under the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act to file a claim up to the amount that they have already received from WEPP. The government would therefore be responsible for recovering the amount it paid to employees under WEPP. </div>
    </p><a name="Para507922"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was an acceptable mechanism, and although obviously unprecedented in Canada or Quebec, it was satisfactory. The advantage was that employees would be paid more quickly. There was also a little provision on the pension protection plan that was very welcome as well. </div>
    </p><a name="Para507923"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what happened to this bill? It passed unanimously in the House in November 2005, but then the new Conservative government that arrived on January 23, 2006 put it aside. </div>
    </p><a name="Para507924"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, every time I asked questions about it in the House, the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78744,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78744&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">labour minister</A> just said that it was coming. That is the answer I got last November 22.</div>
    </p><a name="Para507925"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So now I would like to know when it is coming. Can the parliamentary secretary tell me what is happening with this bill? When does he think he will come up with some solutions? There are between 9,000 and 10,000 commercial bankruptcies a year. </div>
    </p><a name="Para507926"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the current budget still contain the $32 million provision needed for the wage earner protection program? </div>
