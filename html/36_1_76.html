other flaws in the Liberal agricultural strategy will be raised 
by the farmers themselves.

are taking violence to a new level.  It is also further proof

participate in the public process.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the problem is not what happened when he was in private life. The 
problem is making a Senate appointment and the payback now that 
he is in public life as the Prime Minister of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He has been champing at the bit for years to put Ross 
Fitzpatrick in the Senate, since 1993 when he came to office. 
Even some Liberals thought that it was too soon and far too crass 
to put him in back then in 1993.  Now in 1998 he is in the 
Senate.  The appointment has been made.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is becoming very apparent that the government did 
use false information prior to and during the election campaign

his letter.  Furthermore the RCMP have demanded that the record 
be corrected and the minister has yet to comply.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The program was put together with the help of representatives 
of chambers of commerce.  If members visit the affected areas right

issue, which is critical to the business community.

complete reform.   If we were to name people who are elected in 
one province at this time, and we were to do that in all the 
provinces, what would happen is that the west, Alberta in 
particular, would always have only six seats in the Senate, while 
the maritimes would have 30.  That would be a big disservice 
vis-à-vis western Canada. We want a Senate that is reformed, that 
is elected equal and effective and not a third rate Senate as

double standard.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I have the pleasure today to present a number of petitions, with 
names gathered from all across Canada, from Canadians who are 
concerned about the multilateral agreement on investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are concerned that the MAI is the latest in a series of 
regional and global agreements which, in the name of liberalizing 
trade and investment, expand the powers of multinational 
corporations at the expense of the powers of governments to 
intervene in the marketplace on behalf of our social, cultural, 
environmental and health care goals.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They also submit that the MAI is fundamentally flawed in so far 
as it seeks to protect the rights of investors without seeking 
similar protection for workers through binding core labour 
standards and that the MAI is anti-democratic in so far as it 
would be binding for 20 years, thus tying the hands of several 
parliaments and future governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They therefore call upon Parliament to reject the current 
framework of MAI negotiations and instruct the government to seek 
an entirely different agreement by which the world might achieve 
a rules-based global trading regime which protects workers, the 
environment and the ability of governments to act in the public 
interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have many petitions to present.  Thousands of Canadians have

to assist provinces with upgrading substandard sections of the 
Trans-Canada Highway, and that the province of Saskatchewan, with 
six times the national average length of roads and highways per 
capita, cannot finance this necessary public work without a

regional and global agreements which, in the name of

multinational corporations at the expense of the powers of

seeks to protect the rights of investors without seeking similar

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>SMALL BUSINESS LOANS ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK209">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK210"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Fred Mifflin (for the Minister of Industry)</B> moved that 
Bill C-21, an act to amend the the Small Business Loans Act, be 
read the third time and passed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK211"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have an 
opportunity to speak at third reading of Bill C-21.  This is an 
important piece of legislation because it extends the Small 
Business Loans Act program and its funding for one year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members will know, a comprehensive review of the small 
business loans program is being done.  The legislation before us 
today allows the program to continue while this review takes 
place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me begin by emphasizing for those who have failed to 
understand that Bill C-21 is not a spending measure because the 
small business loans program is not a spending program.  It is a 
loan guarantee program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation extends the funding for the SBLA program by 
raising the aggregate lending ceiling under the SBLA by $1 
billion, from $14 billion to $15 billion.  The $15 billion figure 
contained in Bill C-21 does not mean that the government will be 
spending $15 billion.  It means that the government will be 
standing behind loans to the small business community that have a 
total value of $15 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members across the way have objected to this increase in the 
loans ceiling.  I caution them that should we fail to pass Bill 
C-21 we will place a severe handicap on the SBLA program, which 
serves Canada's small and medium size businesses well and 
provides much needed access to financing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In considering the desirability of this increase in the lending 
limit, we should recall the way the program authority works under 
the SBLA.  The act provides a total or aggregate authority for 
all SBLA loans made by participating financial institutions 
during a specified lending period.  Repayments of loans have no 
effect on the ceiling.  Neither do the defaults nor claims paid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The present lending period covers the years 1993 to 1998.  The 
total loans made to date now stand at more the $12.7 billion. 
They are expected to reach $13 billion by March 31, 1998. However 
current authority to register loans is capped at the $14 billion 
mark for this lending period.  If the House of Commons extends 
the current lending period to March 31, 1999, as is proposed by 
Bill C-21, we can expect further demands on loans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Based on our experience during 1997 and 1998 we expect financial 
institutions would make an additional $1.7 billion of loans under 
the act in the coming year.  This would increase total lending 
under the SBLA to $14.7 billion and exceed the SBLA's present 
authority of $14 billion.  Therefore, for lending to continue 
under the program during the entire extended lending period, an 
increase in the aggregate lending ceiling is required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given that loans are registered on an average three months after 
being made, at the time the $14 billion ceiling is reached 
several hundred loans may already have been made to small 
businesses that the SBLA would not be able to register without 
the increased lending ceiling.  This would certainly lead lenders 
and borrowers to re-examine these loans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without the additional $1 billion of lending authority, a great 
many small businesses would not be able to count on the SBLA to 
support their loans.  This may cause major disruptions to 
entrepreneurs and businesses across Canada.  That is why Bill 
C-21 proposes to raise the lending ceiling to $15 billion.

<A HREF="#LINKT18"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Assuming we see the same rate of lending as last year, this 
would leave a modest cushion of $300 million between the 
estimated need and the total cap.  This excess is quite small 
when we take the range of possible fluctuations into account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to address another key issue that has been debated 
at length.  That is the issue of incrementality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question has been raised as to whether these loans are well 
targeted or would they have been made by the financial 
institutions even without the SBLA program. There is no doubt 
that some loans have been guaranteed which might have been made 
otherwise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The SBLA provides an insurance program against default, not a 
spending program.  Under it, private sector lending institutions 
assess businesses and make loans.  The federal government then 
stands behind the defaulted loans by paying 85% of losses on SBLA 
registered loans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like many other insurance programs, the SBLA pools risk across 
thousands of users.  This of course diminishes risk; however it 
does not eliminate it for SBLA lenders.  The applicants to which 
the banks made loans under the SBLA are otherwise creditworthy 
but tend to be start up companies or firms with low capitalized 
assets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As with insurance of any kind, there are likely to be some loans 
that actually do not need insurance.  For the most part these are 
loans that are less likely to default and therefore they do not 
cost the taxpayer. In fact a certain percentage of 
non-incremental loans actually help make the program affordable 
and sustainable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is extremely relevant to point out that since the government 
took office we have taken steps to move the program toward cost 
recovery.  Since 1995, firms that benefit from the SBLA must pay 
fees that are designed to recover the cost of loans claims. 
Therefore any business that uses the program even if it does not 
need the SBLA loss insurance is in effect sharing the risk of 
lending to small businesses which need the program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Industry Canada will be tracking this issue closely to measure 
the effect of user fees on the incrementality of the program.  In 
the meantime our comprehensive review will certainly be examining 
the matter in detail.  The comments made by members opposite in 
this House I am sure will be brought up in the Standing Committee 
on Industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That brings me to a final point.  This government has been 
proactive in working to constantly update and improve the small 
business loans program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to the move toward cost recovery, Industry Canada 
has taken significant administrative steps to improve the 
efficiency and productivity of the program, such as cutting 
claims audit times by two-thirds and thereby mitigating costs to 
taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We intend to continue this work under the comprehensive review. 
The valuable ideas and suggestions of all members of the Standing 
Committee on Industry will be carefully considering the total 
review. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary I remind hon. members that the statistics indicate 
the program is working well.  It is a good program with broad 
support among the business community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995-96 more than 30,000 firms used the SBLA to improve their 
businesses.  They created an estimated 73,000 jobs according to 
the loan applicants themselves, the people who should know best. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also reiterate that Bill C-21 does not make further 
spending requests.  The amended lending ceiling and the one year 
extension are necessary to continue the valuable loan guarantee 
program while the comprehensive review takes place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have mentioned over and over, this comprehensive review 
will be done in an orderly fashion.  Hopefully we can get it to 
the standing committee early this fall. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe that this House wants to leave our small 
business community in the lurch by cutting off this very useful 
and necessary means of access to financing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For these reasons and for the benefit of Canada's small business 
community, I would ask all members to support this bill so that 
we can pass it in the House and forward it on to the Senate. Then 
we can get on to the comprehensive review as we have discussed 
over and over in this House.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron (Fundy—Royal, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is 
with pleasure that I rise today to debate the conclusion of Bill 
C-21 which is known as an act to amend the Small Business Loans 
Act.  We found out during the previous debate last month and on 
review of the auditor general's report that the bill would be 
better identified as the small business loans act with need of 
substantial review and improvement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill was labelled by many as a bill that lacked performance 
indicators and a bill excessively responsive to lending 
institutions rather than responsive to the lending needs of small 
business.  This legislation has always operated with a sunset 
clause to ensure periodic review for improvement and assessment 
on whether the bill is meeting the needs of small business, not 
merely renewal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On our assessment as well as the auditor general's, the bill is 
in need of improvement and the return to its original focus. This 
government has yet to make up its mind on what it wants to do 
with the act in the first place.  As a result of its indecision 
it has requested that Parliament renew the act as is for another 
calendar year while it continues to review the program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is with regret that we support this legislation only because 
without it as of March 31, 1998 the current lending period would 
cease and SMEs, small and medium enterprises, would not have 
access to capital under the SBLA, the Small Business Loans Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However this government should not expect the support of my 
caucus colleagues or for that matter the small business sector 
unless this government begins to review, improve and update this 
act to ensure that appropriate access to capital is afforded to 
the real engine of job creation, that being the small business 
sector of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would hate to sound cynical but I am really worried given this 
government's reluctance to establish specific debt reduction 
targets. As well as its reluctance to reduce taxation, broad 
based tax reduction for both consumers and small business, the 
government's plan to create more small business is to continue to 
tax us to death so that more large and medium size businesses 
become small companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has missed a real opportunity to show SMEs that 
they are indeed serious about the concerns that SMEs face today. 
In fact they are not alone as the auditor general has pointed out 
in his recent report on this piece of legislation. In section 
29.87 he states that new lending under the program will end as of 
the 31st of March, 1998 unless the government decides to renew 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This presents an excellent opportunity to review the program's 
contribution to filling current financing gaps and stimulating 
economic growth and creating jobs.  The auditor general goes on 
to say the review would also enable Industry Canada to assess 
whether the program meets the needs of the small business sector 
in a rapidly changing economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should not have wasted this opportunity to improve the act. 
This government was criticized for the very fact that this red 
book promise was broken by its own rank and file in the preamble 
to a priority resolution at the October 1996 convention:  “The 
banks and other financial institutions have not yet taken any 
concrete steps to alleviate the hardships faced by the small and 
medium sized firms in obtaining investment capital”.  Those are 
the words of the Liberal Party of Canada, not ours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my previous statement at second reading, I outlined a number 
of observations and recommendations within the Report of the 
Auditor General.  I was pleased to hear during the debate that 
the industry minister agrees with the observations of the auditor 
general's report. I would like to take this opportunity to 
reiterate the minister's statements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister stated “The auditor general's report would be a 
very useful tool as we review the SBLA and design ways to make 
the Small Business Loans Act even better in the future.  A one 
year extension of the act will provide the time needed to 
complete the review of the program”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before we further discuss the necessary initiatives required to 
improve this bill, it would be useful for us to remind ourselves, 
in particular those on the opposite side of the floor, the impact 
the small business sector has.

<A HREF="#LINKT20"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>More than 98% of all businesses in Canada are small businesses 
with employees of less than 50 in number.  Half of Canada's 
workforce is employed by the small business sector. It is widely 
recognized that the small business sector has had the greater 
proportion of new job creation in recent years, as the auditor 
general pointed out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Small businesses play a very significant role in our economy. 
They are the heart of economic activity and community 
development.  In addition they sometimes develop into large firms 
of the future, as long as they are not taxed to death and there 
is more disposable income in Canadians' pockets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Small businesses contribute 43% of Canada's private sector 
economic output.  With this in mind it is imperative that as 
legislators we ensure that small businesses have access to 
reasonable financing to ensure the growth of this critical sector 
of our economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the minister stated, the original Small Business Loans Act 
was introduced in 1961, as I said before, even before I was born. 
However since then the objective and the focus of the bill has 
been greatly distorted.  The bill no longer serves as a loan 
guarantee for small business; rather it serves as a loan 
guarantee program for banks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The intent of the act was simple:  to provide small business 
with access to capital for loan requirements that would not be 
considered under normal lending circumstances.  The federal 
government would in turn guarantee these incremental loans.  That 
is the issue in play here, it is a loan guarantee for incremental 
loans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the years nearly 40% of the loans that fall under the SBLA 
are loans that would be granted anyway by lending institutions. 
Those are not my words, they are the words of the auditor 
general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The original intent of the legislation was to ensure that 
incremental loans to small business were approved in exchange for 
the business sector being willing to pay a higher rate of 
interest and even a fee for the access to incremental financing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As mentioned, the two amendments we voted on just the other day 
relate to the continuation of the bill as well as to increase the 
ceiling of the total amount of the loans from $14 billion to $15 
billion.  Four times the federal government has had to increase 
the ceiling on the total amount of loans.  One would think with 
this kind of exponential increase that small business would 
actually have access to financing and that small business 
financing would no longer be a problem.  I know the member for 
Kings—Hants would actually put that logic into play. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I would like to state to my colleague that the Canadian 
Federation of Independent Business stated that the rejection rate 
of loan requests was actually 2% higher in 1997 than it was in 
1987.  Who was in government in 1987?  It was the Progressive 
Conservative Party of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CFIB also indicated that 29% of business owners surveyed in 
1997 said that availability of credit is still the most serious 
business concern they have.  This is double the concern they 
expressed in the late 1980s, according to the CFIB.  These are 
not just my words. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I challenge the government to return to the original intent of 
the SBLA in providing incremental financing to small business 
when they re-enter the bill as the Progressive Conservative Party 
advocates, as do the CFIB and the auditor general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The overall theme of the auditor general's report and my 
principal concern is that Industry Canada does not have the 
performance indicators and benchmarks to properly assess whether 
the act is actually accomplishing its original objective, that of 
providing incremental financing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The program's raison d'être is to help fill existing financing 
gaps for business.  Without true financial support and adequate 
financing for growth of our small business sector, growth will be 
stunted within our economy and the future prosperity of Canada 
can be threatened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I earlier indicated, the principal problem with the act is 
that it lacks clear objectives and performance indicators and 
benchmarks to measure the success and effectiveness of the 
legislation.  The government could benefit from the old adage, 
what gets measured gets done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I stated earlier, the bill was first passed in 1961 yet the 
type of business that would likely have been started back then 
was either retail based or perhaps light manufacturing. 
The Canadian economy has greatly changed over that period of 
time.  Now we have different sectors such as the service sector, 
the knowledge and information sector which form a much greater 
part of the economy today, with the latter sector having a high 
net employment growth.  It is imperative that when the act is 
reviewed the government ensures there are innovative solutions 
and commitments from lenders that address this need.

<A HREF="#LINKT21"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The greatest concern that we have today is that the original 
intend of the program was to provide incremental financing and 
access to capital to start-up ventures or small firms that would 
not otherwise have been granted a loan from today's lending 
regulations.  The relative size of the loans was intended to be 
small so borrowers could handle a higher rate or a fee in 
exchange for a loan that did not tie up their leverage of their 
personal guarantee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The result today is that given the expansion of the program it 
is now beginning to displace traditional lending rather than 
enhancing marginal loan volumes and filling gaps where small 
venture loans are required.  Given that 90% of the loan was to be 
guaranteed, the lending institution would then consider engaging 
in that loan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we are getting to a situation, instead of having small size 
loans, where some of the loans are actually teetering on over a 
quarter of a million dollars. I am not advocating that we 
necessarily hamstring the SBLA in terms of actually having a 
smaller cap, but the emphasis has to be on more marginal 
financing, incremental financing, as opposed to getting into 
these larger type loans.  At the end of the day these are the 
kinds of loans the banking institutions would actually approve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will take this opportunity to discuss a lot of other things 
which affect the small business sector and the SBLA.  Unlike the 
Reform Party yesterday, I am not necessarily interested in tying 
up a entire day of speaking time on an issue.  I would rather 
talk about issues that Canadians are actually concerned about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk about small business. One of the Reform Party's 
founding principles is its members are here to represent their 
constituents.  If one asks the CFIB whether the small business 
sector likes the SBLA, it will state it is a program it is very 
much aware of. It believes it is key to financing within the 
small business. It is very important. This is whether you are in 
Atlantic Canada, Quebec, Ontario or the west. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Reform Party is truly representing its constituents I 
suggest it actually votes for the SBLA amendment tonight so we 
can continue on with the process of this bill. Otherwise one of 
its founding principles of representing its constituents has been 
thrown to the wayside. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some other initiatives in terms of what this 
government has to do in order to make the small business sector 
more competitive.  The Canadian economy is very overtaxed.  After 
the budget was tabled the Canadian Chamber of Commerce tabled a 
press release in response to the budget.  In the press release it 
challenged the government to draw up a detailed fiscal framework 
for the new millennium based on clear criteria for growth, 
competitiveness and opportunity rather than arbitrary commitment 
to allocate half the surplus to spending and half to debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The small business sector is still way overtaxed. 
In our election campaign we wanted to move the small business tax 
rate from 12% down to 8% which would make some marginal business 
plans into more profitable business plans and actually put more 
money back into small business pockets.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to lower EI premiums for small businesses.  Right now 
the EI program has a $7 billion surplus annually which actually 
belongs in the pockets of employees and employers.  What this 
actually does is taxes every new job is created. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this same communique the Canadian Chamber of Commerce stated 
that if the EI premium were reduced to $1.95 instead of the 
present $2.70 per $100 of insurable earnings, every medium size 
company across Canada would be able to hire at least one 
additional person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that all taxes kill jobs but payroll taxes at the end of 
the day are actually more punitive than any other tax initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we challenge this government to do, when it is reviewing 
the SBLA, is to review all the issues that affect the small 
business sector.  People may ask if the fund is sustainable if we 
lower the EI premium from $2.70 down to $2.00.  The chief actuary 
for the government stated that if it were lowered from $2.70 down 
to $2.00 it would be able to withstand a severe recession.  That 
is an initiative that the Progressive Conservative Party clearly 
advocates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also know that the only economies which have any kind of 
consistent growth are those economies that have less debt and 
less tax.  In order to reduce the overall tax burden of our 
country, we need to lower the debt.  That is why the Progressive 
Conservative Party advocates lowering the debt to 60% of GDP by 
the year 2000 and to 50% by the year 2005.  It goes back to my 
adage of what gets measured gets done.  By saying we will put 
half on new spending, half on new debt and half split between 
debt and tax reduction, at the end of the day I get very worried 
about that.  Canada will not have a surplus if that kind of 
approach is taken because at the end of the day we will end up 
spending it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need less debt and taxes.  We recently had a budget where the 
government raised the personal exemption from $6,500 to $7,000. 
That took 400,000 Canadians off the tax rolls who should not have 
been there in the first place.  What we advocate is that is not 
nearly enough.  We want to raise the personal exemption to 
$10,000 which would take two million Canadians off the tax rolls 
overnight who simply should not have been there in the first 
place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Budgets are more than just about numbers.  They are about values 
we share as as nation.  By that I mean that it is very 
troublesome from the standpoint that we actually tax individuals 
who earn $14,000 less than the poverty line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We challenge this government to develop a plan for growth in 
this country based on less debt, less tax and putting more 
disposable income back into the pockets of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I know as the fiscal conservative that you are, you 
can actually understand that Canadians are poorer today than they 
were approximately eight years ago.  I know the hon. members over 
here will understand that the disposable incomes of Canadians has 
gone down 6% since 1990.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to ensure that we put more disposable income back into 
Canadians' pockets so that more individuals can have an 
opportunity to participate in the economy in general.  The only 
way to do that is to provide Canadians with broad based tax 
relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is with regret that we are voting for a bill because the 
government did not take advantage of the last five years to 
seriously look at the SBLA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government knew it had to be reviewed, but all of a sudden 
it came to a stage and said “oops, the bill is coming up for 
renewal, what are we going to do about it?”  Instead it said it 
would wait for the report of the auditor general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find this kind of perplexing because yesterday the finance 
minister wrote a letter to the auditor general saying that they 
are not so keen on some of his work.  On the other hand right 
now, they are saying they want to wait for the report of the 
auditor general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Kings—Hants made a comment that I will address 
later. What I am trying to say is that if there is one credo this 
government can be described by, it is that sometimes it makes it 
up as it goes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This Small Business Loans Act really is an example of that.  It 
is oops, do you mean we actually have to review a bill?  What we 
are going to do is ask for another year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that the government, in good faith, is going to take a 
serious look at the auditor general's report and act on some of 
those initiatives as opposed to making it up as it goes. We saw 
that in Kyoto.  Sadly, we also saw it in the unity issue in 1995 
during the referendum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need more planning and less improvization.  We also saw it 
again with a provocative approach regarding the supreme court 
reference.  It comes down to exactly what the member for 
Kings—Hants states, brinksmanship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The supreme court reference kicks a hornets nest.  It does not 
tell us anything that we do not know. The government has chosen 
to play Lucien Bouchard's game of getting this kind of issue back 
on the national agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason the government is doing that in the absence of plan A 
is that it tried to come up with a kind of plan B. There is no 
such thing as plan B.  There is no Canada unless we have our 
territories and all 10 provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I challenge this government to do two things.  The first is to 
develop an approach or a plan for growth for our country based on 
less debt, fewer taxes, more disposable income into Canadians' 
pockets so that more Canadians can participate in the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, have more planning and less improvization as we saw in 
Kyoto, as we saw in the unity issue and as we see here in the 
SBLA or even in the postal strike. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am looking forward to the bill being tabled in its new form in 
the coming days.

</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK218">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-21, an 
act to amend the Small Business Loans Act, be read the third time 
and passed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK219"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, why is 
it so rare for a government program to shrink as opposed to grow? 
I have only been here a short while.  I am tender in my years. 
Some would say that I am chronologically challenged.  However, 
having been here for as long as I have, I have noticed that 
things rarely tend to shrink around this place.  They generally 
tend to get bigger as opposed to getting smaller.  That is 
exactly the case with the Small Business Loans Act which we are 
debating today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask myself why that is.  I look at the department which I 
critique.  It is a $57 billion monster that started off very 
small, but then grew and grew over time to become the biggest 
department in government.  The Department of Human Resources 
Development now has a budget of $57 billion.  It is the biggest 
monstrosity of a department there is within the federal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could document this process with other departments, but let 
us take a curious look at what has happened with the Small 
Business Loans Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the government started with the intention that small 
businesses in Canada are a major job engine and that they should 
be helped.  Everybody agrees that small businesses are a job 
engine in this country, but let us look at what type of help the 
government has actually stepped in with, at what benefit its 
intrusion has provided. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We always ask the question:  Who wants it?  Do they actually 
want the help?  There are many small business owners in this 
Chamber.  Mr. Speaker, you may be one of them.  If we were to ask 
small businesses what— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  He makes bread. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders:</B>  That's right.  Making bread is a good 
idea.  There is nothing wrong with making bread.  Bread is not a 
dirty word. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We ask ourselves if small businesses want the Small Business 
Loans Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked some of my friends who I went to high school with about 
this.  I will tell the story of Mike Nyhus, a fellow who I went 
to high school with.  He started a very successful construction 
company.  Mike was never a Reformer when we attended high school 
together, but he has changed because he is now out in the 
workforce making money and paying other people's salaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked Mike how we could change things to make them better for 
him so he could employ more people.  He told me that his biggest 
problem was the red tape and the administrative nightmare he has 
as a small business person.  He said that his biggest problems 
were looking after the GST and all the paperwork, as well as the 
payroll taxes, including the Canada pension plan and employment 
insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last time I heard word of him, Mike said that he could hire 
five people, but he did not do that.  His business could afford 
to hire five more people, but he said that the administrative 
nightmare was preventing him from hiring them for his business in 
my riding of Calgary West. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I look at that I say shame on the government.  Its whole 
idea behind this is that it can toss more money at a problem and 
make it go away.  That is exactly what it wants to do with Bill 
C-21.  The government hopes that by increasing the taxpayer 
liability from $14 billion to $15 billion it will magically 
create more jobs and help taxpayers and small businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look to the businesses that this loans program is aimed 
at, 40% of the businesses that receive loan guarantees under the 
Small Business Loans Act actually did not need to have the loan 
guarantees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Do you mean it's a subsidy? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders:</B>  It's a subsidy.  That's right.  I hear 
other members across the way and within the Chamber who are 
finally realizing that this is actually a subsidy.  I thank other 
members for pointing this out, for noting it and for being 
concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is actually a subsidy.  They do not actually need it.  It is 
a case of profitable companies which could go ahead and find the 
resources and the guarantees they need through other mechanisms. 
They are getting these things and they do not actually need them. 
Government is trying to solve a problem where a problem does not 
exist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real problem is that small businesses have an administrative 
nightmare, red tape, payroll taxes and high taxes generally which 
prevent them from hiring more people.  That is the obstacle to 
more jobs in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember during the last election campaign that I heard 
“jobs, jobs, jobs” from the Liberals. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1605"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT25"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was a young lad at the time of the 1993 election, but if I 
think back I heard something then, and it was jobs, jobs, jobs. 
If I think about it again— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  They said that for two elections? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders:</B>  The member is right.  It was the same 
people.  It was the Liberals. They said jobs, jobs, jobs in both 
elections.  Yet, instead of creating jobs, instead of actually 
lowering EI premiums in this country—and I would like to point 
this out because I am getting some cat calls from across the 
way— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  A million new jobs.  We gave you a job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders:</B>  That's right.  I am going to stick it on 
him, because it looks good on him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals have milked $14 billion out of businesses in this 
country in overpayments on EI.  As a matter of fact, if we take 
how much Albertans overpay in EI taxes—and I want Mike Nyhus and 
other people in Calgary West to pay attention—they are paying 
$833 million more per year than they are actually collecting in 
EI premiums.  That is their overcontribution.  It is not how much 
they are paying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we broke that down for every single worker in Alberta, which 
has a workforce of roughly one million people in a province of 
about two and a half million to three million people, it 
represents about $833 per individual.  Everyone who is working in 
the Alberta workforce is being milked hard by this government by 
over contributing to employment insurance.  That is what this is 
coming down to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of giving taxpayers $1 billion in liability in the Small 
Business Loans Act, creating a bigger hole in my pocket, a bigger 
hole in my wallet, creating more administration and giving out 
more loans and loan guarantees to businesses that do not actually 
need loan guarantees, why does the government not do what 
businesses are calling for and cut EI premiums, cut CPP taxes, 
cut taxes generally and help businesses that way?  That is what 
businesses are calling out for.  It is not just me.  I am not 
delusional over here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Federation of Independent Business, a business 
lobby group, an organization that represents small businesses in 
this country, is calling for these changes.  It is calling for a 
lowering of taxes.  It is not just me calling on this side of the 
House, it is the CFIB which represents businesses from coast to 
coast to coast in this country which is calling for those 
reforms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also another fundamental question.  One of the first 
questions I asked was:  Why is it so rare for a government 
program to shrink?  The other question I asked was:  Who wants 
it?   Not the small businesses.  Forty per cent of them are 
eligible to get loans in other places and do not need the loan 
guarantees.  The government is trying to solve a problem that 
does not need to be solved for those businesses.  It basically 
amounts to a business subsidy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third question is:  Who is going to pay for it?  This is the 
real travesty.  Other businesses are going to have to pay for 
this increase in taxpayer liability to help out their 
competitors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the government always meddling in banking like this? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to tell members another story because the government 
needs to know some of its other foibles.  If it knew more it 
might not pass these things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Federal Business Development Bank has billions of dollars in 
assets.  Once again, when it first started this noble concept, 
the concept that warmed the cockles of the government's heart, it 
was to help invigorate and open new businesses and set up 
avant-garde enterprises.  It would be the cutting edge.  But 
politics got in the way.  It realized that it actually had to 
make safe investments.  As a matter a fact, it started making 
safer investments than what the chartered banks in this country 
make.  Why?  Because it was worried about the political 
ramifications, that it would be smeared with making bad loans. 
Goodness knows, the government has all sorts of experience in 
making bad loans.  It would not want any more of that, would it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are billions of dollars of taxpayers' assets with the 
Federal Business Development Bank.  What does it do?  It intrudes 
into what other private sector institutions would be able to lend 
out.  It goes ahead and takes taxpayers' money, sweat-soaked 
dollars, and it gives it out to businesses through the Federal 
Business Development Bank.  It is intruding on loans that private 
sector institutions, the chartered banks in this country, would 
be able to make.  It is so conservative with its loans that it 
does not come close to serving the original mandate of giving out 
that money to entrepreneurial, avant-garde, cutting edge 
businesses.

<A HREF="#LINKT26"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, who is going to pay for it?  The businesses that 
receive these loans are going to be subsidized by their 
competitors who are paying these high taxes and they themselves, 
if they become profitable, will be the ones who will be anteing 
up money for this poncy scheme.  It is a joke. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have asked four questions.  Surely if I was to ask five or 
six questions the government would tuck its tail between its 
legs, walk out of this place and forget that Bill C-21 was ever 
raised in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But I am going to press on.  I am going to hope. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Question number five is:  Does it actually solve the problem? 
No, it does not.  If the problem is that there are not enough 
jobs in the country, then surely Bill C-21 is not going to solve 
the question of the high unemployment rates this government has 
been pregnant with for all of its time in office, after promising 
jobs, jobs, jobs.  No, it has not realized the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is that it has this red tape, this bureaucracy and 
high taxes.  Even its own members have admitted that taxes are 
too high in the country.  It hushes it up now, pulls its foot out 
of its mouth and buries it.  But, indeed, people across the way 
admit that taxes are too high in the country.  The Liberals know 
it and they know they should be lowering taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish, I pray, that during my time in the House I will see it 
happen in a real substantive way, as opposed to seeing just lip 
service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does it solve the problem?  No, it does not solve the problem. 
The government is not creating more jobs by going ahead with 
this. Indeed, it overinflates.  This is not the first time.  It 
is not the only time and it probably will not be the last, sadly 
enough.  But it overinflates for every single job that may be 
created as a result of the Small Business Loans Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I have to come down to trusting the credibility of the 
auditor general or the credibility of the government, some of its 
spokespeople and ministers on this subject, I will take that of 
the auditor general.  Call me a skeptic, but I will trust the 
auditor general before I will trust the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even the auditor general admits that the government over reports 
the success five times, not twice.  For every single job created 
it reports five.  That is how embarrassing the track record is. 
It over reports five times the success of any type of job 
creation program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was question number five. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely by now the government argument on Bill C-21 is full of 
holes and the taxpayer will have to pay more money.  All of this 
is bleedingly obvious, but I am going to go on to point number 
six.  This one will severely Swiss cheese the government's 
argument. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Question number six is:  Would it pass the judgment of fellow 
businesses?  Once again we look at the CFIB survey of businesses 
in the country.  The CFIB is not calling for an expansion of the 
Small Business Loans Act or a hike in CPP premiums.  That 
federation is not calling for the government to continue taking 
$7 billion a year more in employment insurance contributions than 
it needs.  The CFIB is not asking for more regulation.  It is not 
asking for the 38 tax increases brought in since this government 
came to office in 1993.  The CFIB is not begging and pleading for 
any of those things, yet the government keeps on delivering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federation is asking for a cut in EI premiums.  It is asking 
for a cut in taxes that is long overdue and well deserved. That 
is what it wants.  That is what will pass the judgment of fellow 
Canadians and fellow businesses.  That is what is going to create 
jobs.  That is what will deliver on Liberal election promises, 
instead of the pandering and dribbling and “drabbling” out. 
That is where the real success story lies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Shame on the government.  By increasing the liability for 
taxpayers with Bill C-21 the government is not solving the 
problem which it intends to solve.  It is not speaking to the 
issues it would love to actually be able to say it is addressing. 
It is actually creating a higher, larger liability for taxpayers. 
It is growing a government program and it is not doing the 
service it should be doing for Canadian taxpayers. Shame on it. 
Bill C-21 should go back to the drawing board and be reformed. 
Shame on the Liberals.

additional $1 billion should be made available for other loans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general reported on this and we read his remarks 
very carefully. He suggests changes, and I will come back to this 
a bit later on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An in-depth review of the program is required.  The Minister 
of Industry undertook to have one carried out, so that it would not 
be necessary, as in other years, including last year, to come back 
to the House each time in order to add another $1 billion and to 
extend the existing program for another year.  The Minister of 
Industry agreed to allow the Standing Committee on Industry and 
experts from the department to review the program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that the business community, people representing SMBs 
in all sectors of Canada, will be consulted, and that people from 
Quebec and elsewhere will be able to come and testify. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have already heard from the Canadian Bankers Association 
and the Canadian Federation of Independent Business. 
These organizations recommend a formal review of this program.  It 
will soon be the year 2000.  As everyone knows, the economy is in 
full transition and, unfortunately, the transitions are occurring 
with greater frequency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past, we saw transitions perhaps every 25 years.  Now, 
economic cycles are much shorter in length, seven years they say. 
In the era of globalization, high tech equipment, and so on, people 
are realizing that SMBs are undergoing transitions even more 
frequently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The questions asked by the auditor general are extremely 
important ones. Of course he wants to see more control over what 
it costs the government to compensate lenders, because a certain 
number of borrowers, approximately 5% when it comes to small and 
medium-sized businesses, do not pay back their loans.  The 
auditor general feels that the auditing procedures for these 
requests for compensation must be tightened up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also says that the interest the government would have to 
pay on compensation must be reduced to a minimum.  This needs to be 
reviewed.  I would point out that, with respect to student loans, 
the Quebec Minister of Education tried to avoid taking anything for 
granted and decided to renew annually all procedures and mechanisms 
relating to loans from the caisses populaires and the banks. He 
succeeded in the end in saving money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe there is always a way for governments to save money, 
and this money of course belongs to the taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion, the most important element in what the auditor 
general says is that there must be a more stringent assessment of 
the program's impact on job creation.

<A HREF="#LINKT28"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those who have spoken before me have addressed this point a 
little, but I would like to take a different tack than the Reform 
member.  I feel this review is worth a serious effort.  In the 
final analysis, if we want small businesses to have access to 
guaranteed loans, we must remember that what everyone really wants 
is to see as many jobs created as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The jobs created must be quality jobs.  It is all very fine to 
create jobs, but the statistics are often misleading or incomplete. 
The type of jobs created, the salary, and whether these are 
permanent or part time jobs must all be looked into. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have to consider whether these jobs are in sectors 
that will last, because, as you know, a lot of small businesses are 
failing.  Most bankruptcies occur in the first year of business. 
However, in 75% or 80% of the cases, they happen within the first 
three years.  This is where we must pay particular attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given all the good that this bill can do for business, and I 
think we must not lose sight of this fact, we are obliged to 
support it.  In the past fiscal year, 34,000 SMBs across Canada 
benefited from the program.  This means that over $2 billion in 
loans were guaranteed by the government, including $732 million for 
businesses in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How was this $732 million distributed?  The caisses populaires 
loaned out $321 million of it, while the other banking institutions 
in Quebec provided $385 million. 
For Canada as a whole, the 34,000 SMBs created, according to the 
inadequate figures available, 73,000 jobs, of which an estimated 
25,000, at least, were in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So this is why we in the Bloc Quebecois feel obliged to 
support this measure.  If the bill is not passed by April 1, we 
could not use it to help small and medium size businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will digress a bit further here.  In 1995, the figures 
showed that SMBs contributed 43% of Canada's economic activity. 
That same year, in Quebec, 45% of all jobs, not just the new ones, 
depended on SMBs.  So they account for nearly half of the jobs in 
business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We often think that big business creates jobs, but we note—and this 
is true in all countries, all the OECD reports confirm it—that 
big business is no longer really creating jobs.  It creates 
some, but others are lost.  Often government efforts, and this is 
true for a business in my riding in Quebec, are aimed at 
maintaining jobs.  Frito-Lay is one example, and there are many 
others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the subject of big business, the challenge is not to create 
jobs, but to maintain existing ones.  The Lévis shipyards come to 
mind.  Barely seven or eight years ago, when things were really 
booming, 2,500 people worked there.  Now they have a hard time 
keeping 500 to 700 people employed.  So SMBs are an area for the 
future and where most of the jobs are created. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They often represent the only option for someone without a 
job, who is unable to find one in the public service.  We know that 
neither the federal nor the provincial public service creates jobs 
anymore.  So SMBs are the only option for young people or those who 
have experience in the labour market, but find themselves 
unemployed.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard the Reform member criticize the Minister of Human Resources 
Development. But some good came out of the program, including the SEA 
initiative, the self-employment assistance program, which helped many 
jobless people, for a period of up to a year, set up their own 
businesses. Many of these businesses survived. If these people had not 
set up such businesses, they would have remained unemployed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must do our utmost to help them. I do not doubt that all the 
members here, from all parties, can work so that, in the end, the 
largest possible number of jobs will be created. The Liberals even made 
job creation their slogan in 1993, with their “jobs, jobs, 
jobs”. 
As we saw, their approach was based on macroeconomics, in that they 
concentrated on economic indicators and let things sort themselves out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Contrary to that approach, I think governments still have a very 
specific role to play to help businesses create jobs. At the same time, 
we must be careful and make sure public funds are not wasted. The fact 
is that setting up a business is risky. This basic program allows 
thousands of businesses to take the necessary risks to create jobs. 
Members of this House can never make job creation too much of an 
obsession, too much of a daily concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see that I have some time left. When we review the program, we 
will have to see which sectors are doing best, which ones are providing 
quality employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, in the Quebec City region, socio-economic stakeholders 
noticed that the number of jobs in the public service was the same, 
because of a freeze, if not diminishing. This led a number of them to 
try to devise a strategy geared to the new economy. I want to point out 
in particular the efforts of the technological park, in Sainte-Foy. 
There are also other sectors in the Quebec City region that are 
interested in developing projects that will create quality employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can never repeat it too often: there are sectors where investing 
makes less and less sense. In the context of globalization, our 
businesses must be the best in the world, if they are to survive. They 
must also be in fields that have a promising future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude by saying that Bloc Quebecois members will support 
the bill at third reading, because until a more comprehensive reform is 
done, it is the only way that other businesses can get a loan from 
banking institutions in the next fiscal year.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member agree that passing this bill and then spending 
extra time on the comprehensive review taking into account the 
auditor general's report will be helpful to all of us in the 
House as we discuss this bill in committee and take our time to 
establish the new SBLA for the future? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member said he agreed with 
what I said. It is hard to say anything more, except perhaps to add 
that, while sovereignists, the members of the Bloc Quebecois make a full 
contribution to parliamentary committees, including the Standing 
Committee on Industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that particular case, we make as positive a contribution as 
possible because, as long as Quebec remains part of the federal system 
and Quebeckers pay their share of taxes to the federal government, we 
are perfectly justified in taking advantage of this process, since it 
benefits Quebec businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course we feel the Quebec government and every region in Quebec 
should be involved. 
There are 16 economic regions in Quebec and each has a separate 
strategic plan. Realities vary from one region to the next, be it 
geographical realities, distance or what not. Some natural resources may 
also be found in one region but not in others. Hence the need for 
regional microeconomics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill dealing with small business loans of up to $250,000 
directly concerns the type of businesses we find in all regions of 
Canada. This is a basic program but it should be pointed out that 
similar programs already exist in Quebec. Take the FTQ workers' fund for 
example. This is a Quebec initiative, which the CNTU recently imitated. 
Funds are generated to help small and medium size businesses and promote 
their sustainability. This also allows for the establishment of new 
businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consideration in committee of this bill should focus on assessing 
existing programs at other levels to make sure they are complementary 
and useful. Other programs will need to be created. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Entrepreneurs often come to see me at my office. They tell me there 
is not always enough time to compare the benefits of all the programs 
available. I was told—and did not get a chance to check—that 
credit and loans are available from at least 50 sources. Checking them 
all is a time-consuming process. I think it should be simplified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a time when the federal government should work in 
co-operation with provincial governments to prevent duplication 
and competition. This would allow us to develop business 
assistance programs that meet the particular needs of businesses 
in a given region.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Andy Mitchell (for the Minister of Canadian Heritage) 
</B>moved that Bill C-29, an act to establish the Canadian Parks Agency 
and to amend other Acts as a consquence, be read the second time 
and referred to a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said: Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in this House today 
on the occasion of this second reading of Bill C-29, an act to 
establish the Canadian Parks Agency and to amend other Acts as a 
consequence. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can certainly say on behalf of the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage and on behalf of myself and all Canadians that we take 
great pride in our national parks system, in our national 
historic sites and those other special places that we protect and 
for which we provide stewardship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposal of Bill C-29, the development of the Canadian parks 
agency, is indeed a type of new beginning.  We have had as part 
of the Department of Canadian Heritage, as part of the Department 
of Environment before that and as part of the Department of 
Indian Affairs before that, Parks Canada.  Over those years the 
men and women who have worked in that department have done an 
excellent job in protecting our special places in ensuring that 
our special places are there for the benefit of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a need to bring certainty and permanency to that 
organization so we can move into the future reflecting the 
realities of the 1990s and making sure that we are prepared to 
deal with the challenges of the 21st century.  That is what 
developing and producing a Canadian parks agency is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my comments today it is my intent to talk about why we are 
developing an agency and what we have done so far in terms of 
consulting and talking to Canadians about how we should approach 
this issue.  I am going to talk about some of the components of 
the legislation which is before the House today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My connection to parks and our other special places has 
certainly preceded my time as Secretary of State for Parks and 
the time before I became a member of this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding of Parry Sound—Muskoka we are pleased to host the 
smallest geographic national park in the system, Georgian Bay 
Island National Park which is in the southern end of my riding. I 
and all of my constituents take great pride in that facility and 
what the men and women who run that facility have accomplished 
and the thousands of visitors who come to that area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my own hometown of Gravenhurst we have the birthplace of Dr. 
Norman Bethune as a national historic site where we recognize the 
achievements of one our most famous Canadians.  Also as part of 
my riding and making up part of the southern boundary is the 
Trent-Severn Waterway one of the historic waterways which is 
administered by Parks Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Beyond this hometown experience I have been able to build on my 
appreciation of what Parks Canada has done in the past.  I have 
had an opportunity to talk to Canadians from coast to coast to 
coast this past year.  We consulted with large numbers of 
stakeholders and employees about the proposed Canadian parks 
agency.  In doing so, I have come to appreciate even more the 
importance of these special places, the importance of how 
Canadians view our national parks, how they view our historic 
sites and all of the other special places. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I deal with the ongoing files that are part of the 
administration of Parks Canada, I see on a day to day basis why 
it is that Canadians place a high value on our national parks and 
historic sites.  I have come to learn and to understand why our 
national parks are the third most recognized symbol of Canadians. 
It is because of the importance and the special place they have 
in our nation and the special place in which Canadians hold them 
in their hearts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This agency is going to allow us to produce an organization that 
will be able to achieve our two primary mandates.  The first is 
to ensure that Canadians have an opportunity to enjoy our 
national parks and other special places today, so that they can 
learn about our history, so they can learn about our heritage and 
experience the very specialness that is uniquely Canadian.  That 
is indeed our mandate and this agency will allow us to carry it 
out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will also allow us to carry out our second fundamental 
mandate which is to ensure that Canadians of future generations, 
Canadians of the 21st century and beyond will be able to enjoy 
those special sites as well.  It is an obligation we take 
seriously as a government and which I believe Canadians take 
seriously as a nation to ensure that we can pass on those assets 
in an unimpaired way to future generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this legislation we are going to be developing an 
organization that will be designed in a way that will allow us to 
deal with the economic realities of the 1990s.  It will allow us 
to organize ourselves efficiently so that we can meet the 
challenges and we can do our job, do it effectively and do it 
with less financial resources. We are going to create with this 
agency an establishment that will provide our employees with the 
tools they need to be more efficient and more creative in doing 
their jobs. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 1996 budget, the Government of Canada announced 
its intention to create the Canadian Parks Agency.  Two rounds of 
consultations ensued in the months that followed, at the request of 
the Minister of Canadian Heritage. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed we undertook that consultation with the belief that we 
had to include a wide range of Canadians.  We ensured that the 
various stakeholders who have an interest in our national parks 
and those individuals who work within our national parks and 
other special places had an opportunity to talk to us and provide 
us with some of the important ideas and components on how we 
should proceed in creating this agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the last two years there have been two rounds of 
consultations.  Over 150 stakeholders have provided testimony. In 
addition over 300 of our staff have had an opportunity to provide 
direct input to us on what they believe should be part of this 
agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned earlier we took the opportunity to go across 
Canada.  We took the opportunity to hear Canadians in Atlantic 
Canada, Canadians on the west coast, Canadians in the Arctic and 
Canadians in central Canada so that we could have a full 
understanding of what Canadians in general want to see in this 
agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to take this opportunity on behalf of the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage and myself to thank all of those employees and 
stakeholders who took the time and the opportunity to provide 
their valuable input. We have listened to what they have had to 
say. 
Many of their comments and suggestions have found their way into 
the legislation before the House today.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did we hear?  We heard a number of very important messages 
and a number of very important principles which Canadians believe 
should be in the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>None has been more important than the belief shared by Canadians 
from coast to coast that the parks portfolio needs to be under 
public stewardship.  Our special places, our parks and national 
historic sites, are a public trust and public stewardship needs 
to be exercised in a public way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I state clearly to the House and to all Canadians who are 
watching or will be reading this debate that the creation of 
the Canadian parks agency is the creation of a public agency that is 
fully accountable to the House and to government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During our consultations we heard that the public and our 
employees wanted us to ensure we had a mandate that included firm 
commitments to ecological and commemorative integrity and that we 
reinforced the programs we undertake in terms of interpretation 
and education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They told us that not only was it important to maintain these 
special places.  It was also important for Canadians to learn 
about them and understand the history. Whether or not Canadians 
have the opportunity to travel to these locations they can 
collectively take pride and joy in the reality of these special 
places. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we travelled across the country we heard that message over 
and over again.  Let us ensure that Canadians generally have an 
opportunity to learn about and to experience our national parks 
and other special places. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They also told us that they wanted to be engaged on an ongoing 
basis.  They did not want the consultation to be a one time 
opportunity.  They generally felt very good that there was a 
forum in which they could provide the type of input they thought 
was important in terms of the management of our national parks. 
In that respect they suggested there should be some sort of 
permanent structure in place to allow for that input to be 
ongoing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the bill to set up the Canadian park agency we see a call for 
biennial forums so individuals or groups of Canadians have an 
opportunity to evaluate the ability of the agency, to measure our 
performance in fulfilling our mandate and to provide input in 
terms of whether we have been able to fulfil it in the way they 
think best. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is almost unique among government initiatives.  We will 
proactively and on a mandated basis allow Canadians to evaluate 
the work we will be doing as the Canadian parks agency.  It is 
mandated in our legislation.  It is not subject to regulatory 
change.  That is an important component of the bill.  It was 
suggested during our consultations.  I am pleased we will be able 
to move forward with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This will be a public organization in terms of its transparency 
and accountability.  The legislation will ensure that there 
cannot be and will not be any degradation of the roles of 
parliament, the minister or the government in exercising their 
stewardship of our special places.  Parks and our other special 
places like historic sites and historic waterways belong to all 
Canadians and will be managed on behalf of all Canadians by 
Canadians. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the creation of the Canadian parks agency, we wish to 
attain four key objectives. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those four objectives are very important.  I will take a moment 
to summarize them.  The Canadian parks agency will be a separate 
ongoing service organization which, under the direction of 
parliament and the government, will provide continuity in 
managing Canada's special places. 
I emphasize the concept of continuity.  One of the challenges 
those who have spent their careers in parks have had to face is 
that it has gone from ministry to ministry, from department to 
department.

</I></B></P><P align=left>With the creation of this service agency we will bring some 
certainty and some continuity to ensure we will be able to manage 
our national historic sites and our national parks in a sound 
ongoing way.  I believe this is a very important objective.  It 
will be a very important accomplishment of the legislation when 
it passes the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also we have as an objective the creation of an organization 
committed to some very important goals we have established as a 
government to complete Canada's system of national parks.  This 
is something we have committed ourselves to work toward as we 
move toward the 21st century.  The organization would be 
committed to expanding the system of national historic sites and 
to creating and maintaining marine conservation areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a unique concept, one that we are near the lead in the 
world.  With the creation of marine conservation areas we will 
translate ecological standards and re-create the work we have 
done in protecting our terrestrial areas to our marine areas.  I 
look forward later in this session of parliament to tabling 
legislation which will allow this agency to proceed with that 
very important task. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation will also create an organization that has the 
necessary financial and organizational flexibility which empowers 
our employees to fulfil their mandate in a creative and efficient 
manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I travelled from coast to coast consulting with our employees 
I learned how fortunate we are as Canadians to have men and women 
who have dedicated themselves to careers in Parks Canada.  They 
have dedicated themselves to protecting our special places.  They 
have dedicated themselves to ensuring that Canadians have an 
opportunity to enjoy our special places and to see what is truly 
unique about the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation will establish an agency as a separate employer 
or a structure that will allow us to meet the very specific 
organizational and environmental challenges that are unique to 
Parks Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will provide a human resource regime that makes sense for 
Parks Canada, a human resource regime that understands Parks 
Canada operates from coast to coast to coast seven days a week, 
24 hours a day, in all kinds of geographic and climatic 
conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will ensure through the creation of the Canadian parks agency 
that we have a human resource system which will be able to meet 
those challenges.  We are working at creating that system, not in 
isolation but in partnership with our employees as we have gone 
across the country on consultations, in partnership with the 
unions that represent our employees, and in partnership with the 
Canadian stakeholders who believe in and about the Canadian parks 
agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are working on this group to create a human resource regime. 
I am pleased the partners have come together over the last few 
months and are working diligently in creating the type of HR 
regime that works not only for the agency but for employees 
within the agency. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, if I may, I will describe the new agency. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me explain for a moment some of the important changes the 
agency will bring to the operation of our portfolio. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1655"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT36"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT36"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1655
<A HREF="#LINKT37"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT35"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will be able to flatten the organization.  We will go a 
system where we have a field superintendent who is responsible to 
the head of the agency, who in turn will be responsible to the 
minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This will allow us to see decisions made far more quickly, more 
efficiently.  Decisions will be made, taking into account local 
conditions and local challenges.  We will provide to our field 
superintendents increased levels of responsibility so decisions 
can be taken in a way that reflects the needs of local areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian parks agency will have a number of financial 
authorities not traditionally associated with government 
departments.  These authorities will allow us to operate in a 
business-like manner but remembering we are not a business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to operate efficiently but remember that we do things as 
part of the Canadian parks agency that are not done solely for 
profit.  When we establish a national park in the far north of 
Canada, we do so because Canadians believe it is important to 
protect these special places.  It is not because we believe we 
can turn a profit.  That is not what we are all about.  However, 
with this agency we have created a number of financial 
authorities which will allow us to be more efficient in carrying 
out our tasks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will be able to maintain the revenue generated by Parks 
Canada within the portfolio of the Canadian parks agency.  This 
will allow us additional financial resources that can be used in 
the creation and expansion of our national parks system and our 
system of national historic sites. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the new authorities being granted to this agency we will be 
able to establish a non-lapsing capital account which will allow 
us to keep the proceeds from gifts and endowments, or the sale of 
excess assets such as vehicles or buildings, and use them for 
investment into new Canadian parks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is important.  In the past the funds would simply have gone 
back into the consolidated revenue fund.  Under this agency the 
revenue will be there and available for investments into 
important priorities which Canadians place on the shoulders of 
the Canadian parks agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian parks agency will be working on what we call a two 
year rolling budget.  It will be able to carry forward its budget 
from one year to the next.  No more will we have the scenario, 
which many of us have seen all too often as we approach the end 
of the fiscal year, where expenditure decisions are being made 
not on sound business practice but on the calendar.  We will put 
a system in place by going to a two year rolling budget that will 
allow our managers in the field to make the best possible 
decisions in utilizing their budgets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Something that will be a special authority to the agency and is 
particularly important, given our mandate in the Canadian parks 
agency, is the ability to advance funds from appropriations up to 
a certain limit from future years.  If an opportunity presents 
itself in this fiscal year, for instance to purchase property in 
terms of establishing a national park, we can do it this year 
because it makes economic sense, whereas in the next fiscal year 
it may not.  This will give the management team the ability to 
make decisions based on sound business practices.  I am pleased 
these financial authorities will be granted to the new Canadian 
parks agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As all Canadians want to know—and it is part of our public 
stewardship—we will continue the use of appropriations as the 
primary source of funding for the national parks system. Roughly 
today the split is about 75:25 and that is where we intend to 
keep it in the foreseeable future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned earlier, one of the specific aspects of the new 
agency will be the establishment of a separate human resource 
regime which will allow us to create a structure that reflects 
the realities we face in the Canadian parks agency, the number of 
hours our employees work and the types of conditions under which 
they work, to make sure we have an HR regime that reflects their 
concerns and their needs. 
That is one of the things we are doing with this agency. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1700"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT36"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also going to create with the agency an organization that 
will have a number of simplified processes that will allow 
decisions to happen more quickly and in a more business-like way. 
As I mentioned, we will be able to increase the authorities that 
we are providing to our local field superintendents.  We are 
going to simplify the process by which decisions can take place 
at the local level.  This is important and Canadians will see a 
direct benefit from this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things we heard very clearly when we did our national 
consultation was that Canadians wanted to ensure that this new 
agency would have ministerial and parliamentary accountability. 
One of the specific components of this legislation is to ensure 
that accountability is there.  Canadians have said they want to 
make sure they as Canadians have an impact on the stewardship of 
our special places.  The accountability processes that this 
legislation brings forth will certainly allow that to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I believe this position of accountability is a very critical 
point, I am going to take a moment to review a couple of the 
processes this legislation brings forth to ensure accountability. 
First, in terms of the minister responsible, the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, that cabinet position will continue to have 
responsibility for developing and seeking approval from cabinet 
for broad policy issues.  It will remain accountable to the 
public and remain within government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the minister will approve the guiding principles 
and policies under which the new Canadian parks agency will 
operate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each one of our national parks today and, under this 
legislation, each one of our national historic sites will require 
the development of a five year management plan which will be 
approved by the minister and tabled in this House in order to 
allow parliamentarians to be part of that review. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister will be recommending the corporate plan to Treasury 
Board and approving an annual report which will detail how we 
managed to fulfil our objectives that we established in the 
previous year.  The minister will be approving the state of the 
parks report which will become a much broader report to include 
the ecological integrity of all the special places that we 
manage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister will be responsible for fixing and establishing 
fees that will be charged at our national parks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of talking about the creation of a new HR regime, every 
five years the minister will be tabling a summary report on how 
the human resources regime supports the values established within 
government to management our human resources within the agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Beyond just ministerial accountability, this legislation builds 
in accountability that Parliament itself will have an opportunity 
and an obligation to exercise.  As is the case now, we as 
parliamentarians approve the establishment of new national parks. 
We as parliamentarians do now and will continue to approve the 
annual appropriations which the Canadian parks agency will be 
receiving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The summary of the corporate plan will be tabled by the minister 
in this House for the review of parliamentarians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the corporate plan, the annual review, which will be 
undertaken by the minister, will not only contain our objectives 
but will also analyse and determine whether we are achieving 
those objectives.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned there will be a biennial report which deals with 
the ecological integrity of our special places.  Not only will 
the minister receive and review that report but it will come to 
Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, 113 year ago our predecessors made the decision 
to protect and preserve the newly opened wilderness around Banff. 
Today we are the beneficiaries of that vision and foresight. 
The establishment of the Canadian parks agency reflects our 
effort and will provide us the tools to fulfil that vision into 
the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to us in the House and indeed to all Canadians 
that 113 years from now Canadians will look back and know and 
appreciate that the decisions the House will take today and in 
the weeks to come in terms of this legislation will lead to the 
protection and the creation of the special places that will be 
the enjoyment of Canadians in the 22nd century. 
<P><A NAME="LINK226"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
that was a very interesting speech. The pairing off of the parks 
from Heritage Canada and the insertion of the junior ministry of 
parks I believe has been a very positive step in the management 
of parks in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have had a good working relationship with this minister and I 
would hope that, all partisan politics aside, it might continue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the Canadian parks agency act is to administer 
and protect our national parks, national historic sites and other 
heritage areas.  This is a very important part of Canada. Indeed, 
as Reformers representing the grassroots, ordinary Canadians, 
more and more people across Canada are coming to see and 
understand and value the importance of parks and the preservation 
of parks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We may have different visions and from time to time we find that 
some of the visions of this minister, indeed of this government, 
are rather restrictive and a touch myopic, but nonetheless we 
have the ability to dialogue.  I think we have established a 
working relationship here that the Liberals clearly understand, 
that the Reform Party is very keenly interested in maintaining 
our natural ecosystems, in maintaining the ability of Canadians 
to be able to know, see and understand the importance of parks in 
their lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At present the responsibility for parks, as I have mentioned, 
falls under the Department of Canadian Heritage. Although this 
agency will still report back to this minister and the Minister 
of Canadian Heritage, maybe we have to give even more creative 
thought as to how we can even further depoliticize the whole 
issue of parks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new agency will remain accountable through the minister to 
Parliament.  One of the concerns we had when we first saw the 
title of this act was that it was a step further removed in terms 
of being answerable to the people who are elected on behalf of 
the citizens of Canada to administer parks, but indeed it is not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the major reasons we recognize that parks are unique in 
terms of their administration is that there are many things that 
we can do to create and there are many things that we can 
dismantle or take apart and then rebuild from a legislative 
perspective. When it comes to parks what we have to all clearly 
understand is that we are talking about living ecosystems.  We 
are talking about our very environment.  We are talking about 
being able to do absolute total damage that is irreparable.

<A HREF="#LINKT38"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all recognize and acknowledge that.  Again I want to make the 
commitment on behalf of the Reform Party that any actions taken 
with respect to parks, any management of parks, are taken from 
our perspective with that in mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also like the idea that the agency will be more efficient 
since it will be able to raise and keep its own revenues, to 
bargain directly with its employees, to permit third party 
operators to administer certain facilities and to allow the chief 
executive officer of the parks agency to set terms and conditions 
of employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the difficulties there has been, because of the very 
unique nature of parks in Canada, is to try to fit into a 
template that simply does not fit.  Parks are of an unique shape. 
Parks do not fit into the box that most of the government 
functions can easily fit into. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agency will have access to a new $10 million parks historic 
sites account.  Any funds drawn from this account will be 
repayable to the crown with interest.  Even this in itself is 
somewhat innovative and will permit a flexibility within the 
parks agency that is not clearly available with the existing 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In relation to Reform Party policy, No. 5 in our statement of 
principles is that Canada's identify and vision for the future 
should be rooted in and inspired by a fresh appreciation of our 
land and the supreme importance to our well-being of exploring, 
developing, renewing and conserving our natural resources and 
physical environment.  We support the concept of environmentally 
sensitive zoning.  Therefore this park agency fits very well into 
the established policy of the Reform policy as it presently 
exists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are committed as a party to having our national parks and 
heritage sites administered in an accountable, efficient and cost 
effective manner.  We support the agency's objective of cost 
recovery while at the same time ensuring that fees at Canada's 
national parks and heritage sites do not become prohibitively 
expensive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister will know that I have had some criticism in the 
past.  I continue with the criticism over the way in which the 
entrance fees are administered in our parks.  It is a hodgepodge. 
It is an unenforceable hodgepodge.  It is one which is very 
important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we were to take a very rough figure of $350 million as being 
the parks gross budget, at this point approximately $50 million 
of that is accounted for in terms of fees, rents and leases in 
external money coming into the park.  The problem is that 40% of 
that, $20 million, comes from park entry fees that cannot be 
administered effectively.  In fact, it is in a position of 
causing people to really cheat and creates an environment where 
there is a sufficient advantage for people to cheat on these 
fees.  We are losing that revenue side. It is this kind of thing 
that is currently going on within the parks system that will not 
be resolved with the establishment of the parks agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that the structure of the parks agency will lead to an 
environment where questions like this can be dealt with in a more 
business-like manner.  It is the same thing as the enterprise 
units that were established on an experimental basis.  These were 
the hot pools in the four mountain parks.  It was a first step in 
the direction of the parks agency that the revenue coming from 
the hot pools in Banff, Radium and Jasper would be able to go 
into its own account and be accounted for. Unlike the current 
system within the rest of the federal government where funds that 
come in go into consolidated revenue, these funds would be 
earmarked.  This enterprise unit would be able to administer the 
pools in a business-like way.  There has been some success with 
that as a first step. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party has taken a look at a number of these things 
and we see some real glimmers of hope that there is going to be a 
much more rational approach in the area of financing the parks.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians benefit through a continued service at the parks and 
sites.  The flexibilities and authorities provided in the 
legislation are designed to support the agency in delivering 
services within substantially reduced budgets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To comment parenthetically for a second, it may be known that I 
have the good fortune of having four parks in my constituency, 
Mount Revelstoke, Glacier, Yoho and Kootenay National Park.  Of 
course, Kootenay is adjacent to Banff and Jasper parks and 
Waterton in the southwest corner of the province of Alberta.  I 
am actually surrounded by a tremendous number of parks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am indeed fortunate to live where I do. I also live near the 
people who work at these parks and they have spoken to me.  They 
have my ear.  They have some concerns with respect to how the 
parks agency is going to relate to them as the workers in the 
parks. I look forward in committee to having input from people 
representing all the layers involved in the delivery of services 
in the parks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the Reform Party position that first there is the 
necessity through services like the ranger service to ensure that 
the physical management, administration and enforcement within 
the parks are maintained at a very high level.  That is very 
essential to ensure the integrity of the parks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, with respect to the delivery of the other services, 
particularly for parks visitors, it is the party's position that 
it is done in a cost effective way.  It must be done in such a 
way that Canadians will always be able to access the appropriate 
places in the parks where they should be going so they can enjoy 
their out of door experiences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this in mind while speaking parenthetically, one of the 
major disappointments to me as a member of Parliament occurred 
when Parks Canada in its present life decided it would start 
contracting out. It struck me that what we should have been doing 
at that point was rather than going to contracting out without 
having established the structure of the parks agency, that we had 
an effort to do something without having any idea of what the 
structure was going to look like.  That struck me as being a very 
shallow way for us to be going ahead and doing something which 
perhaps was politically popular at the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of the 3,500 parks employees there are many people, whether we 
are talking about top management or about hourly workers, who 
legitimately have been very concerned about their livelihoods. 
They are concerned about whether they are going to have a job, if 
they are going to be able to buy running shoes for their kids 
next month. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has been very unfair. I was very happy to see Parks Canada 
back off a very flawed process.  With that in mind I close my 
parenthetic remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people who are going to be affected by the parks agency I am 
sure with the co-operation of the minister will have access to 
the committee to speak to the various provisions of the 
legislation.  Whether they are in unions or are non-unionized 
hourly workers or whether they are in management, they must be 
able to have access. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should also bear in mind some of the unfortunate things that 
have happened.  For example at the Department of National Defence 
people have come forward to make submissions and have been 
chastized for it.  I am sure that would never ever happen with 
Parks Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through the parks agency Canadians will benefit by the creation 
of new parks and sites.  We have to be very careful.  We do not 
have a limitless chequebook. We have to recognize that the money 
that will be expended on parks in the future is coming from the 
taxpayers' chequebooks. 
We have to be very prudent in the way we do that. On the other 
side of the coin, we also have to recognize there are some 
identifiable areas in Canada that we have to look at and which we 
have to preserve for the benefit of our children and our 
grandchildren.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the parks agency there is the potential to have enhanced 
accountability to Canadians. The legislation, while encompassing 
the existing activities associated with national parks, national 
historic sites and related protected heritage sites, reinforces 
roles which engender pride and give expression to our values and 
identity as Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister will retain full power of direction over agency 
activities. The legislation provides for new or improved 
accountability mechanisms to Parliament. These are the parts that 
we really like: a summary of the corporate plan and annual 
report; a biennial state of Canadian protected heritage areas 
report; the tabling of management plans for national parks and 
national historic sites in Parliament; and a unique mechanism 
which requires that the agency hold a biennial forum which will 
permit Canadians from all walks of life to share their views on 
the agency's program and to participate more fully in the 
management direction for these treasured national places. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These parks do not belong to the minister.  They do not belong 
to members of Parliament.  These parks belong to the people of 
Canada, and who better to have a say in the way in which they are 
managed and the way in which they are preserved and enhanced for 
the future of Canadians.  In that respect we find that part of 
the parks agency legislation to be the most beneficial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Working toward the completion of the national parks system and 
to enhance the systems of national historic sites and marine 
conservation areas is probably the biggest single challenge we 
have. This is most likely the area where we would end up with 
whatever disagreement we would have with the Liberals.  I would 
not see it as being a political difference of opinion although 
the Liberals have a well-deserved reputation of intervening in 
many situations where there does not need to be government 
intervention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see being able to co-operate with the Liberal government, 
with any government.  For example, three and a half years from 
now when the Reform forms the government, we would look forward 
to the participation of the Liberals with us along with whoever 
else gets the remnants of the seats in Canada.  We would hope 
they would co-operate with us in the continued management of the 
parks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been a challenge of maintaining the services and 
achieving long term goals.  With that in mind again we are 
enthusiastic supporters of the way in which the accountability 
has been structured within this bill. I have stated that the 
agency will report directly to the Minister of Canadian Heritage 
who will in turn be accountable for its activities before 
Parliament.  Current mechanisms to ensure responsible public 
dialogue and accountability will be enhanced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There will be a summary of the corporate plan of the agency, a 
five year plan, and management plans for the national parks and 
national historic sites, and an annual report on the agency's 
operations.  There will be a summary of the prepared report at 
least every five years on how the human resource regime supports 
the values and principles established by the government 
management of human resources.  There will also be a biennial 
report on the state of Canadian protected areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We find the way in which the funds are going to be administered 
also makes a lot more sense, that of accountability, of the 
financing being on a two year operational rolling budget 
providing an annual carryover of funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had an exceptionally light snow year in the mountain 
parks, not that these are the only parks in Canada.  Heaven only 
knows they go from Newfoundland to the Arctic and back—

</I></B></P><P align=left>In the mountain parks where there is normally a tremendous 
requirement for snow clearing and road maintenance, although this 
year has not been a breeze, it has been the next thing to it. 
The cost has been very low.  This was really quite fortunate 
because Parks Canada initiated a system whereby it ended up 
pulling the maintenance facilities for the road clearing 
equipment from where it should be and I believe should continue 
to be, back to Lake Louise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I really hesitate to think what would have happened if we had 
had a normal snow year or a heavy snow year.  However, the gods 
of snow shone favourably on this Liberal government in spite of 
its rather bone headed way of doing this road clearing 
reorganization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My point is that the two year rolling budget is going to be 
beneficial exactly in that situation.  When there is a low cost 
year, why would we turn around and paint signs and bridges that 
do not need painting?  We would do it under the existing regime 
because the money had been left over from the snow clearing.  But 
then next year, when we did not have El Niño and we ended up with 
a dump of snow in the parks, we would be short on budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a matter of fact a couple of years ago it was so short on 
budget because of a heavy snowfall in Mount Revelstoke Glacier 
National Park.  On the Trans-Canada Highway over the Rogers Pass 
there was a series of accidents as a result of not having 
sufficient salt or gravel to take care of the Trans-Canada 
Highway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an absolutely classic example of why the parks agency is 
going to be such an ideal fit in its present form.  We are going 
to look at it.  We are not giving it the green light completely 
but at least it is a faint green light. There are some good ideas 
which recognize that parks in Canada are not like a theatre 
operation which comes under the heritage minister and they are 
not like a television network.  Those are things that can be 
built up or cut down.  However, we cannot build up and cut down 
on what we are doing with respect to natural ecosystems in parks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, a major concern that we have in this process and 
one I am sure we are going to have good co-operation on from the 
minister is to ensure that all interested parties, all people who 
will be impacted by the parks, will have an opportunity to have a 
say in committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again I am going to remark parenthetically.  There is the 
situation when the marine park in Quebec was set up recently. I 
was the parks critic and I said I was looking forward to people 
being able to make representations at committee. That did not 
happen.  We basically got involved in a clause by clause study. 
For the people reading <I>Hansard</I> or the viewers who might not 
understand, we went over the legislation clause by clause, shall 
this clause pass, shall that clause pass and then boom, it was 
back in the House.  I was very disappointed with that process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just want to say very clearly to the minister that will not 
happen on this bill.  We will give everybody who was involved 
particularly on the human resource side an opportunity to have a 
kick at the can.  We want them to help us understand, perhaps not 
only from a legal point of view but also in their judgment as 
they read the words, what this will mean to them in terms of 
everything from collective bargaining to the way in which their 
hours will be set, the whole nine yards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party will be supporting this legislation at second 
reading to go to committee for this process.  As I said to a 
colleague just before I rose to speak, when I am the heritage 
minister I will probably do this legislation this way.

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this 
House, the definition of hobby farmer stated by Disaster 
Relief Canada should be split into the following two 
definitions: (<I>a</I>) Hobby farmers: individuals who seek careers 
outside agriculture and have farms for recreational or 
investment reasons; and (<I>b</I>) Junior farmers: individuals who 
intend to become fulltime farmers, but currently are forced 
to seek off-farm income to build an equity in their farming 
business. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased this evening to rise to 
debate private member's Motion No. 11.  It came about as a result 
of a situation in my riding in the summer of 1996.  I introduced 
a similar motion in the last Parliament which died on the Order 
Paper and, therefore, I have reintroduced it in this Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since I first drafted the motion circumstances across the 
country have brought new relevance to the whole issue of how 
farmers, particularly part time farmers and small businessmen, 
are compensated in instances of natural disaster. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the summer of 1996 there was a situation of serious overland 
flooding in the northern part of my riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my part of Alberta and in many parts of Canada part time 
farming has become a way of life because the economic realities 
of farming demand that many farmers, or members of their 
families, take off-farm employment to supplement their farm 
income in order to survive.  The very fact that they demonstrate 
the determination and the willingness to do this has brought 
about a situation where they are ineligible for disaster relief 
funding under the criteria of the guidelines of national defence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has created a serious and almost ridiculous situation where a 
farmer or a businessman on one side of the road receives disaster 
relief funding to compensate him for damages to his property, 
while his neighbour across the road is denied that funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to get into a debate over whether or not the 
natural disaster was worse in one area than in another.  I firmly 
believe that the effect on the individual is the same, whether 
you are an individual among thousands or an individual among 
hundreds.  My heart goes out to everyone who suffered through the 
Red River flood in Manitoba and the Saguenay flood in Quebec, as 
well as this winter's ice storm in Ontario and Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The very occasion of a natural disaster has a devastating affect 
upon Canadians.  It robs them of their valued property and 
possessions.  It certainly takes away their financial security 
and their peace of mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can sympathize with those individuals, having operated a farm 
for probably 35 years.  During many of those years I had to take 
off-farm employment in order to build equity in my farm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know what it is like when you are young, you have a dream, and 
you and your family work your hearts out to build that dream.  In 
a matter of hours those dreams can be wiped out and destroyed by 
a natural disaster.  That kind of loss, in itself, is enough to 
destroy families.  Many families in my area have been destroyed 
through no fault of their own, but through circumstances which 
arose as a result of these natural disasters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to stop and imagine the anxiety and distress that would 
be added to the suffering because of the uncertainty over whether 
or not these farmers would receive assistance through Disaster 
Relief Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last three years farmers across this country have 
suffered serious damage to their farms and businesses due to the 
flooding of rivers and streams all across the country.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Extensive media coverage made all Canadians familiar with the 
Saguenay flood in Quebec, with the Red River flood in Manitoba 
and, of course, with the ice storm in Quebec and Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly less attention nationally was given to the floods of 
1996 and 1997 in northern Alberta.  It was the flood of 1996, 
which occurred during the same summer as the Saguenay flood, 
which motivated me to draft and to introduce this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following the flood in northern Alberta my office was bombarded 
with phone calls from farmers who were seeking assistance and 
disaster relief.  The majority of the phone calls came from part 
time farmers who were not covered by Emergency Preparedness 
Canada because they earn more than half their income off-farm. 
The federal government's response to their pleas was nothing 
short of a slap in the face. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My constituents were forced to sit by and watch as side 
agreements were made to compensate hobby farmers affected by the 
Saguenay flood, the ice storm and the Red River flood, although 
there seems to be some confusion about whether part time farmers 
did receive compensation for damage caused by the Red River 
flood.  Certainly that was the case in the Saguenay and in the 
areas affected by the ice storm.  Individuals in northern 
Alberta, in 1996 and 1997, were denied that funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is for this reason that my motion asks for the definition of 
a hobby farmer to be divided into a hobby farmer and a junior 
farmer under the Emergency Preparedness Canada guidelines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current definition assumes that all farmers earning less 
than half their income from their farms have those farms for 
recreation or investment purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding it is more often the case that so-called hobby 
farmers are part time or junior farmers who intend to become full 
time farmers but who are forced to seek off-farm income to 
supplement farm income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of the ice storm, the part time farmers in question 
were the maple sugar producers whom I visited shortly after the 
storm.  They have an extremely short season and under the current 
system are penalized for having the drive and ambition to seek 
additional work during the off-season. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ironically, the majority of part time farmers reinvest their 
off-farm income into their farms to build equity, to accumulate 
capital and quota until they are able to maintain a full time 
farming operation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The advantage of splitting the definition is clear.  Hobby 
farmers who own farms for recreation and investment purposes 
would still be excluded from disaster relief programs, while part 
time or junior farmers would automatically be included in federal 
disaster relief programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part time farmers would no longer have to wait for or rely on 
side agreements that are negotiated entirely at the discretion of 
the Treasury Board.  This would eliminate the problem of regional 
inequality whereby some part time farmers, like those affected by 
the ice storm and the Saguenay floods, are given assistance while 
others are not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Northern Albertans were denied additional assistance by the 
Treasury Board, while part time farmers in Quebec and Ontario 
received it for reasons known only to the Liberal cabinet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Presumably the smaller magnitude of the Alberta flood in terms 
of dollars and cents was the reason.  However, whether 200 or 
2,000 farmers were affected, the impact on the individual farmer 
is the same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can it be justified to a part time farmer in Alberta that he 
will not be helped because not enough people were affected?  It 
makes no sense that a person be given assistance for damage done 
by what was clearly a natural disaster while his neighbours 
across the road or his colleagues in other parts of the country 
are denied the same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The devastation to the individual farmer in Alberta was, most 
assuredly, equal to the devastation experienced by the individual 
farmer in southern Manitoba, Quebec or Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government is proud of the compensation given to the 
part time farmers affected by the Saguenay flood as it was the 
first time part time farmers have ever been included in a 
disaster relief agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, this move is only commendable if it is applicable to 
farmers across Canada under similar circumstances.  Otherwise, it 
is little more than a divisive tool that deepens the gap and 
increases regional tension among Canadian provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The divisiveness of federal policies was one of the primary 
reasons for the formation and continued existence of the Reform 
Party.  Any policy or legislation that allows one farmer to be 
helped while another is ignored under identical circumstances 
hinders Canada's growth as a strong and united country.

<A HREF="#LINKT46"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore in order to ensure equality, legislation should be in 
place to prevent the need to negotiate on a case by case basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give an example of one of the many part time farmers who 
would stand to benefit from this motion.  I received a call from 
one farmer who started a grading business on the side to 
supplement his farm income.  This farmer is by no means wealthy 
or a foreign investor or keeping a hobby farm for investment 
purposes.  Rather, he is a farmer with 200 head of cattle who 
wants to raise his income in order to be able to keep his farm 
going so he took an extra job.  Unfortunately, because more than 
50% of his income comes from his grading business, this farmer is 
ineligible to apply for assistance under Disaster Relief Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The farmer's hay and alfalfa fields were the only feed he used 
for his cattle.  His other flooded fields were used for grazing 
his cattle.  Without some sort of relief, this farmer was faced 
with selling or slaughtering his cattle because of his inability 
to feed them.  Flooding also resulted in limited work for the 
graders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore this farmer, like so many other affected part time 
farmers, felt that he was financially destroyed. Certainly this 
is only one example among hundreds of similar stories from my 
constituency as well as Peace River to the west of my 
constituency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a letter to one my constituents, the executive director of 
Alberta Disaster Services expresses his dissatisfaction with the 
current criteria for qualifying for assistance.  He too has 
received many phone calls from frustrated farmers forced to give 
up their farming business.  The eligibility criteria are outdated 
in light of the current reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current reality is that the agricultural community has 
changed significantly and has come to depend on the contributions 
of part time farmers.  It is becoming increasingly difficult for 
families to live on farm income alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last three years over 300 part time farmers in northern 
Alberta have applied for disaster relief funding and have been 
denied eligibility under the program.  While the numbers seem to 
be dropping year by year, I think that is more a result of 
farmers becoming more aware of their ineligibility for the 
program than a drop in damages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The recent ice storm reminded Albertans once again that everyone 
is not treated equally in this country and certainly not under 
Emergency Preparedness Canada guidelines.  This needs to be 
remedied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only clear solution, therefore, is to distinguish between 
hobby and part time farmers and businessmen and to amend the 
guidelines to ensure equal assistance for all part time farmers 
and small businessmen in the event of a natural disaster.  This 
assistance should be automatic as it is with full time farmers 
and businessmen and not decided on by a partisan body like the 
Treasury Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this time I would like to point out that even the hon. 
members opposite have noted the need to reassess existing 
eligibility criteria.  In the fall of 1997 I was told that 
Emergency Preparedness Canada was in the process of reviewing 
eligibility criteria in consultation with a working group from 
the Department of Agriculture and Agri-Food.  I sincerely hope 
these discussions are progressing quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Changes need to be made as soon as possible because, as we have 
been recently reminded, one can never be certain when or where 
another natural disaster will occur.  I also sincerely hope that 
the hon. minister of agriculture, as he has assured me, and 
Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada are actively pursuing equitable 
access to relief for all farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is most important that all members of this House, especially 
the hon. Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, give this motion 
fair and serious consideration.  Through the division of a single 
classification into two separate classifications, this motion 
will do two things.  First, it will ensure fairness.  It is 
unfair to continue to lump part time farmers with the owners of 
recreational farms.  Part time farmers need to be recognized for 
their unique contribution to agriculture and must be protected 
against natural disasters that will adversely affect their farms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion will also establish equality between part time 
farmers no matter what the disaster or where the farm is located. 
It will prevent the bitterness and resentment arising from 
perceived regional favouritism.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To emphasize this equality it is also important that the 
government retroactively compensate those part time farmers and 
businessmen overlooked since the Saguenay agreement with part 
time farmers, including those denied assistance after the 
northern Alberta flood.  I believe this motion addresses the 
suffering of all part time farmers and businessmen affected by 
the natural disaster and it is an important step in securing the 
future of part time farmers in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore I conclude by asking every member of this House to 
give this motion his or her full attention, consideration and 
support. 
<P><A NAME="LINK239"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Richardson (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the Minister of 
National Defence is also responsible for emergency preparedness 
and the disaster financial assistance arrangements.  As the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of National Defence I am 
pleased to speak to the motion before us today and I welcome the 
hon. member's suggestions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take members a few weeks and remind them of our 
most recent disaster, the ice storm of 1998.  Although this storm 
had a devastating effect on so many people in Ontario, Quebec and 
New Brunswick it also showed us Canadians at their very best, 
banding together in times of trouble to assist their friends and 
neighbours.  This was a national crisis requiring a national 
effort.  People worked together to overcome adversity. I am proud 
and I know Canadians are proud of their efforts and the high 
level co-operation between the federal government and the 
provinces, local authorities, community groups and scores of 
individual Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to mention the role played by Emergency Preparedness 
Canada.  This Department of National Defence agency worked 
closely with other federal departments and provincial governments 
to ensure that the emergency response was there when it was 
needed.  A federal emergency operations and co-ordination group 
worked basically around the clock to locate, buy and transport 
emergency materials in response to provincial requests for 
assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Emergency Preparedness Canada also co-ordinated public 
information across all federal departments and agencies 
participating in the relief efforts.  But we were not only 
reminded of Emergency Preparedness Canada's value during the 
recent ice storm, it was also there during the disasters in 
Saguenay and Manitoba, Peace River and Athabasca. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While provincial authorities were in the lead during these 
emergencies, the federal government was there for support where 
and when needed. When the federal government was taking steps to 
ensure that we can provide support for future disasters, and in 
response to disasters in recent years, the President of the 
Treasury Board asked the Minister of National Defence and the 
Minister of Industry to undertake a review of federal financial 
assistance to provinces and territories following natural 
disasters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This review is under way and has been carried out by an 
interdepartmental working group with representatives from 
Emergency Preparedness Canada, Industry Canada, Western Economic 
Diversification and the Economic Development Agency of Canada. 
For the regions of Quebec the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency 
and the privy council and Treasury Board secretariat are also 
involved in this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada will be among the other key 
federal departments consulted.  They will also consider the 
findings of the working group that presents the recommendations 
to Treasury Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Provincial and territorial governments will have the opportunity 
to comment on the working group's findings.  They will also be 
able to make their own recommendations on any changes to the 
disaster assistance arrangements before a final version is 
adopted by the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As part of its review the working group will examine the 
disaster financial assistance arrangements as well as eligibility 
criteria for disaster relief to farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to assure the hon. member proposing the motion and all 
members in the House that the economic recovery of the 
agriculture sector after a major disaster will continue to be a 
major concern of this government.  The financial assistance 
provided by the federal government in response to the January ice 
storm is a recent example of how the government helps the 
provinces, their citizens, including farmers, to recover from 
natural disasters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A share of the $25 million the federal government has already 
provided to the Ontario government and a share the $50 million to 
the province of Quebec under the disaster financial assistance 
program arrangements are destined in part for full time farmers 
in these two provinces. 
However, the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food has announced 
that part time farmers in Quebec who were hardest hit by the ice 
storm can look forward to $50 million in further federal 
assistance to help get them back on their feet.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fifty million dollar federal ice storm recovery package for 
part time farmers, although outside the disaster financial 
assistance arrangements, addresses the main concerns put forward 
by the hon. member in his motion, namely that part time farmers, 
including so-called hobby farmers and the junior farmers category 
defined by the member's motion, will receive financial assistance 
from the federal government to help them recover from the ice 
storm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without going into the details of the program administered by 
the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, let me point out that 
this special ice storm recovery program provides part time 
farmers in Quebec with $1,000 toward their eligible ice storm 
related costs for each full week they were without power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister responsible for emergency preparedness and the 
Ontario ministry of municipal affairs and housing have announced 
the joint financial assistance program that will help part time 
farmers and rural communities in Ontario to the tune of $20 
million.  This assistance is being provided without changing 
current eligibility criteria or definitions in the longstanding 
disaster fund assistance arrangements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know how devastating the ice storm was for so many 
people, including many farmers.  We all want to do our part to 
help these people get back on their feet.  This private member's 
motion reflects the very Canadian desire to help our neighbours 
when they are need.  But because we are currently reviewing the 
eligibility criteria for farming operations and there is a 
special program for part time farmers devastated by the recent 
ice storm, I believe this motion to change the current definition 
of hobby farm under the disaster financial assistance 
arrangements should be put to the interdepartmental working 
group. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I assure all hon. members that this government cares about all 
Canadians, including all farmers, who suffered major losses during 
the January ice storm and other major disasters that wreaked 
havoc on their homes, farmsteads and essential personal 
properties.  This government stands on its record of providing 
financial assistance in disaster stricken provinces in a prompt 
and equitable manner.  We have done this through the longstanding 
disaster financial assistance program and the arrangements that 
flow from it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When circumstances warrant, as in the case of the recent ice 
storm, we have provided support outside these arrangements with a 
special ice storm recovery program for part time farmers in 
Quebec and Ontario.  We are consulting and reviewing these 
arrangements to ensure we can continue to help people when 
disaster strikes.

<P><A NAME="LINK240"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Hélène Alarie (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the motion 
on Disaster Relief Canada's definition of part time farmer is 
incomplete. Every time there is a disaster, there is the big 
problem of how to compensate these farmers who do not come under 
the program's very specific categories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion introduced today would expand the definition of 
hobby farmers, without changing the surrounding text of Diaster 
Relief Canada's definition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even with a broader definition, part time farmers would not be 
better covered by the disaster relief program. From this point of 
view, the motion becomes almost pointless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After the flooding in Lac-Saint-Jean, and in the context of 
municipal tax reform, Quebec looked at the definition of part time 
farmer.  It includes some useful categories covering people 
starting out in farming, so as to allow them time to get up and 
running, as well as all forms of specialized farming requiring a 
certain number of years to become established.  I am thinking, for 
instance, of orchards, which are not productive initially and where 
the operator must look elsewhere for money to get his enterprise 
going. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1830"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT49"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, part time farming, or at least as I know it in 
Quebec, is vital.  It is important, in my opinion, because in 
certain places it holds communities together and makes a major 
contribution to the economy, because people increasingly have to 
look for income from other sources to combine with what they earn 
in their business.  Some communities would be changed drastically 
without all the part time farmers, who hold things together and 
provide support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In such cases, the importance of part time farming cannot be 
denied, and the term hobby farmer is an insult to all those who 
play a vital role in supporting the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, it is in times of disaster that we discover the 
weaknesses in such assistance programs.  At such times, there is a 
lot of co-operation and assistance, because it is a time of crisis. 
However, when things settle down, and it is time for action, for 
rebuilding and compensation, the questions begin.  Action must be 
taken within the framework of the programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened to the suggestions earlier about the study 
undertaken by the ministerial task force, but I think their work 
should be reported to the Standing Committee on Agriculture and to 
us so we may consider all angles of it, because from the 
definition, we assess the criteria and then things get more 
complex. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reference was made as well to the programs that were 
implemented, and I would like to return to the statement made by 
ministers Vanclief and Massé on February 17.  These two ministers 
of the federal government announced unilaterally that they would be 
granting aid of $50 million to part time farmers in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government said that, with this program, and that is 
the crux, part time farmers will receive from the federal government 
assistance comparable to that provided to full time farmers under the 
disaster assistance arrangements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When assistance programs are implemented after a disaster or some 
other difficult event, we can see the hardship experienced by the 
farmers and how important it is for part time farmers to be included in 
the group that requires protection and help to get back on their feet. 
However, as it stands, the agreement does not cover them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part time farmers were told on February 17 that they would be 
treated exactly the same as full time farmers. This has not been the 
case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For full time farmers, the Government of Canada and the provinces 
share the cost 90-10, but in this program a 50-50 split was demanded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that the intent of the announcement made on February 17 has 
not been respected, which creates another problem, which is a major one 
in my opinion: duplication with respect to the cost of administering the 
program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I inquired how the implementation of the program for full time 
farmers was coming along and I learned today that some 9,000 
applications had already been distributed: 6,000 for full time farmers 
and 3,000 for part time farmers. This information comes from Quebec 
agricultural information offices because we in Quebec are close to our 
farmers. They are registered with us.

<A HREF="#LINKT50"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>But it is a system that is already in place and that, 
unfortunately, has some experience, because of the flooding in the 
Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean area.  One learns rather quickly in this 
kind of situation, although one would have preferred not to have 
had to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the result is that farmers have already been surveyed and 
work is proceeding very quickly.  We are prepared to sort out the 
problem of part time farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But now another system is being introduced for part time 
farmers that goes through a different channel, that is therefore 
not as easily accessible to farmers, who are very familiar with 
their regional offices, and that, worst of all, increases this 
program's administrative costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In crisis situations such as this one, I think the need is not 
to increase visibility or administrative costs, but to meet the 
needs of these part time farmers as quickly as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague pointed out, some of them are hobby farmers, 
but others are young or not-so-young people with growing 
agricultural operations.  For those who know this sector well, in 
these circumstances, every cent counts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, a solution must be found.  We must not wait for another 
disaster before finding a solution to this problem. 
In this sense, it is true that we must look at the definition of 
part time farmer or part time farming, as they would have it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to make one final point.  The inflexibility with 
which the $50 million program is being implemented in Quebec is 
costing farmers dearly.  A shared-cost initiative was discussed, 
without both parties being required to participate.  It is rare for 
two parties to act together when the consultation is all on one 
side.  This was the case here.  The measure introduced in no way 
took into account Quebec's programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all these reasons, therefore, and I would like to speak at 
much greater length because this is an issue that touches me 
deeply, the expression part time farmer must be redefined. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK241"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
congratulate the hon. member for Athabasca for bringing Motion 
No. 11 before the House.  It enables us to speak to the very 
crucial and important area of part time farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We recognize farming in general as one of the stronger 
frameworks of Canadian society.  That is where the permanent 
settlement is.  These are the people who come into an area and 
make a commitment, not to stay for a year or two or three but 
perhaps in many cases for generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my friend from Athabasca indicated these are extraordinary 
families.  Farming is not a job.  It is a life.  It is a 
lifestyle.  It is a career where one works in a sense 24 hours a 
day.  Not only does the farmer work but the entire family works, 
friends probably join and extended families become part of the 
operation.  It is one of those aspects of economic development 
that does not fit the usual economic model.  We are talking about 
people who are prepared to devote their lives to developing a 
farm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As others have indicated, obviously for many this starts off as 
a part time operation.  That is the way, particularly these days, 
for young people to get into farming or in British Columbia, in 
my area, what we normally call ranching.  One cannot afford the 
money to simply take over an operation on a scale that will 
enable the making of a decent living. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consequently most farmers or ranchers I know have to seek off 
farm work to make a go of it unless it is a huge corporate 
operation.  Those running the typical family farm or ranch are 
inevitably driving a school bus, working at part time teaching, 
running a gravel pit on the side, or who knows what.

<A HREF="#LINKT51"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, it does not take much for farmers to find 
themselves in situations where they consider themselves to be 
full time regular farmers but find out that half their income has 
to come from someplace else to make a go of it.  That is the 
nature of the business and I think we acknowledge that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. colleague from Athabasca has provided a very valuable 
service to the country.  I have had consultations with my 
colleagues from Winnipeg—Transcona, Winnipeg North Centre, and 
the leader of the New Democrats in Manitoba, the member of 
Parliament for Provencher. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the area of Manitoba that experienced serious flooding 
problems there are still hundreds and hundreds of farmers who 
have not received any support as a result of all types of 
jurisdictional disputes and in my judgment some rather 
insensitive political leadership in that province.  That is the 
area I know best in terms of the details. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the disasters that have befallen many food 
producers, farmers and ranchers in Alberta, northern British 
Columbia and elsewhere.  When these folks apply for support in 
recognition of a natural disaster that has occurred in their 
region, they are told that there is no support, that there are no 
programs available.  Yet, when the same thing happens in other 
parts of Canada, lo and behold there are all kinds of programs, 
all kinds of support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my friend has indicated even then there they have problems. 
If one point becomes clear today, it is that the whole area of 
farmers dealing with natural disasters and receiving some kind of 
support or encouragement to get them through these difficult 
periods has to be re-examined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the interdepartmental task force but that is not where 
the answer will lie.  It is a cumbersome process, to begin with. 
The agricultural committee, as my hon. friend has indicated, 
might be a place to begin.  My suggestion would be that the next 
time agricultural ministers from territorial and provincial 
governments across the country get together with the federal 
minister of agriculture, one of the items on the agenda should be 
how to deal with this issue in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Flooding will not stop this year.  Ice storms may not stop this 
year.  We certainly hope they do but they will probably come 
back.  Some form of natural disaster will occur. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is one thing we have learned it is that existing 
programs do not work well.  They do not treat people fairly. They 
are not offered in an equitable and fair way.  Some farmers are 
eligible; others are not.  Some parts of the country seem to me 
to be treated different from other parts of the country when it 
comes to farmer support during natural disasters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole thing is kind of a hodge-podge and we need to 
acknowledge that.  There is a serious problem.  The parliamentary 
secretary to the minister of agriculture in his speech today 
acknowledged that point.  While we send the issue off to the 
interdepartmental task force, that is one step but it is not good 
enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We owe the member a great deal of gratitude for bringing this 
matter to our attention today.  The issue of farming and the fact 
that people have to seek off farm employment to survive as a 
legitimate farmer these days has to be acknowledged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are moving into a whole new world of hemp cultivation.  The 
federal government announced that regulations were in place so 
people could start growing what I call industrial marijuana or 
hemp.  This is a new enterprise.  When we consider that there are 
50,000 identified uses for hemp, this will provide an awful lot 
of marginal farming operations with one other crop they can 
pursue as long as those markets are developed appropriately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us deal with the whole issue of what is a legitimate farmer. 
What is a legitimate part time farmer?  What is a hobby farmer? 
We acknowledge that hobby farming is a reasonable category as 
well.  Then let us identify appropriate ways to compensate 
farmers for natural disasters, when, where and if they occur, in 
a fashion that is fair, justifiable and equitable to all. 
<P><A NAME="LINK242"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do 
not want to give a long speech.  However, I listened very 
carefully to the member for Perth—Middlesex, the Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Minister of National Defence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thought he explained particularly well the role of the federal 
government in dealing with natural disasters and how the special 
nature, magnitude and focus of a particular event and the nature 
of the farming community affected by the ice storm encouraged the 
federal government to move into the area of assisting part time 
farmers. 
We have great sympathy for the very large number of people in 
that category in eastern Ontario and Quebec.  I think it was the 
particular circumstances and I think the member explained the 
federal government's position with respect to disasters.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The member opposite who raised this issue knows that we cannot 
anticipate the nature, scale or even location of disasters. 
Therefore we have to be flexible.  In this case the needs of part 
time farmers were particularly strong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I happen to know from personal knowledge that the member for 
Provencher has been working hard to get the province of Manitoba 
to amend its agreement.  He has been encountering great 
difficulties at the level of the provincial government.  I 
encourage the member for Provencher to continue doing that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK243"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a real 
honour to stand in favour of my colleague's motion.  There is no 
doubt that the challenge to farmers these days is higher in all 
likelihood than it has ever been, although I remember as a 
youngster growing up on a farm in Saskatchewan that things were 
not very easy then either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the year I was born the farm had produced nothing for two 
years in a row.  When I said in another speech in the House that 
I grew up very poor, it was because of that fact.  When I came on 
the scene in 1939 two things happened: the drought came to an end 
and the war started.  I do not know how we would correlate that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me turn to the motion and the definition of farmers and the 
need for government help when they meet disaster.  The speech of 
the parliamentary secretary gave one of our grievances out west. 
There seems to be an immediate program for disaster in some parts 
of the country.  In no way are we insensitive and unsympathetic 
to that.  However, we observe that when we have similar disasters 
in our part of the country the federal government seems to be 
much less sensitive to them.  It seems to be very difficult for 
us to obtain help for those who need it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many areas in which there seems to be a discriminatory 
attitude.  I had an interesting case reported to me in my riding. 
A young farm couple was having a great deal of financial trouble 
making ends meet.  It was tough.  Income was slow and there were 
many pressures in terms of higher costs and the need to work long 
hours for a very low rate of return. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This couple found that there was federal legislation stacked 
against them.  She had to take a part time job to pay the bills 
and keep the farm running.  Lo and behold, she got in what we 
call euphemistically the family way.  She is now eligible for UI, 
as most people are, having taken a job in one of neighbouring 
towns.  It is one of the benefits under that program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because she also had an interest in a farm, the government 
applied some very stringent and unreasonable rules in computing 
their average, forcing them to take 15% of their gross income and 
apply it as income to the family.  She only wished they could 
make 15% of their gross income; it was much less than that.  As a 
result, she is ineligible for the UI benefits that everyone else 
receives.  They were and are a family that is struggling 
financially.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In the north end of the wonderful constituency of Elk Island 
there are farmers who for two years in a row have not had a crop, 
either because of too much rain at the time of seeding or too 
much rain at the time of harvesting.  They have not been able to 
get their income.  As a result they are facing tremendous 
financial pressures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is there help for them?  No.  It does not seem to come from 
anywhere.  Their financial distress is as severe as those who 
suffer from more immediate and sudden weather disasters, which we 
have heard a lot about in the last couple of years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I emphasize again that I am neither unsympathetic to them nor 
saying in any way that they should be cut off.  What I am saying 
is that there ought to be a system of equity applied so that 
different members of society and the farming community are 
treated equitably.  Those with financial difficulties because of 
circumstances totally beyond their control as in the case of 
aberrant weather should have assistance from a government program 
as do others in different parts of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of people are part time farmers and part time everything 
else.  Some farmers in my riding and elsewhere who among other 
things went into trucking because there was not enough income 
from the farm to keep the farm going. Consequently they get 
involved in trucking or some other part time business.  They take 
employment in the oilfields or in my riding in some of the 
chemical plants.  Some farmers in Saskatchewan had to take jobs 
in the potash mines just to supplement the farm income and keep 
on farming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result they are ineligible in their farming operation for 
some other benefits.  Even with the passing of the Crow rate 
there was some tremendous inequities because of the application 
of certain rules that apply on the federal scene. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge members of the House to support strongly my colleague's 
motion.  Action should be taken.  The motion was not drawn for 
being a votable motion so it appears, having had the pleasure of 
getting this off our hearts, nothing will be done about it.  That 
is wrong.  Action should be taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion is one of great importance and urgency.  If we cannot 
vote on it in the House and bring in an act that will result in 
some changes, at least my colleague has brought the matter to our 
attention, to the attention of the government and to the 
attention of ministers who are in a position to do something 
about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government were to bring forward a bill to address the 
issue in the way my colleague is suggesting, it would receive the 
attention the House would be willing to give it.  Certainly our 
party would support it, provided that it met the criteria my 
colleague is suggesting.  We should do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I challenge the government and the minister to look at it, to 
treat it as a matter of urgency and to do something about it.  It 
is not sufficient and it is not satisfying to me as a member of 
Parliament for farm families in my riding, in Athabasca, in some 
cases who have been in the farming business for years and for 
generations, to face the loss of their property at this stage.  I 
urge the government to do something about it and to bring in a 
government bill that will bring this matter to a resolution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sincerely hope this will not have been just an hour of debate 
but that something will result from it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  When the hon. member for Athabasca

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
really do not know how to express my disappointment at the 
response of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
National Defence to this issue.  Either he misunderstood issues 
in the motion or he chose to ignore them almost totally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is wonderful news that the Department of National Defence and 
other departments are considering changes to the way disaster 
relief funding is provided to small businessmen and to farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another fundamental issue that he refused to even acknowledge 
was that there was a flood in northern Alberta and that the 
Alberta government applied for special funding for disaster 
relief for part time farmers and small business people.  That 
request was denied to farmers and small business people in 
northern Alberta on two occasions, once the same summer and now 
this winter, for whatever reasons.  I have to assume because they 
were in a different part of the country that special funding was 
provided.  That was a sad day for Canadian unity, for equality 
and for fairness across the country.  I was certainly 
disappointed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the flood in my part of the world was nowhere near the 
magnitude of the Saguenay or of the ice storm, certainly I know 
of farm families that were destroyed and are no longer families. 
I know of farmers who committed suicide because of the economic 
and personal hardship they suffered because of the disaster.  To 
simply brush them off as not important and not worthy of the same 
kind of consideration as farmers in Ontario and Quebec is simply 
wrong, unfair and unworthy of a government that has 
responsibility for all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard from the member of the Bloc Quebecois Party and others 
that there was some desire to have the issue go further. I would 
like to ask for the unanimous consent of the House to refer this 
subject matter to the Standing Committee on Agriculture and 
Agri-Food for further study and recommendations to the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The House has heard the proposal of 
the hon. member for Athabasca.  Is there unanimous consent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  There is not unanimous consent.  The

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>IMMIGRATION 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK247"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, over 
the last few months I have had the chance to familiarize myself 
with the reality of immigrants and refugees trying to settle in 
Canada in hope of a new life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without a doubt, starting a new life again in an often entirely 
different social and cultural environment is a long and difficult 
process.  I thus believe it is our collective role to facilitate 
the adaptation of newcomers who wish to participate fully in our 
society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not forget that most of us are immigrants or descend from 
people who decided to settle here two years or two centuries ago. 
Canada, as we all know, is a country of immigration.  We are all 
immigrants except for the aboriginal peoples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over past decades immigrants have made enormous contributions to 
the success of our economy.  The mix of people of various ethnic 
origins has enriched our national life tremendously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following the release of a report from an advisory group in 
January 1998, the minister announced her intention to review the 
Immigration Act.  We agree that our immigration policy and 
practices need some refreshment. People seeking protection in 
Canada are often waiting more than two years before their case is 
settled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recently had someone calling me, saying that her family was 
separated since 1991 because of complications in the sponsorship 
procedures.

<A HREF="#LINKT55"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another dramatic example of the limits of the system is a case I 
was personally touched by, a drama that took place in my own city 
of Halifax.  I am referring to the four Filipino seamen who 
courageously reported an incident of three Romanian stowaways 
while their ship, the <I>Maresk Dubai</I>, sailed toward Halifax. 
These four courageous men asked for Canada's protection after 
their families in the Philippines were harassed and intimidated 
due to their testimony against the captain and five other crew 
members who allegedly forced the Romanian stowaways overboard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although going back to the Philippines appeared to be a threat 
to these people and their family security, they were denied 
refugee status by the Immigration Refugee Board.  The board's two 
member panel concluded that the harassment was not sufficient to 
be considered persecution.  Now their only chance is through a 
request to the minister for exceptional humanitarian 
consideration, but that same minister refused to allow the 
seamen's family members to come and testify during the refugee 
board hearings. What chance do they have?  Under basic justice 
principles these men and their families truly deserve our 
protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the kind of example that makes me worry about the 
changes coming to the Immigration Act.  The government seems to 
think of immigration as an economic tool with people seeking 
protection as a secondary category. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will also remember this Liberal government as the government 
that imposed the infamous head tax on newcomers.  This $975 right 
of landing fee imposed on all adults becoming permanent residents 
is reminiscent of the head tax that was used to prevent the 
establishment of Chinese Canadian families at the beginning of 
this century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new head tax is disproportionately affecting refugees and 
families immigrating through sponsorship.  The United Nations 
High Commissioner for Refugees raised some concerns that refugee 
access to protection might be affected since many are coming to 
Canada with limited financial resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I asked the minister to remove this offensive tax she 
responded: “According to our studies we have penalized no one 
wishing to settle in this country”.  When I asked her for those 
studies I was informed they did not exist.  People working 
closely with immigrants clearly told me that there was an impact 
on low income families. It is time for the minister to realize 
this tax, the resource from which does not even serve to help 
newcomers settle in Canada, was a mistake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current review process is a good time for this government to 
give some indication of the future direction of our immigration 
policy.  Will that direction be toward a restricted view based on 
cold economics and fear of differences or rather toward an open 
policy that recognizes both the positive impact newcomers have on 
our collective life and the humane dimensions of immigration? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian government must live up to its commitment and 
change its current policy of giving priority to investors and 
economic immigration over family reunification and humanitarian 
cases such as the case of the seamen from the <I>Maresk Dubai</I>. 
Removing the head tax would be the first step in that— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The hon. Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Citizenship and Immigration. 
<P><A NAME="LINK248"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Maria Minna (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, family 
reunification has been and continues to be very important for 
this government.  There are no limits.  It is strictly on demand. 
There is not a cap nor is there a quota on family reunification 
in this country.   There was none before, there is none now and 
there will likely be none. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report of the advisory committee to the minister is not a 
government report.  The minister has said that she has concerns 
with aspects of that report.  There are also interesting and 
useful aspects of that report.  If the hon. member wants to 
participate in that discussion it is important that he does so at 
this time.  It is important when the decisions are made that they 
be the right decisions for Canadians and for immigrants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the issue of fees, as we are all aware, certain 
fees are associated with obtaining permanent residency in this 
country.  The government recognizes that some individuals, 
specifically refugees, may have some difficulty in paying these 
fees.  That is why a loan program is in place to offer financial 
assistance to these individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not understand my hon. colleague's concern about this 
program or his implication that it does not work.  In every 
respect it has been a major success story.  First, there is no 
evidence to suggest people are being unfairly penalized by our 
fees.  The loan program ensures money is available to individuals 
in genuine need.  In fact, 95% of the beneficiaries of loans are 
refugees.  Second, we are not simply giving this money to people. 
It is a loan.  I am pleased to inform the House that over 92% of 
the loans have been paid back.  Repayments to this revolving fund 
in 1996-97 totalled $10.2 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This not only demonstrates the government's commitment to 
helping immigrants and refugees enter Canada, it also speaks well 
of the integrity of newcomers who are coming to our country to 
start new lives.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>POST-SECONDARY EDUCATION 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK250"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, on February 
24, I asked the Minister of Finance on the eve of his balanced 
budget to address the serious concerns about funding for 
post-secondary deaf students in Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Beginning on April 1, 1998 funding for post-secondary education 
and disability related post-secondary school support will no 
longer be the responsibility of vocational rehabilitation 
services in the ministry of community and social services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently students in the VRS program receive financial support 
to cover direct costs such as tuition and books as well as 
indirect costs such as a living allowance, interpreters and 
note takers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through VRS counsellors these students also receive advice and 
support in planning their educational and vocational careers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As of April 1 these students will be required to seek assistance 
instead through the ministry of education and training's Ontario 
student assistance program and through special needs offices in 
colleges and universities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Ontario Association for the Deaf has identified a number of 
specific concerns around this new formula.  First, eligibility 
for financial assistance will be based on a family's income as 
determined by a needs test.  It is anticipated that many current 
VRS students will not be eligible for OSAP and that will impose 
immediate and significant financial burdens on families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, special needs offices in colleges and universities are 
already overworked and understaffed.  In addition, they do not 
have the experience or expertise to meet the unique 
communications needs of deaf and hard of hearing students. 
Although a total of $4.9 million is being transferred to meet 
these students' access needs, no details have been announced 
about how much is being allocated to each institution and how 
these funds will be used. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, the valuable consultation and support currently provided 
to students by VRS counsellors will cease on April 1. No 
provision has been made to replace this essential vocational 
planning support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, many deaf and hard of hearing students are not 
academically ready for post-secondary studies.  No accommodation 
has been made for the funding of upgrading and retraining 
programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parents and students are extremely upset, confused and angry 
with these new developments.  The domino effect for deaf students 
and all disabled students continues as the government continues 
to balance its budget on the backs of the most vulnerable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Disabled students are being short changed in their educational 
opportunities.  This will seriously weaken their employability 
and this will perpetuate the cycle of unemployment and 
underemployment that has plagued people with disabilities 
historically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the government to seriously consider the additional cost 
of education facing deaf students and all students with 
disabilities.  I ask the government to keep the promises it made 
to the disabled in its 1996 task force report “The Will to Act” 
and to start doing the right thing for the disabled in this 
country. 
<P><A NAME="LINK251"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime 
Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have the 
opportunity to state that the Government of Canada is committed 
to providing all Canadians with the opportunity to access 
affordable post-secondary education so that they may prosper in a 
knowledge based economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada student loans program recognizes the particular needs 
of students with permanent disabilities.  A special opportunities 
grant of up to $3,000 a year is designed to offset certain 
exceptional education related costs incurred as a result of 
disability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Students who are unable to pay their loans because of disability 
may also apply for a permanent disability benefit in the form of 
loan forgiveness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Effective August 1 this year, Canada student grants will also 
offer up to $3,000 per year to students who have permanent 
disabilities and dependence to assist them in their full time or 
part time studies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian opportunities strategy will also help Canadians, 
including Canadians with disabilities, to succeed in the changing 
economy.  It provides for improved access to knowledge and skills 
for all Canadians through the new $2.5 billion millennium 
scholarship fund, a fund which persons with disabilities will 
also be able to tap into. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget will also help Canadians coping with student debtload 
with tax relief on interest payments and debt assistance to those 
facing financial difficulty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to point out that the 1998 budget announced 
additional tax measures to recognize the cost associated with 
disabilities.  Following the 1998 budget, tax assistance measures 
for disability and medical expense now represent $635 million per 
year in tax credits.

disabilities find and keep jobs was announced.  Indeed the 
Government of Canada is committed to people with disabilities

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>CHILD POVERTY 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK253"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is an 
honour to have a chance to say a few words about the state of 
child poverty in our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember a very wise person once saying that you can tell a 
great deal about a society when you see how it cares for its 
children.  On that count the federal government has to be 
somewhat embarrassed.  This morning, probably in the richest 
country in the world, 1.4 million children woke up living in 
poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As someone said recently in this House, when a parent fails to 
provide basic food, shelter and clothing for a child they are 
often charged with child abuse.  It is considered to be a form of 
child abuse when you deprive a young child of decent food, 
clothing and shelter.  Yet when a government does that it is 
called balancing the budget or getting the fundamentals in place, 
or some various of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is tens of thousands of children every week in our 
country have to go to food banks with their parents in order to 
survive.  Tens of thousands of young children from coast to coast 
to coast are living in conditions that are completely 
unacceptable.  They are living in little dark, damp basement 
suites, tiny cubicles in overcrowded tenements, forced to stay in 
a broken down motel on social services in some community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we consider that the richest country in the world has a 
government that stands passively by and is prepared to accept the 
reality that 1.4 million children must live in poverty, it is 
nothing short of immoral.  We should be embarrassed as a 
Parliament and as a country.  The government should place as the 
highest priority to take steps to ensure that these children no 
longer have to live their lives in poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suspect there are some people who would say that is just the 
way the world is, there are no alternatives and there are always 
poor children.  That is not the case.  There are many countries 
where there are no poor children.  Norway has no poor children. 
There are no poor children in Denmark.  The reason there are no 
poor children in Denmark or Norway is there are no poor parents 
living in those countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have social and support programs that place a value on 
children and young people. When a mother has to leave her place 
of work in order to bear a child she gets a year's leave at 90% 
salary.  The father gets a leave up to a year with 90% salary. 
That country puts a priority on parents being able to be there at 
that very crucial young age to nurture, develop and support and 
to give that young child the kind of break in life he or she 
deserves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do we say to the 1.4 million children who live in poverty? 
It means they are being denied a whole set of things in their 
lives that they should not be denied.  I realize poverty does not 
necessarily mean that you live a deprived lifestyle but it 
certainly goes a long way to see that reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Conference of Catholic Bishops said that for the Government 
of Canada to stand passively by and allow 1.4 million children to 
live in poverty is in fact a form of child abuse. 
<P><A NAME="LINK254"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime 
Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, child poverty is a pressing 
issue and the concern of everyone in the country.  It cannot be 
eliminated overnight.  It cannot be addressed by one level of 
government alone.  The federal government has recognized this 
issue and its complexity and is therefore determined to continue 
to address it as a priority in collaboration with the provinces 
and territories.

<A HREF="#LINKT58"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we have built the national child benefit system. 
That is why as a first step in our last budget we allocated $850 
million to begin increased support to over one million children 
and their families starting this coming July.  That is why we 
have allocated in this year's budget an additional $850 million 
to enrich this benefit over the next two years, $425 million as 
of July 1999 and another $425 million as of July 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The goal of this additional initiative is simple:  pooling 
federal, provincial and territorial resources to ensure that 
children are always better off when their parents leave social 
assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, when the annual federal assistance provided to 
families through the Canada child tax benefit system is fully 
implemented it will have increased by $1.7 billion, which is more 
than 30% since 1996. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is committed to giving our smallest infant and 
older children a good start in life.  The national child benefit 
system will play a key role in fighting child poverty so as to 
help provide that good start for them.

</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK256"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise in this evening's adjournment debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On November 25 and December 1, I questioned the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs about a problem affecting the residents of the 
riding I represent in the House.  Litigation continues between 
three constituents and a nebulous non profit organization that is 
accredited with the United Nations Economic and Social Council, the 
international agency for rural industrialization, better known as 
INARI. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On May 5, 1997, the individuals involved complained to the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs about this agency, alleging fraudulent 
practices and false representations.  Nearly a year later, they are 
still waiting for the matter to be resolved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In brief, the facts are as follows.  A number of Canadians and 
Quebeckers, including the three I referred to earlier, paid 
substantial sums to INARI and incurred considerable expenses to be 
repaid in initiating a rural industrialization project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agency, it must be understood, appeared entirely credible, 
because it was using the United Nations' logo, prestige and network 
to carry out its operations.  These people saw their investments 
rapidly disappear, thus discovering the agency's lack of 
responsibility and dubious practices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Claims for refunds and compensation have been made to the 
director general of INARI, a man named Okorie Okorie, who could not 
offer anything but false hopes. This has had serious consequences on the 
psychological, social and financial well-being of the families involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Investigations and redress procedures have been launched by the 
victims. Messrs. Audet, Daoust and Yee did not miss the opportunity to 
inform me, as well as my colleague, the member for Marguerite-d'Youville 
at the National Assembly, of the problems they faced. As a matter of 
fact, we made representations jointly to the Minister of Foreign Affairs 
to ask him to intervene in this matter to defend these people and all 
the other Canadians and Quebeckers whose rights were obviously abused by 
this agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Quebec minister of international relations, Sylvain 
Simard, was also interested in this matter, as were some of the 
media, who made inquiries of the United Nations only to be turned 
away and to see a number of those responsible for this sidestep the 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is definitely something very fishy here.  It seems that 
the federal government was aware of these dodgy manoeuvres by 
INARI.  INARI's financial director, a certain Louie Moore, had 
apparently been convicted of fraud in the United States, and banned 
from France on the same grounds.  Yet, on a number of occasions, he 
was able to cross the border in order to pursue his illegal 
activities on Canadian soil. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was therefore the duty of the Canadian government to 
intervene in order to assist the victims and ensure such a thing 
could never happen again. 
The Minister of Foreign Affairs therefore wrote last December 
informing me that a representative of the Canadian delegation to 
the UN would be attending the next meeting of the committee 
responsible for NGOs, in mid-January 1998, in order to make sure 
this case was raised and that proceedings were initiated to resolve 
the disputes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That committee would then have the authority to suspend 
INARI's observer status and, eventually, to withdraw any United 
Nations accreditation.  We are now half way through March and have 
still heard nothing about the outcome of this theoretical meeting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion, the victims of this fraud have waited long 
enough, and they now deserve to know where the matter stands, after 
the meeting of the UN committee responsible for NGOs.

this issue and informed the House and those directly affected by this 
fraud of the outcome of its representations to the United Nations.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in May, three 
businessmen from the Montreal region wrote to the Minister of Foreign 
Affairs to complain about the fraudulent practices of the international 
agency for rural industrialization, a non-governmental organization 
accredited with the United Nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A reply was sent, explaining that INARI is a private organization 
based in Togo, with the status of observer at the UN's Economic and 
Social Council and its subsidiary bodies. It is strictly in that 
capacity that INARI participates in ECOSOC's debates, and its status 
does not in any way engage the responsibility of the UN or its member 
states regarding the legality of its activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since INARI is a private organization based in Togo, the Canadian 
government does not have jurisdiction to get involved in the management 
of its internal affairs. 
Still, we did report the complaint made by these Canadian businessmen to 
the UN secretariat, which pledged to refer it to the UN committee 
responsible for NGOs. The members of that committee—Canada is not one 
of them—review issues relating to NGOs at the United Nations, and can 
review, if necessary, the observer status granted to certain NGO's.

deemed adopted. Accordingly, the House stands adjourned until 
tomorrow at 10 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
