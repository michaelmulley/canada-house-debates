<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="INTEGRITYINGOVERNMENT">INTEGRITY IN GOVERNMENT</A></H3>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to talk about trust; the trust citizens place in their 
government, the trust politicians earn from the public, the trust 
in institutions that is as vital to a democracy as the air we 
breathe, a trust that once shattered, is difficult, almost 
impossible to rebuild.
<P>
	Since our election in October no goal has been more important 
to this government, or to me personally as Prime Minister, than 
restoring the trust of Canadians in their institutions.
<P>
	When we took office there was an unprecedented level of 
public cynicism about our national institutions and the people to 
whom they were entrusted by the voters. The political process 
had been thrown into disrepute. People saw a political system 
which served its own interests and not those of the public. When 
trust is gone the system cannot work.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	That is why we have worked so hard to re-establish those 
bonds of trust. The most important thing we have done is to keep 
our word. We said we would cancel the helicopter contract and 
we did. We had to be satisfied that NAFTA would meet our 
concerns before it was finalized and we were.
<P>
	We said we would create a $6 billion infrastructure program 
with all three orders of government and we have.
<P>
	We brought in a budget that restores hope for Canadians while 
meeting our campaign commitment of reducing the deficit to3 per cent of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and we did; and 
we have addressed the stabilization of Canada's 
fisheries-particularly the Atlantic fisheries-and foreign 
overfishing as we said we would.
<P>
	Honouring the promises we made is a key part of restoring the 
trust of Canadians. We have also worked hard to restore trust by 
restoring relevance to the House of Commons. We have given 
MPs a larger role in drafting legislation and greater influence 
over government expenditures.
<P>
	For the first time ever, MPs debated the budget before it was 
tabled. We have also had policy debates on issues like cruise 
missile testing. We have had two debates, here in this House, 
about what should be the government's position on Canada's 
presence in the former Yugoslavia. Everyone agrees that those 
discussions have produced positive results; and they took place 
before the government made a decision.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Finally, we have worked to restore trust by showing 
Canadians that as far as this government is concerned, integrity 
is more than just nice words or photo ops, it is a way of life.
<P>
	There is no better example of this than our cancellation of the 
Pearson airport deal. We sent out a strong, clear message that the 
integrity of this country's institutions is not for sale, that this 
government and this Parliament would serve the interests of all 
Canadians, not the interests of the privileged few, no matter how 
well connected.
<P>
	Keeping our promises, giving a meaningful voice to the 
elected representatives in this House and putting an end to the 
politics of cronyism and secret back door deals is how this 
government has been restoring faith and trust among Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1010 ) </B>
<P>
	I am pleased to announce today that we are continuing to 
re-establish trust by delivering on a number of key 
commitments we made to Canadians during the election and by 
taking unprecedented action to open up the process of 
government in Ottawa.
<P>
	Today we are introducing amendments to strengthen the 
Lobbyists Registration Act. These improvements are in line 
with the unanimous June 1993 report of the House of Commons 
Standing Committee on Consumer and Corporate Affairs 
respecting the Lobbyists Registration Act.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5396"> 5396 </A></B>
<P>
	These changes will force lobbying out from the shadows into 
the open and make it clear to everyone who is representing 
whom, on which issue, and what they are doing.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We have no disagreement with individuals or companies that 
choose to have someone represent them. That is their business 
and their right. But Canadians nonetheless have a right to know 
who is trying to influence elected and public officials.
<P>
	Deals like the Pearson Airport deal must never be allowed to 
happen again. That is why, through our changes to the Lobbyists 
Registration Act, we will be able to force the disclosure of 
lobbying fees related to government contracts.
<P>
	That is why we are building in tough penalties-up to and 
including prison sentences-for those who break these new 
rules. That is why we are prohibiting the inclusion of 
contingency fees in lobbyists' contracts. That is why we are 
appointing an official who will have the teeth to investigate and 
take action.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I am pleased to announce today the appointment of Canada's 
first ethics counsellor, the current assistant deputy registrar 
general, Mr. Howard Wilson. Mr. Wilson's experience and his 
well-earned reputation for probity and integrity make him an 
ideal choice for this important post.
<P>
	The ethics counsellor will oversee and enforce both the 
strengthened Lobbyists Registration Act and a revised, more 
comprehensive conflict of interest code that will replace the old 
conflict of interest guidelines.
<P>
	We have broadened the powers and responsibilities of the 
ethics counsellor from what we laid out in the red book. In the 
red book, the ethics counsellor was to deal with the activities of 
lobbyists, but as we started examining implementation, it 
became clear that this will only address half of the problem, 
basically from the outside in.
<P>
	We wanted to be sure that our system would also be effective 
at withstanding lobbying pressure from the inside. That is why 
we have decided to expand the role of the ethics counsellor to 
include conflict of interest.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	By merging the Ethics Counsellor's function with the 
Assistant Deputy Registrar General's existing role in enforcing 
guidelines on conflict of interest, we will have both a stronger 
and a more unified oversight role, one with real teeth and strong 
investigative powers. We will also avoid the wasteful overlap 
and duplication inherent in creating an entirely new office.
<P>
	We also said in the red book that we wanted a Code of Conduct 
for Members of Parliament and Senators. This Code would 
guide their dealings with lobbyists. We will ask a Committee of 
Parliament to take this matter on and have a Code of Conduct in 
place as soon as possible,  because I feel that MPs themselves 
must take responsibility for those decisions, as I myself have 
taken responsibility for the activities of the government, 
lobbyists, parliamentary secretaries and others.
<P>
<B>(1015) </B>
<P>
	We also consulted with the Leader of the Opposition and the 
leader of the Reform Party on the choice of the Ethics 
Counsellor a few weeks ago, and I know that they look forward 
to this person's annual reports to Parliament as much as I do. 
They know, as we all do, that trust in the institutions of 
government is not a partisan issue, but something all of us 
elected to public office have an obligation to restore.
<P>
	I know they will work as hard as we will on this side of the 
House to build on the renewed trust Canadians are showing in 
Parliament and in the political process.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The steps we have announced today are important. They will 
go a long way toward guarding against the excesses of the past 
and making the system more transparent and open.
<P>
	There can be no substitute for responsibility at the top. The 
Prime Minister sets the moral tone for the government and must 
make the ultimate decisions when issues of trust or integrity are 
raised. That is what leadership is all about.
<P>
	As Harry Truman put it, the buck stops here. I vow to you, to 
this House, to Canadians, that I will never abdicate that 
responsibility. I will never pass the buck.
<P>
	Of all the lessons we learn in life, many of the most valuable 
are the ones we learn at a young age from our parents. My father 
taught me early on that nothing, not wealth, nor social status, 
nor fame, nor glory, is more important than your good name.
<P>
	In the end, it is all that we really have. It cannot be bartered or 
traded. When it is gone, it can never come back. My father's 
teaching has also been the credo of my political life. For more 
than 30 years it has served me quite well.
<P>
	What is true for an individual is also true for a government. 
We pledge to you and to all Canadians that we will guard our 
good name with all that we can and that we will not betray the 
hopes so many Canadians have vested in us.
<P>
	At the end of the first part of the session, I would like to pay 
tribute to all members of Parliament.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	After a long career in politics, and in spite of some pretty 
tough debates and some pretty exciting Question Periods, I think 
that is what observers are saying; I would like to thank the 
Leader of the Opposition and his party-
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5397"> 5397 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I would like to say thank you to the Reform Party and its 
leader. This Parliament has operated a a level that was not 
known before. It is my duty to thank all members of Parliament, 
the Leader of the Opposition and the leader of the Reform Party 
for having helped us to achieve that.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I think the finest compliment this Parliament has received 
since we opened this session in the middle of January was the 
poll taken by an American firm and reported in the newspapers 
here in Canada a few weeks ago.
<P>
<B>(1020) </B>
<P>
	A poll was taken in April in the world's nine largest 
democracies, including Mexico, the United States, Canada, 
Great Britain, France and Germany. Canadians were the ones 
who said they had the most trust in their government.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	That poll is a compliment to all of us and we should take credit 
for it. During the campaign when I was trying to get candidates 
sometimes people were very reluctant to run in politics because 
of the disrepute unfortunately into which the profession had 
slipped. Today we have managed to restore the prestige of this 
institution. It is a credit to all members of Parliament who were 
elected, whatever their political opinions and options.
<P>
	Public service is a great calling. Public service is a very 
honourable profession. A public calling is the desire of all of us 
to try to make society better for all our citizens. I have been a 
professional politician and I am very proud of it. I could not 
have had a better career because perhaps in my riding or 
travelling in the nation I have been able to do something good, 
making some progress in the quality of life. Every member of 
Parliament will have this experience.
<P>
	I am telling hon. members that when they are alone and they 
think about it they will feel good that perhaps some people are 
happier because we have offered our service.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, nothing makes the job of a leader of the opposition who 
plans to criticize the government more difficult than being 
complimented by the Prime Minister first.
<P>
	I would like to start by thanking the Prime Minister and 
expressing my appreciation for the opportunity he has given this 
House and Parliament as a whole of joining in consideration of 
an extremely important issue, the proposed legislation on 
lobbyists and the tightening up and improving of ethical 
standards in public life. I fully endorse, I echo, the Prime 
Minister's remarks just now on the need to maintain and 
promote respect for our  institutions and especially for the 
institution of Parliament.
<P>
	Parliament is the ultimate forum where democracy can speak 
out rationally, respectful of the value of others. It is here that our 
problems, whatever they are, must be solved, and solved in the 
right way. To this extent, the steps the government is proposing 
to take-with the opposition's co-operation, I am sure-to 
tighten up and strengthen standards of conduct within the 
federal administration, and on the federal scene, are most 
welcome.
<P>
	I want to make clear right away that we fully support the 
appointment of Mr. Howard Wilson as Ethics Counsellor. We are 
aware that Mr. Wilson has had a praiseworthy career in the 
federal Public Service and that we can have every confidence in 
his ability to take the helm in this matter at a critical time.
<P>
	Second, we are also fully in favour of the proposed combining 
of the duties and responsibilities of the Ethics Counsellor. It 
seems to me that the government is right to want to avoid 
duplication and to safeguard consistency and greater 
effectiveness in the implementation of provisions ensuring 
respect for ethical standards, especially as regards lobbyists.
<P>
<B>(1025) </B>
<P>
	I want to add that we also support-it gets tiring to keep 
repeating that the opposition agrees with the government-we 
also support the creation of a joint committee of the House and 
the Senate to define a code of conduct for MPs and senators, for 
everyone, in fact, who is not already covered by the existing 
guidelines, which are, I understand, going to be broadened and 
tightened up for senior public servants and ministers.
<P>
	Now we have reached the nub of the matter before us this 
morning, the Lobbyists Registration Act. During the election 
campaign the government made a commitment to strengthen 
controls and improve the Act. The Act was a commendable first 
step, but it proved in practice to be too weak. A House 
committee considered the matter for quite a long time, worked 
hard under the chairmanship of MP Felix Holtmann, and tabled a 
report last June that found there was a need to change things to 
improve the Act. The government adopted the committee's 
proposal, since as we all know the red book promised that its 
recommendations would be implemented.
<P>
	First, as far as the Ethics Counsellor is concerned, the powers 
of investigation attributed to him strike us as appropriate, a step 
in the right direction. If an Ethics Counsellor can on his own 
initiative launch investigations as soon as he has reason to 
suspect that a violation has been committed, that is a step in the 
right direction. Our examination has been purely preliminary; 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5398"> 5398 </A></B>
<P>
naturally as the proceedings on the legislation unfold we will go 
into greater detail.
<P>
	I understand that the Ethics Counsellor will be given powers 
of investigation, so that he will be able to summon witnesses, 
compel them to testify, and under oath, and that the evidence he 
obtains in this way will be admissible in court if a criminal 
offence has occurred. These provisions are more or less the same 
as the rules of evidence in the case of depositions to 
commissions of inquiry.
<P>
	This having been said, I want to go on to some remarks that I 
think are very important, on the need to improve the legislation, 
because this bill has some serious shortcomings. I think the 
government can be persuaded of this. It is the opposition that 
will have to do this. We will of course have an opportunity to 
work with government MPs and we think we can persuade the 
government to change the legislation in a number of ways.
<P>
	First, the Ethics Counsellor must be appointed not by the 
government but by the House of Commons. The government 
should have to submit Mr. Wilson's name to us. We know we 
will approve, it is not the individual who is at issue, we are 
committed to supporting his appointment. But the Ethics 
Counsellor should hold his mandate from Parliament. That 
would considerably increase his authority, his powers and his 
ability to intervene directly in anything related to the way 
government operates.
<P>
	Remember, this is no ordinary appointment. This is the person 
who will have the authority to intervene in the way government 
manages its affairs, in Cabinet ministers' personal ethical 
conduct vis-à-vis their public responsibilities, even in 
decisions the Prime Minister might make; the person who will 
be able to make sure that the conduct of whatever Prime 
Ministers the future may produce will be consistent with the 
ethical standards that have been set.
<P>
	So the person holding this position will be that much more 
comfortable, and the public will be that much more confident 
that he will carry out his duties as he should, if he is under the 
ultimate authority of Parliament. That is why I would urge the 
Prime Minister to consider the need, as I see it, to submit this 
appointment to Parliament as a government recommendation to 
be endorsed by Parliament, so that the Ethics Counsellor would 
be answerable directly to Parliament.
<P>
	I do not want to run out of time before I have a chance to 
discuss two shortcomings in the bill that are, in my opinion, very 
serious. First, it maintains the distinction between two 
categories of lobbyists.
<P>
<B>(1030) </B>
<P>
	Reading the Standing Committee's report of last June, it is 
clear that the fundamental criticism the Committee made of the 
existing legislation-and there were Liberals on that 
Committee-was that the distinction between the two levels of 
lobbyists ought to be done away with, that a preferential system 
should not be maintained for lobbyists employed by big 
corporations over professional lobbyists.
<P>
	The Act distinguishes between firms of lobbyists that identify 
themselves as such and take ad hoc contracts to make 
representations to the government and influence decisions, and 
other lobbyists, known as in-house lobbyists, whose official 
title might be ``Vice President for Government Affairs'' with a 
big company, and who might be based here in Ottawa, doing 
exactly the same work as professional lobbyists.
<P>
	The existing legislation, which the bill being tabled this 
morning is supposed to amend and improve, provides that the 
lobbyists in this second category, the ones who work full-time 
and on salary for big corporations, do not have the same 
obligations. And when I skim quickly through the bill, as I said 
before, the distinction in requirements is still there.
<P>
	For example, a Vice President for Government Affairs based 
here in Ottawa and working for a big company, whose sole job it 
is to lobby on his company's behalf, would not be obliged to 
divulge what contract he wants to obtain when he meets with 
senior public servants.
<P>
	He is obliged to divulge the program and the type of 
legislation, but the others, the professional lobbyists, are 
obliged to divulge the contract. People are indicating to me that 
I am wrong. We will see. It often happens that people tell me I 
am wrong, but we will see as the proceedings unfold.
<P>
	A second and I would say more serious, more fundamental 
shortcoming, is that lobbyists should be obliged, just as they 
used to be, to divulge the target of their interventions: whom are 
they going to approach? That way we know the nature of the role 
they are going to play. The Act simply says they have to divulge 
the names of departments and government bodies, but it is 
absolutely essential that they say which minister they are going 
to see.
<P>
	Is a particular lobbyist going to see this or that senior 
government member, who may be in a position to exercise 
greater influence, for example, because he has something to do 
with campaign funds? It is important to know these things. It is 
the very essence of the legislation, it goes to the very heart of its 
effectiveness and the goal it is trying to achieve, that it should 
spell out very clearly, much more clearly than this bill does, in 
any event, the requirement that the individuals, the 
decision-makers who are going to be approached by lobbyists in 
the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5399"> 5399 </A></B>
<P>
course of their representations on behalf of their clients, be 
identified.
<P>
	So there is plenty of work to be done. We are very pleased that 
this House has the opportunity to do it. We are going to work 
closely with other parliamentarians. We are not resigned to 
failing to convince the government of the need for 
improvements. I am sure that the government is open to these 
suggestions and that we will be able to give the people of Canada 
and Quebec a law that will assure them that there is a group of 
people in the federal Parliament who are working for their 
well-being and giving them every guarantee of doing so with the 
most scrupulous honesty.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island):</B> Mr. Speaker, the right hon. Prime 
Minister has correctly identified a need for trust in government. 
We too have found that many Canadians are disillusioned with 
government and cynical with its processes. But the question I 
want to ask is whether the statement of the government today is 
going in the right direction and whether it is going far enough.
<P>
	Before I comment on the Prime Minister's speech I would like 
to make a comment on the process that has been going on here 
with respect to this legislation. I have found it extremely 
frustrating to try to build the response I am giving now because 
of the guarded secrecy which has surrounded this issue until 
today. I challenge the wisdom of operating in secret to this 
degree especially since the topic of the day is openness.
<P>
	The Prime Minister has outlined some of the achievements of 
his government so far. There have been some minor cosmetic 
changes, some symbolism, but not much substance. The right 
words are being used but they have not in my opinion delivered 
anything substantial to this point.
<P>
<B>(1035 ) </B>
<P>
	The Prime Minister indicates that they have given MPs a 
larger role in drafting legislation and greater influence over 
government expenditures. Then he goes on to say that for the 
first time, MPs debated the budget before it was tabled.
<P>
	If the question is whether the people of Canada through their 
elected representatives have power to control government 
overspending, the answer is a resounding no. We did in fact have 
an opportunity to speak, but no one heard. We gave many well 
documented facts and figures and they were ignored.
<P>
	The government is continuing on its path to increasing debt 
despite the protests of the taxpayers who can see clearly that this 
is wrong.
<P>
	No, there is little here beyond the fluff of correct terminology. 
There is not yet any substance to a promise of more open, more 
responsive, and more representative government.
<P>
	The Prime Minister made mention of the Pearson airport deal. 
Indeed, this deal stands as a monument to the evil of backroom 
dealings without accountability. We must commend the 
government for taking prompt action to bring that deal to a halt, 
but now what is happening?
<P>
	The Reform Party moved an amendment to the bill which 
would require full disclosure of any agreements entered into to 
terminate the Pearson deal. We felt that Canadian taxpayers 
should know the amounts paid and the recipients of those 
payments. Yet every Liberal in this House voted against that 
amendment, defeating it and preventing Canadians from 
possibly ever knowing what kind of backroom deals the present 
government engaged in to bring this project to a halt.
<P>
	I seriously doubt that the measures being proposed today 
would have the effect of being able to prevent another deal like 
the Pearson deal.
<P>
	The government is proposing to send this bill to committee 
right away. Hopefully all the members of that committee will 
have meaningful and substantial input into its final wording and 
impact. However, I want to remind the members of this House 
and all Canadians that this process was completed last year and 
the results of the Holtmann report have not been implemented.
<P>
	I can only wish and hope that the government will not waste a 
bunch of time repeating the whole process. The red book 
promised: ``A Liberal government will move quickly and 
decisively in several ways to address these concerns about 
conflict of interest, influence peddling and selling access''.
<P>
	The response we have today from the government is a 
beginning. It seems to me that the measures taken are woefully 
inadequate. We will be watching with interest to see if this 
committee work will result in a report which will actually be 
implemented in legislation, or if it will be like the previous 
efforts, much work for the backbenchers with little or no 
tangible results. We will be watching to see if the new 
committee will expand on the work of the Holtmann report and 
whether the government will implement its recommendations.
<P>
	I note just in passing that among other things the Holtmann 
report has one chapter with six recommendations to remove the 
distinction between tier one and tier two lobbyists. I have not yet 
seen the bill because of the secrecy I was speaking of earlier, but 
I was informed just before I came in that this new bill does not 
even mention distinguishing between tier one and tier two. 
Maybe it is the lobbying of the lobbyist groups themselves that 
prevented this from getting in.
<P>
	The Prime Minister has announced the appointment of an 
ethics counsellor to oversee and enforce the strengthened 
Lobbyists Registration Act. Since we know very little about the 
individual named, it is prudent on our part to wish him well. We 
will be watching his work with great interest.
<P>

<P>
	Finally, I would like to ask a few questions, not to embarrass 
the Prime Minister or the government but to challenge them to 
really deliver what Canadians are expecting.
<P>
	If the Prime Minister says: ``No goal is more important to this 
government than restoring the trust of Canadians'', then why is 
this government spending dollars hand over fist in the Prime 
Minister's riding for a theme park? Why is this government 
conducting polls in private, released only when a minister gives 
approval? Why is this government giving fat advertising 
contracts to old political buddies? Why is this government 
continuing to hedge and waffle on the much demanded overhaul 
of the MPs pension plan? These are items which would produce 
great leaps in the increase in trust by Canadians in their 
government.
<P>
<B>(1040) </B>
<P>
	Would it not be better if we had a government in which the 
members of Parliament were actually empowered to do what 
they were elected to do, to represent their constituents in a 
meaningful, effective way?
<P>
	Would it not be better if all of us who are charged with the 
responsibility of forming government policy would do as I 
always do when approached by a lobbyist? I tell them that my 
constituents, the people who elected me, are my lobby group. I 
take my direction from them.

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Motion No. 1</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-28, in Clause 3, be amended by replacing lines 34 to 46, on page 2 
and lines 1 and 2, on page 3, with the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
``3.(1) The appropriate authority for a province may designate as designated 
educational institutions any institutions of learning in or outside of Canada that offer 
courses at a post-secondary school level, or any class of such institutions.''
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, the first amendment moved by the 
Opposition is meant to improve the bill so that it will become 
slightly more acceptable to Quebecers and to all Canadians, 
particularly to young Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1125) </B>
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, you have already read the motion but I think a 
second reading would be welcome since all the commotion 
following the vote made it hard to hear.
<P>
	It is being proposed that clause 3 of the bill be amended by 
replacing lines 34 to 46, on page 2, and lines 1 and 2, on page 3, 
with the following:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``3.(1) The appropriate authority for a province may designate as designated 
educational institutions any institutions of learning in or outside of Canada 
that offer courses at a post-secondary school level, or any class of such 
institutions.''</BLOCKQUOTE>
	We have moved this amendment because the other 
amendment made by the bill was divided into two sections 
whereas, in our view, it defines the role of the appropriate 
authority for a province.
<P>
	We would have preferred by far the old section in the existing 
act where, for the purposes of the present act, the appropriate 
authority was defined as a person, an organization or any other 
authority designated as such by the Lieutenant Governor in 
Council of the province.
<P>
	Unfortunately, this was defeated in committee. But it is most 
appropriate to highlight the change it has brought. Until the bill 
is enacted, designation of the appropriate authority is made by 
the Lieutenant Governor in Council of the province concerned, 
that is by the province's Minister of Education.
<P>
	What is new here is that the designation would be made by the 
federal minister designated by the Governor in Council. It says 
``the Minister'' because ministerial structures are undergoing so 
many changes that it is preferable not to say which minister. But, 
in this case, it is the Minister of Human Resources 
Development.
<P>
	This means that, ultimately, our federal Minister of Human 
Resources Development will become almost a federal minister 
of education. I wish to remind this House once more-as I did 
during first reading-that, under the Constitution, education is 
an area of exclusive provincial jurisdiction. It is important to 
keep this in mind.
<P>
	What in fact have we just learned? That the appropriate 
authority for the province will be designated by the federal 
minister in order to accomplish two things essentially: first, to 
designate or not to designate post-secondary institutions in or 
outside of Canada and, second, to deliver eligibility certificates 
to students entitled to federal financial assistance.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5404"> 5404 </A></B>
<P>
	In my view, designating institutions and delivering eligibility 
certificates are definitely two educational matters, the 
responsability for which normally belongs to the provinces.
<P>
	It is becoming increasingly clear that there are two nations in 
this country. Some provinces do not mind much that a federal 
minister would be responsible for educational matters. 
However, education is very precious to Quebec as it is at the 
very root of the development of our culture and our identity. We 
are witnessing another attempt by the government to interfere in 
an area of provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
<B>(1130) </B>
<P>
	I would like to remind the House that, during the election 
campaign, the Liberal members and the Prime Minister himself 
said that they would not talk about the Constitution. This was 
reassuring for some maybe, but what is happening in reality?
<P>
	They say they do not want to talk about it, but they are almost 
changing the Constitution through administrative agreements, 
by increasing the role of a federal minister in the field of 
education. As far as the Official Opposition is concerned, we 
would have preferred them to talk about the Constitution and we 
would have hoped that the present government would not go 
against the spirit of the Constitution, at least in the field of 
education.
<P>
	How must we interpret such a strong desire on the part of the 
federal government, on the part of the Minister of Human 
Resources Development, for that minister to be the one who 
designates the appropriate authority from now on? There is a 
connection with the employment and learning strategy that he 
himself announced on April 15, and student loans can now be 
seen to be the fourth element of that strategy.
<P>
	This is the first piece of legislation put forward by the 
government which relates to this employment and learning 
strategy. That is a new term, a play on words: learning is 
essentially education. We believe that behind this aspect of the 
strategy-and this is reflected in the press release-the 
government is barely hiding the fact that it wants to impose on 
the provinces national, meaning Canadian, standards of 
education.
<P>
	From Quebec's standpoint, from the Official Opposition's 
standpoint, that is unacceptable. For us, what is national applies 
to Québec, to the nation of Québec, and the concept of 
``Canadian standards'' flies in the face of the attachment of the 
people of Québec to their culture, to their education. That is why 
the members of the Committee, with the help of other members, 
fought relentlessly against this will to centralize.
<P>
	But, since there are only a few hours left, we have to recognize 
that we failed to make the government back down. I would like 
to point out other centralizing initiatives. There is the one that I 
have just talked about, but there is another one. The federal 
government not  only interferes with provincial jurisdictions, it 
gives itself increased discretionary authority, an authority 
which is almost without precedent in that a minister will be able 
to intervene, to manage by regulation. And that is quite 
important because we see what role he has in mind for the 
appropriate authority.
<P>
	The second amendment is also about this, but the appropriate 
authority will play a key role and it will be completely 
controlled by the minister himself without any right of appeal. 
At least, the bill makes no mention of a right of appeal. Maybe 
the regulations will, but when one makes a law, one must foresee 
all the possibilities, even changes of minister, even changes of 
government.
<P>
	In a democratic society, a law must be as clear and precise as 
possible, especially in areas like education, which lends itself to 
conflicting interpretations, to hesitations, to pulling and 
tugging, all of which is detrimental to both levels of 
government.
<P>
<B>(1135) </B>
<P>
	I think that Quebecers and Canadians-when the Prime 
Minister was saying that he did not want to hear any talk about 
the Constitution, that was not quite it-want to avoid 
duplication, having two governments that want to do the same 
thing in the same fields, when there is so much to be done in 
terms of jobs and economic development.
<P>
	We see a government that wants to reduce its funding in the 
fields of health care, social services, education and 
postsecondary education. Yet, while it is reducing its financial 
contribution, it is increasing its desire to control, its desire to 
run everything from Ottawa, in a field that Quebec jealously 
guards: education.
<P>
	Education is a major portfolio, it is important in defining an 
employment strategy, it is important for the future of young 
people and for the entire community.

<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Human Resources Development. I should make it 
clear that the debate is to complete Motion No. 1. Then we will 
go to Motion No. 2.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Human Resources Development):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened with a great deal of interest to the hon. member from the 
Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
	I heard many of the arguments and points which he raised 
during his intervention at the committee. I must say that the 
comments at times steered away from the content of the 
amendment which he was making. He spent a great deal of time 
talking about the constitutional impact of the changes to the 
Canada student loans. It is unfortunate that the members of the 
Bloc Quebecois cannot appreciate the fantastic results we have 
received in co-operating with the province of Quebec for over 
30 years in providing important financial aid to students.
<P>
	Regardless of where they come from, whether it is the 
province of Quebec, Ontario or British Columbia, they  have 
definitely been given access to much needed funding so that 
they may complete their education and give great strength to our 
country.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5405"> 5405 </A></B>
<P>
	I suggest to the hon. member that the best indication as to how 
the provincial governments feel about this legislation can be 
found in statements that have been made by various ministers or 
their representatives in the last few days, not in hypothetical 
statements made by the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
	First, let me say that Mr. Chagnon, minister of education for 
Quebec, on June 9 answered the following to a question by the 
Parti Quebecois on whether Bill C-28 will force national 
standards in education on the provincial government of Quebec: 
``La réponse est non''.
<P>
	I think that is fundamental to the debate. I do not wish to 
engage in a merely political discussion when there are thousands 
of students waiting for this government and this House to act on 
this very important piece of legislation.
<P>
	I want to go specifically to the point raised in the hon. 
member's amendment. This amendment does not make much 
sense. It would leave the program without an appropriate 
authority at the provincial level for purposes of assessing and 
according aid to students and designating eligible institutions. 
That is quite clear from the hon. member's amendment.
<P>
	It is my belief that students need some assurances that they 
will be able to gain access to the aid that is available under this 
legislation.
<P>
<B>(1140 ) </B>
<P>
	I remind hon. members of the Bloc that provinces have played 
a critical role in the administration of federal students' 
assistance program. We expect the provinces to continue to act 
as the appropriate authority for the purposes of assessing 
students needs, according aid and designating eligible 
institutions.
<P>
	At the same time, both levels of government are actively 
exploring ways to improve services to students and streamline 
the administration of student assistance programs. A number of 
provinces even during committee here signalled their interest in 
harmonizing both the administration and financing of student 
aid. Such initiatives are extremely important. They will reduce 
overlap and ensure greater value for our funding.
<P>
	In this regard several provinces have indicated an interest in 
looking at different machinery for delivery of provincial and 
possibly federal aid. This could entail assigning the 
administration of the program to a third party other than a 
provincial student aid office. As well there is interest in 
streamlining the process of designating foreign institutions for 
purposes of the federal program. Currently over 4,500 
international institutions are designated.
<P>
	This is very labour intensive and maintaining up to date 
information is extremely costly. One approach would be to 
establish a broadly representative entity with the necessary 
expertise that could undertake this task in respect of student aid 
programs generally. For example, a mechanism such as the 
Canadian Information Centre for International Credentials 
which is jointly funded by the CMEC and the federal 
government could serve the interests of both levels of 
government in this regard.
<P>
	The centre brings together representatives of provinces, the 
AUCC and the ACC and it might be appropriate to expand its 
role in this regard.
<P>
	For these reasons we have provided the necessary flexibility 
to allow for different types of machinery at the provincial and 
federal levels. Of course, we intend to continue to work in close 
collaboration with the provinces. The Canada student loans 
program is an example, a model example, of how the federal 
government can work together with the provincial governments 
and deliver a very important service to Canadians.
<P>
	This view is widely shared by the provinces. I was very 
pleased to hear senior provincial representatives who appeared 
before the committee speak positively about the program and 
speak positively about the partnership that this program has 
allowed our federal government and the provincial governments 
to participate in. This type of collaboration is an example to all 
federal-provincial governments as to how federal and 
provincial governments can in fact work together.
<P>
	Everyone we spoke to basically said to go ahead and push this 
legislation through. It has many positive features. It is necessary 
for those students who are waiting for our help. This legislation 
also takes extremely positive measures, whether you are looking 
at deferred grants, the help it gives to part time students, women 
pursuing doctoral studies, or high need students. Not only is it 
good legislation, it is progressive legislation. It brings in middle 
class families that have in the past been shut out of the Canada 
student loans. They may have over $2,000 available.
<P>
<B>(1145) </B>
<P>
	A person benefiting from a deferred grant with a debt load at 
the end of a four-year BA of $22,500 now will have the debt load 
reduced by $6,000. That speaks to the type of legislation this is. 
It speaks to the progressive nature of this legislation.
<P>
	For all these reasons this motion obviously should be 
defeated.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
speak against the motion.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5406"> 5406 </A></B>
<P>
	My remarks will be quite brief. The hon. parliamentary 
secretary has said quite a bit about some of the reasons why this 
motion should be defeated.
<P>
	I was very conscious of ensuring that the rights of the 
provinces were looked after when this legislation came into the 
House. I looked quite closely at this clause to ensure that the 
rights of the provinces were not being infringed upon. I 
reviewed the transcripts from when provincial officials were 
before the committee to see what they had to say about this 
clause and about the possibility of any infringements. I placed 
phone calls to provincial officials to ask them if they were 
concerned about this. In every case they said they were not.
<P>
	I believe they used their provincial jurisdiction and delegated 
their authority to the federal minister in this case because they 
were confident they could have that authority back at any time. 
They do have the protection of the Constitution in this matter.
<P>
	There are many problems with this bill and there are some 
good things about it, to be fair, as well. I do not believe that this 
clause that the Bloc Quebecois is concerned about is one of the 
problems. There are many other things that we can be greatly 
concerned about, but this is not one that we need to worry about.
<P>
	I will conclude my remarks by saying that we will be speaking 
later on about some of the problems with this bill. At the end of 
the day, however, you will find we support this bill, but at this 
moment we will be speaking against and voting against the 
motion put forward by the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier):</B> Mr Speaker, I would like 
to say as an introduction to this bill-although it includes an 
opting-out provision that we shall discuss later in a third 
amendment and that has become extremely finicky and departs 
from what has been the spirit of this type of legislation since 
1964-that as Official Opposition we worked very hard to keep 
one thing in this bill. Some people might say it is not the most 
important thing, or our business, but we wanted to do our job as 
Official Opposition. We wanted to stress the historic change of 
replacing appointment of the appropriate authority by the 
provinces with direct appointment by the federal minister, with 
no compulsory consultation of the provinces.
<P>
	This bill was introduced late, and as a result the legislative 
process has been speeded up.
<P>
<B>(1150) </B>
<P>
	Although the hon. colleague who spoke before me said that he 
had consulted-and we know he carried out consultations; so 
did we-it is not all that clear that the provinces know their 
rights, for the plain and simple reason that in this bill they have 
only one right left, one single right, and that is the right to opt 
out.
<P>
	Aside from opting out, any initiative or power in this matter, 
which is extremely important to education, belongs to the 
federal minister, and we shall see in the second amendment that 
the minister has even been given an amount of latitude that is 
rare, not to say unheard of, in a piece of legislation.
<P>
	Why, in order to establish the co-operation between the 
provinces and the federal government mentioned by the 
parliamentary secretary, must the federal minister take the place 
of or decide in this bill to take the place of the provinces? Some 
people in Canada may think-and we saw this in 
committee-that education must become an area of shared 
jurisdiction. Of course, everyone made an exception for Quebec, 
which would always oppose that notion with all its might. And it 
is understandable that, in light of economic imperatives and the 
importance of education to a country, some people might think 
that way.
<P>
	But let us debate this issue for what it is. It does not concern 
only the provincial minister of education who is left dangling; I 
think it concerns Canadians, because -and maybe this is 
becoming the case-unless the provinces of Canada are just 
administrative authorities with no real power of initiative, 
education, their field, has to be of concern to them.
<P>
	Why do we find it so dramatic that the appropriate authority 
will now be appointed by the federal minister and not by the 
province? Because, elsewhere, this bill addresses only relations 
between the minister and the banks, in broad terms; but 
students-and I shall come back to this point later-despite the 
good intentions listed by the minister, nowhere does the bill 
mention any obligations to students. Nowhere! And if we look at 
the budgets, there again, nowhere is there any mention of 
students: between last year's budget and this year's budget, after 
all the terrific promises that were made to us, how much of an 
increase is there? A million dollars for the whole of Canada! 
Congratulations! What openness!
<P>
	Where is the extra money, the stuff that promises are made of, 
going to come from? Where? The banks are supposed to go and 
get that manna from graduates, that is where; there is no money 
anywhere else. At none of the hearings did I hear that there was 
any money anywhere else; there certainly is none in the budgets.
<P>
	So I come back to my question: why is it so dramatic that the 
appropriate authority will now be appointed by the federal 
minister instead of the provinces? Because the appropriate 
authority has essentially two powers; including that of 
designating institutions, as my colleague said earlier. What does 
a designated institution mean for ordinary people? It simply 
means that Queen's University cannot accept students who 
qualify for scholarships unless it is designated by the 
appropriate authority.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5407"> 5407 </A></B>
<P>
	So we can see the decisive importance of designation. We 
could say, ``But does not that go without saying? Come on, what 
university could lose its designation?'' Well, Mr Speaker, let me 
tell you that the Association of Universities, which may have the 
right to an opinion here, is extremely worried by the very next 
provision, which provides not only that the minister may 
appoint the appropriate authority to designate, but also that that 
appropriate authority, reporting directly to the federal minister, 
is empowered to revoke designation.
<P>
	Now, the universities told us that they have been threatened 
for a long time that if they do not participate and do not know 
how well students actually pay back loans, if their rate of 
defaulting on loans is too high, they could lose their designation.
<P>
<B>(1155) </B>
<P>
	And what could the province do in that case? Nothing. It is the 
federal minister-as if that person did not have enough to do 
with that immense department that accounts for nearly half of 
federal government expenditures-it is the federal minister 
who, in the end, will consider the case.
<P>
	There is another worrisome aspect to the bill. If I were 
speaking on behalf of another Canadian province, it seems to me 
that I would be saying exactly the same thing. Where 
designation is concerned, is it to ensure effective co-operation 
among the various provinces, which are responsible for 
education, and I shall speak-How much time do I have left? 
Three minutes?
<P>
	Why is it assumed that the provinces cannot co-operate 
except under the appropriate authority? They will no longer be 
equal; they will be subjected to the authority of the minister. 
People may say, ``Oh, but there is no bad faith on the part of the 
minister; the minister is going to consult''. Sure. I can already 
hear my hon. colleague telling me that, with characteristic flair. 
But you do not draft legislation for the incumbent minister. You 
draft legislation for as long as it lasts. There have been two acts 
since 1964, so you can guess that this one, too, will last for some 
time.
<P>
	The provinces have only one right left, one single right, and 
that is the right to opt out.
<P>
	I want to return to the appropriate authority. That authority 
can designate and revoke designation, but it also has an 
extremely important power, the power to determine which 
students will qualify for loans. That, too, is important.
<P>
	Which students will qualify for loans? According to which 
criteria? We read:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>12.(1)(<I>a</I>) to have attained a satisfactory scholastic standard;</BLOCKQUOTE>
If the student has ``attained a satisfactory scholastic standard'' 
and, obviously, if the student needs the money. Whether the 
student has attained a satisfactory scholastic standard is clearly 
an institutional matter; but, what is more important, the use of 
this provision can have a decisive influence on all degree 
courses at every institution and every university.
<P>
	I must say that there has not been much of an uprising in 
Canada in the face of that provision, although Canada is a big 
place for an uprising. People have not read it carefully; they 
have not looked at it carefully; they trust the minister. That 
provision is eminently dangerous.
<P>
	To the fact that the minister has been given latitude to appoint 
the appropriate authority-and of course we would have liked to 
retain the former wording, the wording of the present act, 
which-not this new wording- until it is amended, is still the 
current act and the one we shall defend-I add the fact that the 
minister can also appoint a bank, a financial institution. In 
committee, it was very clear that a financial institution could 
decide whether the student has attained a satisfactory scholastic 
standard.
<P>
	People may say, ``No, no, that is not the ministers intention''. 
But there is nothing in the bill to prevent that from happening.
<P>
	We could not ignore this extremely important provision. It is 
easy centralization because it is about student loans; however, it 
indicates a worrisome trend, not just for Quebec, which I hope 
will settle that problem once and for all, but for the provinces in 
general.
<P>
	I suspect that, even without Quebec, Canada will be talking 
about the Constitution again.

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5408"> 5408 </A></B>
<P>
He said: Mr. Speaker, after having worked on this bill in 
committee for several days, we have finally reached the report 
stage at which time we can propose improvements in the hope of 
convincing the House that such improvements would give us a 
clearer piece of legislation which could survive many years 
without being called into question.
<P>
	Similar in spirit to the previous amendment, this amendment 
would ensure that the minister, who in clause 3 may designate 
for a province an appropriate authority, will not have the power 
to muzzle the appropriate authority. Perhaps as a result of the 
previous vote this will no longer be the case, but the basis for 
this amendment being moved is that this provision of the bill 
will not be amended. The portion of the clause that would be 
deleted reads as follows: ``The Minister may give directives to 
any appropriate authority respecting the exercise or 
performance of any of its powers, duties or functions under this 
Act or the regulations, and such directives are binding on the 
appropriate authority''.
<P>
	Since the legislation must provide for all possible situations 
that could arise, it is possible that in a given situation, the 
directive given by the minister would be unacceptable for some 
legal reason to the appropriate authority. The fact that the 
proposed legislation gives the minister the right to compel the 
appropriate authority to comply with his directive is tantamount 
to saying that the appropriate authority is not needed because he 
would have to implement any decision taken by the minister.
<P>
	The clause in question states that the minister designates and 
gives directives to the appropriate authority and that these are 
binding on him. In our view, deleting lines 18 to 26, as proposed 
in the amendment motion, would remove the sword of Damocles 
that is being waved over the heads of the designated appropriate 
authorities and would give them a minimum degree of 
flexibility to be effective. Clearly, this piece of legislation, as 
was the case with the previous student loans legislation, applies 
more to the other provinces than to Quebec which is the only 
province to have opted out, or the Northwest Territories. Our 
duty as legislators is to ensure that the legislation is the best it 
can be.
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	While Quebec will certainly continue to exercise the right to 
opt out-because in Quebec, we have developed an entirely 
different system, we have a completely different approach to 
student loans-and continue to do its own thing, legislation is 
needed and, in the provinces which will be governed by it, this 
legislation must be administered correctly, honestly and 
effectively.
<P>
	In committee, serious work was done and a number of 
amendments were proposed, some of which were adopted, thus 
improving the legislation.
<P>
	I think it is important to note also that in that respect, we end 
up in a rather symbolic situation at the same time. The hon. 
member inquired earlier as to where the money came from. 
Ultimately, grants and bursaries in Quebec are financed by the 
program, through exchanges between governments. But in fact, 
it has never been denied that Quebecers' tax money ought to 
come back to them in the form of grants and bursaries, under a 
program managed by the province, as this has become the 
practice, and Quebec has demonstrated that it has the expertise 
required to grant loans to its students.
<P>
	In this case, as far as the designation of the appropriate 
authorities is concerned, we believe that in the spirit of the 
Constitution and its provisions on jurisdiction, the bill could 
have provided that the provinces have the authority to appoint 
them and to delegate this authority to the federal government if 
they so please, which could have been the case in nine provinces 
out of ten. A wording along these lines would have avoided 
infringing upon provincial jurisdiction, which we end up doing 
with this bill with I must say some contempt for the authority of 
the provinces. That is what motivated the amendment I have 
moved.
<P>
	Seeing that infringement is to be expected, as legislators, we 
want to make sure that these authorities will retain a minimum 
of leeway as we move from the old provisions under which the 
government of each province designated the appropriate 
authorities to new ones whereby the federal minister will 
designate the appropriate authorities for each of the provinces. 
If we cannot persuade the government to change that, let us at 
least make sure that, as far as the performance of their duties is 
concerned, these authorities retain some leeway, because the 
minister might decide for example to sign agreements with 
banking institutions which could affect the student loan and 
bursary system, and the authority representing a province may 
feel this decision was not the most appropriate.
<P>
	I can give you a specific example: francophone and Acadian 
students in all provinces of Canada except Quebec asked that 
caisses populaires be formally identified as banking institutions 
that could be accredited for loans and bursaries by the 
government. In a situation like that, one province, for example, 
could realize that the minister would sign an agreement with 
only one bank for all of Canada; then the authority in the 
province might say: ``That is not how we want it to apply here 
and we have some suggestions for you, Minister''.
<P>
	Theoretically, as it is now written, the minister can impose it 
and the appropriate authority cannot even challenge the 
decision. This means that even if a provincial government held 
hearings on loans and bursaries because it considered opting 
out, for example, those designated as appropriate authorities 
could receive a notice from the minister that they are not 
allowed to testify at the hearings.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5409"> 5409 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1210) </B>
<P>
	In the bill as it now reads the minister has indeed too much 
authority in his spheres of activity, and even more so when past 
experience is considered, especially in Quebec, which has opted 
out.
<P>
	We also considered-because we must always look at the laws 
regardless of the individuals who apply them and a long-term 
view-we want to ensure that we will not have a recurrence of 
what has happened in many other fields, a sort of competition 
between governments. For example, if the program of a 
province that wants to opt out is not what the federal minister 
wants, he might try to override the province, and his power over 
the appropriate authority would be one way he could control the 
situation, perhaps to the detriment of the provinces concerned.
<P>
	That is why we consider it important to support this 
amendment.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Human Resources Development):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am somewhat perplexed by the comments of the opposition, 
particularly as they relate to federal-provincial relations.
<P>
	My recollection leads me to believe that the provinces are 
quite happy with the program. They look forward to 
participating as they have for almost 30 years. If I may quote the 
minister from Quebec on May 10, he said:
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	``It says in this bill that the option taken by Quebec in 1964 to 
create its own student financial assistance network, that is, a 
loan and bursary system in place since 1966, will be protected''.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is very clear there is a great deal of support from the 
province of Quebec to continue with the type of effective 
partnership that has existed with the federal government.
<P>
	Since I need to bring evidence to the floor of the House of 
Commons, I should like to quote the minister of education for 
the province of Nova Scotia, John MacEachern, who wrote to 
the Minister of Human Resources Development on May 4: ``I 
believe that the development and implementation of the youth 
employment and learning strategy, which includes the reform to 
student loans, will assist our young people in their success in 
today's labour market. Thank you for the opportunity to share 
my views on the initiatives under this strategy''. That is a very 
strong endorsement from the province of Nova Scotia.
<P>
	Lastly I refer to the representation made by representatives of 
the New Brunswick and Alberta governments who kindly 
answered the invitation to all provinces to appear before the 
standing committee on HRD. Mr. Smith from New Brunswick 
responded to a  question by the member for Mercier on whether 
the bill was an intrusion into provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	``Really, because all New Brunswickers expect the other 
governments to agree on how to serve this student while keeping 
additional costs to a minimum''.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	He added that the federal-provincial agreements provided for 
in the bill, as well as the enhanced administrative and technical 
co-operation, would lead to a further guarantee of continued 
federal-provincial co-operation with respect to designation of 
authority.
<P>
<B>(1215 ) </B>
<P>
	This is what Mr. Hemmingway from Alberta commented. I 
think one of the problems we have today in relation to the 
federal loan program is discrepancies between and among 
provinces with respect to which institutions may be designated. 
I know that the federal concern has been that given it is a 
national program, benefits should be reasonably equal across 
the country. We are presuming and it is our understanding that 
we will have a great deal of input in developing the designation 
criteria that will be put in place and that those criteria would be 
negotiated on an ongoing basis between the two levels of 
government.
<P>
	To me what this legislation clearly indicates is that if there is 
one single group of people against this legislation it is the 
members of the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
	I want now to return to the specific issue, the specific motion. 
We as a government are committed to providing consistency and 
fairness under our student assistance program. The amendment 
presented would repeal subsections 42 and 43 of the bill which 
provide the minister with the flexibility to establish policy 
directives.
<P>
	I think if we are to look at this in a very clear and rational way 
there is nothing wrong with the federal minister's having 
something to say about a federal initiative, a federal policy. 
There is absolutely nothing wrong. It is within his right. It is his 
duty and obligation to make sure he has something to say about 
the policy initiatives, the policy direction under this particular 
act.
<P>
	I fail to understand, and I have spent a great deal of time 
trying to figure it out, exactly what the opposition is saying and 
trying to follow a logic of the opposition. Perhaps the problem is 
not one of logic. Perhaps the problem here goes above and 
beyond that. It is a question of vision.
<P>
	For the moment I am not going to engage myself in a 
constitutional discussion. The reason I am debating today is that 
there are hundreds of thousands of students who are awaiting 
this program, provinces awaiting this program, part time 
students, students with disabilities, women who want to pursue 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5410"> 5410 </A></B>
<P>
doctoral studies, students who have been victimized by a heavy 
debt load. This is the issue we are debating today.
<P>
	It is for this reason that I simply cannot support the 
amendment as proposed by the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
	The government must be in a position to ensure that the 
policies which are developed are applied consistently across the 
country. It would appear that the opposition is not overly 
concerned about treating students fairly throughout Canada 
because of its own political agenda.
<P>
<B>(1220 ) </B>
<P>
	On behalf of the thousands of students who are awaiting this 
program, the thousands of students in need who want to acquire 
the skills to be competitive, to acquire the life skills necessary to 
meet the challenges of the new economy, to acquire the 
education that is part and parcel of life today, as we live through 
a learning continuum, as we engage in life long learning, it is 
fundamental that we support these students. It is for that reason 
that I will not be supporting the motion presented by the Bloc 
Quebecois.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
oppose this motion of the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
	It seems to me that the provinces have spoken with one voice 
on this issue. They had a chance to speak up on Bill C-28. They 
came before the Standing Committee on Human Resources 
Development to talk about this piece of legislation. In every 
case they suggested they will go along with this legislation and 
that they are in support of it.
<P>
	We cannot start giving carte blanche to provinces including 
Quebec simply because the members down the way demand it. 
We must be respectful of what the provinces are saying. Quebec 
has indicated it is quite comfortable with this piece of 
legislation. The people in Alberta are happy with it, the people 
in the maritimes are happy with it.
<P>
	I do not really understand the paranoia down the way. I can 
only assume that there are other reasons for this motion coming 
up than the ones stated.
<P>
	Having said that, we cannot support this motion. We will be 
saying more down the road about some of the problems inherent 
in Bill C-28.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am surprised by 
the Reform Party's reaction. They did not argue very long 
against this amendment, that I will read since it is important to 
understand the situation.
<P>
	I will not read the amendment as such but what we wanted to 
delete:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Minister may give directives to any appropriate authority respecting the 
exercise or performance of any of its powers, duties or functions under this Act or 
the regulations, and such directives are binding on the appropriate authority.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is a good example of the co-operative federalism the 
parliamentary secretary referred to earlier. A partnership where 
everything seems to happen in harmony and in a climate of good 
understanding. If that were true, the minister would not have to 
include such provisions in this bill.
<P>
	Let us try to figure out the minister's intentions. First 
possibility, when they say they want to add that ``such directives 
are binding on the appropriate authority'', does it mean that, in 
the past, appropriate authorities in the provinces did not follow 
directives or that the student financial assistance system did not 
work well? I am not talking about Quebec but about the other 
provinces, because Quebec had exercised the right to opt out, 
which it wants to preserve.
<P>
	The fact that they felt the need to include ``such directives are 
binding on the appropriate authority'' in the bill, being very 
strict and everything when it should go without saying, suggests 
that there are many problems.
<P>
	I see my colleague from Louis-Hébert, a former teacher, and I 
give him an example. It is like saying to a young person that 
under school regulations, smoking is strictly prohibited. And 
then adding: ``Thinking of smoking is strictly prohibited''.
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>
<P>
	They enact regulations upon regulations, which are binding 
on the authority. When have we ever seen that in a bill? I have 
read a number of them, more in Quebec than here, but it is very 
rare. I think it should go without saying. It shows an incredibly 
authoritarian mentality. The parliamentary secretary talks about 
partnership and co-operation. I will remind him of certain facts.
<P>
	Regarding this year's reform of social programs, the minister 
has postponed his action plan two or three times because the 
provincial ministers did not agree with him on the agenda. What 
a good example of co-operation! They cannot even agree on 
what to include in the agenda because the provinces are so 
suspicious.
<P>
	Another example of co-operation is a National Assembly 
resolution on job training, which was passed unanimously on 
April 15, I think, telling the federal government not to meddle in 
education and training matters in Quebec. Even Premier 
Johnson, a stauncher federalist than his predecessor, voted for 
this resolution. What a good example of co-operation! 
Everything is going awfully well with people working in 
harmony. Only Bloc members see problems.
<P>
	I just said that it is not only the Bloc members but also all 
members of Quebec's National Assembly, including those in the 
Liberal Party, the sister party of the federal Liberals. There 
should be harmony, yet motions are adopted unanimously in the 
National Assembly. There should be another solution, as having 
such an item on the  agenda speaks of a lack of confidence. The 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5411"> 5411 </A></B>
<P>
past is often a harbinger of the future. Things happen, but why? 
Always because of the centralizing will of the federal 
government in an area in which it has no jurisdiction under the 
Constitution.
<P>
	Government members are surprised at the Bloc members' 
reaction.  Bloc members complained to the standing committee 
studying the bill. We insisted on seeing the regulations because 
the legislation was vague in many respects, and, without a right 
of appeal, the Minister has a lot of power. We were finally given 
an overview. I would like to underline here that regulations can 
stipulate that appropriate authorities may sign entitlement 
certificates, designate educational institutions, sign entitlement 
certificates regarding registration confirmations, and so on. It 
goes a long way.
<P>
	Confirmation that a student has registered at a university or 
college is not a national objective. We are now dealing with 
registration. The borrower signs the entitlement certificate 
concerning the loan application, the contract-All we got to see 
was an overview, not even the real regulations.
<P>
	Other than being excessively centralizing, this bill reflects a 
will to encroach on provincial jurisdiction. There is a double 
centralization, but this time from the Minister of Human 
Resources Development, who wants to control and manage 
things, through appropriate authorities who are being told in 
advance that they have to agree to everything the minister says. 
This is co-operation! How modern can you get? This is unheard 
of.
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
	This is a power over which the House of Commons and its 
members would have no control, since it would be delegated to 
the federal Minister of Human Resources Development. We are 
concerned by that and this is why we are trying so hard, while 
there is still time, to convince the members opposite to change 
their mind on this issue.
<P>
	We want to convince them before it is too late. The minister 
gave examples of co-operation and he read a statement from the 
education minister in Nova Scotia. For those who are not aware 
of that, three provinces previously benefitted from a trial 
agreement which served as a basis for this bill. The 
parliamentary secretary mentioned Nova Scotia.
<P>
	Yet, based on testimony heard by the Human Rights 
Development Committee, and I attended every single meeting 
and consultation of that committee, it appears that Nova Scotia 
is the worst possible example one could provide, according to 
the students, because there is a lot of concern in Nova Scotia at 
present.
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary also mentioned Alberta. I do not 
have the newspaper article with me but, yesterday, it was 
mentioned that many students are worried there as well. 
Students are concerned about the reduced financial assistance 
provided by the provinces. They are also concerned about the 
financing of post-secondary  education. And they are concerned 
about something else too. It is all very well to raise the loan 
ceiling and bring in scholarships. Indeed, there are some good 
provisions in this bill, including for part-time students, for 
single mothers and for others as well, but what we oppose is the 
government's will to centralize. We object to this show of 
authority.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier):</B> Mr. Speaker, this bill 
which does not surprise my colleague on this side of the House 
and which was praised by the member opposite, to whom I will 
answer a bit later, contains some gems that we can smile at, once 
we get over our anger, which we can never do completely. It 
includes a very rare provision. When asked, before the 
committee, if such a provision was usually found in bills, the 
legal counsel answered that he did not remember ever seeing one 
like that, which was, in any case, very rare.
<P>
	The minister now has the power to designate. He refused to let 
the provinces continue to exercise their power enshrined in the 
Constitution and reaffirmed in federal acts since 1964. The 
minister changes the whole process, but there is more. He is 
afraid that the appropriate authorities may be influenced by the 
provinces. So, he expects strict obedience from the appropriate 
authorities, as we can see in one provision which says: ``The 
Minister may give directives to any appropriate authority 
respecting the exercise or performance of any of its powers, 
duties or functions under this Act or the regulations, and such 
directives are binding on the appropriate authority''.
<P>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
	There is a third issue here which is also very important: the 
Statutory Instruments Act does not apply in respect of directives 
given under subsection (2). Hence, these directives will not be 
published in the <I>Gazette</I>.
<P>
	So, this provision shows you the spirit in which the bill was 
drafted. The minister is going from one extreme to the other in 
his relations with the provinces. We have here a situation where 
the province, under a federal act, is recognized as the 
appropriate authority since it has jurisdiction over education. 
Not only is the minister saying: ``From now on, I am the one who 
decides'', but he also intends to follow through. He says: ``Not 
only will I be designating the appropriate authority, but it better 
not let itself be influenced by a third party, because my 
directives prevail''. After all, his directives are binding.
<P>
	You can see, Mr. Speaker, how the appropriate authority will 
be free, under these circumstances, to exercise its power, as long 
as it follows the minister's directives. There is something funny 
in this bill. In every other piece of legislation, the appropriate 
authority is defined. In this one, the legislator must have 
forgotten to do so, because he says the directives are binding on 
the appropriate authority. In other words, the appropriate au-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5412"> 5412 </A></B>
<P>
thority has now become merely an authority which is  never 
mentioned in the bill, except under appropriate authority.
<P>
	Thus, the fact that this appropriate authority has now become 
merely an authority speaks volumes about how they see the 
relationship with the provinces and one must have a great sense 
of humour or be generous enough to say, as does the hon. 
secretary, that this bill will ``enhance co-operation''. The 
provinces are left with a single right, that is the right to opt out. 
Otherwise, not only is the appropriate authority designated by 
the Minister, but the Minister's directives are binding on the 
appropriate authority which has now become merely an 
authority.
<P>
	These directives apply to all the powers provided in there. 
There are well-known powers, but there is also a power to make 
regulations that I have not seen elsewhere-but I am not 
familiar with all the statutes. Also, to improve the act, they even 
had in some cases-and it is somehow contradictory, but this 
was the only way to proceed-they even had to try to increase 
this power to make regulations, since neither the provinces nor 
the students have any rights and the minister has no obligations, 
only some powers and an authority. This sums up rather well 
what this bill is all about.
<P>
	Thus, when the parliamentary secretary says that hundreds of 
thousands of students are anxious to know the results of our 
work, he has got an absolute nerve! And there are several 
reasons for this. First, there is already a system in place. An act 
already exists. Second, they introduced this bill only two weeks 
ago although they have had it for some time now! Third, despite 
the minister's generous intentions, there is in the estimates, as I 
said, only $1 million more for all Canadian students this year. 
Wonderful!
<P>
	So, how is the minister going to keep his promises? He is 
relying on the banks to make students pay back their loans-and 
we know that, depending on where they live, the new graduates 
have difficulty finding a job and are deeply in debt-so the 
minister is relying on this money to honour his generous 
commitments.
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	So, when the hon. member down the way talks about paranoia, 
I remind him that the opposition has a role to play. When the 
opposition sees what is in the legislation, notwithstanding-not 
the clause-the intentions of the present minister, the 
opposition can only object vigorously to those provisions which 
do not enhance co-operation with the provinces but enable the 
minister to make decisions without consulting them.
<P>
	The minister will consult and listen only if he wishes to. A 
future minister of education could use those provisions to decide 
who should have a loan and who should not. If one area of 
responsibility in a democracy is important for a province, which 
is responsible for education under the Constitution, it is the 
issue of who has access to education. We will come back to that 
aspect  because, in the opting-out provision, the minister paid a 
lot of attention to the conditions for repayment to the banks and 
to the repayment arrangements for the students, but did not care 
much about accessibility.
<P>
	We hear a lot about increased access for single mothers or for 
the handicapped but the truth is that the real objective is to try to 
negotiate a better deal with the banks; I have nothing against 
that, but stop taking liberties with the truth.
<P>
	As the Official Opposition, we have the responsibility and the 
duty to denounce nonsensical actions and measures that do not 
promote co-operation with the provinces. Even though some of 
the people consulted said that they had nothing against the 
measures, nothing guarantees that those provisions will not give 
another minister-supposing that another government is in 
office-excessive power that would allow him to avoid 
co-operating with the provinces.

<BLOCKQUOTE>Motion No. 3</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-28, in Clause 14, be amended by deleting lines 27 to 41, on page 
12.</BLOCKQUOTE>
She said: Mr. Speaker, proceedings in the House do not always 
reflect exactly what goes on in committee. I have said that, as 
the Official Opposition, we have tried to do our job the best way 
we could, to a point where, at the committee stage, we even 
moved amendments with which we were not comfortable. For 
example, we proposed that the minister be at least required to 
consult the provinces before designating the appropriate 
authorities.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5413"> 5413 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	You can certainly understand that it was difficult for us to do 
that, but we thought that we had to move such an amendment in 
order to force the minister to hold consultations. Of course, our 
amendment was defeated.
<P>
	Now, Mr. Speaker, I want to talk about the clause that 
concerns Quebec the most. The committee sat for many hours, 
but that subject came up only during the last half hour. The 
clause that we want to delete affects the right of the provinces 
and territories to opt out. I have to tell everybody who is 
listening to us today that the right to opt out has been part of this 
legislation since it was first adopted in 1964, but there was no 
condition attached to it.
<P>
	The province that chose to opt out received its share of what 
was spent elsewhere, depending on its population and the 
amount of money spent. They were saying: ``There are two 
situations: either you take part in the national program or you 
opt out and, in that case, inasmuch as you have a provincial 
program, we will redistribute to you the equivalent of what has 
been distributed to other provinces''.
<P>
	We have to realize that in the context of the old struggles 
under Duplessis and later of the first arrangements under 
Pearson, before centralizing federalists took over the Liberal 
Party and formed the Liberal government, the right to opt out 
was not subject to any conditions. The first program, enacted in 
1964, has been changed. The current act too, under which we 
have been operating since 1984, provides a right to opt out, this 
time subject to two conditions I would describe as light and 
formulated as objectives to be achieved.
<P>
	The concern was that the provincial program should have 
provisions that had essentially the same effects as far as 
part-time students and exemptions from interest payments were 
concerned. Those then were provisions related to accessibility. 
They did not jeopardize the whole program, the whole approach 
of the program. There was a recognition that a province opting 
out from the program had its own approaches, its own 
objectives, its own criteria and its own administration, but on 
the other hand they were saying: ``Make sure that part-time 
students enjoy the same rights and that in some cases there can 
be exemptions from interest payments''.
<P>
	But this new measure is quite another story. This bill turns the 
conditions into bothersome requirements affecting program 
administration with seemingly very little concern for 
objectives. Besides, it is not that we would want the program to 
be different, because Quebec did not wait for the central 
government to show the way to set up a loan and grant program.
<P>
	Quebec did not wait for the central government of Canada to 
invest more in education, even more than the wealthiest 
province. I want to come back to those figures.
<P>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
	It is important to know that university funding has been 
largely provided-when I say largely, it should be pointed out 
that provincial efforts vary, and I shall refer to Quebec's 
effort-by the federal government; this is money from the 
provinces redistributed on the basis of demographic criteria. 
From 1977 to 1985-86, according to the most recent study I was 
able to find, which was published in 1992, that effort declined 
considerably.
<P>
	General financing for the entire education system is not 
provided through student loans but through a program of 
transfer payments covering both health and education. The 
provinces have all chosen to give preference to health over 
education, resulting in a considerable proportionate decline in 
funds devoted to education. As to the provincial contribution 
offsetting the lower level of federal spending, Quebec has made 
a remarkable effort. From 1977 to 1986, Quebec invested 2.3 
percent of its gross domestic product in education. This has 
since declined to 2.1 per cent, which means that 0.2 per cent 
went over to health. We do not have the time to go deeper into 
this.
<P>
	By comparison Ontario-which is far richer than Quebec in 
terms of individual and overall wealth, for well-known 
historical reasons-invested 1.4 per cent of its GDP in 1977, and 
only 1.1 per cent in 1986-87. This means that Quebec, a poorer 
province, spent twice as much of its GDP on education. 
Concerning student loans, the figures submitted by the 
department indicate that Quebec contributed the same amount in 
1992-93, even though the number of students was 
proportionately lower because Quebec has only 70 per cent of 
Ontario's population.
<P>
	Under these conditions, it is a shameful, indecent and 
unacceptable situation when one is told in a federal bill that 
Quebec has to respect eight points, that it has to report-and that 
is why I will be sending additional documentation to the Quebec 
minister of education-and that most of these points relate to 
program administration; in particular, it indicates the direction 
of these reforms. This reform of student aid shows what is in 
store with the reform of social programs: centralization, 
meddling in provincial jurisdiction and a right to opt out with 
national standards that apply even to administration.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Maria Minna (Beaches-Woodbine):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
hon. member is correct when she says that 30 years is a long 
time. We have had this program for 30 years. Federal-provincial 
co-operation has existed under the Student Loans Act for30 years and the co-operation and support continues.
<P>
	We heard from the parliamentary secretary earlier today that 
the provinces in this country do support this act. This is very 
important.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5414"> 5414 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1255 ) </B>
<P>
	Under this bill provinces will continue to be able to opt out of 
the federal student assistance program if they choose to offer 
their own program of student assistance. There is nothing new 
here.
<P>
	Opted out provinces will be able to receive compensation if 
they have a program which has substantially the same effect as 
the federal program. This is nothing new. The government is 
simply carrying forward provisions from the previous act.
<P>
	Moreover we are expanding provisions for compensation to 
provinces which choose to opt out to ensure that their students 
benefit from the proposed reforms. This is a positive initiative.
<P>
	We are also providing for accountability. This is something I 
believe is very critical if we are to be accountable to the 
taxpayers of this country. Accountability is something that 
taxpayers have asked us to make sure we have.
<P>
	For this reason we are asking those opted out jurisdictions to 
satisfy the minister that they have in place a program that is 
substantially the same as the federal program in order to receive 
compensation. Surely this is only responsible and reasonable.
<P>
	This can be accomplished by a simple letter once a year from 
non-participant provinces. It is not an onerous detailed demand. 
It is a simple letter of response and communication. It is not 
terribly demanding.
<P>
	Subclause 14(7) establishes that a province choosing to opt 
out is compensated for those program elements which are in 
place at the provincial level. Without subclause 14(7) an opted 
out province could be compensated for program elements which 
are not available within that province. To me, that would not be 
responsible. We must be accountable and continue to be 
accountable to the taxpayers. We would increase the 
government cost without any assurance that students are 
receiving the benefits provided for under this legislation. Again, 
that is important in this country, and we have discussed it for the 
last eight months. Accountability on how we spend federal tax 
dollars is very important.
<P>
	The provinces have agreed with the provisions in this bill. 
They agreed to the provisions because they feel comfortable that 
in fact their jurisdiction is not being affected, that they are 
protected under the Constitution and that this is a co-operative 
process working together for the benefit of the students of this 
country and in doing so, ensuring that students across Canada 
will receive the same programs and have the same access to 
good programs for post-secondary education.
<P>
	I really see nothing new and nothing terribly earth shaking in 
these changes. I believe they are for the benefit of Canadians. 
Therefore, I suggest that this motion is out of order. If the 
motion stands I would urge all members to vote against it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat):</B> Mr. Speaker, earlier an 
hon. member referred to the duty of the opposition when the 
opposition looks at legislation such as we have before us today.
<P>
	I think it is incumbent upon the opposition to give the 
legislation a thorough vetting. When opposition members come 
across a clause that they are uncomfortable with, they check it 
out, consult the stakeholders and find out what the different 
opinions are on it. After having done that if they are satisfied 
that the stakeholders do not have any particular problem with it, 
they should not oppose it for the sake of opposing it.
<P>
	I point out to the members in the Bloc that although the 
Government of Quebec was invited to come before the HRD 
committee to talk about this, it did not. It is comfortable 
apparently with this particular clause of the bill. It has the 
ability of course and has taken advantage of the ability to opt out 
of the previous act and presumably this one as well.
<P>
	It is very important that the opposition picks its time and 
place to make a big deal about these things. But to cry wolf too 
often only guarantees that you will have no audience when it is 
really important.
<P>
	I was very suspicious throughout the meetings that we had 
with respect to this bill about some of the intentions of the 
government. I wanted to ensure that the provinces' rights were 
not being tampered with, that they were not being infringed 
upon.
<P>
	In looking at it, after talking to all the people involved, 
talking to the ministers' departments and their officials, they do 
not have concerns.
<P>
<B>(1300) </B>
<P>
	I do not understand why we are even talking about this, given 
that even the Government of Quebec does not seem to have any 
concerns.
<P>
	In the interests of expediency, I would hope that we will 
defeat this motion.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, to a certain extent, the amendment before us can be 
considered a symbol. If our amendment is passed, it will be a 
sign that this government acknowledges that provinces which 
choose to opt out of the program can do so with dignity, and in 
full awareness of the situation, and fully take advantage of the 
opportunity to set their own requirements for their program.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5415"> 5415 </A></B>
<P>
	If that clause remains unchanged, however, this bill on 
financial assistance to students will no longer recognize that 
provinces have the right to opt out with full compensation; it 
will reduce them to the status of beggars. Each time provinces 
want to specify a number of points in a section, they will have to 
abide strictly by the federal financial assistance program, so that 
it will be impossible to take into consideration special 
circumstances prevailing in a given province.
<P>
	I will give you three examples in the bill before us in clauses 
7, 10, and 11.
<P>
	Clause 7 provides for an exemption from interest costs for a 
borrower who ceases to be a full-time student. If a province 
wants to exercise its right to opt out of the program, be it the 
Maritime provinces or Quebec, which has already opted out, and 
thinks a more substantial exemption is in order, it will not get it 
because big brother does not agree. There will be no room for 
adjustment to special conditions in a province where it is harder 
to find a job. It could be that in Toronto it would be normal to 
start paying back student loans the day after graduating, but not 
in New Brunswick where high unemployment makes it harder to 
get a job and where the provincial government might want to 
give students a better chance.
<P>
	With this bill, the federal government forces all provinces to 
implement a system which is identical to the one defined in the 
present law.
<P>
	The second example I wanted to give you concerns clause 10. 
These are all examples which pertain to people in everyday 
ordinary activities. It says that the lenders' obligations end if a 
student dies before completing his studies. How much latitude is 
there? Could some provinces not say that if death occurs the year 
after, the same exemption should apply? Some governments can 
be more humane than others or they may be able to afford more. 
Other provinces could impose more restrictions on that kind of 
situation.
<P>
	With this bill, we will reintroduce the absurd situation which 
we now have in the health sector, where the federal government 
imposes standards on the services offered, but reduces its 
financing every year.
<P>
	With the clause as worded in this bill, the federal government 
prevents practically any province that wants to exercise its right 
to opt out from doing so, because the conditions for opting out 
are such that there would be no benefit for the provinces, which 
are left with no room at all to manoeuvre in the areas where they 
would like to operate.
<P>
	Clause 11, which deals with permanent disability of the 
borrower, is another example. The federal legislation says that 
when a student becomes permanently disabled, the minister can 
reimburse the amounts owed by the student. Now, a province 
might feel that in the case of partial disability, the government 
could repay part of the loan.
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
	The three specific examples I wanted to give you show that an 
apparently minor clause that, on the face of it, seems quite 
benign, in fact hides a deep-seated desire for centralization. 
Instead of tabling a bill in which the opting-out principle is 
clearly explained, with full compensation for the province, if the 
government had told the provinces that there would be no more 
opting out, of course there would have been a tremendous hue 
and cry. However, this is an attempt to sneak through what the 
government has been unable to do in a more direct manner.
<P>
	We suggested a slightly different amendment in committee, 
and when it was finally defeated, there was a moment of silence 
as members realized this was a clear example of the very 
different view we have of government intervention. On the 
federal side, there is the perception-perhaps it comes from the 
bureaucracy which answers directly to the ministers-that they 
know what to do and that is how things are supposed to work, 
and last but not least, it has to be the same everywhere.
<P>
	A loan and grant program may include many areas where a 
province wants to do things differently. As for the previous 
remarks by the member from the Reform Party, I would ask him 
to moderate his enthusiasm about the fact that the current 
provincial Liberal government made no representations at the 
hearings, because that government exists in name only. It is 
nearing the end of its term. It is threadbare. It will soon be 
replaced by another government that will be genuinely 
committed to defending the interests of Quebec. It will do so, 
knowing what is involved, and it will ensure that every time, for 
as long as it is still part of the Canadian federation, the interests 
of Quebec and those of the provinces will be protected.
<P>
	It is not only a matter of defending our powers province by 
province because it is written in the Constitution Act. It is 
simply obvious when it comes to loans and scholarships. We 
have had the proof with the representatives of francophone 
students in the rest of Canada who came and told us: ``The law 
must provide clearly that we will be able to deal with our banks, 
caisses populaires and other financial institutions headed by 
francophones''. Therefore, often the institution where a student 
chooses to negotiate his loan will be the institution he will deal 
with for the rest of his life.
<P>
	That is why we need systems that allow provinces to opt out 
and to establish their own rules in order to meet such demands. I 
think the situation can be assessed very differently, for instance, 
in New Brunswick compared to Alberta. They could have 
different goals. There can also be a link between the way the 
provincial government is funding universities and the student 
loan and scholarship system.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5416"> 5416 </A></B>
<P>
	For example, if a provincial government advocates free 
education as much as possible, the operating costs of the 
university will not diminish. Therefore, the government will 
support those costs in its administrative operations but its 
student loan and scholarship program will be reduced. Another 
province might go for a program in which education expenses, 
the real operating costs of the university will be paid for almost 
totally by students, while the government will not significantly 
contribute to the funding of education.
<P>
	I think that we should have flexibility and pick one of the two 
following options: We either opt for a centralized system where 
the conditions are the same for everyone or we allow the 
provinces to use the important development tool that is 
education in order to acquire the leverage which will enable 
future generations to face the future.
<P>
	I invite the government to reconsider its position on that 
amendment. It will only have to retain the right to opt out with 
full compensation and in no circumstances should a province 
have to convince the minister that its position is right. It should 
only have to inform him of its position.
<P>
<B>(1310) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philippe Paré (Louis-Hébert):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am happy 
to speak on the amendment that the Bloc is proposing in order to 
eliminate that clause. On May 9, the federal Minister of Human 
Resources Development tabled his Bill C-28, the Canada 
Student Financial Assistance Act. The Bloc Quebecois is 
opposed to this bill and I support the amendment on the outright 
elimination of clause 14(7).
<P>
	This bill as worded is as if the government wanted to 
eliminate 30 years of history. The hon. member for Mercier was 
saying earlier that the Canadian act has been in effect since 
1964. Quebec has given itself its own system, but with this bill, 
it is as if that system did not exist. It is a kind of negation of 
history.
<P>
	We must remember that education is recognized by the 
Canadian Constitution as an exclusively provincial jurisdiction. 
However, the federal government has long been assuming 
certain powers in that sector, such as student financial 
assistance. In order to be able to interfere in the education 
sector, it refers to its spending authority. It is ironical that a 
government with an accumulated debt of more that $500 billion 
and an estimated annual deficit of almost $40 billion, is 
behaving as if it was on top of it. Because it has spending 
authority, it says: ``Let us spend''. Whether or not it is able to 
spend does not make any difference; it just spends money.
<P>
	The height of irresponsibility in the bill is that the 
government, with revenues that it does not have, is preparing to 
put even further into debt the young people that it wants to train. 
If this is not the perfect example of what can be called a vicious 
circle, then I do not know what it is. The government spends 
money that it does not  have and asks the so-called beneficiaries 
to foot the bill without knowing whether it can create jobs for 
them!
<P>
	Until now, provincial governments which, like the Quebec 
government, managed their own student financial assistance 
program could almost automatically exercise their right to opt 
out of the federal program and receive an alternative payment. 
This system worked relatively well for all. However, with the 
new bill introduced by the Minister of Human Resources 
Development, the rules are completely different.
<P>
	The provinces will not be able to exercise as easily their 
opting out right. This bill provides unacceptable new procedures 
with which provincial governments will have to comply if they 
want to exercise their opting out right and receive alternative 
payments. I refer here to clause 14(7) of the bill.
<P>
	We feel that this bill is, as my colleagues from Levis and 
Mercier mentioned before, a centralizing measure which 
threatens the provincial autonomy recognized in the Canadian 
Constitution, by giving the Minister of Human Resources 
Development too much power. One wonders if the government 
is not seeking, through this bill, to create its own Department of 
Education and to impose national education standards.
<P>
	Speaking of national standards, it is important to recall the 
basic, recurring problem in this area. The federal government 
imposes standards, then-invoking a lack of financial resources 
or other excuses-gradually withdraws while maintaining the 
standards.
<P>
<B>(1315) </B>
<P>
	To prove that, I will simply remind you that as far as 
established programs financing is concerned, including 
post-secondary education, in 1977-78, federal funding 
amounted to 48 per cent of the funds required for cost-shared 
programs, while in 1994-95, they will only amount to 32 per 
cent. If the federal government pays only 32 per cent, it means 
that someone else will have to pay the difference and it will be 
the provincial governments. Even so, they will have to comply 
with the national standards.
<P>
	Let me give you another example. I would like to talk about 
the changes that occurred in the revenues of the government of 
Quebec between 1984 and the projections for 1998. In 1984, 
federal transfers accounted for 28 per cent of the Quebec budget, 
while in 1998, they are expected to account for only 15 per cent. 
There again, the people of Quebec will have to pay.
<P>
	That way of doing things and imposing national standards 
takes away responsibility from the provincial governments 
which are elected governments and which are much closer to the 
people than the federal government.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5417"> 5417 </A></B>
<P>
	That way of doing things shows that local needs are ignored. 
Much has been said about the major differences between the 
various regions of Canada, but national standards do not take 
those differences into account at all. The bill that we are 
debating is just like the others. It assumes that as far as student 
loans and education are concerned, the needs are exactly the 
same in Newfoundland, Quebec and British Columbia.
<P>
	Finally, these national standards infringe upon democracy 
because people in the provinces have elected members to 
provincial legislatures, they have placed their confidence in 
them and given them powers, and the introduction of national 
standards will eventually erode an important part of provincial 
responsibility.
<P>
	In fact, clause 14 provides that, in order to receive alternative 
payments, a provincial government will have to satisfy, not 
inform but satisfy, the minister, I quote: ``by written notice 
received by the Minister before the beginning of the loan year in 
question, that, in relation to the matter in question, the 
provincial student financial assistance plan has substantially the 
same effect as the plan established by this Act''.
<P>
	This is totally unacceptable and I wonder, if the Supreme 
Court were to study this intrusion in a provincial jurisdiction, it 
would not decide in favour of the arguments presented by the 
Official Opposition.
<P>
	It is unacceptable that provincial governments would have to 
justify their student financial assistance plans to the federal 
Minister of Human Resources Development since education is 
exclusively a provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	In the context we all know very well, where a large proportion 
of Quebecers are against the federal system, one could say the 
central government is doing all it can to provoke a general 
outcry. This seems due to a very questionable sense of politics; 
it is hard to say if it is pure stupidity or provocation.
<P>
	This whole question is particularly important for Quebec 
because it is crucial that Quebecers manage their own education 
system.
<P>
	Let me conclude by saying that Quebec's record in this regard 
shows that Quebec has acted responsibly in setting up such a 
system. We must also keep in mind that education is a vital 
instrument for cultural and linguistic development. Quebec 
cannot afford not to be in control of this sphere of activity. Our 
French-language universities are shining brightly. They are 
almost everywhere and their vitality leaves no doubt. You can 
find graduates of French-language universities in every sector. I 
think we set a remarkable example for the rest of Canada. While 
developing its French-language universities, Quebec was 
generous enough-I think the word is exact-to allow its 
anglophone minority to have its own universities. No other 
province did such a thing, except New Brunswick with Moncton 
University. Everywhere else, francophones must make do with 
bilingual universities. We know the results.
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse):</B> Mr. Speaker, it was 
refreshing to hear the hon. member for Louis-Hébert give us 
this historical reminder of what we always accepted in Quebec. 
The hon. member mentioned the rights of English-speaking 
Quebecers, rights that we respected to the point that, at one time, 
there were three English universities in Quebec: Sir George 
Williams, McGill and Bishop's, in Lennoxville, and only one 
French university, Laval, which had a campus in Montreal. This 
does not go very far back in the collective memory of 
Quebecers. We have to repeat it, over and over again, to show 
the degree of tolerance we exhibited in the area of education. Of 
course, we have caught up. The Montreal campus became the 
Université de Montréal, a university was created in Sherbrooke 
and then, in the mid 1960s, we had the creation and expansion of 
the Université du Québec network.
<P>
	This being said, the rights of English-speaking Quebecers are 
well protected, and a sovereign Quebec would guarantee these 
rights in its constitution.
<P>
	The bill in front of us questions the concept of opting out in 
the historical meaning of the term, in its constitutional meaning, 
a concept which was introduced at the time of the first 
agreements, the so-called Sauvé-Diefenbaker agreements at the 
end of the 1950s. Quebec could opt out, because at that time it 
was the only province to ask for the right to withdraw from a 
federal program in exchange for full compensation. That way, 
Quebec was not subject to what we call federal standards, and 
what others call national standards. The opting out provisions 
were always maintained. We had the Lesage-Diefenbaker, 
Lesage-Pearson and Johnson-Pearson formulas, and finally the 
Bourassa-Trudeau formula, although the agreements were 
scarcer at that time.
<P>
	Essentially, what Quebec Premiers Sauvé, Lesage and 
Johnson have obtained is the right to opt out with full 
compensation without having to justify their decision. Finally, 
we are back to the concept advocated by Sir John A. Macdonald 
of a legislative union in Canada. They want to legislate here for 
all of the provinces while leaving them a small way out. Ottawa 
tells them: If you want to opt out, you will be able to do so 
provided you can convince us, the federal government, that your 
provincial legislation meets federal or national standards. In the 
end, the one giving that power, the federal government, under 
conditions precedent, is reserving the right to say: No, you have 
not convinced us and so we are keeping that power and we are 
going to continue to administer the program or else you will 
receive no transfer payments.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5418"> 5418 </A></B>
<P>
	Misrepresentation of Canadian federalism did not start with 
Bill C-28. In fact, federal attempts to do so go back to 1867, but 
they increased at the end of the 1950s and the beginning of the 
1960s and have been growing steadily.
<P>
<B>(1325) </B>
<P>
	Quite possibly there may not be a single sector that has not 
been touched by federal legislation. To my knowledge, 
according to the research that I have done, the one area in which 
the federal government has really not been able to venture is the 
administration of provincial public servants. That was the gist 
of a Supreme Court ruling when the Trudeau government 
imposed wage and price controls. This government had 
succeeded in getting elected on the promise that it would not 
freeze prices and wages. However, once elected, it proceeded to 
do exactly the opposite, like any good Liberal government worth 
its salt.
<P>
	I agree with my colleague from Kingston and the Islands who 
followed the events of the Trudeau era closely and who noted 
this massive incursion into fields of provincial jurisdiction, this 
disdain for provincial legislatures who are treated as junior level 
governments, whereas the senior level government for our 
friends across the way is the federal Parliament of Canada.
<P>
	Why must we remind the member for Kingston and the 
Islands and our colleagues opposite, who are fully aware of the 
situation, that they conducted the same studies we did, that they 
have lived and will continue to live for the next few months in 
the same country as us and that they should know that provincial 
legislatures have as much sovereignty over their respective 
areas of jurisdiction as the federal Parliament has over its own?
<P>
	We have to constantly remind them that this struggle for the 
recognition of provincial sovereignty dates back to our 
great-grandfathers and great-grandmothers. We hope that our 
generation will be able to complete the task undertaken by those 
who came before us in the House and in the Quebec National 
Assembly and who participated in all the struggles for the 
survival of the Quebec nation. Well, we are tired of merely 
surviving. We have now decided to start living. We will live as 
Quebecers under the authority that we will freely delegate to the 
Quebec National Assembly when we have freed ourselves once 
and for all from an institution that has more to do with feudalism 
than with modern democracy. We will rally Quebecers to a 
collective plan for Quebec's sovereignty and take back our 
powers so that we no longer have to beg and convince anyone of 
the legitimacy of our demands. We will quite simply make our 
own decisions as people who have full political maturity, and 
that is coming soon.
<P>
	People in English Canada and elsewhere in the world are 
already waiting to see a new country emerge and take its place in 
the international community. The decision for independence is 
coming soon and we must prepare for it. And we must prepare 
even more when we see the  kind of highly centralizing 
legislation presented to us by the present Government of Canada 
which is not so different from its predecessors.
<P>
	The Gordian knot that has been strangling us for decades in 
Canada, the fact that there is a country missing in this 
country-we will have to make a decision on it in Quebec and 
then of course negotiate with our friends in English Canada on 
the consequences of our decision. But if we think about it 
carefully, historically, I believe that both sides can benefit from 
the decision that we will make in Quebec so that each of us can 
have our own decision-making bodies and instead of arguing 
bitterly over bills on which we can have extremely divergent 
views, we can each make our own decisions in our own 
legislature and then discuss what unites us as friends and 
neighbours instead of what divides us.
<P>
	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
participate in this debate on Bill C-28, the Canada Student 
Financial Assistance Act.
<P>
<B>(1330) </B>
<P>
	The way the federal government is acting here exemplifies, in 
a way, the failure of the Canadian federal system and can 
explain, to a large extent, why a sovereigntist political party like 
ours was voted into the House of Commons of Canada.
<P>
	Student financial assistance is obviously an education matter. 
And in Canada, under the existing Constitution, education 
comes under the jurisdiction of the provinces. The government, 
the English Parliament that passed the British North America 
Act in 1867 had clearly defined the jurisdictions of each of the 
two levels of government we have in Canada: the federal 
government and the provincial governments. And each of them 
have exclusive powers within their jurisdictions.
<P>
	Under section 42 of the British North America Act, education 
was defined at that time as an area of provincial jurisdiction. But 
for years, actually decades now, the federal government has 
been invading this provincial area of responsibility. By virtue of 
what authority? By virtue of its own power to spend.
<P>
	It is somewhat ironic to see, while jurisdictions are clearly 
defined in the Constitution, the federal government is intruding 
in an area under provincial jurisdiction, saying: ``We are rich. 
We have loads of money. We have money to spend. Therefore 
you have to take our money''.
<P>
	The bill before us speaks volumes about the government 
managing to ignore the uniqueness of provincial governments in 
the end. In time, this practice has caused the federal system to 
fail in Canada, with the result that communities like ours, in 
Quebec, have decided to take responsibility for themselves and 
run their own state business in their interests, according to 
objectives set by and for themselves.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5419"> 5419 </A></B>
<P>
	This bill sets out standards any provincial government would 
have to meet to avail itself of something we have been enjoying 
in Canada for over thirty years, namely the possibility of opting 
out. As you know, since the 1960s, many voices were raised in 
Canada to warn the federal government: ``You are interfering in 
such and such an area of provincial jurisdiction''. With things 
heating up, the federal government of the day put forward the 
opting-out formula, which means that a provincial government 
can invoke its right to opt out, get full compensation for and 
administer certain programs in the interest of its people.
<P>
	Quebec opted out of a number of these programs, including 
the loan and bursary program.
<P>
	This bill preserves the opting-out formula, but the conditions 
each province must meet in order to exercise the right to opt out 
are so stringent that the day will come when opting-out will not 
be in a province's interest.
<P>
	The bill says that if a province wants to withdraw, its program 
must have essentially the same criteria as those of the federal 
program. So what are they really telling the province? They are 
telling it to administer-repeat, administer-the federal 
program in such a way as to obtain the same results.
<P>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
	At first glance, we could say: ``Yes, it is quite normal in a 
federation. The federal government has a responsibility to 
ensure that all parts of the country and all citizens are treated the 
same way''. We would then completely ignore one important 
aspect: Within the Canadian federation, there are some very 
obvious local differences. British Columbia, Newfoundland and 
Quebec often face particular situations that require adjusting the 
programs from which they asked to withdraw. Also, they cannot 
always pursue the same objectives and effects if they want to 
ensure that the people who stand to benefit get the most out of 
the programs.
<P>
	I think it is rather obvious in the area of education. I myself 
am a teacher by profession. Before being elected to the House of 
Commons, I worked as a guidance counsellor in a secondary 
school. I saw that the Canadian education system has its 
peculiarities. It was quite obvious every year during Canada 
Career Week. Schools then received boxes full of brochures 
suggesting activities, in French, of course, because we are still 
Canada's French-speaking province. We received documents in 
French suggesting activities geared to the various levels.
<P>
	Every year, it was something of a novelty for everyone. We 
were eager to see what was proposed. The school's guidance 
counsellors and teachers tried to find out together what 
Canadian people elsewhere  thought up for us in French and wanted 
us to do during Career Week. Often, it was written in acceptable 
or sometimes even in excellent French. We had difficulty 
understanding the type of activities proposed and figuring out to 
which students or levels they were aimed  at. The various 
systems work differently and also the values underlying them 
vary from province to province. So, in the vast majority of 
situations, we simply could not use the material provided to us.
<P>
	Nevertheless, we would do like the rest of Canadian schools 
and have a career week, except that we would use material 
prepared in our own school, and it would work very well. This 
example illustrates how, in a field as critical as education, 
Canadians and Quebecers have different approaches, views and 
ways of doing things.
<P>
	At the time, we more or less did what Quebec wants to do in 
the next few years, in that we decided to act independently. We 
told ourselves: Our school will have its own career week, based 
on our own methods, objectives and procedures, and activities 
will be geared to our students.
<P>
	This modest work experience has taught me that, in fields as 
important as education, the needs of citizens and provinces must 
be taken into account, and those needs are not the same 
throughout Canada. That is why the bill before us is a bad piece 
of legislation. It includes several clauses promoting such 
standardization, and some provinces might not be able to make 
the necessary adjustments to ensure that the system runs 
smoothly.
<P>
	Let us go back to clause 7, which refers to the interest-free 
period for a borrower who ceases to be a student.
<P>
<B>(1340) </B>
<P>
	Why does that clause impose a standard procedure for every 
province in the country? We all know that the unemployment 
rate varies from province to province. It is not true that a student 
in a given province has the same chances of finding a job when 
he graduates as a student in another province.
<P>
	Yet, based on that clause, the situation is presumably the same 
right across the country. I will conclude by simply asking the 
House to support the amendment tabled by the Bloc Quebecois 
to delete this provision which forces provinces to adopt and 
implement standard procedures, thereby making the option to 
withdraw from the plan non applicable for all intents and 
purposes. If this bill is passed in the form proposed by the 
Liberal government, it will confirm once again that Canadian 
federalism cannot work in the current context. Consequently, 
those who are looking for an alternative in the interest of their 
community have no choice but to withdraw from it, as I hope 
Quebec will do in the next few years.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5420"> 5420 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis):</B> Mr. Speaker, subsection 14(7) we 
want to see deleted adds to the conditions imposed on the 
provinces which want to opt out of the federal financial 
assistance program and establish their own program, just like 
the province of Quebec and the Northwest Territories are 
currently doing.
<P>
	This provision only adds to the existing conditions and Bill 
C-28 on financial assistance applies, as you know, to new 
matters. Pursuant to subsection 14(7), in order to obtain 
alternative payments, the Minister of Education or the province 
concerned must satisfy the Minister, by written notice received 
by the Minister before the beginning of the loan year in 
question, that, in relation to the matter in question, the 
provincial student financial assistance plan has substantially the 
same effect.
<P>
	It must have the same effect not in general, with some small 
exemptions, but in every matter in question, as the plan 
established by this Act and the regulations. We have moved to 
delete this subsection, because section 14 already has six 
provisions which, according to a study we ordered and have had 
reviewed, are enough to provide all the provinces which decide 
to opt out of Bill C-28 with all the financial assistance they 
need.
<P>
	Of course, we think the status quo would have been better, 
because the previous provisions were very specific. Pursuant to 
the old legislation, the provinces only needed to convince the 
minister where part-time student loans and special exemption 
periods were concerned.
<P>
	To convince the federal minister, is it not a bit much? A 
provincial government must convince the federal minister when 
it needs financial assistance! Sometimes, people think that the 
federal government gets its money elsewhere, but I want to 
remind Quebecers that their taxes make up 24 per cent of all 
federal revenues. We do not take this money away from other 
provinces; it comes from their own tax dollars sent to Ottawa, 
which in turn provides financial assistance in an area under 
exclusive provincial jurisdiction. So, the minister must now be 
convinced. That was also a requirement under the existing 
provisions and admittedly these people had adopted a centralist 
approach. Before, we also had to convince the minister in order 
to opt out of the program, but only about very limited aspects 
such as part-time studies and special exemptions, not about 
loans. Let us not forget that fact.
<P>
<B>(1345) </B>
<P>
	Why is Quebec so insistent on managing its own financial 
assistance program? Of course, the program is not perfect and 
some will never be totally satisfied. Most Quebecers would 
prefer to see more grants than loans awarded, but, up until now, 
the federal program was restricted to loans. Grants will now be 
included, although this has long been the case in Quebec. It 
would take be too long to enumerate all the features of the 
Quebec legislation respecting student financial assistance, 
which was amended in 1990, but, as my colleague from 
Jonquière said, there are many of them.
<P>
	Here is one characteristic which does not appear in this bill. 
For example, instead of imitating the federal legislation where a 
sword of Damocles hangs over the heads of students with poor 
grades, Quebec uses the carrot rather than the stick approach by 
saying that students graduating within the required time benefit 
from a reduction in their loan payments. We are thus 
encouraging those who succeed without penalizing or limiting 
access to those who have satisfactory results in certain fields, 
but who may go through difficult times because of personal 
problems, illness or family problems. Troubling events can 
always happen. According to this bill, the federal minister, 
through the appropriate authority, must ensure that the student 
has satisfactory results. In Quebec, it does not work this way. In 
our province, a scholarship program is already in place, even for 
part-time students. Therefore, the situation is already very 
interesting in Quebec.
<P>
	However, it is a question of principle. Quebec must manage 
its own student loan program. Why? Because, as we know, every 
province invests in its own postsecondary education system. So 
does the federal government, but the stakeholders at that level 
are the provinces. What happens?
<P>
	In Canada, for example-although this varies from one 
province to the next and even from one university to the 
next-the universities, which by getting less  money from  the 
higher  levels of government, tend to raise their tuition fees. On 
average, these fees have increased threefold in all of Canada 
since 1984. In Quebec, universities have succeeded so far in 
maintaining lower tuition fees, since access to higher education 
is very important for Quebecers. This is a principle on which 
they all agree. There is a consensus on that. There must be 
access to higher education. Members of Parliament and ordinary 
citizens often say that people must take control of their own 
destiny and that students are no exception. They must pay a 
greater part of the cost of their education.
<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
	The example of the United States is often given. True, this is 
the case in the United States but this is the only western country 
where tuition fees are higher than in Canada. In France, 
university education is free, because access to university 
education is also considered to be important. With this right to 
opt out, Canada looks more and more like two countries in one. 
We do not want to prevent English Canada from putting in place 
a loan system according to its own values and needs, but Quebec 
has its own concepts on this due to its cultural identity. 
Quebecers have their own values.
<P>
	We find it unacceptable that a government which said that it 
did not want to talk about the Constitution anymore is discreetly 
amending legislation containing quasi-constitutional 
provisions. It says one thing and does the exact opposite. It 
waited till the end of the session to force us to adopt its measure 
in a hurry even before the Minister of Human Resources 
Development reveals his  action plan for social security reform 
and before the consultations on this subject take place. Students 
are considered 
<P>

<B><A NAME="5421"> 5421 </A></B>
<P>
to be a distinct group since it has already been decided how they 
should be treated.
<P>
	The government could have raised the ceiling on student loans 
simply by amending that aspect of the existing act, but no. It 
chose to present a bill that represents a further encroachment in 
an area of exclusive provincial jurisdiction, namely education.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would probably have regretted not participating in 
this debate, so that is why I am doing it now, even though it is 
getting near the end. I will remind the members that we are now 
at report stage and that the study of this amendment will 
complete the consideration of this bill at second reading. I will 
probably be the last person to speak at this stage of the process.
<P>
	The amendment before us is aimed at deleting paragraph 7, in 
clause 14 of the bill. We want to delete it because, from now on, 
a provincial government will be able to exercise its right to opt 
out only if it can convince the minister. And convincing 
Minister Axworthy is no easy task. The provincial government 
will have to send written notice to the minister before the 
beginning of the loan year, even though the number of students 
is essentially the same from one year to the next in the various 
disciplines. The federal government wants to put one more 
obstacle in the way to make it more and more difficult for the 
provincial governments to opt out of the national standards that 
the minister of education of Canada-since we may have to call 
him that from now on-wants to impose on all Canadians.
<P>
	I think it is extremely difficult to accept such a change. 
Several of my colleagues who spoke today mentioned that 
Quebec has always exercised its right to opt out. We also heard 
that this student financial assistance program was first 
established in 1964 by a great Liberal, Mr. Pearson, who had a 
totally decentralized vision of Canada. But we can see clearly in 
the intent of this bill the centralizing influence of the former 
Trudeau government since several Cabinet members who were 
probably involved in the drafting of this bill, including the 
minister and the Prime Minister, have followed in the footsteps 
of this great man who, according to some people, marked the 
history of our country, certainly because of his excessive 
centralizing policies.
<P>
<B>(1355) </B>
<P>
	To opt out with full compensation, provinces must also adjust 
their loan and grant conditions to their particular situation. Over 
the past few weeks and the past few months, we have been 
saying it over and over again, there are two countries within this 
one. Soon, there may be ten or even twelve, because I doubt if 
provinces will want to operate under such a centralized system. 
Moreover, people will realize that this legislation contains real 
danger. It is as if people had fallen asleep all of a sudden; it 
would appear that parliamentarians have also  fallen asleep and 
are unable to see the traps in this piece of legislation; the danger 
is real. When they wake up, it will be too late.
<P>
	I am thinking of the francophones outside Quebec who 
presented a brief. I do not want to be quoted out of context nor be 
accused again on the basis of my supposed intentions. I will 
therefore quote the brief presented by French-speaking 
Canadians, by our young francophones. It says that 
francophones and Acadians often have lower standards of 
living. Their education level is lower than their 
English-speaking counterparts, which leads not only to lower 
incomes but also to a situation where post-secondary education 
should be systematically promoted as a means of breaking out of 
the vicious circle our communities are trapped in. Besides, 
because of their linguistic situation, these young students must 
often leave their community, or even their home province, to 
further their education at the university or college level.
<P>
	The provinces should have a piece of legislation or 
regulations that would be flexible enough to allow them to 
organise their own loan repayment system according to 
students' needs. Incentives could be taken into consideration 
such as Quebec's initiative to grant a substantial break on loan 
repayment to students who manage to complete their education 
within the specific time frame normally needed for a bachelor's 
degree, a master's or a Ph.D.
<P>
	I urge the government to carefully review this bill before 
passing it at third reading.

<P>
	While he was a student he spent a summer working as an

	<B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport):</B> Mr. Speaker, lead shot, 
gun ammunition made mostly from lead, is widely used in 
Canada for small game hunting. When birds and animals eat 
lead shot, it dissolves in their stomachs and slowly but surely 
kills them. The same can be said about lead fishing weights. 
Loons, eagles, herons and cormorants are among the birds 
affected by these toxic products.
<P>
	There are good alternatives. Steel shot has been developed as 
a practical, effective, economic and non-toxic substitute.
<P>
	In Denmark and Holland, lead is banned from all products, 
including gunshot and fishing weights. Lead shot is banned in 
the United States but Canada does not have similar legislation.
<P>
	I urge the government to adopt a policy whereby lead shot and 
fishing weights made of lead are not to be used or made in 
Canada.

Fort Erie, Ontario is nestled on the shores of Lake Erie at the

co-host of the Friendship Festival.
<P>
	The festival was originally organized seven years ago to 
recognize and commemorate 175 years of peace between the 
communities of Fort Erie, Ontario and Buffalo, New York and 
between the countries of Canada and the United States. The 
festival takes place on both sides of the Niagara River, one of the 
very battlegrounds of the war of 1812.
<P>
	The festival's mission statement is to provide a forum for the 
people of Canada and the United States to celebrate this 
historical relationship and to enhance community spirit, pride, 
economic development and cultural awareness. The festival 
takes place from June 25 to July 4, encompassing these two fine 
countries' national holidays of July 1 and July 4 respectively.
<P>
	The Friendship Festival attracts over 500,000 people annually 
along with hundreds of vendors, artists and hobbyists. Most 
important, it is a festival focused on the family and the 
harmonious existence of two communities that were once at war.

essential that we do what is necessary to protect them. The 
inclusion of the undefined term sexual orientation in the Human 
Rights Act holds dangerous implications for Canadians and 
their children.
<P>
	This is not simply a recent concern. The danger of including 
sexual orientation in the charter was addressed on January 29, 
1981 by the Minister of Justice. Allow me to quote his words: ``I 
am not here to determine what sexual orientation means. It is 
because of the problem of  the definition of those words that we 
do not think they should be in the Constitution''.
<P>
	Those same problems of definition exist today. Consequently, 
the undefined term of sexual orientation must not be included in 
any federal legislation.

problem in 1981 is the Prime Minister of Canada today.

internal trade agreement by the end of this month. I share these 
concerns with the labour movement and organizations such as 
the Canadian Environmental Law Association and the Canadian 
Centre for Policy Alternatives.
<P>
	The drafts of this agreement are not available to the public. It 
is being negotiated behind closed doors and with little 
consultation. I call upon the governments involved to open up 
this internal economic constitution to an open and public debate 
and delay the signing date until this consultation has taken 
place.
<P>
	It is one thing to negotiate co-operative agreements which put 
a stop to practices of some governments, like tearing up bricks 
in a sidewalk because they were purchased in the wrong 
province. It is another to duplicate within Canada a free trade 
agreement that will hamper the ability of governments to 
establish, maintain and improve labour, consumer and

injuries and illnesses in Canada is close to $11 billion.
<P>
	Clearly we have a fiscal and social responsibility to ensure 
that the general public is empowered with information designed 
to prevent injuries and illnesses in the workplace and save lives.

for all the individuals and organizations such as the Canadian 
Centre for Occupational Health and Safety in my riding of 
Hamilton West that produce general information and research 
on injury and illness prevention in the workplace.

	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in a letter to a meeting of his provincial counterparts in 
Halifax, the Minister of Human Resources Development 
included a requirement that the provinces get back to him on his 
proposed reform of social programs within 36 hours. Not three 
weeks, not one week, not three days, not 48 hours but 36 hours. 
An unrealistic and unacceptable deadline, considering the 
extent of a reform that has met with legitimate opposition from 
the provinces.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5426"> 5426 </A></B>
<P>
	I want to ask the minister whether this means he still insists on 
imposing his views on the provinces by making them feel they 
are up against the wall, since he sent them a 36-hour ultimatum.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. Leader of the 
Opposition is once again building a question on a strong base of 
fantasy. Never, in a letter, comment or direction did I say that 
there would be any limit of 36 hours.
<P>
	This morning I spoke directly to the chairman of the social 
services ministers, Dr. James Smith. I asked him where he heard 
it and he said it was brought up by somebody in the meeting and 
the press asked about it and he responded. I asked: ``Had you 
heard it from me?'' He answered: ``No. You are talking about10 days, two weeks, whatever time is necessary for a response''.
<P>
	I would say to the hon. Leader of the Opposition that before he 
asks a question he should get his facts straight.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in a democracy like ours, the best way to be informed is 
to read respectable and respected newspapers. The <I>Ottawa 
Citizen</I> said today-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> The <I>Ottawa Citizen</I> is a very good newspaper. 
It reported today that provincial ministers were given 36 hours 
to get back to the minister.
<P>
	I want to ask the minister whether he realizes that by being so 
uncompromising and setting this deadline for a quick response 
from the provinces, he is aggravating the impasse between 
Ottawa and the provinces.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification): </B>Mr. Speaker, I would like to read the press 
release from the Minister of Health and Social Services: ``The 
ministers have reiterated their commitment to reform of our 
social programs. They also stressed the need to find more 
effective ways to implement social programs so as to reduce 
poverty and improve services to the neediest in our society''.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, the ministers of social services understand the 
priority: get down to work to find new answers to deal with 
poverty. The only person who is not engaged is the Leader of the 
Opposition and his party.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the provincial ministers want social reform, but they 
do not want the minister's reform. That is the difference. Does 
the minister not realize that instead of his usual unhealthy 
obstinacy, he should show-
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> Unhealthy-misguided.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> It is a synonym.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> Instead of being so obstinate, would the 
minister agree he should show some common sense and make a 
point of not only involving the provinces in his reform but 
especially of respecting their practically exclusive jurisdiction 
in this area?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have said always that this 
reform is bigger than any one government, any one level of 
government. It is a reform that requires the full participation of 
all Canadians. We will work with anybody: provincial 
governments, interest groups, Canadians on an individual basis. 
We did that during the first phase of the Commons hearings and 
we intend to do it again in the second phase.
<P>
	I said specifically in the letter I wrote to the ministers of 
social services-if the hon. Leader of the Opposition would take 
the time to read the letter and find out what was really 
said-where I said this must be based on the full participation of 
all partners in this process. The only people who are avoiding 
participating are the Bloc Quebecois and we know the reason 
why.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development. 
The <I>Ottawa Citizen</I>, referring to off-the-record remarks by a 
government spokesman, disclosed parts of the social program 
reform being considered by the federal government, a reform 
that will be made public at the end of July, during the summer 
holidays, after Parliament has adjourned.
<P>
	Can the minister confirm that his reform will require that all 
income security program recipients, be it welfare or 
unemployment insurance, will have to do community work or 
take training courses in order to receive their benefits? The 
National Anti-Poverty Organization said this will amount to a 
cheap labour policy, and will not form the basis of a real 
employment policy.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have not yet had the time or 
opportunity to read the press report referred to by the hon. 
member.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5427"> 5427 </A></B>
<P>
	However, I would suggest to her that any press report at this 
stage is purely speculative and hypothetical. We will know the 
kind of options we want Canadians to debate is when we table 
the report.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier):</B> Mr. Speaker, are we to 
understand that, through this bulldozing operation, the minister 
wants to impose his views on the provinces, by threatening to 
reduce financial contributions to provinces that refuse to link 
the payment of benefits to the obligation to do community work 
or take training courses?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources

	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, scandals, unfounded allegations and unanswered 
questions have plagued governments and Parliaments 
throughout our history. Certainly the Prime Minister's 
statement this morning was welcome in light of our past history.
<P>
	In his speech this morning on integrity in government, the 
Prime Minister claimed that the power of the ethics counsellor 
will prevent deals like the Pearson airport privatization from 
happening again.
<P>
	My question for the Prime Minister is this. What is there 
about the Pearson deal that the ethics counsellor would prevent?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, a 
deal like that will not occur again simply because the 
government will never sign such a deal. I do not know if it is 
very easy. The ethics counsellor is there. There is legislation. 
The members of the committee will have an opportunity to 
interview him. He is a very competent person. He will give 
advice to the government.
<P>
<B>(1425) </B>
<P>
	As I said, in the final analysis, it is the government that 
decides. When we have a bad government like the previous Tory 
government, you know it is the type of government that 
produced things like that. You can be reassured that will not 
happen with a Liberal government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we are hoping that some of the clout that this ethics 
counsellor will have will prevent the Liberal government 
following in the footsteps of the previous government.
<P>
	The Prime Minister said this morning that deals like the 
Pearson airport deal must never be allowed to happen again, and 
I concur.
<P>
	Would the Prime Minister tell us if the ethics counsellor 
would have power of intervention to stop deals such as the 
Pearson when ethics issues arise? That is what he indicated to us 
this morning.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, if 
you conclude that the deal was made because of the lobbyists, 
you know the counsellor will look at the lobby business and 
intervene. At the end of the day, any deals, any contracts by the 
government are made by the government.
<P>
	We cannot deny our responsibilities as government. We have 
been the government for eight months. The people are very 
pleased. You just made reference to that. It is not like it was 
before. Why? It is because the government is committed to 
honesty and integrity in the public eye.
<P>
	This government will remain this way. The ethics counsellor 
can help us. That is why I appointed him, to help us. In the final 
analysis, as I said this morning, the government remains the 
government. We have been elected to make the decisions. We 
are trying to get the best advice possible.
<P>
	Mr. Howard Wilson is a man of credibility that has done his 
job properly, advising ministers over a long period of time. He is 
competent and we are very happy that he has accepted to face 
these new responsibilities. His job is not to replace the 
government. The government will remain the government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the Prime Minister's answer. He has made 
it fairly clear in our minds that the new ethics counsellor does 
not have power of intervention. His power lies in his ability to 
report to the public.
<P>
	Recently it was decided that a single annual report from the 
Auditor General was not sufficient. This morning the Prime 
Minister informed the House that the new ethics counsellor 
would report just once a year to Parliament.
<P>
	Based on past performance and our history, conflicts of 
interest and ethics may arise on a regular basis. Certainly an 
annual report to Parliament will not be sufficient.
<P>
	Can the Prime Minister explain how the ethics counsellor can 
effectively communicate to the public without a chance of 
political interference regarding the conduct of government if he 
is only required to file a report annually?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
question being raised concerning the ethics counsellor misses 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5428"> 5428 </A></B>
<P>
the point. What the hon. member should be noting is that, at the 
present time, there is no ethics counsellor and no reports have 
been filed.
<P>
	The government has moved forward on a number of important 
commitments that were contained in the red book: commitments 
to fulfil the report of the standing committee of the House of 
Commons from last June; the commitment to appoint an ethics 
counsellor; the commitment to give him investigatory powers; 
the commitment to stop the contingency fees that were polluting 
the government procurement process.
<P>
	These are important commitments. We have met them. They 
should be applauding us.

	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs. Yesterday, the 
United States pleaded in favour of commercial sanctions against 
North Korea. The proposed sanctions include a mandatory ban 
on North Korean imports or exports of arms or weapon 
components, a ban on technical and scientific co-operation in 
order not to enhance North Korea's nuclear capacity, and 
terminating all economic assistance through the UN or its 
subsidiaries.
<P>
	Can the Minister of Foreign Affairs tell the House whether 
Canada unconditionally supports the U.S. position on banning 
North Korean imports or exports of arms, and on the whole 
range of proposed commercial sanctions against that country?
<P>
<B>(1430) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, I am glad to tell the hon. member that Canada supports 
the U.S. position and that, if needed, we will lobby other 
members of the Security Council so that it passes this 
resolution. If the UN goes ahead with these sanctions against 
North Korea, we will certainly fully comply with all of them.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères):</B> Mr. Speaker, can the 
minister indicate what action has been taken by the government 
of Canada to bring North Korea back into the fold of the Atomic 
Energy Agency and to ensure that that country's nuclear 
program is compliant with the provisions of the 
Non-Proliferation Treaty?
<P>
	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, we do not have diplomatic relations with North Korea, 
and are not able to express our views directly to that country. 
However, we did so through public statements, and indirectly, 
by presenting our point of view to people who are in regular 
contact with the North Korean government.
<P>
	During the recent visit by the South Korean foreign affairs 
minister, the Prime Minister and I stressed how important it was, 
in our view, to fully respect the Non-Proliferation Treaty, to 
have all the nations of the world renew it, and to convince the 
North Korean government that it cannot isolate itself in that 
way. It must join the ranks of most other countries of the world  
who want us not only to ban nuclear arms but also to respect the 
Non-Proliferation Treaty.

	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Minister of Justice.
<P>
	On March 14 the minister said in the House: ``I do not believe 
it is reasonable for anybody to interpret the term sexual 
orientation as it appears in the human rights legislation as 
including pedophiles''.
<P>
	Whether child molesters are homosexual or heterosexual in 
their orientation they certainly are not reasonable. Child abusers 
will find it entirely reasonable to launch a challenge to the 
Criminal Code on the basis of this sexual orientation if the term 
is not defined in the human rights act.
<P>
	Why is the minister so reluctant to define the term sexual 
orientation?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Russell MacLellan (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I want to say to the hon. member that the Minister of 
Justice is in no way reluctant to define the term sexual 
orientation. He has expressed the seriousness of this question in 
the relevant situations.
<P>
	It is going to require a good deal of study to deal with it. The 
Minister of Justice is now in the middle of doing this study with 
the department. We will not only have a definition of sexual 
orientation, but we will be able to bring forward to the House a 
program and a policy of which I think the House will approve.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate that answer. If the meaning of the term sexual 
orientation is so clear-and he referred to jurisprudence 
previously as being the avenue by which he would have it 
defined-I believe the government should take over, should not 
shirk its responsibilities and should define the term. The 
minister said: ``I do not think matters of public policy should be 
determined in the courts''.
<P>
	Why is the minister not willing to take that responsibility, let 
that be discussed here, and define it properly in the legislation?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Russell MacLellan (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Minister of Justice has put before the House a 
record which in my opinion is enviable. He has brought forward

to the Criminal Code.

<P>

during the referendum campaign on the Charlottetown accord,

<P>
	Does the Prime Minister agree with the kind of political 
pressure exerted by the previous government, and does he not 
believe that this kind of interference violates the freedom and 
integrity of journalists?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
seems that it was not very effective, and I dislike being 
ineffective.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to remind the Prime Minister that the 
position of his party is to convince broadcasters to promote 
Canadian identity. He will probably do it effectively.
<P>
	What I want to know is if he is ready to guarantee, on behalf of 
the government, that they will never exert pressure on the CBC 
to make it alter its news during a future referendum on Quebec 
sovereignty.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
there is a law governing the operation of the CBC, and I will ask 
that the CBC respect that law. The law says, in defining the 
mandate of the CBC, that it must inform people on the 
advantages offered by Canada. This is the reason for the creation 
of the corporation. Objectivity is all we ask for.

education is important. However the money was used instead to

difficult to offer services in English and French, that is in both

minister is going to have a good opportunity today to show how 
well he backs that up. This young lady agreed to drop the sexual

<B><A NAME="5431"> 5431 </A></B>
<P>
assault charges on the condition that  this repeat offender was 
deported which he was in November last year.
<P>
	Now I find this chronic sex offender, this failed refugee 
claimant is back in my community to appear, by invitation from 
this minister's officials, at a second hearing to be allowed to stay 
in Canada.
<P>
	Why is this man even getting a hearing in the first place? Why 
has the government reneged on its promise to keep this criminal 
out of Canada?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not intend to engage on the 
floor of the House of Commons in a case when the member has 
not given me advanced notice of the person's name or the case 
file.
<P>
	The member may not wish to respect the privacy legislation, 
due process. I say again to the hon. member that no one on that 
side has a virtue or a monopoly on virtue about those cases that 
are abhorrent to all Canadians.
<P>
	I will certainly look at the case that the hon. member speaks 
about. Tomorrow we will be putting forward amendments with 
the aim of making it very, very clear that those in the minority 
who abuse will have those loopholes closed. I hope that his party 
looks forward to the speedy passage of that legislation.

	<B>Mr. Jean-Marc Jacob (Charlesbourg):</B> Mr. Speaker, in a 
report released yesterday, the Canadian Committee for the 50th 
Anniversary of the United Nations is proposing the 
implementation and funding by Canada of a peacemaking unit 
which would be at the disposal of the UN to take part in different 
peace missions. This UN rapid intervention standing force 
would particularly be used to prevent conflicts and massacres, 
to protect humanitarian assistance convoys and to maintain 
interposition forces for the enforcement of ceasefires.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs. In the 
context of the review of the Canadian foreign policy and defence 
policies, is the minister in favour of this recommendation to 
create a Canadian peacemaking unit?
<P>
<B>(1450) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, that is a very interesting proposal which will certainly 
be examined on its merits by the parliamentary committee 
mandated to review our foreign policy and defence policies.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Marc Jacob (Charlesbourg):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
greatly appreciate the minister's answer, because it gives some 
leeway to the joint committee on foreign policy review as well 
as the joint committee on defence, and I thank him for it.
<P>
	Can the minister also tell us if he agrees with another proposal 
made by that committee to increase the membership of the UN 
Security Council in order to accept more developing countries?
<P>
	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member must know that, indeed, studies are 
currently being done within the UN Security Council. In fact, at 
the last UN meeting, a special committee was given the mandate 
to review the membership of the Security Council. Several 
proposals are currently being examined.
<P>
	Canada is very interested in a Security Council that would 
better reflect the current reality of the UN, in view of the fact 
that a considerable number of countries have been added since 
the creation of the first Security Council. Canada did not make 
any specific proposal, but we are examining very actively 
different proposals currently under review. When that special 
committee tables its report, Canada will certainly be at the 
forefront of a major reform of the Security Council.

	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration. It is 
further to the question raised by my colleague from Fraser 
Valley West.
<P>
	The minister in the past has told Canadians that these are 
isolated cases, the aeroplane analogy as I call it. I would like 
him to tell that to the young lady anxiously awaiting the results 
of her HIV test while this rapist walks the streets of her 
neighbourhood.
<P>
	My question is this. In Matsqui prison in B.C. today is another 
repeat offender who has been ordered deported nine times. Does 
the minister intend to deport this rapist nine times as well? How 
many innocent citizens must suffer because of government 
incompetence and inaction?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration):</B> Mr. Speaker, it seems the Reform Party takes 
great pleasure in citing cases where it seeks to exploit whereas 
we see cases and we try to fix the system that allows those cases 
to occur.
<P>
	There is a big difference. The gory details, day in and day out, 
give no satisfaction and no pleasure to any member on this side 
as it does not give any pleasure or satisfaction to that side. We 
have laws. We have a process. We also move to deport 
individuals and we have. We will further strengthen that.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5432"> 5432 </A></B>
<P>
	I will give a commitment to look into those individual cases, 
but I refuse to engage on the floor of the House of Commons to 
give out justice Reform Party style.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast):</B> I have a 
supplemental, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	At the present time we are waiting results from consultations 
and studies. I would like to offer the minister the chance to show 
Canadians that his bite is as big as his bark.
<P>
	The hearing for the once deported rapist that my colleague 
referred to will be held at 8.30 a.m. tomorrow. Will this minister 
stop this hearing immediately, deport this individual and 
guarantee Canadians that he will never ever enter Canada again?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration):</B> Mr. Speaker, first, I am not aware of the 
individual case.
<P>
	Second, if the hon. member is as concerned about this case as 
he demonstrates on the floor of the House of Commons, I 
caution him that that excitement can in fact throw the case out 
because he and other members could be in contempt of court.
<P>
	First, why don't you settle down? Maybe you should settle 
down.
<P>
<B>(1455 ) </B>
<P>
	Second, if you do have the case at heart and want to create 
justice, do not be in contempt of court and do not give that 
individual any further legal angles.

	<B>Mr. Bernard Patry (Pierrefonds-Dollard):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have a question for the Minister of Transport. As a result of the 
air embargo against Haiti, Canadian nationals are in a hurry to 
leave the country. However, this morning, we were informed by 
the media that several Canadians, men and women, could not 
leave Haiti even if they had valid return tickets because of an 
airfare increase at Air Canada.
<P>
	What does the minister intend to do to deal with that 
situation?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
I just found out today about the allegations referred to by the 
hon. member. I want to say that we obviously have no control 
over airfares charged by airlines. However, I want to tell all the 
members of this House that we are very concerned by this whole 
issue, if those allegations are founded.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Although we do not have any regulatory power on this 
particular issue, it is with a great degree of sadness that we 
learned of this kind of situation having developed in Haiti, if in 
fact the allegations are correct. We will want to inquire. I am 
sure that the carrier in question will want to explain the facts of 
the situation and make sure that Canadians understand exactly 
what did take place.

	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is 
for the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration. For several 
months now, immigration officers, especially in Montreal and 
Toronto, have been requiring from refugees whose status has 
been recognized by the Immigration and Refugee Board a 
passport from their country of origin. They have been requesting 
those people to contact their embassy or consulate to apply for a 
passport in order for them to review their application for 
permanent resident status.
<P>
	My question is this. Is the minister aware that the demand 
imposed by immigration officers upon refugees whose status 
has been recognized jeopardizes the safety of those people and 
that of their families in their countries of origin?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration):</B> Mr. Speaker, documentation is normally 
required after a refugee is accepted and upon landing. I think it 
would be easily understood that documentation for a number of 
individuals is impossible if in fact they are refugees. If they are 
fleeing from a regime, documentation sometimes is an 
impossibility, which is taken into account.

	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Minister of Justice. We have been told that 
law abiding firearms owners are the primary source of guns used 
in crime because their firearms can be stolen. Accurate 
information regarding the sources of guns for criminals is 
necessary to determine if further firearms controls will reduce 
gun related crime, yet the statistics are unavailable.
<P>
	Will the minister undertake a comprehensive national study to 
determine the source of firearms for criminal activities and will 
he make the information readily available to all Canadians?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Russell MacLellan (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we do not have accurate statistics on the availability of 
firearms for illegal purposes. As the hon. member has said there 
are those who say that most of the firearms that get into the 
<P>

<B><A NAME="5433"> 5433 </A></B>
<P>
hands of criminals are stolen,  but the Official Opposition 
yesterday said that firearms smuggled across the border were 
the main concern.
<P>
	The Ministry of Justice is looking into this. The minister has 
given his undertaking that he will get as much information on 
this question as he possibly can and make it available to the 
House.

	<B>Hon. Audrey McLaughlin (Yukon):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Transport. Recently the minister 
gave an address outlining the government's plans to 
systematically dismantle the transportation system in this 
country. It should have been entitled ``Goodbye to the National 
Dream''. The minister calls his plan commercialization but it is 
clear that he means privatization and it will affect 75 per cent of 
the department's activities.
<P>
	I ask the minister to be clear with Canadians. His policy 
clearly follows the Tory royal commission on transport.
<P>
<B>(1500 ) </B>
<P>
	I would like to ask the minister to explain how his plan to 
commercialize is different from the plan of the Tories to 
privatize which he opposed so vehemently in the last 
Parliament?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I want to assure my hon. colleague that there is no intention to 
dismantle the transportation system. We are trying to ensure that 
an integrated, affordable transportation system is available for 
Canadians to move both people and products.
<P>
	I want to say to my hon. colleague that many people who 
follow the transportation scene will recognize in the 
commercialization approach that we are trying to maintain the 
involvement of the Government of Canada in a supervisory, a 
regulatory, a policy way in the work we are doing in 
transportation. We also understand that business and 
commercial practices have to be applied to the way we 
administer the transportation system.
<P>
	The people who have been around here for some time have 
seen former ministers of transport of a Liberal stripe attempt to 
do these kinds of things. It is not a Tory agenda. It is an agenda 
designed to provide Canada with a transportation system that 
will support the economy that is required to pay for the social 
programs that are at the heart of Liberal policy.

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to ask the deputy government House leader to tell us the 
business for the coming days.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Fernand Robichaud (Secretary of State 
(Parliamentary Affairs)):</B> Mr. Speaker, today, the House will 
continue the debate on Bill C-37, to amend the Young Offenders 
Act. Tomorrow, the House will consider the motion from the 
Minister of Industry to refer Bill C-43, on lobbyists, to 
committee before second reading.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Since much of the business for next week depends on bills 
coming back from committees, scheduling of votes and other ad 
hoc arrangements will be arranged on an ongoing basis of 
interparty consultation.
<P>
	We will want to complete Bill C-28 regarding assistance to 
students, Bill C-30 regarding fisheries workers, Bill C-32 
regarding taxes on tobacco, Bill C-40 the miscellaneous statute 
amendments and Bill C-37 the young offenders bill.
<P>
	We would also like to complete consideration of the two bills 
affecting the Yukon, Bill C-33 and Bill C-34 if they come out of 
committee on time. We will also have to deal with anything else 
left over from this week.
<P>
	Of course, we would also like to discuss completing any other 
bills that my be reported from committee in sufficient time.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleagues, last week we had a question of 
privilege raised by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister 
of Fisheries and Oceans. I am prepared to give my ruling on this. 
Following that, I will give my ruling on the point of order raised 
by the hon. member for Winnipeg Transcona.

	<B>The Speaker:</B> I am now ready to rule on the matter raised last 
Monday, June 13, by the hon. Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans. In his submission, the hon. 
parliamentary secretary sought to clarify a number of issues 
related to allegations made against him by the hon. member for 
Simcoe Centre during Question Period on June 2 and 3, 1994.
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary claimed that, by bringing into 
question his compliance with the federal conflict of interest 
code, the allegations had damaged his credibility and had thus 
impeded his ability to function as a member of this House. The 
parliamentary secretary then informed the House that he had 
complied fully with the conflict of interest code and had 
formally resigned as a director and officer of the company in 
question. The parliamentary secretary also refuted other 
allegations made by the hon. member for Simcoe Centre.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	From the information provided during the exchange and from 
my review of the <I>Debates</I> of June 2 and 3, it would appear to the 
Chair that this is clearly a disagreement as to the facts. I refer the 
hon. members to citation 31(1) of Beauchesne's 6th Edition: ``A 
dispute arising between two Members, as to allegations of facts, 
does not fulfill the conditions of parliamentary privilege''.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	May I also quote from the <I>Journals</I> of June 4, 1975, at page 
600. In a ruling on a case of allegations made by one member 
against another in respect of his conduct, Speaker Jerome 
indicated that ``a dispute as to facts, a dispute as to opinions and 
a dispute as to conclusions to be drawn from an allegation of fact 
is a matter of debate and not a question of privilege''.
<P>
<B>(1520 ) </B>
<P>
	The government House leader pointed out that there have 
been many occasions when members have risen to make 
statements under the guise of a statement of personal privilege 
in order to put on record their understanding of a situation 
involving themselves. As your Speaker, I take these matters 
very seriously and understand the need for members to express 
themselves in these cases. When I intervened during the 
parliamentary secretary's presentation, I felt that he had made 
his point.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Not every matter raised as personal privilege necessarily 
constitutes a basis for a question of privilege. It is incumbent 
upon the Chair to ensure that the time of the House is used 
judiciously, and Members can assist the Chair by being succinct 
in their presentations when bringing such matters to the 
attention of the House.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I would like to thank the hon. government House leader, the 
hon. parliamentary secretary and the hon. member for Simcoe 
Centre for their contributions.
<P>
	My colleagues, I am now prepared to rule on a point of order.

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="NEWDEMOCRATICPARTY-SPEAKER'SRULING">NEW DEMOCRATIC PARTY-SPEAKER'S RULING</A></H4>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> On June 1, 1994, the hon. member for 
Winnipeg Transcona raised a point of order concerning the 
designation of party status for members of the New Democratic 
Party. I would like to thank the hon. member for his detailed and 
well researched presentation, and the hon. members for 
Kingston and the Islands, Laurier-Sainte-Marie and 
Kindersley-Lloydminster for their contributions to the 
discussions.
<P>
	The hon. member for Winnipeg Transcona asked that I 
consider and rule upon the request of the members of the New 
Democratic Party caucus: One, to be designated as New 
Democrats; Two, to be seated together; and three, to be treated 
as a recognized party for certain procedural purposes.
<P>
	I am now ready to rule on that point of order. First, let me deal 
with the question of what constitutes a party for procedural 
purposes, a question which has long preoccupied the House. The 
hon. member for Winnipeg Transcona argued at length that the 
definition of ``recognized party'' in the Parliament of Canada 
Act and the Board of Internal Economy bylaws applies only to 
certain matters of money and allowances. He maintained that 
the definition should not be used to define the meaning of 
``party'' or ``recognized party'' in our standing orders or our 
practice.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	He noted, for example, that Section 50(3) of the <I>Act</I> which 
sets the composition of the Board of Internal Economy makes 
specific reference to a caucus which ``does not have a 
recognized membership of 12 or more''. That reference, he 
claimed, implies the possibility of a caucus without 12 
members, yet identified as such.
<P>
	The hon. member presented detailed accounts of the 
situations which existed in the House of Commons in 1963, 
1966 and 1979 when smaller parties were recognized in various 
ways for purposes of procedure and practice. He also argued that 
the same rights should be extended to members of the New 
Democratic Party today.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5438"> 5438 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Having studied the circumstances of each of these cases and 
having reviewed the rulings referred to by the hon. member as 
well as others touching on this matter, the conclusions I draw are 
quite different.
<P>
	The status granted to minor parties for procedural purposes in 
certain of these cases was the result of the political exigencies of 
the time. In none of these instances did the Chair act 
unilaterally.
<P>
	In his ruling of September 30, 1963, at page 386 of the 
<I>Journals</I>, Speaker Macnaughton, while dealing with the status 
of a New Democratic Party in the House, pointed out that the 
status of a party in the House was for the House itself to decide.
<P>
	Speaker Macnaughton also made two comments which I feel 
are very important and which I would like to quote to the House. 
He said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It is in consequence among the duties of the Speaker to see that the Standing 
Orders of the House are followed in the course of its procedures and that the 
privileges of the House, once they have been defined and recognized, are 
protected. It is also the duty of the Speaker to be impartial and removed from 
politics, which has already been my aim since, honourable members, you did me 
the honour to elect me as your Speaker.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1525 ) </B>
<P>
	I am still quoting Speaker Macnaughton.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It seems to me that having in mind the authorities from Sir Erskine May to 
Lord Campion, from Bourinot to Beauschene, and from Anson to McGregor 
Dawson and many others, a situation such as that now facing the House must be 
resolved by the House itself. It is not one where the Speaker ought by himself to 
take a position where any group of members might feel that their interests as a 
group or a party have been prejudiced. Nor should the Speaker be put in the 
position where he must decide, to the advantage or to the disadvantage of any 
group or party, matters affecting the character of existences of a party, for this 
surely would signify that the Speaker has taken what is almost a political 
decision, a decision where the question involves the rights and privileges of the 
House itself.</BLOCKQUOTE>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In the <I>Journals</I> of February 18, 1966 at page 159, Speaker 
Lamoureux, in the ruling on ministerial statements referred to 
by the hon. member for Winnipeg-Transcona, was loath to 
institute any change in the practices of the House at that time 
and indicated that he would not veer from the contemporary 
practice until such time as the House amended the Standing 
Orders to do otherwise.
<P>
	In October 1979, when the issue of party status was again 
raised, Speaker Jerome returned to the 1963 ruling of Speaker 
Macnaughton to reiterate that this matter is not the 
responsibility of the Speaker to decide but rather, a matter for 
the House. I would draw the attention of members to the words 
of Speaker Jerome on page 69 of the <I>Debates</I> for October 11, 
1979.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In his presentation, the hon. member for Winnipeg Transcona 
quoted from a subsequent ruling of Speaker Jerome given on 
November 6, 1979, and found at page 1009 of the <I>Debates</I>. This 
ruling concerned the Chair's responsibility to protect the rights 
of members of small parties.
<P>
	One of the portions of the ruling quoted only in part by the 
hon. member is worth repeating:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The House will recognize in what I have tried to do, I think both representing 
the spirit of the protection of minorities in the House and also, I think the 
generosity of the House, that what those members are entitled to can be given to 
them with a generosity and a recognition that respects the fact that they are 
members of a political party, so long as it does not give them an advantage that 
they would not otherwise enjoy as five members and, secondly, so long as it does 
not deprive other members of their right to participate in some way.</BLOCKQUOTE>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Yet again, Speaker Jerome declined to go beyond the 
contemporary practices of the House while ensuring that the 
rights of the individual member were protected.
<P>
	This important theme was once again taken up in a ruling by 
Speaker Fraser given on December 13, 1990 and found at pages 
16703 to 16707 in the <I>Debates</I>. At that time the Speaker 
declared in very strong terms that the basic rights and privileges 
of individual members of whatever political persuasion are fully 
protected by the Chair. Stating, on page 16704: ``The Chair 
pledges to do its utmost to continue to serve this House in as 
even-handed and impartial a manner as possible''.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In the current circumstances, the existence of the New 
Democratic Party caucus has not been denied and the Chair will 
continue to ensure that each member of the House is treated 
fairly by the rules.
<P>
	In arguing his case, the hon. member for Winnipeg Transcona 
acknowledged that his party's situation could not be resolved 
without, what he called, ``an appropriate will to discern the 
difference between some previous situations and the situation 
we find ourselves in at the moment''.
<P>
	I find myself agreeing with the hon. member up to a point. In 
my view, what he called ``an appropriate will'' to resolve the 
situation must be found not in your Speaker acting alone but in 
the House acting as a whole.
<P>
<B>(1530) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	As the hon. member for Laurier-Sainte-Marie rightly points 
out, the status of minority parties in the House has always been 
determined in general by the political make-up of the House.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5439"> 5439 </A></B>
<P>
	If the hon. member's argument persuades his colleagues to the 
solutions he seeks, then the House will have to give new 
guidance to the Chair.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As your Speaker and the guardian of the rights of minorities 
and each individual member, I remain fully aware of the grave 
responsibilities of the Chair in this regard. Indeed, an analysis of 
the last two months shows that a member not belonging to a 
recognized party has participated almost every day during the 
period reserved for members' statements and, on the average, 
every other day during question period. The House may be 
assured that I and my deputies pledge to continue to do 
everything we can to facilitate the fair and active participation 
of each member in the work of the House.
<P>
	In my view unilateral action by the Chair would mark a 
significant departure from the interpretation of our rules and 
practices as they have evolved over the last decade. As your 
Speaker and the servant of the House, I believe that I cannot 
arbitrarily impose a new interpretation but must wait until the 
House as it is now constituted indicates to me what, if any, 
action it wishes the Chair to take.
<P>
	Let me now address the two other matters: the designation of 
members as members of the New Democratic Party and their 
wish to be seated together.
<P>
	The hon. member for Winnipeg Transcona complained that 
his party is not designated, as it should be, as a caucus on the 
seating plan of the Chamber. He presented copies of seating 
plans from previous parliaments to support his view. He did, 
however, acknowledge that his party is clearly designated as the 
New Democratic Party in the <I>Debates</I>.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Let us review the current situation. The Members of 
Parliament belonging to the New Democratic Party are 
identified as such in the <I>Debates</I> and on the televised 
proceedings of the House. They are designated as ``others'' in 
the back row to the left of the Speaker on the seating plan of the 
Chamber.
<P>
	Seating arrangements in the House have traditionally been 
decided following negotiations among the recognized parties.
<P>
	The chief government whip places members of the 
government in seats to the right of the Chair and, when there is 
not enough room on the right to accommodate all government 
members, some may also be placed to the left of the Chair.
<P>
	Of the remaining places, the Whip of the Official Opposition 
assigns seats to the members of that party and the whip of the 
third party then assigns seats to members of that party. The 
responsibility for assigning to other members the seats that 
remain vacant has traditionally fallen to the Speaker.
<P>
	To determine the seating arrangements for those members 
who do not belong to a recognized party, the Chair follows the 
order of their seniority as elected members.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In considering the NDP's request, the New Democrats' 
request that they be seated together and that their leader be 
granted the rank due her as a Privy Councillor, I was struck by a 
phrase of the hon. member for Winnipeg Transcona. Explaining 
the timing of his point of order he stated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I thought it was appropriate for the House to become acquainted with itself 
after the unprecedented upheaval of the last election.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I applaud the wisdom of that comment. The Chair has made 
every effort to accommodate members fairly in the present 
situation. Having now been your Speaker for some five months, 
I have received various representations from members of 
Parliament and their constituents on this matter and I have 
carefully reviewed the precedents. For example, on September 
24, 1990, at page 13216 of the <I>Debates</I>, Speaker Fraser noted on 
a ruling dealing with seating arrangements that the Speaker can 
exercise some discretion in these matters. He stated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I also think members should understand that as your Speaker, I have some 
discretion in dealing with the rights of every person in this House who is in a 
minority position. I think we have a great tradition of protecting the rights of 
minorities, and I can assure the hon. member that the rights of minorities will be 
protected by the Speaker in a way that is fair and equitable for all other 
members.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1535) </B>
<P>
	Having concluded that some remedy does lie within the 
purview of the Speaker, I have therefore asked my officials to 
modify the seating plan as of the return of the House on 
September 19 to implement the following changes in the seats 
that the Speaker assigns:
<P>
	(1) The hon. members for Sherbrooke and Saint John will be 
seated together and identified as the Progressive Conservative 
caucus on the seating plan.
<P>
	(2) The hon. members of the New Democratic caucus will also 
be seated together and be identified as such on the plan.
<P>
	(3) The hon. member for Beauce will be identified as 
Independent and the hon. member for 
Markham-Whitchurch-Stouffville will be identified as 
Independent Liberal.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This appears to the Chair to be a fair response to competing 
claims. Members of the same party will be identified and seated 
together, with the precedence of their respective leaders 
determining their place in the sequence. The two other members 
will be assigned the two remaining seats according to their 
seniority and designated according to their express wishes.

	I want to thank the hon. member for Winnipeg Transcona for 
his thoughtful, in-depth presentation. I appreciate the 
contributions of the hon. members for Kingston and the Islands, 
Laurier-Sainte-Marie and Kindersley-Lloydminster. I hope 
the steps I have taken to solve matters within my discretion will 
go some way to remedy the situation. The hon. member for 
Winnipeg Transcona and his caucus colleagues may be assured 
that if the House indicates to me that it has been persuaded by his 
arguments I stand ready to be guided accordingly.

	The House resumed from June 15 consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-37, an act to amend the Young Offenders Act and the 
Criminal Code, be now read a second time and referred to a 
committee, and of the amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata):</B> 
Madam Speaker, 35 years ago, I opted for a career in education, 
specifically in the training of pre-school and primary school 
teachers.
<P>
	I also decided to speak for those who have no voice, the 
children and adolescents who rarely get an opportunity to 
express their views, defend their position or demand their rights. 
Therefore, I am especially pleased to speak today to this debate 
on Bill C-37, An Act to amend the Young Offenders Act and the 
Criminal Code.
<P>
	At the outset, I want the House to know that I fully support the 
amendment proposed by the hon. member for Saint-Hubert who 
is also the justice critic for the official opposition. This overly 
regressive bill should not proceed beyond second reading and 
should be withdrawn by the government.
<P>
	Moreover, the amendment states that the Young Offenders 
Act ``introduces no concrete measure for the rehabilitation of 
young offenders'' and ``does not encourage the provinces to take 
legislative or other measures necessary in order to set up 
comprehensive crime prevention programs''.
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
	I would like to add my voice to those of my colleagues and 
join the broad consensus in Quebec which opposes any attempts 
to make the provisions of the Young Offenders Act more 
stringent. In the time allotted to me, I would like to outline our 
main reasons for opposing this bill.
<P>
	First of all, far be it for me to deny the existence of youth 
crime and violence, much less to minimize the seriousness of 
the problem. In point of fact, vile, unacceptable crimes such as 
premeditated murder are committed by juvenile delinquents. 
The present system acts as a kind of safety valve and works well 
in that the  existing legislation already makes it possible to 
transfer such cases to adult court and to sentence the offenders 
accordingly.
<P>
	During 1992-93, 33 cases involving serious crimes were 
transferred to adult court. The problem is that we do not have the 
data to confirm or invalidate the government's decision to move 
in this direction. As for other serious crimes which can be 
categorized as relational crimes, reintegration into Canadian 
society should be the preferred approach.
<P>
	The legislator showed that social reintegration was one of its 
main concerns, as he clearly stated in the principle of the bill by 
including Paragraphs <I>a</I>) and <I>c</I>.1) in Clause 1, and I quote: 
``Crime prevention is essential to the long-term protection of 
society and requires addressing the underlying causes of crime 
by young persons and developing multi-disciplinary 
approaches to identifying and effectively responding to children 
and young persons at risk of committing offending behaviours in 
the future''. The bill goes on to say: ``The protection of society, 
which is a primary objective of the criminal law applicable to 
youth, is best served by rehabilitation, wherever possible, of 
young persons who commit offences, and rehabilitation is best 
achieved by addressing the needs and circumstances of a young 
person that are relevant to the young person's offending 
behaviour''.
<P>
	Where the shoe pinches is that the legislator's goodwill does 
not extend beyond stating these nice principles. Too bad. The 
Minister of Justice had everything he needed to bring about the 
changes that would have made the youth justice system more 
efficient. He financed a late-February seminar hosted by the 
University of Toronto's criminology centre. This seminar 
brought together a group of experts including academics, 
government officials and professionals working in the field of 
youth justice.
<P>
	The introduction to the final report dated March 28, 1994 says 
that the purpose of the seminar is explicit in its very title, 
``Beyond the Red Book: A Workshop on Recommendations for 
Amendments to the Young Offenders Act''. What is the minister 
proposing to us in his bill? The promises in the red book, and 
nothing that goes beyond this now outdated document. Nothing 
takes into consideration the opinion of the experts who met at 
that seminar to advise the minister-at great expense to the 
taxpayers, need I remind you.
<P>
	They give themselves a clear conscience. They study. They 
consult. But why, I ask you, Madam Speaker, since everything 
was already in the red book. So the essential amendments in this 
bill concern heavier penalties for serious crimes and the 
presumption of referral to adult court.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5441"> 5441 </A></B>
<P>
	A reference document dated May 1994 and published by the 
Department of Justice says that the public is very concerned 
about the need to control youth crime and to protect society. 
Therefore some believe that stricter sentences are the best way 
to deter young people from committing criminal acts.
<P>
<B>(1545) </B>
<P>
	By the way, what does the experts' famous report say about 
stiffer sentences? I quote:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``Variation in dispositional severity will have little, if any, 
impact on crime'' and ``there is no obvious pressure within the 
youth justice system for higher maximum penalties''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In other words, the experts who rely on facts, on their 
experience, on what they see, contradict those who rely on 
perceptions and their own imagination: tougher sentences are 
not the way to reduce youth crime.
<P>
	Faced with this dilemma, what does the minister do? He 
decides not to take the path suggested by his experts. He even 
ignores the fine principles set forth at the beginning of his own 
bill and he opts for more severe sentences. Nevertheless, this 
same document issued by the department says: ``All our efforts 
in criminal justice seek to prevent crime, including youth crime. 
Prosecuting someone who committed a crime may provide some 
comfort to the victim and reassure the public, but it cannot be as 
satisfactory as preventing the crime as such.
<P>
	It is often harder to implement crime prevention programs 
than to merely sue an offender after the fact. Prevention is based 
on the economic, educational, social, moral and legal conditions 
which generate crime and it requires efforts to change those 
conditions. The co-operation of many departments from all 
levels of government, as well as of the private sector and the 
public in general is needed. Making crime prevention programs 
effective is a major challenge. However, the results obtained 
with such programs, namely a reduction in crime, is much more 
beneficial for young people, and also for Canadians who, 
otherwise, might have become victims. Consequently, the 
rehabilitation of young offenders must be a major objective of 
the legislation''.
<P>
	This is an ambitious program. Joint action is necessary. We 
must co-operate with the other governments, the private sector 
and the public. We must change the economic, educational, 
social and moral conditions in our society. We must promote 
awareness, education and tolerance. Together, we must meet the 
challenge of reducing crime because, in the end, it will prove 
more beneficial for everyone.
<P>
	Experts also insist that rehabilitation is more effective outside 
the criminal system. The Canadian Sentencing Commission 
says that 70 per cent of Canadians want more money to be 
allocated to the development of other types of sentence than 
incarceration.
<P>
	Yet, this is not what the minister has decided to do. He prefers 
the easy solution. The challenge was probably too big for his 
government. We must look elsewhere to find out why the 
minister tabled such a bill, especially considering that the 
Young Offenders Act was amended in 1992, precisely to extend 
by three to five years the sentences for violent crimes. Merely 
two years later, when we have not even had a real chance to see if 
the amended act works and to assess its impact, the government 
comes up with new amendments to once again lengthen 
sentences for violent crimes, this time by five to ten years.
<P>
	It seems obvious to me that the government's chief concern, 
in bringing this amendment, is to keep an election promise, 
perhaps made off the cuff by the leader of the Liberal Party 
during the last election campaign when he was being pressured 
with questions in the Reform Party's stronghold. Or perhaps the 
minister bowed to various pressures by trying to please 
everybody, but satisfying no one. The bill does not go far enough 
for hard-liners who want society to be protected at all cost, and 
it also turns a deaf ear to those who would like to maintain the 
status quo and those who support the social reintegration and 
rehabilitation of young offenders.
<P>
	The second important amendment to this bill concerns the 
presumption of transfer to adult court.
<P>
	Youth crime and violence by young people are of real concern 
to the public. But this concern is based on the public's 
perception, not on actual facts. More and more Canadians are 
afraid of rising crime, particularly involving young people, and 
many Canadians feel that the government is not doing enough to 
address this problem.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	In a 1987 report, the Canadian Sentencing Commission noted 
that 75 per cent of the population believed that 30 to 100 per cent 
of crimes were violent crimes.
<P>
	But the reality is quite different. In 1992, for example, only 
one of every ten crimes under the Criminal Code that were 
reported to police was a violent crime. In its background paper, 
the government recognizes that the extent of violent crime in 
Canada is not well known, and that rational responses to 
criminal behaviour among young people should be based on 
facts and not on perceptions. Since 1970, the average number of 
homicides allegedly committed by adolescents has declined 
sharply. The department also tells us that young people between 
the ages of 12 and 18 make up 8 per cent of the population, and 
that about 6 to 9 per cent of suspect investigations in all 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5442"> 5442 </A></B>
<P>
homicide cases in Canada since 1986 have focused on young 
people in that age  group. It is therefore patently false to claim 
that adolescents are more likely than adults to commit murder.
<P>
	To deal with this problem, the government had two options: 
the easy, populist and short-term solution, which included the 
bill before the House today, or stressing the long-term interests 
of the teenager and society and opting for rehabilitation. When a 
young person who has committed a reprehensible act is charged 
and tried by a judge and jury, and especially if he is sentenced to 
life imprisonment, it may be some consolation for the victim or 
the victim's family and it may be reassuring for society. 
However, what does society gain by sentencing a young person 
whom we might be able to rehabilitate through community 
reintegration? What do we gain by sentencing a young person to 
closed custody or imprisonment, a school for crime with no 
drop-outs and where good attendance increases the risk of 
recidivism?
<P>
	Nothing at all, Madam Speaker. Statistics show that only13 per cent of young people are responsible for violent crimes, 
while this was 22 per cent for the 18 to 25 group and 33 per cent 
for the 25 to 34 group.
<P>
	According to the experts, the minister should have gone 
beyond the red book, because the main problem with the Young 
Offenders Act is not the act itself but the administration of 
justice.
<P>
	For instance, it is a fact that the crime resolution rate is very 
low. The average for all types of crimes is around 29 per cent. 
Another administrative problem is the time it takes for the court 
to hand down the sentence. It takes far too long, especially when 
we are talking about teenagers, where time is a very important 
factor. When the time lapsed between the crime and sentencing 
is too long, this tends to erode the causal link between the two 
events and consequently undermines the credibility of the adults 
who make the decisions that alter the course of their lives.
<P>
	Our so-called civilized and industrialized world has no 
initiation rites to mark the passage from childhood to adulthood. 
Instead, we invented adolescence. What are the messages 
teenagers get from our society? You are too big to be a child and 
too small to be an adult. You have to settle for being a teenager. 
You have to meet standards of acceptable behaviour. You have to 
go to school, because you are too young to work. You have to go 
on welfare, because there are no jobs.
<P>
	Between the ages of 14 and 18, teenagers experience a major 
identity crisis. They are trying to find themselves. They want to 
test the limits of society. They need understanding, support, 
supervision, explanations, information, education, training, but 
they are often left alone with a list of instructions. In other cases, 
they are often exposed to confrontation and violence.
<P>
	I have heard some quite remarkable speeches in this House on 
traditional family values and the need to subsidize women in the 
home to allow them to raise their children. But those same 
members were among the first  to call for more repression, more 
punishment and stricter standards. Have we forgotten that 
children do not come into this world as delinquents and that the 
environment in which they were raised has made them what they 
are? Are we overlooking the fact that we are the sum of our 
experiences? Are we trying to disclaim all responsibility for the 
mess we have made?
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	I am disappointed, even sad. Sad because we do not seem to 
care about working to improve our collective well-being. We 
have the power to save our children, but we are choosing to put 
them in jail. Yet, are not parents responsible for their children 
until they reach 18? Then, why not consider alternatives like the 
ones suggested by the expert panel? For example, we could have 
added the option of imposing a suspended sentence, which 
would protect our society and give young persons a chance to 
prove their willingness to modify their behaviour.
<P>
	To improve the delivery of justice we could have considered a 
better co-operation between the Crown and the defence, in order 
to reach a decision best suited for the accused. Personally, I 
think that the probation officer could have been involved, to find 
alternatives to prison.
<P>
	To conclude, amendments to an act will never make up for not 
enforcing of that act properly. The federal minister is 
responsible for the Young Offenders Act, but its application 
comes under provincial jurisdiction. To reach his objective, 
better youth justice administration, the minister should have 
involved the provinces in the legislative review process.
<P>
	He did not do that and that goes to show, in my opinion, that he 
is not looking for an effective, long-term solution, but rather for 
a short-term, popular solution, even if it is counter-productive. 
Once again, the federal government demonstrates that it has but 
one concern: to centralize. It follows its own course, 
irrespective of the good of the children of Quebec, among 
others.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Karygiannis (Scarborough-Agincourt):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I have been working on amendments to the Young 
Offenders Act since the day I was elected. Some of the 
comments made by my hon. colleague across the way I certainly 
could not comprehend.
<P>
	This particular act we are dealing with was first tested in 1985 
when a young individual in my riding killed three people: a 
mother, a father and their seven-year old daughter. The young 
offender received three years in total. There are no words to 
describe the feelings of my constituents.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5443"> 5443 </A></B>
<P>
	What I am hearing from the hon. member is that the Liberal 
Party wants to appease the Reform. I do not think the Liberal 
Party brought these changes about because of the Reform Party. 
For a long time the Liberal Party has been a beacon for changes 
to the Young Offenders Act. Certainly I disagree with what my 
colleague is saying.
<P>
	My colleague is saying that in a civilized world we should 
have something which is called an adolescent. This young 
individual who snuffed three lives was not an adolescent; he had 
already moved into the adult world. He committed a crime. As 
the saying goes: You do the crime, you pay the time.
<P>
	I heard with great interest my hon. colleague saying that we 
do not need prisons, that we need rehabilitation. I quite agree we 
need rehabilitation.
<P>
	What in the hon. member's view should a young offender get 
for committing a severe crime, such as a killing or a rape? Do we 
say: ``You are a nice adolescent so don't worry about it. We will 
give you a pat on the back because you are not old enough to do 
it'', or: ``You did the crime, you pay the time''?
<P>
	Closer to home, if a young offender were to kill a member of 
the hon. member's family, how would she want to see justice 
served? What kind of time would that young offender be paying?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata):</B> 
Madam Speaker, it must be understood that I never said that 
teenagers, including criminals, were all very nice individuals. 
Let us not get carried away.
<P>
	I think that it is extremely important to realize that there are 
around two million teenagers in Canada and that the member is 
talking about something that happened three years ago in his 
riding. One out of two million, that is not a lot to justify 
amending an act. According to statistics, over the past 20 years, 
around 46 teenagers a year commit odious crimes.
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	The example given by my colleague clearly proves that the 
problem is not with the act or sentencing, but with the 
enforcement of the legislation. If, in his riding, this odious 
murderer had been tried in adult court, as allowed under the 
present legislation, he would have been sentenced accordingly. 
He would have received a life sentence, Madam Speaker, not 
three years.
<P>
	It must be understood that once again, the member, with his 
question, is providing me with a beautiful opportunity to make 
my point, a point which is in keeping with the question he asked 
me.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul E. Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby):</B> 
Madam Speaker, my colleague in her speech mentioned that the 
preamble of the amendments to the Young Offenders Act falls 
very short. What does my colleague from Quebec say about what 
should be the balance  between the needs of the victim and the 
needs of the offender as outlined in the preamble as to the 
general direction the act should be administered?
<P>
	I noticed the word ``victim'' is not mentioned at all in the 
preamble. I would like her views on the balance between 
victim's needs and offender's needs, especially as it should be 
outlined in the preamble of the Young Offenders Act.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay:</B> Madam Speaker, I think we need to make a 
distinction between the various types of crimes. There are the 
serious, horrible and unacceptable crimes, which should be 
dealt with before adult courts, as stipulated in the current 
legislation.
<P>
	Now, for all the other types of crimes, we know that the 
majority of crimes committed by young people are property 
offences. The most important thing is to find a way to allow the 
young offenders to directly compensate their victims. Let me 
give you an example.
<P>
	If we were to ask a 14- or 15-year-old who broke into my 
house to mow my lawn for a whole summer, I think that might 
serve as compensation for the crime and as a constant reminder 
to the offender of what he did wrong. That could improve 
relations in our society. I would probably lock my doors while 
he mowed the lawn, but still there may be some innovative 
alternatives to intolerance and repression.
<P>
	Teenagers and children are victims. They were not born this 
way. We have to understand that they are not totally responsible 
for their actions. The economic and social conditions in which 
we have them live and the school situation they find themselves 
in have a significant impact on the lives of 14- to 18-year-olds. 
When they need to identify with someone, there is no one 
around: their fathers are gone, their mothers have new 
boyfriends or vice versa. They change home every week, they 
never live at the same place, they have problems at school. We 
built them huge schools  where they  do not  feel  as  though they 
belong. All of these things make life very difficult for our young 
people. That is why they are constantly testing society to see 
what is allowed and what is forbidden.
<P>
	The more innovative and tolerant we are towards young 
offenders, in order to give them the opportunity to right the 
wrongs they did, the better their chances for rehabilitation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I want to congratulate the member for 
Rimouski-Témiscouata. I think she understands the problem 
of young offenders and she presented the issue quite well.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5444"> 5444 </A></B>
<P>
	The member is also surely aware, from what the Minister of 
Justice has said, that he wants to address this issue in two steps: 
the first step being the amendments which he proposed last week 
and which are being undertaken, as you said so well, without 
first knowing the results of the 1992 amendments. The Act is 
therefore being reworked again before those results are even 
known. The second step will take the form of large-scale 
consultations on the entire young offenders issue, possibly 
resulting in a report to the Committee on Justice and Legal 
Affairs, along with proposed amendments to the Young 
Offenders Act. This is just one more snag for the Young 
Offenders Act, which was passed in 1984.
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
	I have two questions for the member, Madam Speaker, which 
can be answered quickly. First of all, does the member find this 
to be a normal process in dealing with an issue as important as 
young offenders? Second, do this process and the amendments 
proposed by the minister-although she did touch on this point 
in her address-conform to Quebec's expectations concerning 
this issue, and in particular the expectations communicated very 
clearly to the federal justice minister by the National Assembly 
and the provincial minister of justice?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay:</B> I thank my colleague for his congratulations 
and his two questions. The process seems quite abnormal to me. 
If the minister had made a career in the same field as I did, and if 
he had applied for a grant to bring new amendments without first 
awaiting the results of a previous amendment, he would never 
have got the grant. It makes absolutely no sense to make 
amendments without really knowing the results of previous 
amendments.
<P>
	In my opinion, therefore, since this is a two-stage process, it 
would be logical for the minister to be patient, wait for the 
second stage and postpone his bill for the time being. He is 
sending us on vacation but not sending our young people to jail 
as he does with this bill. The presumption of transfer to adult 
court is a problem that will increase the enforcement 
requirements of this Act, although he seems to say somewhere 
between the lines that it will be possible, for anyone so inclined, 
not to follow the Act and perhaps to circumvent it.
<P>
	Now, as for Quebec's position, the only thing I find to cheer 
about in this bill, if one can say anything good about it, is that it 
gives me one more argument in favour of voting for Quebec 
sovereignty. Once again, the federal government is turning a 
deaf ear to Quebec concerning an Act that, while it could always 
be improved, is working very well in Quebec. The federal 
government will not win points in Quebec by making 
amendments such as these. It is showing us again that we have 
one more reason to leave this country which is not ours.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew (Secretary of State (Training 
and Youth)):</B> Madam Speaker, I am pleased to rise and speak 
today in support of the government's recent actions to crack 
down on violent young offenders who commit serious crimes.
<P>
	As a preamble to my speech, we all have responsibilities in 
this country that we should not predicate the effectiveness of 
programs on what our political agendas are. I think we have a 
responsibility for the young people of this country and this piece 
of legislation and the amendments are clearly to address the 
needs that are there.
<P>
	I am happy to be a member of Parliament and a contributing 
member so to speak who will perhaps add to a healthy debate and 
make viable suggestions that would fortify the country, bring 
people together and carve out a future for young people in this 
country rather than talk about some rather destructive means 
that would not bring any enjoyment or any good health to the 
country such as it is.
<P>
	I am pleased that on June 2 the Minister of Justice tabled 
amendments to the Young Offenders Act. These amendments 
recognize the public's growing concern about youth violence 
and demonstrate the priority this government places on 
protecting the public.
<P>
	These amendments, by shifting the onus on young people to 
take responsibility for their violent crimes, sends a strong signal 
to young people that their actions carry serious consequences. 
We are a country that basically wants Canadians to know that we 
all have a responsibility for our country and consequently for 
our actions.
<P>
<B>(1610 ) </B>
<P>
	However, as the Minister of Justice made clear, legislation is 
only one part of the answer to violence among young people. 
Protecting the public is the primary and necessary objective but 
we must focus our attention on helping our young people if we 
are to find lasting and effective solutions to youth crime.
<P>
	I am encouraged to see that the amendments to the Young 
Offenders Act include provisions for the rehabilitation and 
treatment of young offenders in the community. There are many 
complex questions surrounding youth crime, questions that the 
Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs will be 
examining as part of the reform of the youth justice system.
<P>
	I welcome the opportunity to work with my colleagues in the 
House to take action on the contributing factors to crime and 
violence such as unemployment, poverty, alcoholism, drug and 
substance abuse, family violence, racism and illiteracy.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5445"> 5445 </A></B>
<P>
	This is not to say that any of those factors justifies any kind of 
violent crimes or should contribute to saying that young people 
have the right to commit crimes. These are mitigating factors. 
These are things that make it very difficult for young people to 
have a life that is well, a life that is healthy and a life that keeps 
them from the negative side of life, so to speak.
<P>
	Socioeconomic misery and crime are two sides of the same 
coin. By addressing these problems in our society we will be 
tackling the root causes of youth crime and ultimately adult 
crime. It does not take any stretch of the imagination to see how 
such socioeconomic misery fuels anger, frustration, anti-social 
behaviour and criminal activity among young people.
<P>
	I would like the House to consider the adverse conditions that 
many of our aboriginal youth face as they walk through the 
perilous path to adulthood. Unemployment among aboriginal 
people is twice the Canadian level. It is the number one problem 
facing aboriginal communities and they have the lowest 
incomes of anyone in the country.
<P>
	The illiteracy rate among aboriginal people is twice the 
national average. High school dropout rates can be as high as95 per cent in isolated northern communities; 57.7 per cent of 
aboriginal people are under the age of 24. The aboriginal 
population is very young, growing fast and on the move.
<P>
	The majority of aboriginal peoples do not live on reserves and 
the migration of on-reserve aboriginal peoples to urban centres 
particularly in western Canada is increasing. In Manitoba it is 
estimated that one out of four new entrants into the job market 
will be of aboriginal origin. In Saskatchewan it will be one out 
of three.
<P>
	Are they destined for a life of unemployment, social 
problems, crime? The odds seem stacked against them but this 
need not be the case. Five to six times the number of aboriginal 
peoples are incarcerated in provincial and federal institutions as 
compared with aboriginal peoples in the general population. Yet 
aboriginal peoples only represent approximately 3.7 per cent of 
the Canadian population.
<P>
	The state of many aboriginal peoples in Canada is not a pretty 
picture. Despite these socioeconomic problems, progress has 
been made in health, education, economic community 
development and social services.
<P>
	Such progress is often linked to aboriginal peoples having 
culturally appropriate services controlled by aboriginal peoples. 
I am proud to be a part of a government that recognizes the 
enormous potential that our young people have to offer and that 
is prepared to invest in their abilities and to give them hope and 
opportunities for the future.
<P>
	This government has implemented a number of programs and 
services we feel will help aboriginal youth and other youth as 
well recognize their strengths and  grow to their full potential 
and to see the sun on the horizon in an optimistic manner.
<P>
	I, as Secretary of State for Training and Youth, and the 
Minister of Human Resources Development have announced a 
youth strategy. This strategy will attack some of the root causes 
for turning youth into young offenders.
<P>
	In my riding last month we made a contribution to a youth 
program with the Gwich'in people. The Gwich'in people have 
taken it upon themselves to build their own healing centre, to 
deal with many of their social and justice issues, many of their 
health issues. They have done so along with the partnership they 
are building with people who have the expertise in and outside 
their own communities.
<P>
<B>(1615 ) </B>
<P>
	Last month we announced 37 projects as part of the first wave 
of Youth Service Canada. We believe it is necessary to send a 
signal that young people can contribute to rather than take away 
from their communities. Many think of young people very 
negatively because young offenders tend to get all the stories, all 
the ink. The news media always covers them. However many 
young people are doing wonderful things but are not being 
celebrated or recognized.
<P>
	Youth Service Canada aims to help 18 to 24-year olds gain 
work experience, develop their skills, learn good work habits 
and improve their self-esteem through community service 
projects. Youth Service Canada should provide opportunities for 
youth to break away from the socioeconomic factors which have 
held them back and have seduced some to become involved in a 
life of crime.
<P>
	Recently I attended the University of Calgary's graduation for 
its native students. It has graduated 18 native students with 
university degrees, some of them with a Bachelor of Social 
Work, some of them with a Bachelor of Education. A young 
woman graduated with an engineering degree. Those young 
people are very healthy models of outstanding citizens who will 
help their communities and this country.
<P>
	So far it is not all bad news. These 18 students from the 
University of Calgary graduated under the leadership ofMr. George Callion who works with native students across Canada. 
He works on the Calgary Police Commission and contributes in a 
number of ways.
<P>
	It takes leadership. It takes caring. It takes generosity. These 
must be expressed to our young people to encourage them and to 
let them know that the government cares and the people in their 
communities care. We must let them know that we in this House 
care about them and are directing our efforts to deal with those 
things.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5446"> 5446 </A></B>
<P>
	Thus far from all the colleges and universities across Canada, 
there have been 92,000 aboriginal graduates. That is quite a 
huge cadre of professionals who will contribute in some way to 
their communities.
<P>
	On Monday the Edmonton <I>Journal</I> featured the graduation of 
native law students. Five or six of them were pictured on the 
front. I know most of them, but the one that leaped out at me was 
none other than Mr. Brad Enge from the Northwest Territories. 
He is a native student and a 20-year veteran of the RCMP who 
has contributed to his community and his country. He is a proud 
Canadian who has worked hard for law and order. He is a proud 
Canadian who has worked for the young people in his 
community. He is a model for these young people.
<P>
	That is how it is done. Success is the way in the native 
communities to bring further successes. These 92,000 graduates 
thus far, along with the law students who were pictured on the 
front page of the Edmonton Journal are the way to go.
<P>
	There is more than one way to deal with young offenders, the 
whole issue of social justice and a number of other justice issues 
as well. There is rehabilitation but there is also the way of 
leadership, young people who set an example as those people 
will do.
<P>
	Part of the consultations on the concept of Youth Service 
Canada had me in contact with many youth across Canada. I met 
with hundreds of groups. We talked about all the bad things 
which are happening.
<P>
	I had the occasion to go to the SkyDome stadium in Toronto. 
There were 50,000 young people accompanied by their teachers. 
They were celebrating what they called the journey of hope. It 
was a positive celebration to show that Canada's young people 
are not just involved in crimes. They are doing many wonderful 
things.
<P>
	I have attended many graduations across the country, many of 
which involved aboriginal youth, but many of which involved 
ordinary Canadian citizens.
<P>
<B>(1620 ) </B>
<P>
	It is positive and wonderful to see people doing something 
constructive for which they get no credit. I wanted to celebrate 
that with my hon. colleagues.
<P>
	Speaking about the Youth Service Canada I believe that every 
department and crown corporation will do its part to forge those 
partnerships which will produce healthier and better 
contributing young people across Canada.
<P>
	In the Dene language we have what is called Dene Tulu. It is 
the path you walk on and the path you walk on is the path of your 
own choosing. We have integrated that as one stream into the 
youth services corps because of the young people who have been 
marginalized or have been left out, who have dropped out of 
school and have given up learning and are out of the labour 
market. Essentially, they become so marginalized they drop out  
of life. We need to rebuild their confidence. We have to get them 
back to work and back to learning.
<P>
	This stream called the Dene Tulu or Tulu would have them 
contributing. Whether the path you choose is good or bad is 
really up to you. That is the Dene form of justice. Tulu is one of 
our four guiding themes for Youth Service Canada to look at 
directly assisting those young offenders who are in community 
based rehabilitation programs.
<P>
	Young offenders were also prominent at some of our 
consultations across Canada, along with the disabled and the 
homeless youth. Youth Service Canada is one part of the 
government's actions to help young people to make the 
transition from school to the workforce or to reintegrate into 
society.
<P>
	We could talk about the many attempts which the government 
has put forward. We have put forward a youth strategy and a 
youth internship program. We have been discussing the changes 
to the Canada student loans program. They will help young 
people to participate positively in their learning for future jobs 
they will engage in for nation building. There are exercises in 
their communities at the community and regional levels.
<P>
	For that reason part of the youth internship approach is 
industry driven and involves the sectors of automotive repair, 
logistics, environment, electrical manufacturing, horticulture 
and tourism. Aboriginal youth will benefit from the youth 
internship, acquiring the hands-on knowledge and skills 
required in today's workforce.
<P>
	The success of all our young people as they step into the adult 
world is crucial not only for their own self-esteem but also for 
the well-being and prosperity of society as a whole. The 
government stay in school aboriginal campaign is using 
innovative methods to increase public awareness and spur 
community action to reverse the appalling trend of having 
young people drop out of school, to the tune of 95 per cent in 
some areas as I have indicated.
<P>
	A lot of discussion that preceded these amendments to the 
Young Offenders Act focused on violent crime and a need to get 
tough with young criminals. However let us not lose sight of the 
fact that less than 20 per cent of the youth crimes are violent 
acts. Of course they get most of the attention. It is very 
unfortunate and very negative that that is what usually gets a lot 
of the ink and the air time.
<P>
	Let us not lose sight of the fact that less than 20 per cent are 
violent acts. Most youth crimes are property and alcohol related. 
Getting tough and throwing these young people behind bars is 
not necessarily the best answer in these situations. We are not 
saying that leniency is the answer. We are saying that perhaps 
there are other ways of forging relationships and partnerships 
that will help to reconstruct and rebuild communities.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5447"> 5447 </A></B>
<P>
	We as parents have a responsibility. When a child is born and 
when a young child leaves the house to go to kindergarten, you 
do not know how that child will turn out. But if you do not do 
your level best, if you do not do everything in your power as a 
responsible member of the community to provide the nurturing, 
love and guidance for that child, it is almost guaranteed that you 
are sealing the fate of that child to a life of negativity and 
downfall. Even if you do everything right there is no guarantee 
but if you do not do anything to help young people you are 
almost sealing their fate to a life that is not very positive.
<P>
<B>(1625 ) </B>
<P>
	I encourage all the people who affect young people in the 
communities. It takes one person to make a positive impact on 
your life. That person could be a counsellor, an RCMP officer, a 
teacher. That person could be a friend, an aunt, or an uncle. 
Somebody to be there to reach out and encourage a young person 
is what it takes sometimes.
<P>
	Remember, the responsibility is not just in legislation or 
amendments. The responsibility is the relationship we forge as 
members of this wonderful country, members of our wonderful 
and diverse communities, that contribute to making life better 
for everyone.
<P>
	We have a responsibility for Canada's future which is going to 
be drawn out through the young people whom we nurture, guide 
and teach. Government and all of the governance we leave 
behind is in their hands. We have an onerous responsibility, but 
if we do nothing, we will reap nothing.
<P>
	I appeal to all Canadians to remember that laws are guides. 
They guide us. We work in the highest court in the land. We are 
building, remaking and changing laws, but we cannot legislate 
caring, loving and nurturing, the things that we have to give to 
ensure that the situation with young offenders is abated.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River):</B> Madam Speaker, the 
secretary of state talked about a crackdown in this legislation 
which is coming forward. I certainly would like to know what 
type of crackdown is being proposed.
<P>
	A constituent who has written to me, Mr. Forsen, talks about 
the need for tougher penalties. This gentleman is a grandfather. 
His two grandsons are repeat offenders and all they got was a 
slap on the wrist. He is afraid to leave home because he has been 
robbed by these two grandsons in the past.
<P>
	I want to know what kind of crackdown the hon. member is 
speaking of here? She has suggested that only 25 per cent of the 
acts are violent, but I would put those I mentioned in that violent 
class as robberies were involved. Can the hon. member explain 
to concerned Canadians what type of crackdowns are being 
proposed?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Blondin-Andrew:</B> Madam Speaker, this is directly from 
the news release of the Minister of Justice who tabled the 
amendments on the Young Offenders Act.
<P>
	The highlights of the bill include: increased sentences for 
teenagers convicted of first or second degree murder in youth 
court to ten and seven years respectively; dealing with 16 and 
17-year olds charged with serious personal injury offences in 
adult court, unless they can show a judge that public protection 
and rehabilitation can both be achieved through youth court; and 
extending the time that 16 and 17-year old young offenders who 
have been convicted of murder in an adult court must serve 
before they can be considered for parole.
<P>
	The bill also includes: improved measures for information 
sharing between professionals, like school officials and police 
with selected members of the public when public safety is at 
risk; retaining the record of serious young offenders; provisions 
that will encourage rehabilitation and treatment of young 
offenders in the community when this is appropriate.
<P>
	This does not necessarily speak to the question the member 
asked. I do believe in the various communities that will be 
affected by this legislation there are people, for example the 
provincial and territorial justice ministers, who are looking at 
attempts to better deal with young offenders in their own regions 
and provinces. That might include community service work for 
example.
<P>
	One suggestion has proved to be quite viable in the aboriginal 
community. Young offenders have been sent out on the land to 
do hard physical labour in camps. They have had to cut wood, 
haul water and do a lot of physical work. It has been found that 
the recidivism rate with those young offenders is virtually nil. It 
is not necessarily boot camp. They learn something. They learn 
how to survive. They learn coping skills. They regain their 
self-esteem. Those are the kinds of ideas that are being 
entertained and I do not find them totally offensive if they are 
coupled with other positive rehabilitative measures.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis):</B> Madam Speaker, I welcome this 
opportunity, as the Official Opposition critic for Training and 
Youth, to question my counterpart, the Secretary of State 
(Training and Youth). As a courtesy, I had agreed to change my 
speaking schedule, and I am not sure this will suit the hon. 
member opposite, because she has given me a golden 
opportunity to talk about the Youth Service Corps which was the 
subject of the first part of her speech. I will start with a comment 
and then ask a few questions.
<P>
	The employment and learning strategy includes the Youth 
Service Corps, but I would like to point out that this year, only 
2,500 young people across Canada will be able to take advantage 
of this initiative, while we have 400,000 young people across 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5448"> 5448 </A></B>
<P>
Canada who are unemployed. It depends on the age group, 
because if we  look at the 16 to 30 group, as we do in Quebec, we 
could say there are 600,000 young people who are unemployed.
<P>
	So 2,500 does not have much impact. When we realize that of 
the $10,000 spent on each young person in the Youth Service 
Corps, about $4,000 goes to administration, there is only 6,000 
left. It all depends. There are some variants in the pilot projects, 
and incidentally, in Quebec, pilot projects tend to be found in 
Liberal ridings, in most cases, although in Laval, there are two 
Bloc ridings and one Liberal-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> It was a mistake.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dubé:</B> It was probably a mistake. So there is a 
coincidence, and I do not know whether in Western Canada our 
Reform colleagues may wish to help us out on this, there are not 
many, but they tend to be in ridings that are carefully chosen. 
The Secretary of State says the program will also be used to 
rehabilitate offenders, and I do not mind, but when they 
announced this plan, it was supposed to be about jobs.
<P>
	I wish she would try and convince me, and I would also like to 
ask her about the $150 per week, because I remember that 
initially it was $61 per week for those living with their families, 
and it went up to $121. She talked about partnership and 
consultation when she came to Quebec City. I heard she was 
coming the day she came, so it was too late for me to be invited. 
Another point is that to finance this Youth Service strategy, the 
government is taking funds intended for existing programs, 
including women's programs, which means that the government 
is more or less robbing Peter to pay Paul. Is this the kind of 
attitude the Liberal government wants to take? So I listened very 
patiently to the Secretary of State, but quite frankly, she has yet 
to convince us that she made a very positive presentation on the 
subject before the House today.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Blondin-Andrew:</B> Madam Speaker, I am not sure that I 
would ever be capable of convincing the hon. member to believe 
anything the federal government does. I am sure he will 
recognize that since we have been in government there has been 
a boost in the economy. We have created 183,000 jobs since we 
were elected. Sixty-six thousand of those jobs have gone to 
Quebec. We have just had the signing of the infrastructure 
program recently.
<P>
	Our youth initiative is an initial first step. We believe that this 
is one way to stimulate a very downtrodden and a very cynical 
group of young people who have been marginalized. We do not 
feel in the five and half months we have been in office we have 
had enough time to do all of the things we should do.
<P>
	The hon. member spoke about consultation. This from the 
party that did not agree with us interfering jurisdictionally by 
bringing forward this program. We had nothing but headaches 
and heartaches from its members. Now they want into the 
program. I am glad. Any time the hon. member wants to put 
forward a  proposal I would be more than happy to receive it. I 
would be happy to meet with him outside the Chamber to discuss 
this program. I would also be happy to discuss all of the other 
programs we have.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	The opposition members know we are having a very difficult 
time. We are streamlining, restructuring and in some cases 
collapsing boards and getting rid of programs that duplicate 
other services. This will allow us to reallocate for other positive 
purposes such as the youth service corps. We managed to 
maintain a level of service that is adequate for the public.
<P>
	I do not really know what the hon. member is complaining 
about. However, I am certainly willing to work with him in the 
future on all of these initiatives.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I listened closely to what the Secretary of State for 
Training and Youth said. I think that she understands the 
problem well, particularly in a riding like mine where there 
really is a problem with young native offenders. I think her 
analysis of the situation was excellent.
<P>
	I would like the hon. secretary of state to tell us however, with 
regard to social rehabilitation and reintegration-because I am 
sure she has ascertained with the Minister of Justice that it 
does-if indeed this aspect is covered in the bill. I am quite sure 
she did check because the minister alluded, albeit 
half-heartedly, to rehabilitation or reintegration. I would like to 
know where in the bill this aspect is emphasized. Is it 
emphasized by imposing stiffer sentences? By reversing the 
burden of the proof? How exactly does the bill provide for the 
reintegration of young offenders into society?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Blondin-Andrew:</B> Madam Speaker, this whole issue of 
young offenders is not an either/or. We are attempting to create a 
balance within the justice system, especially as it pertains to 
young offenders.
<P>
	We are looking at some rehabilitative measures. We are not 
going to lock up young people and throw away the key. We know 
that the costs for incarceration are prohibitive.
<P>
	I know that because in my riding, and the hon. member for 
Kenora-Rainy River can attest to it, we had the highest rate of 
recidivism, of repeaters. We know what it costs to keep people 
incarcerated for long periods of time. The upkeep costs are 
prohibitive. The Minister of Justice and other members are 
attempting to create a balance to address the issues of violent 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5449"> 5449 </A></B>
<P>
crimes committed by young offenders and still maintain a 
section for rehabilitation.
<P>
	As I indicated, the Department of Justice is not the only 
department that has that responsibility. Communities, parents, 
regions, provinces as well as hon. members in the House have a 
responsibility to contribute in a positive way.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Forseth:</B> Madam Speaker, on a point of order. I wonder if 
I may have the unanimous consent of the House to ask just one 
brief question of my colleague?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Does the hon. member 
have the unanimous consent of the House?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul E. Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby):</B> 
Madam Speaker, can my colleague advise the House on behalf of 
the government if aboriginal young offenders need special 
attention for those likely to receive a custody sentence? Is the 
required denunciation of custody different for native young 
offenders?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Blondin-Andrew:</B> Madam Speaker, I believe there is 
equal application of the law for young offenders. Because of the 
rate of recidivism and the higher rates of incarceration for 
aboriginal people generally, as I indicated, the rate of 
incarceration exceeds the population for men in particular. I am 
not sure that pertains to young offenders but I would venture it 
would be very close.
<P>
	Having said that, I do not think there is any special treatment. 
If there is any special treatment it is to create equality not to 
create inequality. There are such inconsistencies and such 
marginalization right now that there is definitely a 
constitutional disadvantage applied to young aboriginal people.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis):</B> Madam Speaker, I welcome this 
opportunity to speak to Bill C-37 as to Opposition critic for 
Training and Youth. Two principles are set out in the first clause 
of this bill which are worth repeating first, crime prevention is 
essential to an orderly society and second, young persons should 
not be held accountable for their behaviour as adults, but must 
nonetheless bear responsibility for their actions. These 
principles go along the same lines as points made by other 
Official Opposition members.
<P>
	Bill C-37 refers to crime prevention, yet it contains nothing 
but repressive measures. It would seem that rehabilitation for 
young offenders is dependent upon coercion and imprisonment. 
Transferring to adult court 16- and 17- year olds charged with 
serious crimes is not in keeping with the stated principle that 
young persons should not be held accountable as adults. Yet this 
transfer procedure is a major feature of Bill C-37.
<P>
	Amendments are introduced in clauses 3 and 8, whereby 16- 
and 17- year olds charged with criminal offenses causing death 
or serious injuries would systematically be proceeded against in 
adult court. The onus is on the young person to apply to be tried 
before a youth court judge.
<P>
	Also, 16- and 17- year olds charged with assault causing 
severe bodily harm will have to convince the court they should 
be proceeded against in youth court, or else they will be tried in 
adult court. It used to be up to the Crown to decide whether to 
transfer the young person or not. A transfer procedure is now in 
place for young people aged 14 and up, and it is up to the Court 
to demonstrate that adult court is the only court qualified to hear 
serious cases.
<P>
	So different age groups are treated differently by the courts. 
Those between 12 and 15 will not be treated the same as 16- and 
17-year-olds if they commit serious crimes. Some lawyers will 
undoubtedly argue that this violates the right to equality before 
the law as provided for in Section 15 of the Canadian Charter of 
Rights and Freedoms.
<P>
	Now on to psychological and medical considerations. Clause 
4 of Bill C-37 would allow the courts to direct that teenage 
repeat offenders undergo psychological or medical 
examinations. At the present time, such examinations are 
allowed only if the court has reasonable grounds to believe that a 
young person may be suffering from a psychological disorder. 
Young repeat offenders are regarded as mentally ill rather than 
as normal human beings damaged by their living conditions. 
This clause also has a legal dimension. Requiring a person to 
undergo a psychiatric assessment based on their criminal record 
may violate basic rights in the Charter.
<P>
	This measure is troubling because some provinces like 
Alberta, Manitoba and Saskatchewan do not have a system to 
look after young people in trouble. Youth custody conditions 
and their administration come under provincial jurisdiction. 
These young people may be the victims of some provinces' lack 
of supervision resources and end up spending more time in adult 
jails.
<P>
	It is not normal for a court to bypass the reasonable grounds 
prescription to send a young person to a psychiatric institution 
for assessment. These psychological reports could be disclosed 
to third parties, which may violate the principle of 
confidentiality for teenagers' records.
<P>
	This disclosure of records is expanded upon in Bill C-37, 
which calls for a better exchange of information on young 
offenders between the various police forces, school authorities 
and social workers involved. We must ensure that this exchange 
of information is restricted, because the public and the media 
are getting more and more interested in young offenders, so that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5450"> 5450 </A></B>
<P>
the principle of confidentiality may be seriously threatened by 
this openness. It is the Lieutenant Governor in Council who  will 
rule on the clause concerning the disclosure of information.
<P>
	The reaction of the Quebec Minister of Justice suggests that 
would not change, at least in Quebec, but what about the other 
provinces?
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	The last of the major changes proposed in Bill C-37 is 
unquestionably the harsher sentences provided for in the case of 
first- and second-degree murder. Pursuant to clause 13(3) of the 
bill, the maximum sentence for first-degree murder would rise 
from five to ten years. In the case of second-degree murder, the 
maximum sentence would increase from five to seven years.
<P>
	This is a strange provision in that 16- and 17-year-olds can 
already be tried in adult courts. Therefore, the ones who stand to 
suffer the most as a result of this measure are 12- to 
15-year-olds. Youth crime statistics do not justify such a harsh 
stance. Youth violence is generally on the decline. In the big 
cities, violence is either increasing or changing in nature with 
the upsurge in gangs. We are now seeing different kinds of 
violence than in the past. One can believe the government has 
been influenced by the families of victims of violent crimes who 
are motivated by a desire for vengeance. The Youth Protection 
Act was amended in 1992 to increase the sentences from three to 
five years. Why is the government taking this hard-line 
approach when the number of murders has declined? It is not 
even waiting to see the results of the initial changes and here it 
goes increasing the length of sentences again. Will it decide to 
lengthen the sentences again in two years' time?
<P>
	It is obvious to the official opposition that the government is 
acting with undue haste in bringing in this legislation and that it 
is trying to please everyone.
<P>
	Surely the rising popularity of the Reform Party in Ontario, a 
Liberal stronghold, has something to do with this decision. As 
far as the Quebec government is concerned, the bill should not 
have been introduced in the first place and the government 
should work within the parameters of the existing legislation 
and enforce its provisions.
<P>
	It should be noted that the provinces are responsible for 
enforcing the provisions of the legislation and, in the opinion of 
the federal justice minister, they will enjoy considerably more 
latitude in this area. However, if ever a genuine legislative 
review process were to be undertaken, the provinces would have 
to be seriously involved.
<P>
	No further details are given about the federal government's 
crime prevention policy mentioned in clause 1 of Bill C-37, 
despite the fact that it is an essential component of an effective 
juvenile crime prevention strategy. The bill is also silent on 
another problem, that of adults who use young people to commit 
their crimes and who get off scot-free.
<P>
	The Official Opposition supports harsh penalties, but only in 
the case of premeditated, first-degree murder. With respect to 
other crimes, the existing provisions should remain in effect. It 
has also been said that the Youth Protection Act should not be 
mentioned too often because it only confuses matters.
<P>
	Instead, I will quote statistics. According to the Canadian 
Centre for Justice Statistics, the average number of murders 
committed by teenagers in Canada fell from 55 between 1972 
and 1982 to 46 between 1982 and 1992. In 1992, police laid 
charges against 140,000 teenagers for violating the Criminal 
Code and other federal laws. The number of charges laid has 
risen by 25 per cent in the last seven years. Two thirds of the 
115,000 cases heard by youth courts led to a guilty verdict. 
About one third of teenagers found guilty by youth courts were 
committed to custody in correctional institutions or to open 
custody.
<P>
	According to an article that appeared in the <I>Toronto Star</I> on 
June 6, it would cost between $70,000 and $100,000 a year to 
keep a young person in a detention centre. In 1992-93, the 
average number of teenagers in detention institutions was 4,734 
a day, one third of whom were in secure custody. Fifty-three per 
cent of the teenagers convicted in 1992-93 were 16 or 17 years 
old.
<P>
	According to the Canadian Department of Justice, in 1992, 
less than 15 per cent of violent crimes were committed by young 
people. According to an article published in a magazine called 
<I>Canadian Social Trends</I> in the fall of 1992, only 13 per cent of 
the charges laid against young people in 1991 involved violence.
<P>
	According to a Statistics Canada survey, 70 per cent of all 
charges laid against teenagers in 1991 were related to crimes 
against property. However, the number of charges linked to 
crimes against property has increased by 17 per cent since 1986.
<P>
	According to an article published in the <I>Ottawa Citizen</I> on 
April 19, 1993, one in three Canadians mistakenly believes that 
violence is as widespread here as in the United States.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	In 1991, 753 homicides were reported in Canada, as compared 
to 24,000 in the United States. This means 32 times more 
homicides in a population 10 times larger that ours. There is just 
no comparison. The only detectable element of commonality 
between our two countries is the fact that repression does not 
make the crime rate go down, while media coverage of murders 
has a greater effect on public opinion.
<P>
	A study carried out in Manitoba in 1992 showed that 90 per 
cent of young sex offenders had been assaulted in their 
childhood. Another study, which was carried out in London, 
Ontario, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5451"> 5451 </A></B>
<P>
in 1987, showed that 50 per cent of young persons charged with 
violent crimes had seen their father beat up their mother.
<P>
	In its report on crime prevention, the Standing Committee of 
the House of Commons on Justice and Solicitor General noted 
that incarceration rates are higher in the United States than 
anywhere else in the world and they currently spend $70 billion 
on law enforcement, judicial and correctional services. 
Nevertheless, in 1990, the United States ranked first in the world 
for the number of murders, rapes and robberies committed on 
their territory. In fact, U.S. figures in that area continue to rise.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice did not include in Bill C-37 provision 
to toughen sentences for adults who solicit or hold young 
persons hostage to force them to commit crimes in their behalf.
<P>
	Not only are these young persons forced by adults to commit 
crimes, but they will have to bear responsibility for the actions 
of adult criminals. The severity of this legislation should be 
directed toward these adults who often manage to evade the 
police, thus escaping prosecution, instead of the young people 
who get caught for such offenses.
<P>
	The young people are taking the rap for adults. What is the 
idea? To brand young Canadians and Quebecers for the sake of 
making good a promise made in the red book? True enough, 
young people's inexperience often makes them easy game for 
police forces who are better at arresting young people than their 
adult counterparts.
<P>
	The police make them spill the beans and take on full 
responsibility for the actions they are accused of, charges them 
and finally, have them convicted and sentenced in the place of 
adult criminals.
<P>
	In Bill C-37, the Minister of Justice neither provides for nor 
supports any effective direct measure to eliminate juvenile 
delinquency. A proven direct alternative for eliminating 
juvenile delinquency is financial support for street workers.
<P>
	At present, street workers are barely surviving on reduced 
subsidies. By the way, these subsidies, which most of the time 
called employment development programs and were 
subsequently cut could pay for a large part of youth services. 
This is an important point to note. Many communities in Quebec 
and in other regions of Canada used this employment program.
<P>
	Resources are being cut back, resources which were used 
effectively but which could be even more effective if they were 
increased for this purpose. Organizations are already 
established, know their clientele, know their young people and 
are already up and running and what happens? Resources for 
them are cut.
<P>
	Would the Department of Justice agree to give some of its 
budget to these street workers? Adult criminals who make use of 
young people's services do not have to pay the cost of their own 
defence since they are not charged and do not pay the cost of 
defending the young people charged in their place. In such a 
case, society now pays the costs involved in bringing them to 
justice.
<P>
	Instead of punishing those who are really guilty, namely the 
adult instigators, Bill C-37 insists on punishing these young 
people who, I repeat, have been enlisted by adults.
<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
	I would like to conclude now with the impact of the message 
we are now giving our young people. Four hundred thousand 
young Canadians are unemployed-I am speaking broadly; I do 
not know how many are under 18-and the hon. member for 
Rimouski-Témiscouata spoke of two million young people in 
Canada who are under 18. What message are we now giving 
these young people? It is this: ``If you do wrong, you will be 
punished''. It is a message declining responsibility, unlike the 
following: ``We trust you. You may have done wrong, but we 
will try to give you a chance and rehabilitate you''. Why do I say 
that? Because the provinces everywhere lack resources for 
rehabilitation and social reintegration.
<P>
	I will not name him, but during an exchange, an hon. member 
told of his experience. This was actual testimony from his youth 
when he did something wrong at the age of 12. He was delighted 
that some adults took charge of him to help him straighten out, 
so much so that he is a member of this House today. This is an 
important position, unless the role of MP does not really amount 
to much.
<P>
	The problem in this House now, as in Canada, is that people 
tell horror stories. Not enough success stories are mentioned, 
but there is a lot of experience. We need only talk to educators 
and to people who have been involved in community 
development, municipal recreation services or volunteer 
organizations. Every day they could tell us about the benefits of 
a prevention program based on the positive side of young 
people.
<P>
	Right now, we talk about school drop-outs, delinquency rate, 
etc., but we forget to ask questions such as: What pushes young 
people to commit crimes? I remember one case in the Quebec 
City region. I will not give any names. Some young people had 
watched a violent movie which had led them to kill a taxi driver. 
They were influenced by the movie. Why not legislate at that 
level? Why let young and very young people watch violent acts?
<P>
	I do not have exact figures, but a young person watching 
television all day can witness about 50 murders. And then 
people are surprised. I am not saying that there is more crime, 
but these are measures which we should think about.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5452"> 5452 </A></B>
<P>
	The whole issue of firearms comes to mind when I read that 
young people still have access to such weapons. This morning 
again, there was a story involving military firearms. There are 
so many firearms.
<P>
	This is another aspect, but I want to go back to the main issue. 
What is needed is some positive action to convince young 
people to get involved in the community, on a volunteer basis or 
otherwise. But, first, the message conveyed by our leaders must 
be a positive one. It must be a message of hope telling young 
people that they have an interesting future ahead, instead of 
being about harsher sentences and incarceration.
<P>

<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> It is my duty, pursuant 
to Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the question to be 
raised tonight at the time of adjournment is as follows: the hon. 
member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve-Human Rights.
<P>
<B>(1700 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul E. Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I would like to address a question to my 
colleague. Does he believe that the proposed amendments to the 
Young Offenders Act in this bill go in the right direction? If he 
does not, what legislative provisions would he propose in 
addition to the usual request for more social programming and 
counselling services?
<P>
	If the bill says the wrong things-and I believe he is taking 
that tack-what does he propose other than throwing more 
money at the problem with increased social services?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dubé:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for asking 
this question. I thought I had said it rather clearly in my speech. 
We in the Official Opposition feel that this act already provides 
sufficient punitive measures and that we should instead-and 
this is really the crux of today's debate-be considering the need 
for additional resources to rehabilitate young people and 
reintegrate them into society-in short, preventive measures.
<P>
	A parallel can be drawn with the health field, where money 
spent on prevention may seem like a lot initially, but pays 
long-term dividends. This is particularly true for young people. 
If we are harder on a young offender and send him to an adult 
prison, which is a highly criminalized environment, what will 
happen? In all likelihood-and I am tempted to use the word 
guarantee here-that young person will turn to a life of crime. 
Instead, we should tell the young offender: ``You have done 
something wrong and you must acknowledge that fact, but we 
are giving you a chance to start over again''. That is very 
important.
<P>
	My colleague's question also indicates, quite obviously, that 
there are two countries within this country. I can understand the 
Reform Party members, they represent the views of their 
constituents; and I will admit that the newspapers clearly show 
that this is a major public concern, and I can understand that. But 
in Quebec-I must say this because it is the role of a member of 
Parliament to advocate the interests and demands of his 
constituents-there is no such collective reaction against young 
offenders. Yes, the issue remains a concern, but not on the same 
order of magnitude.
<P>
	In the present federal system, the Criminal Code must be 
enforced the same way in every province, and I find that 
unfortunate. Clearly, some people, particularly in Western 
Canada, are not happy with the act in its present form. In 
Quebec, we are satisfied with the act as it now stands. It is often 
said that this is a big country. Now, that is all well and good, but 
when you try to dress everyone in the same clothes-tall, short, 
fat, thin-you find that ``one size fits all'' sometimes does not 
apply. I am drawing this parallel simply to illustrate my point, 
but I do feel that it is the essence of what I wanted to say. I see a 
difference of opinion, and we in the Bloc, obviously, say that the 
status quo is better in this case.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm):</B> Madam 
Speaker, for the information of the House and also because my 
fellow Bloc member mentioned a case in Quebec where a taxi 
driver was killed by a young offender, I just want to say that the 
act was correctly applied to this person by the courts in Quebec, 
in that there was a request for transfer to adult court, and in fact, 
this young person was transferred to adult court. He will be 
treated as an adult and will be sentenced as an adult, if he is 
found guilty. So in the present legislation, we have all the 
instruments we need to do this. The problem is one of 
enforcement, and I think the Bloc Quebecois tends to emphasize 
this because the problem is really how the law is enforced.
<P>
	And this week, I was very surprised to see the crime statistics. 
If we look at the figures, and all the newspapers reported the 
Statistics Canada survey which tells us that the crime rate has 
not increased since 1988, even in the case of young offenders, 
and I must say this is even more encouraging, and it seems the 
number of all types of crimes went down during the same period.
<P>
<B>(1705) </B>
<P>
	I have a question for the hon. member, if he would care to 
answer. I realize this bill did not come from the Bloc Quebecois, 
because it would never have made it to the House, but I would 
appreciate it if the hon. member would explain to the House why 
we have a bill that is so repressive-we have always had a 
problem with young offenders, and as long as murders are 
committed by young offenders, the problem will exist -when 
the statistics clearly show the problem is not as serious as one 
would have us believe in this House. There has been no shocking 
increase in the youth crime rate, so why  introduce a bill at the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5453"> 5453 </A></B>
<P>
last minute with stricter sentencing for young people, a bill that 
will be even more repressive?
<P>
	Why was it absolutely necessary to table a bill like this in the 
House? And why reverse the onus of proof so that it will be up to 
the defence to prove that young offenders should not be tried in 
adult court where they may get more severe sentences instead of 
being tried under the Young Offenders Act? Could the hon. 
member explain why we have this bill, although the statistics 
show that no further legislation is necessary and that legal 
circles in Quebec and Ontario are very clear about not tinkering 
with the Young Offenders Act because it is good legislation, and 
so perhaps the problem is one of enforcement?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dubé:</B> Madam Speaker, clearly I agree with my colleague 
on some points. As to his question: Why? I think it is obvious, it 
is that public pressure seems to influence the Liberal 
government. In my opinion, we have to be wary of 
contradictions and inconsistencies.
<P>
	For example, we are telling young people that they cannot 
vote before 18, that they cannot drive before 16, but if they 
commit a crime they can be treated as adults. I think we have to 
be consistent, we cannot have more than one standard. I believe 
this should be corrected.
<P>
	As to the weight of public opinion, I would imagine that 
members of the committee will hear witnesses, and I hope they 
make them change their minds on the general direction of this 
bill. A good start would be for the people satisfied with the 
present legislation to be more active in order to balance the 
influence of those who request dramatic changes.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia):</B> Madam Speaker, two months ago, almost 
10 years to the day after the passage of the Young Offenders Act, 
Nicholas Battersby was shot down in cold blood on an Ottawa 
sidewalk. Because the person who shot him was a young 
offender, we know very little about him. All we know is that he 
shot a man for a lark, for fun.
<P>
	There was a big public outcry, lots of calls for tougher law 
enforcement, and the media and the usual brown shirted 
brigades of gun control lobbyists were braying that we should 
stop crime by getting tough on honest citizens.
<P>
	This is something like a man who has two dogs, one vicious 
and one gentle. The vicious dog bites the postman and so to 
appease the postman the man shoots the gentle dog and then 
takes the vicious dog and tries to sweeten his temperament by 
overfeeding him.
<P>
	What will happen to this young man? Because of the date of 
the crime I presume he will be tried under the old Young 
Offenders Act; but for the sake of this discussion let us say that 
he would be tried under the new one. It is less likely under the 
new act than under the old that he  will be tried in an adult court 
for the simple reason that the new law will lead to interminable 
court delays with the new process of reverse onus that has been 
written into it. If he is convicted he will face a maximum of	10 years in custody, no minimum, of which perhaps 6 years could be in closed custody. Judging on the way the laws have been enforced to date that is all rather hypothetical and somewhat unlikel
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	What should be done with a person like that? I respectfully 
suggest that murder by a 16-year-old is no less harmful to the 
victim than murder by an 18-year-old. Therefore the penalty 
should be essentially the same. I am not suggesting immediate 
incarceration with older prisoners where the young fellow 
would be the plaything of sexual predators. That constitutes 
cruel and usual punishment by any standards and is unworthy of 
a civilized society.
<P>
	We should have institutions designed to serve specific age 
groups. We used to have them. They were called reform schools. 
Some hon. members may say that is too expensive and we cannot 
afford it. If we could rehabilitate some of these young hoodlums 
perhaps it would be money well spent. It should not be 
expensive anyway; it need not be expensive. Young people 
incarcerated in a reform school could do useful work, including 
growing their own food which adult prisoners in the 
penitentiaries used to do and which we have done away with in 
most cases. Why do we not go back to that? When the young 
offender is not working to earn his keep he could be educated. 
Go easy on the pool tables and TV.
<P>
	A 14-year old young offender in open custody was recently 
quoted as saying: ``It is easy time; it is kind of like a playground: 
Disneyland or something''. What is that young fellow learning 
about the justice system?
<P>
	The proposed amendments to the Young Offenders Act are in 
our opinion purely cosmetic, a transparent attempt to pacify a 
public clamouring for meaningful change. The government's 
response to almost everyone's principal demand that the 
maximum of age of application be lowered from 17 years to 15 
years is to be sloughed off with a silly and meaningless 
compromise requiring 16 and 17-year olds to establish, through 
a tedious and expensive court process, that they should not be 
tried in adult court for the most serious crimes: murder, 
attempted murder, aggravated sexual assault and so on. The cost 
and confusion will be enormous: a bonanza for lawyers.
<P>
	Since both reverse onus and judicial selectivity are involved 
some lawyers will probably be able to seek the spotlight and 
beef up their incomes by mounting a charter challenge. This is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5454"> 5454 </A></B>
<P>
an act written by lawyers for lawyers. I think of the constituent 
who asked rather plaintively: ``Can't you pass a law down there 
forbidding lawyers to run for Parliament?''
<P>
	In the House on June 6 the hon. member for Saint Hubert said: 
``These motions will be similar to extradition proceedings. It is 
going to be a waste of energy and public funds and through it all 
young persons will learn how to foil the system and scoff at the 
law''. I rarely agree with anything the hon. member says but I 
certainly agree with that. She was spot on.
<P>
	Of course her proposed solution differs from mine. She would 
continue to treat these louts like poor little misguided children, 
subject to the same rules as 13 and 14-year olds. People of16 and 17 are not children, for heaven's sake. They hold down 
jobs. They drive cars. They have babies with or without the 
benefit of matrimony. If they are unhappy in the parental home 
generous social welfare will in most provinces provide 
reasonably comfortable independence.
<P>
<B>(1715) </B>
<P>
	Bill C-37, rather than ensuring that these older young 
offenders will end up in adult court, makes it less likely than 
ever because of the reasons I have cited. I do not want to sound 
like a nagging parent saying ``when I was your age-'', but at the 
age of 17 I was working in a bush camp swinging an axe to raise 
money so I could enter university. If anyone had dared to 
suggest to me that I was a child I would have been outraged. We 
do young people no favours by relieving them of responsibility.
<P>
	One of the hon. members opposite probably will not believe 
this, but I can actually remember when I was 10 to 13-years old. 
My companions and I fought regularly but never dreamed of 
using the knives which as farm boys we all carried. We did not 
try to maim each other. We had an archaic code of conduct which 
might seem terribly quaint to the lawyers and social workers 
who have been trying to redesign our society.
<P>
	You did not kick somebody who was down. You did not pick 
on little kids or gang up on anyone and you never, never hit girls. 
In other words, we knew the difference between right and 
wrong; so did my kids as recently as 20 years ago.
<P>
	I venture to say to the young savages who terrorize their 
weaker classmates, vandalize property and give the finger to 
their powerless teachers, to exempt 10 and 11-year olds from 
the rules of civilized conduct is socially destructive madness. A 
child who gets away with it at 10 or 11 and whose parents are not 
held legally accountable for his or her actions learns a lesson 
which all the prattling counsellors and dreamy eyed social 
workers in the world cannot erase.
<P>
	Now the minister tells us that section 43 of the Criminal Code 
which protects parents who do care about their kids and use 
reasonable force to discipline them is up for review. What 
strange world does the Liberal Party inhabit?
<P>
	The road from uncorrected naughtiness to mean 
destructiveness to full blown delinquency is short and straight. 
The government owes it to the children of Canada and to the 
future of our society to re-enter the world of every day 
Canadians. Bill C-37 is a start, but only a start. Let us get on 
with it.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, I neglected to inform you that I am splitting 
my time with the hon. member for Red Deer. I hope I can put that 
in now.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I agree to accept it. You 
have already gone over. We had better get to questions and 
comments.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm):</B> I listened 
to the member, and he sounds as if he no longer belongs to the 
Reform Party, but rather to the nostalgia party. These problems 
are today's problems, and I think that they cannot be solved the 
way the member suggested. I think that the problem of young 
offenders is much deeper than it appears at first glance. When 
young people turn the TV on, what do they see? Violence. In 
today's papers, we can read that a father seems to have left his 
firearms unattended since a 10-year old brought army revolvers 
to school. I think that there is a problem with educating parents 
and making them aware of potential problems with their 
children. I believe it to be a much deeper problem.
<P>
	I would like to hear from the member who comes from 
western Canada if in his province they have a mechanism to deal 
with these young offenders.
<P>
<B>(1720) </B>
<P>
	Is there some mechanism to decriminalize their cases, to steer 
them towards rehabilitation and social reintegration or is it an 
area, in this great and beautiful country, where they put young 
offenders in block A, and the adults in block B? Do they send 
them to the best crime school to turn them into real outlaws later 
on?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
his questions. He must be aware that reform schools or youth 
wings, as he calls them, do not exist anywhere in Canada any 
more.
<P>
	I am advocating, and I am advocating strongly, that doing 
away with them was a mistake because there is now no real 
mechanism to deal with these young people. We have the open 
custody situation or we have jails for adults. We really do not 
have much in between. We have youngsters in remand centres 
interminably.
<P>
	They get into more trouble there; they get educated. That is 
why we should have reform schools where they get proper 
education. Yes, I am nostalgic. I do yearn for a period of our 
history when society was orderly, when there was a discipline of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5455"> 5455 </A></B>
<P>
children, when the police and the courts had power and 
exercised it.
<P>
	I do not have a yearning for a police state, but I do have a 
yearning for a state where people are safe and where there is a 
social contract which involves decency and mutual respect 
among people. We have lost that. A lot of it is due to the same 
frame of mind that framed the original Young Offenders Act and 
which did not have the courage to come forward and do a full job 
with Bill C-37.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer):</B> Madam Speaker, Canadians have 
waited a long time for this day. For years they have been 
demanding substantial changes to the Young Offenders Act. 
Canadians say they do not feel protected. They have asked the 
government to put society first instead of the criminal.
<P>
	Canadians have demanded changes and Canadians have 
waited. In the meantime there have been costs. The public 
confidence has been eroded. Young offenders who have been 
released for violent crimes have reoffended. All the while 
Canadians have appealed to the government to protect society 
and ensure offenders are rehabilitated before being released.
<P>
	The government has tabled before us amendments to the 
Young Offenders Act, which it says will address these concerns. 
The amendments would change the declaration of the Young 
Offenders Act so that its primary objective is to protect society. 
On the surface this looks good. The protection of society should 
always be the objective of our criminal justice system. We as 
parliamentarians must ensure the protection of Canadians is 
paramount.
<P>
	Bill C-37 falls far short of this goal. We as Reformers will be 
supporting the bill because it does do something about 
toughening up the system. Something is better than nothing. 
However there are problems. The government's proposed 
changes are merely cosmetic. They appear to give the act a 
smooth finish, but when we look beneath the surface we can see 
serious structural flaws.
<P>
	Here are some of the flaws. Bill C-37 does not lower the age 
limit. Those young offenders who commit serious crimes and 
who are under age 12 are still not held criminally responsible, 
even though criminal acts are committed by children under age 
12.
<P>
	All we need to do is look at the newspapers today. They tell a 
harrowing tale about an Aylmer boy who held his classmates at 
gunpoint. The boy had a .357 magnum and 9-millimetre pistol. 
He was 10 years old and apparently threatening the lives of his 
classmates. Yet he has not been charged because he is too young.
<P>
	In 1993 Regina police were paralysed to act after a 
nine-year-old and an eleven-year-old attacked two young 
boys. The victims were forcibly confined, beaten and sexually 
abused. Police could do nothing. Parliament has not given them 
any power to act. The stories could go on. We have heard many 
of them repeated in the House.
<P>
<B>(1725) </B>
<P>
	Young offenders like these ones should be included in our 
youth criminal justice so they can receive treatment, so they can 
learn that their crimes are not acceptable to society, so we can be 
assured they do not reoffend and, finally, so they can eventually 
become productive members of the community. We have the 
chance to reform the violent actions of these young children but 
we are missing this window of opportunity.
<P>
	Bill C-37 also fails in another area. It softens the law for 
violent offenders under age 16. The amendments we are 
considering today will allow youth courts to deal more harshly 
with murders. Canadians across the country have demanded that 
the current five-year maximum sentence is a slap on the wrist.
<P>
	The proposed changes will increase first degree murder 
sentences to 10 years. In reality this translates to six years of 
custody and four years of community supervision. Second 
degree murder sentences will be increased to a seven-year 
maximum. This translates into four years in custody and three 
years of supervision.
<P>
	I would argue that these changes would work to soften the law 
in its treatment of murderers. The slightly higher sentences will 
mean fewer violent offenders under 16 will be transferred to 
adult court. The changes before us today will ensure that many 
murderers will remain under the Young Offenders Act.
<P>
	The government argues that its amendments are sufficient. It 
says most of the murder related cases heard in youth court are 
committed by 16 and 17 year olds. In 1992 and 1993, 60 per cent 
of the cases heard in youth court involved this age group.
<P>
	These statistics like the amendments before us today look 
good at first glance, but once we look a little deeper we see the 
blemishes. The numbers completely ignore an important fact. 
Offenders under age 16 committed 40 per cent of the murder 
cases heard in youth court at this time. I would argue this is a 
significant proportion.
<P>
	There is yet another flaw in these amendments. The general 
public is kept in the dark about violent repeat offenders. The 
proposed changes will provide information on young offenders 
to the police, to school officials and to child welfare workers. 
Certain members of society whose safety is in jeopardy will also 
receive information on the young offender.
<P>
	These seem like valid changes but in reality they are 
superficial. The general public does not have access to the 
information. If certain members of the public can receive 
information about a young offender because their safety is at 
risk, why is the general public not also informed? If there is a 
chance a young offender will reoffend then all society is at risk. 
It is impossible for anyone to know for certain that only a 
targeted few will be in danger. If the government were truly 
interested in protecting all 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5456"> 5456 </A></B>
<P>
society then all society would be informed about dangerous 
young offenders. This is not the case.
<P>
	An additional flaw is that violent young offenders' records are 
not kept on file permanently. The proposals also claim to protect 
society by allowing police to keep the record of young offenders 
on file for ten years instead of five. According to the justice 
department this change will ensure that the length of time a 
young offender's record is kept is in keeping with the 
seriousness of the offence. Keeping the young offender's 
murder record on file for 10 years does not begin to mirror the 
seriousness of the offence. Murder is permanent; it demands a 
permanent record. The victims' names and ordeals will be 
forever etched in the minds of their loved ones long after the 
murder record has been wiped clean. Society has the right to 
know. If the government were truly interested in protecting 
society it would keep all murder records and violent crime 
records on file permanently.
<P>
	Bill C-37 also raises some questions about serving sentences 
in the community. Will the community sentences be adequate? 
Under the changes set before us today more non-violent 
offenders will serve their sentences in the community instead of 
in custody. This change has many attributes. Young offenders 
will not be influenced by harder violent offenders. Often jail is 
considered a training ground for crime. It will save government 
money. It costs approximately $75,000 to incarcerate an 
individual. However, the government in saving this money must 
be committed to redirecting some of it into the communities.
<P>
<B>(1730) </B>
<P>
	If these offenders are to live in our communities we must 
ensure that they do not become repeat offenders. We must 
protect society. To do this, some of these offenders may need 
treatment and we must ensure that they receive it. I am not 
talking about spending more money. I am talking about saving 
money and spending some of it more wisely.
<P>
	In conclusion, when we make changes to our criminal justice 
system we must ensure that the system is predictable to society. 
In order for a judicial system to act as an effective deterrent, 
citizens must be able to anticipate the outcome of their actions.
<P>
	It is therefore important that the Young Offenders Act mirror 
the adult system as accurately as possible. We still have a long 
way to go, especially in the area of criminal records and 
publication bans. I believe these changes before us today are a 
small step toward this goal. Bill C-37 is far from perfect but it 
will improve the current system somewhat.
<P>
	Amendments to Bill C-37 are essential. I would urge my 
fellow members of Parliament to ensure that these are enacted.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morris Bodnar (Saskatoon-Dundurn):</B> Madam 
Speaker, mention has been made of the negative effect of 
increasing the sentencing, that this will result in fewer 
individuals being transferred to adult court.
<P>
	I remind the member that the onus is reversed. A person such 
as that is automatically in adult court and must be transferred 
down to youth court or the young offenders court in the case of 
serious offences such as murder.
<P>
	As well there was mention made of the Aylmer incident 
yesterday but no mention whatsoever was made about the 
parents. What about those guns? How did they get into the 
hands? Were they in the hands of law abiding individuals? Were 
they in the hands of neighbours? How did they get into the hands 
of the children? Perhaps we should stop blaming the 10-year old 
and start blaming the adults who allow these guns to get into the 
hands of young people.
<P>
	There is a lot of rhetoric about rehabilitation and productivity 
to society but no substance. Therefore, my question to the hon. 
member is what would he do? How would he change it? What 
specific items would he put into the act to deal with 
rehabilitation and to make this young person productive to 
society?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Red Deer):</B> Madam Speaker, there are a lot of 
things we could say that we would change. We could certainly 
take a look at things like boot camps and those sorts of things. 
However, more important to the question, we must include 
victim's impact statements. We must include parents in the 
actual criminal justice system. The parents have to be forced to 
be there to hear what the victim went through and what their 
little darling did to that person. If they are found in any way to be 
responsible, they have to be part of that restitution; that money 
that is paid back, that fence that is fixed, whatever that damage 
has been.
<P>
	I agree with the member fully. We must involve the parents in 
this. We must involve the victims in this. I do not see that in Bill 
C-37. I see a wishy-washy bill that really just satisfies the red 
book claim that we are going to make some changes but will do 
nothing to improve the actual situation we have.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I would like to rectify what the member said regarding 
the case in Aylmer. I do not know if he read the same papers as I 
did, but this young person did not threaten anyone, he was going 
to practice shooting in a field with some friends. That is no 
excuse for the parents, though, but it is quite different from what 
the member said. It is misinformation of that kind that 
needlessly scares people.
<P>
	This being said, I know now-I already knew it, but it was 
confirmed by a member from western Canada-that there is no 
mechanism in Western Canada to deal with young offenders and 
their problems.

<P>
	Now that it has been confirmed, could the member tell me 
what his province will do the day young offenders are released, 
following the amendments to the Young Offenders Act, after 
spending seven to ten years in jail? What is the province going to 
do with them, if during all that time, there were no specialists to 
work with and treat them? If during their time in jail, nobody 
helped them, what is the province going to do with them once 
they are released after seven or ten years?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Red Deer):</B> Madam Speaker, I am not quite sure 
exactly what the member is referring to but we are saying that 
we do not abandon those children. In fact, we have to do 
something about that rehabilitation.
<P>
	We are already spending millions of dollars on social 
programs, on various types of retraining programs and it is not 
working. It is just not working. We have a bunch of academics 
who have this idealistic world where they think they have 
solutions but it is not working. We have to look at other things 
and that is the point. The money we are putting in there now is 
being wasted.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Parliamentary Secretary to Deputy 
Prime Minister and Minister of the Environment):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it is rather significant that on the one hand, we have the 
Reform Party telling us that the justice minister's proposal is 
nothing more than a cosmetic measure, while on the other hand, 
we have the Bloc telling us that the bill is far too repressive. 
Perhaps it is the happy medium.
<P>
	I have listened closely to my colleague, the Minister of 
Justice, answer countless questions in the House about his views 
on young offenders and crime. He has said that his philosophy 
consists of cleaning up some of the outdated provisions in 
legislation, and at the same time focussing on the issue of crime 
prevention.
<P>
	In our red book, we promised to take a look at provisions in 
the legislation as they pertain to certain violent youth crimes 
and to strengthen the act which is now ten years old. At the same 
time, however, we made it very clear that we would try to find 
ways to curb crime, and this is where prevention comes into 
play.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Just the other day after the Stanley Cup riots, all of us 
expected the riots to take place in New York City which is a city 
where crime has become a way of life. Yet New York City was 
quiet. It was lawful. The riots happened in Vancouver, a quiet 
peaceful city in normal times.
<P>
	Last year it happened in Montreal, my own city, which is 
again extremely quiet and peaceful. We have to ask ourselves 
what the reasons are for lawlessness, violence and crime. We 
have to go back to the hopelessness in which youth sees itself.
<P>
	I heard my colleague from Reform say that 17 years ago when 
he was 17 he went to bush camp and 20 years ago he knew what 
right and wrong were, as if today we do not have youth going to 
bush camps and other ways of work, as if today the youth does 
not know what is right and wrong. The great majority of youth in 
Canada are outstanding citizens, highly qualified, desirous of 
working. There is crime because there is hopelessness. We do 
not give them a chance.
<P>
	A few years ago I had the sad privilege to serve on a 
committee with some other people about an ethnic group in 
Montreal who did not have the French language skills. They had 
very few educational skills and no work training skills. They 
could not find work.
<P>
	The elders were saying because of that those people would 
resort to crime. They would rely on drugs and crime because 
there was no other open way for them. This is why in our 
electoral commitment we call it creating opportunity. Unless we 
create opportunity we are going to have to resort to more and 
more laws which will solve nothing. The more hopelessness 
there will be, the more crime there is going to be and then the 
more repressive laws we are going to be looking for.
<P>
<B>(1740) </B>
<P>
	What we need to do is to look at an integrated approach to 
society that looks at crime in its very sources. They say that an 
adult is born when a child is born. This is why we have addressed 
the question of day care for all the poor, single mothers that have 
to go to work leaving their children at home without adequate 
day care. So we have tackled day care. There is a correlation 
between day care and eventual crime.
<P>
	Today we have a rate of drop out rate in our schools of 
something like 40 per cent. Sixty per cent of young Canadians 
have no vocational skills or no post-secondary skills. How can 
they approach the workplace in a competitive economy where 
work has to be more skilled than ever?
<P>
	We graduate 24,000 apprentices a year compared to 600,000 
in Germany. In proportion to our population we should graduate 
275,000. How can we hope for these young people to find work, 
to find a dignity of life if we do not give them the chance?
<P>
	This is why our program addresses itself to all the various 
causes of hopelessness.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Literacy, youth programs, the Youth Service Corps, 
apprenticeship programs and the reform proposals which my 
colleague the human resources development minister is now 
working on: this is the integrated reform which will affect all 
sectors of society and foster a climate in which job training will 
be a much more positive experience.

<P>
	We have to restructure our industries toward the new 
industries of tomorrow; environmental technologies, broadcast 
technologies, information technologies, health technologies in 
which we can shine so that added to our thrusts to train young 
people into apprenticeships, into post-secondary education that 
is geared to these new areas of excellence, we can find them 
work, we can find them an opportunity, a chance.
<P>
	We have wonderful young people in Canada, some of them 
highly qualified. Most of our youth are wonderful people. Those 
that resort to crime and hopelessness are those that do not find a 
chance.
<P>
	We talk about prevention and we say that we have not 
addressed prevention. Yet our Minister of Justice pointed out 
that we are going to create very soon a national council for 
prevention of crime. I know some will say another council.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We intend to consult with Canadians, provincial and 
municipal governments, police forces and communities with a 
view to developing, not a short-term, hastily conceived 
strategy, but a comprehensive, long-term strategy, one that 
addresses all aspects of crime prevention, including long-term 
rehabilitation.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	There is a saying that if we cherish the child and give him or 
her hope then we do not have to punish the man or the woman in 
later life. I believe in this fundamentally. What we need in our 
society is to give our young people, whether they be 12-year 
olds, 15-year olds, 17-year olds or 20-year olds a chance. To 
believe that the world has not changed since the 1960s or the 
1950s is to delude ourselves. It is a new world today with instant 
communications. The world is very different.
<P>
	Sure, there is more crime. There is more crime in Canada as 
there is more crime in France or England, in places which 
heretofore were very peaceful. That is the way of today's world. 
In all of these countries there is one common link, lack of 
opportunity for young people and for adults. When despair and 
hopelessness set in, people resort to any way to earn a living, to 
acquire dignity of life. That is what we must attack.
<P>
<B>(1745) </B>
<P>
	To say that 20 years ago all was sweetness and light when we 
all went to bush camps and everybody was nice is illusory. 
Today I find we have more frank young people than in my 
generation. We have young people who are far more committed 
to society, to truth, to integrity, to the environmental cause than 
we ever were in my time. We believed that you had to cane 
children and use law and order in our families. Today it is a more 
enlightened world where we rule by consensus and work 
together to try to form partnerships within our families, within 
our communities. It is a far more challenging world.
<P>
	We have to resolve to effectively create opportunities so that 
our young people get back to work, find hope and dignity and 
then they will not have to resort to crime and violence.

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides):</B> Madam Speaker, it is 
with great pleasure that I rise today in this House to participate 
in the debate on Bill C-217, an Act to amend the Young 
Offenders Act.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, I am against this bill. As you well know, 
criminologists have long argued that there is a wide gap between 
the public's perception of crime rates and the actual levels. 
Many believe that violent crime is a plague, in particular among 
young people, when the proportion of crimes committed by 
youths is very small. In fact, less than 15 per cent of all crimes 
committed by young people in 1992 involved violence. Despite 
the increase in the number of violent crimes committed by 
young people, most of this increase is due to minor assaults 
between peers, which, according to legal analysts, would not 
have involved the criminal justice system 10 years ago.
<P>
	In April 1988, a study was conducted on the rehabilitation and 
social reintegration of 24 teenage murderers sent to Boscoville 
between 1968 and 1983. This study supports previous local and 
North American data on the typology, prospects and 
reintegration of young murderers.
<P>
	It reminded decision-makers that, under certain conditions, 
these teenagers can be helped and become responsible and 
productive citizens.
<P>
	Like other studies, the one I mentioned found that these 
teenagers have good prospects, that they do not commit 
subsequent offences and that their crime were due to 
circumstances and neurosis.
<P>
	Young people charged with crimes have the right to be treated 
equitably under the law and enjoy special protection in this 
regard. Given their ages and maturity levels, young offenders 
have special needs that cannot be met in the adult system.
<P>
	In fact, the bill attempts to reconcile the need to protect the 
public against teenage criminals by requiring them to assume 
responsibility for their actions with the need to protect young 
offenders' rights and help them become productive and 
law-abiding adults.
<P>
	The media are often accused of contributing to the climate of 
fear. They tend to dwell upon spectacular and sensational crimes 
and to dramatize the vilest acts of violence reported on 
television, which apparently distorts reality, creating the 
impression 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5459"> 5459 </A></B>
<P>
that crime has become rampant and exaggerating public fear. 
Fear is also fostered and intensified by rising crime statistics.
<P>
	Some analysts are of the opinion that the intensity of the fear 
presently experienced by Canadians results in part from 
economic uncertainty. High unemployment has contributed to 
the climate of insecurity and vulnerability and is causing social 
and economic problems that reinforce the feeling of social 
disintegration.
<P>
<B>(1750) </B>
<P>
	The Liberal Party platform includes proposals to increase the 
length of maximum sentences imposed by the courts for first and 
second degree murders committed by young offenders; to relax 
the requirement to systematically dispose of police files on 
young offenders after a certain time; to allow the identification 
of some young offenders who have been convicted of violent 
crimes; and to create a ``dangerous young offender'' category 
for dangerous and habitual young offenders. We, Bloc members, 
cannot support the bill before us.
<P>
	It has been established that through positive, early 
intervention in their lives, young persons struggling with social, 
psychological and emotional problems can be prevented from 
straying into crime and becoming dangerous repeat offenders.
<P>
	There are a number of examples in support of the view held 
that young people commit offenses because they figure the gains 
derived from their unlawful activities will outweigh the price 
they will have to pay if caught. Criminologists and young 
offenders support workers have observed however that in many 
cases, young people commit offenses for reasons totally 
unrelated to the law. In their view, most young offenders commit 
property offenses which are not particularly clever and are more 
indicative of their lack of maturity and irresponsibility than of 
their maliciousness.
<P>
	The overwhelming majority of young Canadians and 
Quebecers are ambitious, hard-working and respectful of their 
peers. Most of them become productive and law-abiding 
citizens. To put all young people on the same level as the 
minority who commit crimes is to do them a disservice.
<P>
	Suing someone who committed a crime may provide some 
comfort to the victim and reassure the public, but it cannot be as 
satisfying as preventing the crime as such. It is often harder to 
implement crime prevention programs than to merely sue an 
offender after the fact. Preventing crime requires a review of on 
the economic, educational, social, moral and legal conditions 
which generate crime as well as an and it requires effort to 
change these conditions. The co-operation of many departments 
from all levels of government, as well as of the private sector 
and the public in general is needed. Making crime prevention 
programs effective is a major challenge. However, the results 
obtained with such programs, namely a reduction in crime, are 
much more beneficial for young people, and also for Canadians 
who, otherwise, might have become victims.
<P>
	In conclusion, as parents, MPs and responsible adults, we 
simply cannot support this bill. We must take our 
responsibilities towards our children and teenagers. It is a lot 
harder to promote prevention, but it is also a lot more effective 
and rewarding. All those involved, including parents, educators 
and social workers, must work with young people to prevent 
crime.
<P>
	I simply cannot believe that a ten-year-old child is mature 
enough to realize that he has committed a first or second degree 
murder. I have a ten-year-old daughter myself and I simply 
cannot believe that she has that comprehension. These children 
obviously know what is good and what is bad, but I doubt very 
much that they would understand that they committed a first or 
second degree murder. These children need protection. Yes, they 
must be punished. Yes, we must teach them, but how far must we 
go?
<P>
	We must also do more in terms of promoting rehabilitation 
which, according to statistics, gives very good results.
<P>
	It goes without saying that this approach will require 
additional efforts from all those involved in the process, but I 
am convinced that the results will be much better than if we 
hastily pass harsher laws.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Pat O'Brien (London-Middlesex):</B> Madam Speaker, it 
is my pleasure to join in this debate on the Young Offenders Act 
and on a much-needed new bill to improve that act.
<P>
	First of all let me congratulate the Minister of Justice for this 
bill. It offers to Canadians, as part of a two-step plan, some 
interim improvements to the youth justice system. It is 
important as members that we recognize and acknowledge this 
will be a two-step process. This is not the final and finished 
product if you will. If it were I would simply say to the minister 
that it does not go far enough in the ultimate sense but for now it 
is very good and major step in the right direction.
<P>
	It is important to note that the second phase will be a thorough 
review by a parliamentary committee and by a 
federal-provincial task force on the whole youth justice system. 
There will be considerable public input in that review process, 
as there has been so far to this point. Obviously it is very 
important to involve provincial legislatures and provincial 
justice officials because the legal system is administered at both 
the federal and provincial levels.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5460"> 5460 </A></B>
<P>
	The bill offers some very badly needed improvements. The 
original Young Offenders Act had an excellent rationale in my 
view. It was simply to recognize that society ought to deal with 
the young offender in a way different from a more mature 
offender, that the penalties ought to be different, and where 
incarceration is required that there ought to be different 
facilities. Canadians generally recognized and accepted that 
rationale.
<P>
	Unfortunately as we know on all sides of the House and as 
Canadians from coast to coast to coast know, the Young 
Offenders Act has been, in at least a minority of cases, 
somewhat badly abused.
<P>
	You see young offenders on national television telling 
Canadians that they consider the Young Offenders Act to be 
something of a joke and that they feel when they are incarcerated 
it is kind of like going to camp. When you hear that on national 
TV from repeat young offenders, there is no doubt in my mind 
that Canadians feel, and rightly so, that there are some problems 
with the current legislation. Obviously that is why the minister 
is seeking to put forward these improvements as step one of the 
ultimate act we will have in place.
<P>
	If I might briefly consider the improvements that are offered 
in the proposed legislation, one of the major improvements is 
the provision that would put the onus on a 16 or 17-year old 
offender convicted of a violent crime, especially murder. The 
onus will now be on that individual to convince the court why he 
or she should not be dealt with as an adult criminal in adult court 
and subject to the tougher penalties of law.
<P>
	That is an important change because under the current 
legislation we seek to amend, the reverse is true. A 16 or 
17-year old convicted even of murder is dealt with on a much 
more lenient basis and is not tried in adult court. This legislation 
will correct what most Canadians consider to be a gross inequity 
in that area.
<P>
	The provision or penalty for murder, I would remind hon. 
members and Canadians generally, started out at a mere three 
years for first degree murder. In my riding of 
London-Middlesex we had a sad situation a few years ago 
when one young offender murdered I believe three people-it 
was certainly more than one person-yet was subject to a 
maximum total penalty of three years. That was clearly not just 
and clearly not adequate for a serious crime like murder.
<P>
	The penalty went from three years within the last short period 
of time to five years but this legislation would allow a doubling 
of that maximum penalty up to 10 years.
<P>
	Some might still say that for first degree murder 10 years is 
inadequate and I suppose that is a debatable point, but it 
certainly is far more just than the five-year penalty that it will 
replace.
<P>
<B>(1800 ) </B>
<P>
	The under 16 and 17-year old offenders in that age category 
will not be eligible for parole as early if convicted of murder. In 
other words, a young offender convicted of murder will now find 
it much more difficult to earn parole than he or she has under the 
current legislation. Again, I think that is just common sense and 
simple justice.
<P>
	As I say, Canadians know that there have been problems with 
the Young Offenders Act. They are crying out for improvements. 
I think the minister has offered major improvements as the first 
step of a two-step process.
<P>
	As our red book stated during the election campaign and as the 
minister, the Prime Minister and members on this side of the 
House have continued to say since the election of last October, 
public safety must be the top priority as we address this issue.
<P>
	Let me be completely fair and say that I have heard that 
statement from all parts of the House. I agree that public safety 
must be the first consideration when we are considering the 
justice system, in any part of the justice system, and that 
includes those offenders who are young Canadians. It seems to 
make that as its first priority.
<P>
	Where perhaps I differ as a Liberal from some hon. members 
in the House is this. This party, this minister and this legislation 
seeks to find a balanced approach to this serious problem of 
youth crime. It is not enough to just simply say: ``Let's throw 
them in jail for as long as we would any other adult, throw away 
the key and let them rot in jail''. That is not the answer. We have 
not heard that attitude too much in the House, but I have detected 
that kind of approach by certain hon. members. I would find it 
shortsighted because it is not a balanced approach.
<P>
	Legislation alone will not solve this problem. It is certainly a 
key component of addressing this issue but it is not enough in 
and of itself. I think that we are very shortsighted as a nation if 
we do not seek to treat the root causes of youth crime, the 
poverty that many if not most young offenders experience, the 
very real poverty that most Canadians do not experience but 
which a high percentage of young offenders have experienced in 
their lifetime. They have experienced repeated family violence, 
themselves often the victims of this violence both sexual and 
non-sexual.
<P>
	Racism is unfortunately a real problem. There are young 
offenders who are from a minority group. When you analyse 
their background and why they committed crime, racism is a 
repeated theme in young offenders from minority groups.
<P>
	The whole question of illiteracy and dropping out of school is 
another problem. As an educator for 21 years, the first signs to 
show that you may have a potential young offender on your 
<P>

<B><A NAME="5461"> 5461 </A></B>
<P>
hands, and teachers will tell you this, are exhibited in 
classrooms at the youngest ages and the lowest grades. 
Obviously, as with criminals of all ages,  substance abuse by 
young offenders is a major factor in their reasons for being 
involved in criminal activity.
<P>
	If one were to summarize these root causes in a brief phrase, I 
think we could do no better than describe the dysfunctional 
family or the breakdown in the family and of good family values 
in this country, I hope in a minority of families. An analysis of 
young offenders will show that an overwhelming percentage of 
them come from dysfunctional families where there is not 
proper parental supervision and where there is not proper 
inculcation of values with these young people. In effect, as a 
society we reap what we sow. This party seeks to find a balanced 
approach.
<P>
	I applaud the minister and the legislation, and I applaud the 
fact that he says time and again when he speaks to the House that 
we have to treat the root causes of crime otherwise we are not 
ultimately going to come up with an improvement in this 
important area. Sure we will lock away young offenders for a 
longer time at great cost to the nation, but that will not solve the 
problem which we ultimately hope to improve upon.
<P>
	What we ought to do as a country and what the legislation 
seeks to do in my view is, while improving the legislation and 
coming up with more realistic penalties, not only be reactive to 
young offenders but to put preventive action into place.
<P>
	The sharing of information among professionals such as 
police officials and school authorities will be an important part 
of preventive action. As a teacher, I say that any teacher in this 
country knows there are young offenders and in some cases 
violent young offenders walking around the halls of a particular 
school.
<P>
	It is important that educators know that in the interests of the 
safety of the other students in that facility and indeed staff in 
that school. It is a fact that there has been an increase in violent 
crime in schools in this country. It concerns all of us.
<P>
	I am pleased to join in the debate today. I applaud the minister 
for the legislation. It is a major first step in the right direction 
and we will await as all Canadians do the ultimate 
improvements in the Young Offenders Act.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> It being 6.05 p.m. the 
House will now proceed to the consideration of Private 
Members' Business as listed on today's Order Paper.

	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should take the necessary 
steps to make food distribution in Canada's North more effective and therefore 
more economical, in order to enable the Inuit to purchase higher quality food at a 
lower price.</BLOCKQUOTE>
He said: Madam Speaker, like my Inuit colleague on the other 
side of the House, I will try to say a few words in Inuktitut and I 
will also provide a translation.
<P>
	[<I>Editor's Note: Member spoke in Inuktitut.</I>]
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It means that I am pleased today to introduce this motion. It 
follows my trip to Iqaluit when I did not feel pleased last winter. 
I arrived in an extremely harsh climate, with temperatures 
around-30o''. This motion is before the House today to draw the 
attention of Canadians and Northerners to the astronomical cost 
of food in the Far North. Not only is the cost astronomical but 
the living conditions are surely the most difficult in Canada.
<P>
	I often spend two or three days on location talking with 
people. I was troubled to see how they live and I think that the 
proposal before us today at least has the merit of trying to do 
something for them. I do not know how far we will go, but I was 
very happy that my motion was drawn and that I can make this 
presentation today.
<P>
	As I usually do, I will give a brief introduction and give you a 
summary of the historical background. The Inuit's ancestors 
immigrated from northern Asia 8,000 years ago. They must not 
be confused with other native people; they do not want to be 
called Indians, they are Inuit. It is very important throughout our 
discussion not to treat them as Natives; that would be a mistake.
<P>
	Originally, the hunters used flint stones as weapons with 
which they eked out a living from day to day in extremely 
difficult conditions, as I explained to you briefly. A little later, 
they started using bows and harpoons. One may wonder why 
people from northern Asia would stop in such a hostile land with 
such a harsh climate. It is fairly easy to understand. Indians from 
South America had invaded North America and the lands further 
south were already occupied, so they simply decided to stay in 
the Arctic.
<P>
<B>(1810) </B>
<P>
	Of course, hunting is part of the tradition of many Inuit and 
Natives. In 1839, the Hudson's Bay Company embarked upon its 
economic incursion into the Arctic. At the time, it was mostly 
interested in whaling, and when the whale population began to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5462"> 5462 </A></B>
<P>
decline over there, it went as far as Ungava. When it realized 
that the fauna and the flora, but mostly the fauna, were getting 
scarce  due to hunting and trapping, the Hudson's Bay Company 
changed its economic approach somewhat.
<P>
	It focused more on trapping, because fur trading was 
becoming a very lucrative operation for the Hudson's Bay 
Company. That is when a change in the way of life of the Inuit 
was first noticed. They went from subsistence hunting to 
commercial hunting, and became more and more dependent on 
Europeans. That led to a progressive decline in the number of 
animals and made the Inuit more dependent on us.
<P>
	Later, during the 1940s and 1950s, with the building of 
military bases in the area came the modernization of the 
economy, which did not necessarily please the people over 
there, because, as I will explain later, there are a lot of problems 
with the standard of living in Canada's North.
<P>
	There was more and more state intervention. In 1955, for 
example, the federal government started a housing program in 
the Far North, which I will address later, because, as we know, 
housing is a big problem for Inuit as well as Natives. But I do not 
want to dwell on this. I would rather talk about the cost of food 
and I am just coming to that.
<P>
	Still in the same context, the education level is very low. On 
average, the 30- to 40-year-olds have only completed grade 4. 
Unfortunately, in a modern economy, these people are left out. 
That is why their unemployment rate is so high, around 35 per 
cent. With a very unqualified labour force in a modern economy, 
they end up with a very high rate of inactivity.
<P>
	As for health services, the Far North is huge and can you 
imagine that there was no health support in the area before the 
first community clinic was opened in 1947. Two years later, a 
second clinic was opened in Kuujjuaq, Quebec.
<P>
	As many as 42 per cent of deaths in the area are caused by 
violent incidents. That is terrible! Of course, alcohol and drugs 
play an important role. These people have no hope, they are fed 
up with life and they turn to alcohol and drugs, thus causing 
many violent deaths.
<P>
	Regarding the contamination issue, the modern economy 
which was brought to the region by the Hudson's Bay Company 
and which was perpetuated by other companies has caused a 
major mercury and heavy metal contamination problem in the 
North. Significant levels of toxins are found in the breast milk of 
Inuit women.
<P>
	These people can no longer hunt for food. Instead, they have 
to buy products in a grocery store, just like you and I do every 
week.
<P>
	The situation is not much better with regard to housing. A 
two-bedroom house costs about $150,000 up North, as opposed 
to about $70,000 here. We have to understand that all the 
materials must be shipped to the North, and that is why the cost 
of housing is so high.
<P>
<B>(1815) </B>
<P>
	Those people have a standard of living that is still much lower 
than ours. Their life expectancy is very short, much shorter than 
ours. Since they live in such a vast territory, when they need 
health care, they often have to travel over huge distances to get 
treatment. In fact, this causes many deaths. As for the birth rate, 
which also causes housing problems, whereas we have 13 births 
per 1,000 people in Quebec, the rate for the Inuit in Northern 
Quebec is 34 per 1,000. We can see that their population is 
growing rapidly.
<P>
	The cost of living index is revealing: the average income of an 
Inuit is about $9,700. That is an important figure and, according 
to my calculations, that works out to about $187 a week. That is 
not much. As you and I will see, Madam Speaker, when we finish 
shopping for groceries later, there would not be much left to live 
on.
<P>
	I will mention the study I have in my hands; it was made by a 
group suggesting that they could provide food distribution in 
Canada's North much more efficiently. The company's name is 
Tikisaivik and they did a market study. Market studies can be 
done by anybody, but this one clearly shows us that food prices 
could be reduced by 10 to 20 per cent. That naturally would have 
a major impact on those people living on a budget averaging, as I 
mentioned earlier, $187 a week. As you will see, after we finish 
shopping for groceries later, there would not be much left to live 
on.
<P>
	With your permission, Madam Speaker, we will now go 
grocery shopping with our friends across the way and my 
colleagues on this side. We will go to the Northern Store in 
Resolute Bay. I will give you a price list for groceries compared 
to the prices in Ottawa. A litre of milk costs $3.69 in Resolute 
Bay, but $1.25 in Ottawa; a loaf of bread costs $2.85 in Resolute 
Bay, and $1.59 here; a five kilogram bag of flour costs $11.25 
there, and $4.49 here; a dozen eggs costs $3.85 there, and $1.29 
here; a bag of apples costs $3.63 there, and $2.62 here; a sack of 
potatoes costs $4.95 there, and $2.99 here; a can of peas-I like 
peas with turkey, it is very good-a can of peas costs $2.95 
there, and 69 cents here; apple juice costs $4.50 there, and $1.19 
here. We could go on and on; ground beef costs $8.97 there, and 
$3.72 here. At the end of the list, I have Tang orange juice which 
costs $2.85 there and $1.09 here in Ottawa. If we add all items 
together, the total will be $124.77 in Resolute Bay, compared to 
$49.28 in Ottawa. If your salary is $187 a week and your 
groceries cost you $124.77, there is not much left for the rest of 
the week.
<P>
	Why is this? It is due of course to the great distances and to a 
very complex distribution network which starts in Winnipeg, 
Ottawa or Montreal; for somes places, the goods are moved by 
train before being sent by plane; in others, they are moved by 
truck. In Quebec, they travel over something like 2,000 
kilometers by truck before being shipped by plane to the Far 
North. So, the proposal that is being made, and this is only an 
example, there  could be other proposals, as I said earlier, is that 
big 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5463"> 5463 </A></B>
<P>
carriers with a single supplier could go directly from Montreal 
to Iqaluit, where I went, and I explained a bit earlier the living 
conditions that exist there. So, we would avoid all the 
go-betweens, those who make a profit along the way.
<P>
<B>(1820) </B>
<P>
	These people are simply proposing that big carriers be used to 
bring everything to Iqaluit and, from there, the food would be 
distributed by small planes to villages of this huge territory.
<P>
	That proposal has the merit of reducing by about 10 to 20 per 
cent the cost of a shopping basket, as I explained. This is not 
insignificant. And there is also a series of other measures that 
would not only make this project viable, but also contribute to 
the Inuit really taking control of their lives in the Great North. 
This project would create 55 direct and indirect jobs in the Great 
North, particularly in Iqaluit, which is not insignificant, because 
in a context where 35 to 40 per cent of our people are without 
jobs, 55 jobs would be very welcomed in the Great North.
<P>
	There is also the whole issue of the federal government that is 
already paying a lot. Canada Post-we are talking about the 
famous local transportation-is paying $20 million a year for 
food distribution, while the study that we have here suggests 
that we may be able to do the equivalent for $9.8 million. So, not 
only the cost of food products may decrease, but shorter  transit 
times would allow for fresher products, while in the present 
system, when the food gets there-and I saw it myself- it is 
anything but fresh and barely acceptable. I think that we would 
not accept that in our shopping centres.
<P>
	I do not want to talk too much about investment, but the 
federal government might be asked to invest in this area. 
However, considering we could save between seven and eight 
million dollars annually on the way food products are 
distributed, it seems to me that the initial funding requested is 
negligible.
<P>
	Before I forget, I would like to say that Tikisaivik is 60 per 
cent Inuit-owned. Most of the shareholders are Inuit. Madam 
Speaker, I certainly do not want to be seen as playing favourites, 
but I took this company as an example because it had the best 
and most effective studies. Five students at the master's degree 
level did a market survey, and I have it here today.
<P>
	I will try to be brief, because I see that my time is running out. 
The objective is lower food prices. I think that is essential. In 
fact, it is the focus of my speech today. It is important for the 
well-being of the Inuit in the North, whether they are in Quebec, 
on Baffin Island or even closer to the Arctic, to have a food 
distribution system that would not be a drain on the family 
budget. Reducing the price of food will enhance the quality of 
life of the Inuit in the North, and that is the most important 
factor.
<P>
	Another point is improving food quality. Earlier, I talked 
about freshness. It will be possible to eat fresh vegetables at 
their peak and to improve the way they are handled, as opposed 
to what I saw in the shopping centres up there.
<P>
	Job creation. This is also a very important factor, as I said 
before. Fifty-five Inuit jobs could be created.
<P>
	Variety in the type of foods and creating a local economy. I 
think this is where the government could make a contribution so 
that the Inuit can escape the cycle of dependency in which they 
have been kept for too long. This plan for a modern economy 
will ensure that people can work in the food distribution sector 
in the North. In fact, this should be done by local people instead 
of companies from outside that do not know the local situation 
and operate on the premise that they have to give their 
shareholders a decent profit.
<P>
	Local people have a stake in the quality of life of the Inuit, and 
I think that is important.
<P>
<B>(1825) </B>
<P>
	I will conclude with a few words in Inuktitut-I hope I 
pronounce them properly-``nakurmiik toma'', which means we 
look to the future with confidence, and I hope that if the 
government takes a good look at how food distribution in the 
North can be made more economical, I think we can look 
forward to the future and ensure that the Inuit will have the 
quality of life they should have had many years ago.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I am pleased to have this opportunity to participate in tonight's 
debate. First of all, I would like to say, however, that I am not an 
expert in this area. I have often travelled to northern regions of 
our country to do some canoeing which I enjoy. I have often 
noted the regular prices of goods in the North. I congratulate the 
hon. member for Saint-Jean for his interest in this question and 
for moving this motion in the House.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	However I would like to stress that a reliable and affordable 
food distribution system is critical to the health and well-being 
of tens of thousands of Canadians living in northern isolated 
communities. This issue is one that must concern us as a 
national legislature in Canada.
<P>
	Here in the south the issue of food distribution is not as 
significant for one or either of governments or residents. 
Nutritious food is broadly available at supermarkets or corner 
stores throughout the areas in southern Canada. Distribution of 
food 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5464"> 5464 </A></B>
<P>
products is left in the hands of the private sector, with no 
demand for or need for government involvement.
<P>
	In the north the situation, as the hon. member has indicated, is 
dramatically different. Many communities are isolated and do 
not have year round surface access so food supplies must be 
delivered in some cases by air and in other cases by sea. 
Perishable foods, which as a rule are the most nutritious, are 
very difficult to arrange for in some of these communities. The 
expense of transporting perishable foods to remote communities 
increases their cost to consumers. The hon. member provided 
the House with a list, the variety of which I have seen in my 
northern experiences.
<P>
	These areas are not only isolated but they are often 
economically depressed. In some communities unemployment 
is as high as 85 per cent. Many families are living on social 
assistance, supplemented by whatever commodities they can 
harvest from the land.
<P>
	The northern food mail program therefore is vitally 
important. It subsidizes the cost of shipping perishable, 
nutritious foods to isolated northern communities, and puts 
these basic necessities within the reach of northern families. On 
many of the flights I have taken to various places in the north I 
am aware that the plane is filled with bread, eggs, milk and other 
perishables that are shipped to these communities. However, 
even with the assistance of this program, it is extremely difficult 
for families to afford the proper and nutritious food that is 
demanded. Without the program it would be virtually 
impossible to do so.
<P>
	I again stress that the prices the hon. member listed are not 
exaggerated. I am not exaggerating when I say the situation in 
the north would be desperate without this program. Government 
studies show that a family of four in isolated communities in the 
Northwest Territories would have to spend between $260 to 
$280 a week, or between 85 per cent and 110 per cent of their 
after shelter income for a basic diet. That is about twice the cost 
of a comparable basic diet in southern Canada.
<P>
	I would remind hon. members that Canada is a signatory to the 
United Nations declaration on the rights of the child. One of 
those rights is the right to adequate nutrition. Children should 
not go hungry, especially in our country.
<P>
	There can be no question in my submission as to the need for 
the program. The only question is what form the government 
subsidization for food distribution or food costs should be. We 
stress it is essential for the health of northern residents. It is also 
fair to say that the current program is achieving its intended 
purpose, notwithstanding the suggestions made by the hon. 
member.
<P>
	The northern food mail program is strongly supported by the 
communities it serves, by the food distribution companies, by 
the merchants that form part of the distribution system and by 
the consumers. Canada Post, which ships food products and 
other essential goods by air, has been a willing and vital partner 
in the program.
<P>
<B>(1830) </B>
<P>
	In spite of all that, I commend the hon. member for Saint-Jean 
for urging the government to reconsider the current northern 
food distribution system. There is always room for 
improvement and governments should be continually looking at 
new approaches to program delivery.
<P>
	Therefore I am extremely pleased to inform the House that the 
government has already taken steps to re-evaluate this program. 
In April the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development and the Minister of Health committed their 
departments to a full review of this essential service for the next 
year.
<P>
	This review will build on an evaluation of the program that 
was undertaken by consultants last year. It will include 
consultations with all the key stakeholders, including northern 
residents, merchants, air carriers, provincial and territorial 
governments, and aboriginal organizations.
<P>
	This consultation process is fully in keeping with the red book 
commitment, and I know the hon. member has read the red book 
extensively, to ensure that aboriginal people are fully involved 
in decisions that affect their lives. Toward this end, regional 
consultation meetings will be held in the north this September 
and October. Written views and recommendations will also be 
accepted by the government.
<P>
	My hon. colleague will be particularly pleased to hear that an 
interdepartmental committee is currently looking at terms of 
reference to guide this review. In addition to Health Canada and 
Indian and Northern Affairs Canada, the committee has 
representations from the Departments of Finance, Agriculture, 
and Human Resources Development, the Treasury Board and the 
Privy Council Office.
<P>
	This review will look at the issue of food distribution in the 
north from a very broad perspective. It will not just consider 
how much money is being spent or needs to be spent under the 
northern food mail program. It will address the fundamental 
question of whether or not this is the best way to ensure that 
northerners can meet their needs for food and other essential 
goods that are currently shipped under the program.
<P>
	It will review alternatives for food distribution and food costs 
subsidization including income support to ensure that people 
have money to buy the essential foods. The role of local food 
production, processing, and intersettlement trade will also be 
considered.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5465"> 5465 </A></B>
<P>
	The review may tell us in the end that the essential structure of 
the program is solid but that some fine tuning is needed. It may 
tell us that a completely new approach is needed, or that the 
program should be developed and looked after by another level 
of government, or indeed by an independent organization.
<P>
	In the meantime, hon. members have the government's 
assurance that funding for the program in its current format will 
continue. In 1994-95 a total of $14.1 million will be available 
for the food mail program. The bulk of this, some $13.6 million, 
will come from the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development. The remaining $500,000 will be contributed by 
Health Canada. This level of funding should be sufficient to 
maintain the postage rates at the current levels until March 31, 
1995.
<P>
	In closing, I want to say that I of course am not an expert on 
this subject. I have had some experience as I have indicated in 
the course of my remarks, but I am not an expert. The remarks I 
am alluding to and am in part reading have been prepared for the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development who is tied up at a committee meeting 
tonight and is unable to be here to deliver this particular speech. 
I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to the debate 
on his behalf and on behalf of the government.
<P>
	In conclusion, this House must acknowledge that the northern 
food mail program has proven to be an effective and efficient 
way of making food and other essential goods more affordable 
in isolated northern communities. As a member who travels 
there occasionally I am pleased to support it. I am confident that 
if any improvements can be made either in the short term or in 
the long term, they will be identified in the course of the review 
which the government has under way and which will be 
reporting in due course.
<P>
	I thank the hon. member for raising this issue in the House.
<P>
<B>(1835 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to participate in this debate on the motion presented by 
my colleague, the hon. member for Saint-Jean. The motion asks 
the government to make food distribution in Canada's north 
more effective and more economical.
<P>
	I could not help but notice that the member who spoke just 
before me must have done his research from exactly the same 
material that I did mine. His speech sounded a lot like the one I 
am about to deliver.
<P>
	We in the Reform Party are always looking for ways to 
improve on existing programs. I commend the hon. member for 
his initiative in bringing this motion forward.
<P>
	Since the 1960s the federal government in conjunction with 
the post office has made an effort to supply isolated northern 
communities with affordable fresh produce. Under the northern 
air stage program the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development pays Canada Post a subsidy to cover a portion of 
the cost of bringing nutritious and mostly perishable food to 
communities that have no year round road or rail access. 
Approximately 125 communities serving about 86,000 people 
are eligible under this program.
<P>
	As has been referred to previously, in the 1994 fiscal year this 
food mail subsidy will amount to some $14.1 million. Of this, 
$13.6 million will be coming from the Department of Indian 
Affairs and Northern Development, with about half a million 
dollars coming from the Department of Health.
<P>
	The residents of Canada's north face not only higher retail 
prices than we southerners but they also have a critical 
employment program. Most work in that area is, at best, 
seasonal in nature. The 1986 census showed that only 35 per cent 
of the aboriginal population 15 years of age or older were 
employed, compared to 60 per cent for all of Canada in the same 
age category. Of course a high unemployment rate means a 
lower annual wage and ultimately less purchasing power.
<P>
	The high cost of transporting goods in the north, even with the 
government subsidized food mail program, results in higher 
consumer prices. As was also alluded to earlier, a family of four 
in these isolated communities in the Northwest Territories 
would have to spend between $260 and $280 per week just for a 
basic diet. That is at least twice as much as we would have to 
spend in southern Canada for the same diet.
<P>
	A study by the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development conducted in 1990 concluded that by reducing the 
merchant's transportation costs, the air strategy subsidy has 
been an effective means of keeping the prices of food and other 
goods in remote areas lower than they otherwise would be. The 
study also found that an elimination of the subsidy would likely 
result in higher social assistance costs, higher health care costs 
and an increase in isolated post allowances for government 
employees.
<P>
	When the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development launched this study in 1990 there were no apparent 
alternatives. Today, as was indicated by my hon. friend, there 
may be a practical cost-effective solution for at least part of this 
problem.
<P>
	As was also alluded to by the mover of this motion there is a 
corporation which is prepared to establish a food distribution 
network. I certainly do not want to propose one corporation over 
another but where there is one, there are likely to be others.
<P>
	This corporation plans to supply food from a central 
distribution centre in Iqaluit which at the outset would serve 
some 38 northern communities. This unique Canadian 
enterprise predicts that the price of food  products in the north 
could be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5466"> 5466 </A></B>
<P>
reduced by 10 to 20 per cent. This will be possible because of the 
company's plan to reduce transportation costs and because its 
purchasing power will enable it to negotiate lower prices and to 
pass the savings on to the customers.
<P>
<B>(1840) </B>
<P>
	This company expects to save on transportation costs by 
regrouping products and chartering aircraft that would carry up 
to $75,000 worth of merchandise per flight. While its plan 
initially is to be a food wholesaler, the company estimates that it 
can receive 88 per cent of the market share in two years by 
supplying perishable food products and other consumer 
merchandise needed by northern residents but not currently 
available at reasonable prices.
<P>
	The overall cost to inaugurate the service is estimated to be 
some $1.65 million. Without going into too much of the 
financing it is safe to say that the company would probably need 
some government loan guarantee in order to get started. I think 
the operative word here is ``loan''. As was also mentioned by the 
mover of the motion, this company would create jobs for some 
people in the north and they also all are shareholders of this 
particular company.
<P>
	What benefit is this for the Canadian government? The 
company's prospectus predicts initial savings for the 
government of up to $3.6 million. It expects to train and employ, 
as was mentioned before, about 55 local people.
<P>
	Now as you know we in the Reform Party are strong believers 
in the free enterprise system. I am personally pleased to see that 
this group has taken the initiative to provide a better service to at 
least some of the isolated northern communities. It sounds like 
an excellent viable alternative.
<P>
	If this group is successful, it is likely that other entrepreneurs 
will follow its lead. Then there would be no need for the 
Government of Canada to provide so much subsidy to Canada 
Post for the food mail program.
<P>
	If this had been a votable motion, I would have asked that it be 
referred to committee. I would encourage our party to support 
this motion and refer it to a committee for further examination. 
Since it is not a votable motion, I would like to encourage the 
government.
<P>
	I was very pleased to hear the member opposite say that the 
government has plans to review this whole program and, I hope, 
these proposals. Certainly what I would encourage is that the 
government look at every possible proposal to make the food 
distribution in the north far more efficient and effective as well 
as improving the quality of the food and ultimately the diet of 
the people who live in the north.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morris Bodnar (Saskatoon-Dundurn):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I rise to address the House on the motion put forward 
by the hon. member for Saint-Jean.
<P>
	As my hon. colleague has explained, the northern air stage 
program is critical to the good health of many thousands of 
people living in remote northern communities. It is also a 
federal initiative that is not well known to many Canadians or to 
their representatives in this House. I would like to take this 
opportunity to provide some background on the program so that 
hon. members can fully appreciate its importance.
<P>
	The principal objective of the northern air stage program is to 
achieve food security in isolated northern communities. Food 
security is defined as a condition in which all people at all times 
have access to safe, nutritiously adequate and personally 
acceptable foods in a manner which maintains human dignity. 
Food security poses special challenges in northern Canada, 
where southern food is very expensive and retail competition is 
extremely limited.
<P>
	There are also increasing pressures on traditional food 
sources as well as concern about contaminants in the food chain. 
Hunting itself is expensive, especially for people who are 
already in low-paying jobs or are receiving social assistance.
<P>
	Under the northern air stage program the Department of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development makes payments to 
Canada Post to subsidize the cost of providing air parcel service 
to communities that are not accessible by year round surface 
transportation. This payment covers between 50 and 60 per cent 
of the cost of sending these parcels, most of which are food 
items. This is why the program is more commonly referred to as 
the northern food mail program.
<P>
<B>(1845) </B>
<P>
	This program has become a vital element of the northern food 
distribution system. It ensures that supplies of nutritious, 
perishable food are delivered to about 45 Inuit communities in 
the Northwest Territories, northern Quebec and Labrador. It also 
serves about 60 isolated First Nation communities in the James 
Bay region of Quebec, in Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and 
the Northwest Territories, and about 20 mainly non-aboriginal 
communities in Labrador and the north shore region of Quebec. 
In total, some 86,000 Canadians depend on the program.
<P>
	In 1989 the previous government announced that the food 
mail program would be phased out after more than two decades 
of existence. As might be expected, this announcement was met 
with a great deal of opposition both in the north and in the 
House, and the government decided instead to undertake a major 
review of the program.
<P>
	As a result of this review steps have been taken to make the 
program more equitable in terms of the subsidization rates paid 
<P>

<B><A NAME="5467"> 5467 </A></B>
<P>
for parcel delivery to  communities in the Northwest Territories 
compared to the provinces.
<P>
	The postage rates for shipments to the territories traditionally 
had been about three times as high as in the provinces. Important 
changes have been made also in how funding is applied. The 
lowest postage rates are provided now for nutritious, perishable 
food. Food of little nutritional value has been disqualified from 
funding.
<P>
	As well, shipments of alcohol and tobacco products are not 
subsidized under this program. Merchants or individuals must 
use commercial air cargo service, winter roads, or seasonal 
marine service for the resupply of these items.
<P>
	As a result of these changes Canada Post now charges 80 cents 
per kilogram plus 75 cents per parcel for nutritious, perishable 
food deliveries to all remote northern communities.
<P>
	Non-perishable food and non-food items can be mailed to 
isolated communities in the northern parts of the provinces for 
$1 per kilogram plus 75 cents per parcel. In the territories the 
rate for these items has been maintained at $2.15 per kilogram 
plus 75 cents per parcel.
<P>
	These changes have helped to reduce the prices of perishable 
food in the Northwest Territories. In some communities there 
has been a fairly significant reduction in the total cost of the 
basic northern food basket for a family of four.
<P>
	In Pond Inlet, for example, the cost of this basket decreased 
by more than $30 between 1991 and 1993. Unfortunately there 
are many communities in which increases in the cost of 
non-perishable food have offset the reductions in the cost of 
perishables.
<P>
	The lack of retail competition in many communities also 
continues to affect food prices. In Broughton Island where the 
local co-operative closed, leaving only one store in the 
community, the cost of the northern food basket actually 
increased by $40 between 1992 and 1993 despite the reduction 
in postal rates for perishables.
<P>
	From a nutritional perspective, consumption of perishable 
food in Inuit communities in the Northwest Territories has 
increased significantly since the postage rates began to decline 
in October 1991.
<P>
	In 1991-92 Canada Post shipped 758 tonnes of perishable 
food to the 10 communities in the Baffin region which 
traditionally have been on the food mail system. The following 
year when postage rates were further reduced these shipments 
increased by more than 35 per cent to 1,040 tonnes.
<P>
	Despite this increased consumption, there is still a great deal 
of room for improvement. A government survey of isolated 
aboriginal communities taken in 1991 and 1993 shows that the 
per capita consumption of store-bought perishable food 
continues to be much lower in the north than in southern Canada.
<P>
	As a result, the average intake of vitamin A and calcium is far 
below recommended levels and the average consumption of 
sugar in all communities is extremely high. This is obviously 
undermining the health of northern residents.
<P>
<B>(1850) </B>
<P>
	It is also evident that high food costs continue to be the major 
impediment to improved diets in the north. In the same survey I 
mentioned a moment ago, between 40 and 50 per cent of women 
reported that they were extremely concerned about not having 
enough money for food. In most communities, this was a greater 
concern than alcohol and drug abuse and family violence. The 
situation is obviously extremely difficult, but without the food 
mail program or some alternative, it could be much worse.
<P>
	It is clear that some form of subsidization must continue for 
shipments of nutritious, perishable food items to isolated 
northern communities. The residents of these communities 
already have many problems to deal with: poverty, 
overcrowding, family violence, alcohol and substance abuse, 
cultural disruption, gambling and so on. Hunger and poor health 
brought on by an inadequate food supply should not be added to 
the list.
<P>
	I want to reiterate that the government has already taken the 
action proposed by the hon. member for Saint-Jean. An 
interdepartmental committee is now developing the terms of 
reference for a fundamental review of the food mail program for 
the next year.
<P>
	I would urge my hon. colleagues to support this important 
initiative. The food mail program costs each Canadian taxpayer 
an average of about one cent per week. This is a very small price 
to pay, considering the enormous impact the program has on the 
health and well-being of 86,000 Canadians.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière):</B> I am pleased to speak to the 
motion introduced by my colleague from Saint-Jean which calls 
on the government to take the necessary steps to make food 
distribution in Canada's North more effective, and therefore 
more economical, in order to enable the Inuit to purchase higher 
quality food at a lower price.
<P>
	I listened closely to the speeches given by the hon. member 
for Saint-Jean and by my Reform and government colleagues. 
They have certainly defined the problem of food distribution in 
the North quite well.
<P>
	I want to use my time to focus in particular on the situation in 
the Nunavik territories, that is in northern Quebec and certain 
parts of Nunavut which correspond to what used to be called 
Keewatin, Baffin Island and Kitikmeot. Everyone no doubt 
agrees that the major problem with food distribution in the 
<P>

<B><A NAME="5468"> 5468 </A></B>
<P>
North is distance. On average, food is shipped over a distance of 
roughly 2,200 kilometres, and in some cases, of up to 3,000 
kilometres.
<P>
	Air and sea transportation modes are commonly used, with 
sea routes open only a few months of the year. To all intents and 
purposes, air transportation is the sole mode used. Obviously, 
transportation costs are astronomical, because after all, these 
territories are not inhabited by large numbers of people. 
Furthermore, considering the climatic conditions, costs can be 
exorbitant.
<P>
	The big problem for the people of these territories and the 
people concerned-in the territories that I looked at, involving 
27,000 people, including 8,000 in northern Quebec-is due to 
transportation costs and the cost of living. In these territories, 
the cost of living can be one and a half times or twice as high. So 
we see that it is a serious financial situation for these families. 
The situation is even more serious in that northern Quebec and 
northern Canada as a whole have a big problem with 
employment and inadequate incomes. For all practical purposes, 
salaries in these regions are modest, even very modest, and the 
cost of food is high.
<P>
<B>(1855) </B>
<P>
	The impact on the people's health is great. Many studies done 
in the South and some in the North show the connection between 
health and diet. That is why I wanted to speak on the motion of 
my colleague from Saint-Jean, because it really is a problem. I 
think that Parliament and the Canadian government must take 
the necessary action to deal with this situation for the good of 
the people concerned.
<P>
	For the territories I am considering, food is transported by air 
from two places: Churchill and Val-d'Or. From these places 
food products are sent to the North. There is no distribution from 
major cities such as Montreal, for example, where wholesalers 
and retailers could send their products directly to the North. 
Goods are distributed through the two communities I 
mentioned.
<P>
	Of course, it is not only a matter of costs but also of transit 
times, since goods sometimes take several days to reach their 
destination. It is a real problem but there are, of course, 
solutions. Many things are now being done to feed or help feed 
Northerners. There are government measures and subsidies, and 
I think the federal government's contribution is very 
worthwhile.
<P>
	But there are still some problems. Costs are very high. 
Additional transportation costs to the North range between 
$0.70 and $7.75 a kilo, so we can see why costs are prohibitive. 
But there may be solutions we can contemplate. It was brought 
to my attention that the Inuit designed a project promoting the 
establishment of a distribution centre in the North, in order to 
combine the goods brought on the same plane, thus reducing 
costs and ensuring adequate distribution to the villages 
concerned.
<P>
	I do not want to speak for and publicize the measures that may 
be taken by people who formed a private venture, but I think this 
project should be carefully analyzed by the Department of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development because it seems 
likely to lower food costs in the North and because this initiative 
comes from Northerners. There as elsewhere, the people 
directly concerned are in the best position to take the measures 
required to improve their economic and social conditions. Since 
this project is sponsored by Inuit, I think it could be of interest to 
the Department of Indian Affairs.
<P>
	This project also promotes the employment of Natives, of 
members of Inuit communities in the North. I think this should 
be one of our goals. Given the high cost of food in the North and 
the initiatives taken by Northerners, I urge the Department of 
Indian Affairs to consider the motion of my colleague from 
Saint-Jean and take the necessary steps to make food 
distribution in the North more effective. And if we can thus 
support Northerners willing to invest their money and energy in 
developing their communities, I think we should not hesitate to 
do so.
<P>

<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> There being no further 
members rising for debate and the motion not being designated 
as a votable item, the time provided for the consideration of 
Private Members' Business has now expired and the order is 
dropped from the Order Paper pursuant to Standing Order 96(1).
