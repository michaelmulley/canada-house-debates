	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (for the Minister of Industry, Minister 
for the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, Minister of 
Western Economic Diversification and Minister responsible for 
the Federal Office of Regional Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> 
moved that Bill C-67, an act to amend the Competition Act and 
another act in consequence, be read the second time and referred to 
a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, here we 
are considering one of the last bills of this Parliament, judging 
from the atmosphere and the number of members in this House. 
The bill before us is C-67, an act to amend the Competition Act.
<P>
	In the speech from the throne on February 27, 1996, the Liberal 
government announced a reform of the Competition Act as 
follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Government will introduce proposals to strengthen the economic framework 
with legislative improvements in the areas of competition, bankruptcy and 
copyright.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Consultations followed, and then a document setting out the 
proposed amendments to the Competition Act was released. The 
Competition Act was updated in the summer of 1994.
<P>
	After that, an advisory committee looked at all the proposals 
gathered, but the competition bureau continued parallel 
consultations on specific points in the law. This is the report the 
minister used to draft Bill C-67 aimed at modernizing the 
Competition Act. This bill, being debated this morning at second 
reading, will likely not reach the end of the process, if rumours of 
an upcoming election call are true, because the work will have to be 
done all over again.
<P>
	This is not a total disappointment, because we feel the bill lacks 
certain major elements, and, moreover, contains a number of 
instances of legal overlap-in which the  federal government 
intrudes in matters of provincial civil law, as we are constantly 
pointing out. The principle is always the same: Ottawa knows 
better than anyone else what is good for Canadians. This endless 
paternalism rears its ugly head in many laws. Yesterday, I had the 
opportunity to discuss the consideration of a private member's bill 
from the Reform Party.
<P>
	Ottawa's centralizing influence is clear. Having arrived here 
three and a half years ago, the Reform Party has now adopted 
Ottawa's style of demanding and centralizing all sorts of powers.
<P>
	What does this bill contain? Based on the legislative summary, I 
can tell you what the main changes proposed are.
<P>
	Obviously, the merger notification process is to be improved and 
the regulatory burden on business lightened.
<P>
	It is designed to ensure quicker and more efficient action against 
misleading advertising and deceptive marketing practices. I will 
come back to this, because we must not think that this is something 
new, that we have just found out about or thought of. There are 
already guidelines governing misleading advertising and deceptive 
marketing practices. It is also designed to amend and clarify the 
law applicable to sales price advertising by retailers.
<P>
	The fourth point is to provide the courts with new means of 
dealing with crime, through orders on consent and orders including 
prescriptive terms upon conviction.
<P>
	It is also designed to address the recent proliferation of 
misleading telemarketing practices that consumers have been 
subjected to and which undermine the value of telemarketing as a 
legitimate marketing tool. Telemarketing is a booming industry 
these days, as we all know, for probably having been solicited on a 
number of occasions for various things.
<P>
	It is true that the Competition Act had not been amended since 
1986 and that some updating is always useful-several of the 
provisions seem quite legitimate and appropriate, and will indeed 
help modernize the act to some extent-but there is a problem.
<P>
	There is a major problem with the number of new civil 
provisions concerning misleading advertising and deceptive 
marketing practices. This is a clear invasion of a provincial 
jurisdiction, namely local trade. I mentioned earlier that we keep 
hearing nice arguments like: ``It is  in the best interest of the 
people. In 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10218"> 10218 </A></B>
<P>
principle, this is a good thing''. But the government is taking 
advantage of the situation to invade a provincial jurisdiction.

	The House resumed at 10.26 a.m.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I hope 
this time I can finish my speech.
<P>
	I want to put things back in their context, since we had an 
unexpected break. We are debating Bill C-67, an act to amend the 
Competition Act and another Act in consequence. As I said earlier, 
in the throne speech, the government had already announced a 
reform to strengthen the economic framework, through legislation 
relating to competition, bankruptcy and copyright.
<P>
	A long process led to the bill before us today. A review was 
conducted as early as the summer of 1994. The Minister of Industry 
asked the director of investigation and research, appointed under 
the Competition Act, to comment on the act currently in effect. 
Following these comments, the minister launched, in June 1995, a 
consultation process by circulating a discussion paper on the 
proposed changes to the Competition Act.
<P>
	An advisory committee was asked to look at the various 
proposals received during the consultation process. Meanwhile, the 
Bureau of Competition Policy continued its consultations on 
specific aspects of the act. This exercise led to Bill C-67, which 
seeks to modernize the existing legislation. As I said, there are 
changes that do indeed modernize the act, which had not been 
reviewed since 1986, and that could bring significant 
improvements.
<P>
	However, the federal government is using this as an excuse to 
continue to slowly invade areas of provincial jurisdiction, 
including civil law. I will get back to this in a moment.
<P>
	I just want to briefly mention the provisions of the bill. There are 
improvements regarding the notice to be given when companies 
merge and when the regulatory burden is reduced. This will ensure 
speedier and more efficient resolution of misleading advertising 
cases and unfair trade practices. I will get back to this particular 
point.
<P>
	The bill also seeks to amend and clarify the law governing price 
advertising by retailers. It also gives the courts new remedies 
following convictions for criminal  activity in the form of consent 
orders and prohibitive orders to include prescriptive terms.
<P>
	Finally, it sets out to address the problem of the recent 
proliferation of deceptive telemarketing practices to which 
consumers fall prey and which detract from telemarketing as a 
legitimate marketing practice. As I mentioned earlier, 
telemarketing is on the increase, but many use it fraudulently. We 
have all seen television programs or news reports of many dubious 
and very often misleading practices designed to swindle hundreds, 
even thousands, of dollars out of individuals on many occasions.
<P>
	There are, as I pointed out, many legitimate provisions that will 
update the legislation. The new civil provisions in the case of 
misleading advertising and deceptive marketing practices, 
however, constitute direct interference in local commerce, an area 
under provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	In 1989, the Supreme Court recognized that the previous 
legislation, the Combines Investigations Act, overlapped an area of 
provincial jurisdiction. This recognition notwithstanding, the Court 
ratified the provisions, relying on paragraph 91(2), which gives the 
federal government the power to regulate trade and commerce.
<P>
	So, once again, this is not the first time our political system or 
our Constitution has led to overlap that is expensive in practice 
because it results in confusion and conflict between levels of 
government, and is the source of many problems.
<P>
<B>(1030)</B>
<P>
	We know that this is not unique to the trade sector. It happens in 
a lot of cases, as we see on a regular basis. In a number of areas, 
health for one, the government is trying to expand its powers or 
interventions, while at the same time decreasing its contribution, 
for example its transfer payments for health. The federal 
government must have found that this money did not do much for 
its visibility, so it decided to cut transfers to the provinces.
<P>
	For example, it cut $2 billion in transfer payments for health and 
then injected millions and millions of dollars into initiatives so that 
the federal government's logo will be highly visible on the cheques 
issued, whereas transfer payments would not have had that 
visibility. The bottom line is that the citizens are clearly penalized. 
We can see that just about all of the provinces are having to 
undertake major reforms, and often to make drastic cuts in these 
areas, as a result of the drastic cuts in the funding they receive.
<P>
	The federal government's attempt to expand its jurisdiction is, 
therefore, not unique to trade and competition. As recently as 
yesterday, the Prime Minister announced that he had, during his 
mandate, modernized federation and made major constitutional 
reforms. So he said, to my great amazement. The only changes the  
federal government has made have been hit and miss, and 
peripheral, always with the goal of ensuring that Ottawa and the 
federal 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10219"> 10219 </A></B>
<P>
machinery will have an increasingly large role to play in numerous 
areas of jurisdiction.
<P>
	The only time it pulls out of anything is when there is no more 
money left. Then the federal government says: ``OK, now we are 
going to pull out''. Yet it makes sure to hold on to all of its sources 
of revenue. They say: ``Oh no, we will no longer interfere with 
forestry or mining, for example, because we have just found out 
these are provincial jurisdictions, but we will keep the cash''. The 
federal government does have jurisdiction over that. It has no 
struggles with its conscience when it comes to keeping hold of the 
money.
<P>
	As I said earlier, the court had recognized these encroachments 
in the former legislation but nevertheless validated them, saying it 
was impossible to do otherwise, considering section 91(2) of the 
Constitution. The court decided there were factors that mitigated 
the seriousness of these encroachments.
<P>
	In the final instance, creating a system of civil remedies was 
justified if the government could demonstrate there was some 
justification for doing so. When the federal government can do 
that, this mitigates the seriousness of federal intrusion. We find this 
in a decision by the Supreme Court which, in most cases, comes 
down on the same side and seldom on the side of Quebec, so draw 
your own conclusions. This is just another example of the highest 
court in the land interpreting the legislation it gets from people like 
the hon. members opposite, who are gradually diminishing the 
powers of the provinces and find excuses for these multiple 
intrusions by the central government, and I say central, because 
this has gradually become a centralist government.
<P>
	With the court's blessing, the government has taken advantage of 
all this flexibility it has been given by a court that is equally 
centralist. And the result today is Bill C-67, which introduces more 
duplication and intrusion in areas under provincial jurisdiction. 
This is not necessarily about occupying a legal space that had been 
vacant so far. Some provinces already have measures to deal with 
these practices.
<P>
	In the existing legislation, misleading advertising and deceptive 
marketing practices are treated as matters to be dealt with only in 
criminal court. That is as it should be, because of the federal 
government's powers with respect to criminal law. However, Bill 
C-67 proposes to establish a parallel non-criminal mechanism to 
deal with these offences, although, as I said before, in most cases 
these areas are already regulated by the provinces. In Quebec, we 
have the well-known Consumer Protection Act, whose purpose is 
to protect consumers against certain practices.
<P>
	Now we will be stuck with two sets of legislation that deal with 
misleading advertising and deceptive marketing practices. We will, 
or perhaps I should have said we  would, because I have the distinct 
impression that we will not manage third reading of this bill before 
an election is called, considering the intense activity we are seeing 
among Liberal members today. This is a party preparing to hit the 
campaign trail. In fact, from what I can see, several members all 
already on the campaign trail.
<P>
<B>(1035)</B>
<P>
	So, there will be two sets of rules. Which one will prevail? This 
will be very confusing for consumers. How well protected will the 
consumers feel in all this? Which legislation will they feel protects 
them best? There already is legislation. It is clear that legislation 
like Quebec's Consumer Protection Act can be used effectively 
against such practices.
<P>
	Now, there will be another, federal act, and the public will know 
that. They will wonder what its scope is and what it deals with. This 
is another instance of unnecessary overlap. There are many 
businesses, but not all of them use misleading advertising and have 
deceptive practices. Businesses, small and medium size ones in 
particular, complain bitterly about the regulatory burden, all the 
government red tape and the legalities imposed on them. They find 
it quite confusing.
<P>
	In the face of initiatives like this one, which will result in two 
co-existing acts, one federal and one provincial, regulating 
business practices, how can we expect these people to concentrate 
on doing what they do best? They are not in business to fill out 
government forms. These are entrepreneurs who have found a 
niche where they feel comfortable, can innovate and want to sell 
their products.
<P>
	I recently had a discussion with an entrepreneur in my riding, 
who was telling me that it makes no sense whatsoever, that one full 
time employee spends one full day every week filling out forms. 
Out of a dozen employees, one person works full time to fill 
various forms for different levels of government. One employee 
out of a dozen spends all his or her time on this. The entrepreneur is 
not being unreasonable. He realizes that money must be collected 
and taxes must be paid to governments. However, one wonders 
about the usefulness of many regulations and about the extent to 
which the information will actually be used.
<P>
	It is not always easy to gather all this information. The more 
information there is, the more public servants it takes in Quebec 
City and in Ottawa to sort out that information, to check it out and 
to do something with it. In the end, people are lost in a maze of 
data. Provisions such as those in Bill C-67 will definitely not help 
the process.
<P>
	One wonders why. What will be the next step once this bill takes 
effect? Tell the provinces they have to withdraw, as the bill gives 
the federal government control over this area, since telemarketing 
and trade practices transcend boundaries?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10220"> 10220 </A></B>
<P>
	The federal government probably thinks it is the one in the best 
position to exercise that control. Given the globalization of trade, 
what would the next step be? The federal government will not be 
in a position to take that next step. Therefore, what will happen, 
given that companies do businesses in several countries? Will 
international legislation be required to monitor such activities? 
No, because the provinces can do it. The fact that a business 
engages in sales, trade, soliciting or telemarketing outside the 
province or, conversely, that an outside company engages in 
telemarketing solicitations in a province, does not mean we cannot 
legally monitor their actions.
<P>
	It may be different in the case of referendum acts, because if 
money is spent outside the province, the Quebec legislation cannot 
regulate that activity. This is a different issue but, normally, a 
province should be able to monitor, through legislation, what goes 
on on its territory. Quebec already has a number of provisions to 
that effect.
<P>
	Instead of stubbornly trying to find new ways to set standards 
that will apply from coast to coast, the Minister of Industry should 
have had the courage to introduce provisions that would have 
promoted greater access to the Competition Tribunal. Currently, 
the director is the only person who can go before the Competition 
Tribunal. If the director does not take action in a given case, the 
private parties cannot go to the tribunal for corrective action. 
Therefore, under the current act, only one person can initiate 
proceedings.
<P>
<B>(1040)</B>
<P>
	In September 1996, not so long ago, the Secretary of State for the 
Federal Office of Regional Development for Quebec, speaking to 
the bar association, admitted that his government had abandoned 
for the time being the idea of allowing private parties access to the 
tribunal.
<P>
	The director of the Bureau of Competition Policy, however, 
admitted in a speech to the Canadian Institute, and I quote: ``Given 
the extent of commercial activity covered under the legislation, it is 
difficult for the director to investigate all complaints that strike him 
as justified and to institute proceedings, thus leaving certain parties 
without recourse''.
<P>
	This comment makes it plain that there are cases in which certain 
parties suffer damages and seem to be justified in lodging a 
complaint. He seems to be saying that he is unable to investigate all 
complaints, even those that he feels are justified. We are not talking 
about unjustified complaints, but about those he feels are justified. 
He is therefore unable to take action accordingly and the end of his 
comment is significant: ``[-] thus leaving certain parties without 
recourse''.
<P>
	Rather than continue to interfere in civil matters at the provincial 
level, an attempt could have been made, in this bill, to sort this 
problem out. It is widely recognized  in our legal system that there 
is no justice without access. Changes could have been made under 
the bill regarding access to the tribunal in order to allow those 
adversely affected by the supposed violations to correct these 
injustices.
<P>
	The government could have shown leadership and implemented 
a more balanced system that is more accessible and that makes 
recourse available to private individuals, while ensuring that 
prosecutions do not serve strategic interests or objectives 
incompatible with the purposes of the Competition Act.
<P>
	Obviously, we want to see this done in such a way as to avoid all 
sorts of problems. In the interest of avoiding duplication, the 
government should ensure that recourse available to private 
individuals is not already covered by the provinces. If the 
provinces are already addressing these sectors, the federal 
government should not interfere.
<P>
	I will also say a few words about telemarketing. The advisory 
committee concluded that telemarketing was a serious problem in 
Canada that should be tackled at the federal level, not at the 
provincial level, because of interprovincial and international 
ramifications. With that kind of reasoning, one can justify any 
encroachment on any sector whatsoever. If the problem is serious 
and would have an impact on more than one province, the federal 
government would, according to the committee, have a moral 
obligation to intervene.
<P>
	I may recall that the Consumer Protection Act regulates 
telemarketing quite satisfactorily. As they do in so many other 
cases, the provinces can get together on this and ensure their 
regulations are compatible. This is not to say that provincial 
regulations are infallible, but my point is that the provinces are 
certainly capable of exchanging information and data with a view 
to improving their respective legislations.
<P>
	Although Bill C-67 merely criminalizes certain unlawful 
telemarketing practices, we must warn the federal government 
against intervening in this area, as it did in other cases, by creating 
civil remedies. The problem is that civil remedies are a matter for 
the provinces to decide.
<P>
	This flexible federalism they talk about is often one-sided. 
Although the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and the Prime 
Minister keep repeating that their federalism is very flexible, it 
looks a lot more like paternalistic federalism. The government 
thinks it is on the side of the angels when it says it has the right to 
intervene in areas under provincial jurisdiction. But now that it has 
substantially reduced transfers to the provinces, as I said earlier, it 
says the provinces are not doing what they ought to be doing. It 
knows better than anyone else what is good for consumers.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10221"> 10221 </A></B>
<P>
	That is why we are against this bill. However, considering the 
parliamentary calendar, it is quite likely the proceedings on this 
bill will have to wait until the next Parliament.
<P>
<B>(1045)</B>
<P>
	Let us hope in the meantime that the departments concerned will 
have another look at their work and will see there is overlap and 
infringement in a number of sectors which are covered by civil 
remedies and which should remain, as in the present case, under 
provincial jurisdiction, so problems are not continually being 
created.
<P>
	We often feel here that we create more problems than we solve. 
It could be true in this case. In the end, it will not benefit those this 
bill was intended to serve: consumers.
<P>
	I would remind you that it is a major sector, and the director of 
the competition bureau has indicated he is unable to properly carry 
out the mandate. He said he cannot investigate every complaint, 
many of which are well founded. That then is a practical problem. 
They could have said that some people did not have access, that 
their complaints were founded but left in limbo, and wonder what 
they could do to give them recourse.
<P>
	They start with a problem and look for solutions. They look 
around and see the provinces have already done things that come 
within a given field of intervention. What comes under federal 
jurisdiction and what can the federal government do without 
always trying to bypass the provinces in order to have jurisdiction 
in the sector? So, if we have the opportunity to do so, we will vote 
against this bill.
<P>
	Since you are going to interrupt me, Mr. Speaker, and this may 
be my last statement in this legislature, I would like, before I 
conclude, to thank the people in my riding whom it has been my 
great pleasure to represent and whom I would be delighted to 
continue to represent as of June 2 or 3, the day after the elections 
are expected to be held.
<P>
	I would like to say that, in a future Parliament, people may count 
on me and on the Bloc Quebecois to again remind this government 
it often acts in a way that complicates things, in a way that ends up 
costing more and doing less for people.
<P>
	People will have someone speaking in their defence and not 
coming to where they live to defend Ottawa's goals. This is what 
we will be offering them in the coming weeks, and I am sure that 
this is what the people of many Quebec ridings, including, I hope, 
the riding of Témiscamingue or the region of 
Abitibi-Témiscamingue, will want in Parliament.
<P>
	I therefore thank you and remind you that we will do everything 
to ensure that the bill never comes to pass-either in this 
Parliament or in the next. Some  provisions have merit, are good 
and could be adopted. Others will have to be added and still others 
will have to be withdrawn. We hope that, in the usual course of a 
bill in the next Parliament, where we will begin some of this work 
again, the appropriate corrections will be made.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to have the 
opportunity to address this House on Bill C-67, an act to amend the 
Competition Act and another act in consequence.
<P>
	The subject we are discussing today deals with a fundamental 
element of the economic framework governing business in Canada. 
Indeed, the free play of market forces is the very basis of our 
politico-economic structure and shapes all relationships between 
Canadians and companies doing business in Canada and abroad.
<P>
	Canadians, whose quality of life is the best in the world, base 
their economic relationships on the principle of competition. It is 
through competition that productivity, efficiency and innovation 
are improved, thereby enhancing Canada's competitiveness, our 
prospects for growth and our standard of living.
<P>
	The <I>Competition Act</I> plays an essential role in ensuring that this 
system continues to flourish. The <I>Competition Act</I> applies to all 
economic sectors and to all types of trade in Canada. It is the 
legislative framework by which Canadian society, through 
Parliament, ensures that businesses compete on a fair basis.
<P>
	The <I>Competition Act</I> is also an important means of ensuring 
protection of the public interest in deregulated industries. It 
responds well to this government's desire to adopt less costly 
solutions for Canada by avoiding direct intervention in these 
economic sectors.
<P>
<B>(1050)</B>
<P>
	The amendments we have introduced seek to improve the code 
of conduct that defines the parameters for business conduct in 
Canada. With this bill, we can continue to promote a climate of 
vigorous competition while protecting consumers against 
deceptive or misleading practices. These changes will contribute to 
a healthier marketplace, and ultimately, to a better environment for 
economic growth and jobs.
<P>
	In our discussion of the need for a healthy marketplace, we must 
make particular reference to the role of consumers. I would like to 
take this opportunity to consider the relationship between healthy 
competition amongst businesses and the effective protection of 
consumers' interests.
<P>
	Experience has shown that, where international and domestic 
markets exist, consumers enjoy lower prices, a greater choice of 
products, better quality goods and services, and better information 
about these products.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10222"> 10222 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As a result of the continued rivalry within markets where 
competition has free rein, manufacturers and merchants must 
innovate to anticipate consumers' needs. To keep its market 
position, each business must earn and renew consumers' trust 
daily. The most competitive markets are those where consumer 
information flows without restriction and options are avidly sought 
out before goods and services are offered.
<P>
	When markets are competitive, consumers are more apt to 
inform producers and suppliers of needs and expectations. They are 
better informed of the choice of products, services and prices so 
they acquire greater power vis-à-vis producers and suppliers that 
must vie for their business. That is why the free play of market 
competition needs to be preserved and promoted. After all, 
restrictive practices that lessen competition are profitable only to 
the businesses that engage in them. They also decrease the overall 
welfare of society which is the reason we must be sure to keep 
vigilant and put an end to such practices.
<P>
	A thorough revision and update of the Competition Act was last 
carried out in 1986. We want this key element of business law to 
continue to operate effectively. Accordingly, there is a need after 
10 years of experience with the current model to ensure the 
legislation keeps pace.
<P>
	The amendments we are considering today are not intended as an 
in depth reform of the act which is generally serving Canada well. 
They will however clarify the law in certain areas, promote 
voluntary compliance and provide a better and more effective 
variety of tools to the Competition Bureau. This is a balanced and 
focused package of amendments that result from broad 
consultations with consumers, businesses and experts. It reflects a 
high degree of consensus.
<P>
	I will now deal with the main amendments we are proposing to 
show how they will promote healthy competition and lead to the 
faster and more efficient resolution of problem situations. To put 
the proposed amendments in context, I should first indicate that the 
current act contains provisions on criminal matters as well as those 
of a non-criminal nature. The criminal offences it deals with 
include price fixing, bid rigging, predatory pricing, retail price 
maintenance, misleading advertising and other deceptive 
marketing practices. In these matters the onus is on the crown to 
prove beyond a reasonable doubt that an offence has been 
committed.
<P>
	The non-criminal or civil matters by contrast may be reviewed 
by the Competition Tribunal of Canada. These include mergers, 
abuse of dominant position, refusal to deal, consignment selling, 
monopoly tied selling, market restriction and delivered pricing. For 
reviewable matters the bureau may apply to the tribunal for a 
remedial order.
<P>
	The bill before us builds on this foundation of enforcement tools 
and remedies, supplements the criminal provisions with a new 
offence related to deceptive telemarketing and creates a new civil 
approach for most instances of misleading advertising and 
deceptive marketing practices.
<P>
	The bill also improves existing provisions relating to merger 
pre-notification, prohibition orders and ordinary price claims. The 
common denominator reflected in these amendments is a focus on 
clarifying the law for business and improving enforcement 
efficiency and effectiveness.
<P>
	Telemarketing is a legitimate method of product promotion. 
However, when we refer to deceptive telemarketing, we are 
focusing on the use of deceptive representations and abusive tactics 
in the course of telephone promotions. Deceptive telemarketing has 
defrauded victims of large sums of money in the process. It has 
tarnished the reputations of honest telemarketers. Cleaning up this 
industry could be an asset to business and consumers.
<P>
	Small and medium size businesses are also frequently targets of 
deceptive telemarketing. The Competition Act should not allow 
dishonest undertakings whatever their modus operandi to increase 
criminal operators' profits at the expense of honest businesses.
<P>
	Currently the act prohibits the use of false or misleading 
representations for the purpose of promoting the supply or use of a 
product or promoting any business interest. The act also contains 
provisions relating to promotional contests. However, the existing 
law does not specifically forbid certain practices that have come to 
be associated with deceptive telemarketing. These need to be 
addressed.
<P>
<B>(1055)</B>
<P>
	This bill will create a specific new offence relating to these 
practices. The maximum penalty on summary conviction will be a 
fine of $200,000 or a year in jail or both. On indictment the 
maximum penalty will be a fine at the discretion of the court or jail 
for up to five years or both.
<P>
	This new provision will apply to situations involving use of 
interactive telephone communications whether initiated by a 
telemarketer or by potential customers. The telemarketer will have 
to provide certain important information at the outset of the 
telephone conversation. Also, a number of deceptive practices will 
be prohibited.
<P>
	To close on this subject, let me just add that another amendment 
will make it easier to obtain interim injunctions from courts to 
quickly put an end to the activities of deceptive telemarketers. 
These injunctions will also be available against third parties to 
enjoin them from providing products or services to deceptive 
telemarketers.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="10223"> 10223 </A></B>
<P>
	These amendments represent a considerable improvement in the 
current law. They address the most problematic practices that have 
been identified. They also incorporate penalties that will provide 
better deterrence.
<P>
	In this area of competition law, the proposed amendments will 
be of great benefit to all stakeholders, consumers as well as 
businesses. As I have already mentioned, the current law contains 
provisions relating to misleading and false representations. 
Violations of these provisions are addressed solely through the 
criminal law process, prosecutions in criminal courts. Advertisers 
can avoid being convicted if they establish they have acted with 
due diligence.
<P>
	Under the proposed amendments there will still be a blanket 
prohibition of deceptive advertising and marketing practices. The 
Competition Act will offer the bureau two avenues, criminal 
prosecution or civil resolution, to rectify conduct which though 
problematical has occurred unintentionally. Under this new civil 
regime most of the deceptive practices now prohibited will remain 
practically unchanged but will become reviewable matters.
<P>
	The bureau can call upon a judicial member of the tribunal, the 
federal court or provincial superior court, and redress can be 
obtained through court order or by way of consent. Orders to 
publish information notices as well as to pay administrative 
monetary penalties for individuals may be issued. Last, consent 
orders may be entered into and will then be legally binding.
<P>
	Measures such as these will expedite decision making and 
ensure that it is done consistently and by a specialized body.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleague, you will have the floor after 
question period of course.
<P>
	It being almost eleven o'clock, we will now begin statements by 
members.

	<B>Mr. Gar Knutson (Elgin-Norfolk, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, today I 
rise to pay tribute to the fine work of Dr. Thomas Curran who is 
about to retire from his position of senior research officer, science 
and technology division, research branch, Library of Parliament, a 
position he has held since 1975.
<P>
	Over the past 20 years Dr. Curran has ably served on committees 
of the environment, forestry and fisheries, health and welfare, as 
well as others. Dr. Curran has authored reports on a wide range of 
topics including cloning, AIDS, global warming, gene therapy and 
acid rain. Dr. Curran is one example of the highest quality of  
support the Library of Parliament provides to parliamentarians in 
helping us deal with complex issues in service to Canadians.

Speaker, I, as well, will not be running again in the next election. I 
want to take this opportunity, first of all, of thanking the 
community of Regina and the constituents there who have been 
re-electing me.
<P>
	Our family came from the camps of southeast Asia to Regina, 
Saskatchewan in the early fifties and that community has honoured 
me by re-electing me since 1979.
<P>
	The House of Commons is a tremendous institution that serves 
Canada well. It does need to change and as an organic institution I 
am sure it will. In the future I hope that some members will come 
here through proportional representation because the voices of 
hundreds of thousands of Canadians are not heard in this 
Parliament because of our electoral system.
<P>
	Also, I hope in the future that the committee system will be 
strengthened because it is in the committee system that ordinary 
members of Parliament, regardless of what political party they are 
from or whether they are in the  government or in the opposition,

winner of Canada Mortgage and Housing's flexhousing design 
competition.
<P>
	CMHC is promoting flexhousing as new concept in residential 
design. Instead of the occupant changing homes, homes can change 
to suit the occupant. A home office, a private suite for aging 
parents or growing children, features that meet the special needs of 
a single parent or a person with a disability, flexhousing homes can 
accommodate all of them.
<P>
	CMHC launched a competition last year to encourage designers 
and builders to create flexible, adaptable and affordable homes that 
are both comfortable and attractive. Mr. Varias' winning design 
reflects CMHC's flexhousing principles of adaptability, 
accessibility and affordability, and incorporates a number of

unemployment insurance reform and the new Employment 
Insurance Act, the federal government has reduced access to 
benefits for pregnant women and adopting parents. By changing 
the criteria and introducing a new formula, the government has 
restricted access to parental leave.
<P>
	Quebec, however, will establish a broader and more generous 
parental insurance system. To do so, the Quebec government has to

<P>

Liberal MP dares to speak up for his constituents against gun

Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to speak on ANZAC day. Some will 
wonder why are we recognizing ANZAC day in Canada.
<P>
	ANZAC day originally commemorated the landing of the 
Australian and New Zealand army corps at the Gallipoli peninsula 
in Turkey on April 25, 1915.
<P>
	Since that time and with the battles of the second world war and 
the ensuing battles in Korea and Southeast Asia, those countries 
have chosen this to be their remembrance day, similar to our 
remembrance day.
<P>
	The significant feature about ANZAC day in Gallipoli is the 
little known fact that the Royal Newfoundland Regiment played a 
significant part in that battle. This regiment suffered tremendous 
casualties at Gallipoli, both from Turkish gunners and from the 
terrible flood which swept through their encampment.
<P>
	The Royal Newfoundland Regiment has served with great 
honour at Gallipoli and in France. It made great sacrifices. We want 
to thank them for their contribution.

Speaker, this morning we learned that the federal government as 
well had a secret financial plan in the event of a yes vote in the 
1995 referendum, something the federal finance minister has 
always refused to admit.
<P>
	This is indeed proof that, beyond the political discourse of hard

their respective responsibilities so that the will of the people of 
Quebec, as expressed democratically in a referendum, can be 
realized in an atmosphere of calm and trust.

the airborne regiment. After the incidents in Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
the army took punitive action. However, in the case of Cambodia, 
the government simply put the lid on the whole affair, and no one 
really knows whether any punitive action was taken in the case of 
military personnel.

disciplinary measures were taken, and if so, what kind?
<P>

<P>
	We must remember that this action took place five years ago 
under the former Conservative government. It is an action that has 
been investigated and where there were grounds for charges, 
charges were laid.

	The whole background of the investigation is available to the 
hon. member at his convenience in the reading room of the

physical and verbal abuse of Cambodians, arms trafficking, 
unauthorized use of cannon and pornographic videos.
<P>
	I realize people in the army like videos, but I think making 
pornographic movies at the Crown's expense for an armoury in 
Toronto is going a bit too far.
<P>
	Does the minister agree it is high time the government woke up 
and introduced specific measures to improve co-operation between 
civilian and military authorities, in order to prevent further 
occurrences of this kind, which are totally unacceptable?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Richardson (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Minister of National Defence has taken a number of 
actions to shore up training programs to bring about better ethics 
and performance in the field by our soldiers and our officers as part 
of the renewal plan. Action is in place in our training programs at 
both the non-commission level and the officer level.
<P>
	The article in the paper, which has been dressed up with liberal 
use of adjectives by the writer to gain readership, may be under

<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in the wake 
of these troubling revelations about the events in Cambodia, the 
minister ought to agree with us that the government has made a 
mistake in terminating the work of the Somalia Inquiry, when it 
would have put an end to  all this secretive attitude which is so 
common with Canadian Armed Forces staff.
<P>
	Can the minister, or his parliamentary secretary, tell us why the 
Armed Forces staff persist in worrying about the possible political 
fallout of the abuses committed by personnel becoming public 
knowledge, and in denying the public's right to the truth?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Richardson (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr.

following up on a newspaper article.
<P>
	This action took place five years ago in 1992-93. It was 
investigated. The file on the action is open to the member. He can 
review it at any time. Some of the things that were questioned may 
be valid. Certainly it was investigated and the file was closed, but it 
is available under the access to information.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is quite 
obvious that the answer will not be forthcoming this morning. 
What the parliamentary secretary is doing at the present time is 
rerunning an old tape we have been hearing over and over for the 
past two or three years. We have asked questions about the Somalia 
inquiry, we have made proposals to the government, but it is 
obvious that nothing works; no answers are forthcoming.
<P>
<B>(1125)</B>
<P>
	Does the Minister of Defence, or his parliamentary secretary 
who is here today, agree with us that, out of concern for openness, 
his government ought to give thought to creating, in accordance 
with Professor Albert Legault's proposal, a position of 
parliamentary military ethics commissioner reporting to the House 
of Commons, who could carry out a totally independent 
investigation into the Armed Forces?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Richardson (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister

honourable, but in this situation with the feigned acting we know 
the election is at the door.
<P>
	If the member had read the report of Justice Dickson he would 
know that military justice was reviewed by Justice Dickson. We 
intend to bring forward all the information and reforms he 
suggested. They will be tabled and will be part of military justice in 
the future.

	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Liberal pre-election brochure is kind of like a bad smell. I got in the 
mail yesterday. I threw it away and there it was again in the 
newspaper this morning. It is kind of like something I stepped in 
and I just cannot shake off my shoe.
<P>
	The first thing-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order. I ask the hon. member not to get in any 
deeper than he is.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solberg:</B> Mr. Speaker, when you open up the brochure one 
of the first things it says is: ``Why support the Liberal Party of 
Canada?'' Why indeed after 37 tax increases and after broken 
promises on things like the CBC, day care and a number of other 
issues? The GST promise has to be the biggest whopper of all.
<P>
	It is very clear the Liberal record is in complete disarray, that the 
Liberal record is in flames. Why would people of right mind 
support the same hucksters who sold them off last time, ran away 
with their wallets and dashed their hopes in 1993?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the Liberal record is a solid record of achievement for Canadians 
across the country. If my hon. friend is aware of a bad smell it must 
be coming from the Reform platform he is carrying around in his 
pocket.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, when 
we look at the next section of the government's election document 
it says: ``Liberal policies at work''.
<P>
	Maybe their policies are at work but certainly Canadians are not 
at work. Right now we have 1.4 million unemployed Canadians, 
almost exactly what it was when the government came to power. 
There is 20 per cent plus unemployment in Cape Breton and 
Newfoundland. The national youth unemployment figure is 17 per 
cent. The real unemployment rate when we count all the people 
who have dropped out of the workforce is approaching 11 per cent.
<P>
	Given that horrid record, is the government really intending to 
run on the worst job creation record since the great depression?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member keeps making a statement at the end of his 
questions that is not accurate as far as I am aware. With respect to 
the Liberal record on unemployment there is certainly more to be 
done, but the unemployment rate has gone down by some two 
percentage points since the last election and close to 850,000 jobs 
have been created.
<P>
	When we talk about a good start, this beats the smelly fresh start 
program of the Reform Party. The hon. member should clean out 
his pockets. Then he will feel a lot better.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, so 
many people have dropped out of the workforce that 
unemployment is virtually unchanged from when the government 
came to power.
<P>
	One of the other headings in the document states: ``Make a 
donation today''. Indeed if a donation is made, in return the 
Liberals say they are willing to listen to you. Certainly it has 
worked for Bombardier. We know that.
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
	I think the Liberal grease my palm approach to gathering public 
opinion says a whole lot about their opinion of regular Canadians 
and about their opinion of why they should listen to regular 
Canadians. Given their record of pork-barrelling, scandal, broken 
promises and incompetence, why should Canadians believe 
anything they say when they go to Canadians in the upcoming 
election?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Canadians will believe Liberals far more than members of the 
Reform Party when they listen to questions like the one just placed 
because there is an inherent contradiction in the Reform position.
<P>
	On the one hand Reformers are complaining about not enough 
jobs being created and on the other hand they are criticizing 
measures taken by this government, like the Bombardier 
investment, to create thousands of jobs. No wonder the Reform 
Party is not believable.
<P>
	Speaking of dropping out, according to the polls and according 
to the statements in the House every day, the dropouts are all on the 
side of the Reform Party. They are quitting and running as fast as 
they can. Why do they fear the electorate? Let them answer that 
question.

	On April 14, the minister said, in response to a question by the 
Bloc Quebecois on the future of Mirabel airport, that he was 
prepared to co-operate with any organization wishing to improve 
the utilization of Mirabel, without specifying whether he would 
take part in the joint commission created by the Quebec

Mirabel, and this is just the beginning.
<P>

<P>
	Given the enormous responsibility of the federal government 
in this matter, and considering that its mistakes resulted in 
considerable losses for the Lower Laurentians, will the minister 
finally be clear and say that he will take part in the work of the 
commission announced by Premier Bouchard?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Don Boudria (Minister for International Cooperation 
and Minister responsible for Francophonie, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to reply to the hon. member. As the member knows, 
she and I both represent ridings that are close to Mirabel.
<P>
	The member raised a serious issue, and I find it totally 
unacceptable that her colleague, who represents another region, 
would not think that the future of Mirabel is important. It is 
definitely important to me and to my constituents.
<P>
	Let us not forget that ADM made the decision regarding 
Mirabel. As everyone knows, that decision was not made by the 
federal government. Moreover, ADM was set up by a previous 
government and is structured in such a way as to preclude federal 
representation. I am prepared, and so is the government, to do 
whatever must be done to help protect the future of Mirabel airport.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, if the 
minister really cared about this issue, he would give us a clear 
answer today.
<P>
	On April 16, the transport minister announced that he would 
spend another $60 million, paid in part by Quebec taxpayers, in 
addition to the $185 million given to Toronto's Pearson airport on 
March 25, to make up for his blunders.
<P>
	With an election about to be called, will the minister show the 
same stubbornness regarding Montreal's airports and say that he is 
prepared to sit on the commission to correct the mistakes he made 
regarding Montreal and Mirabel?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Don Boudria (Minister for International Cooperation 
and Minister responsible for Francophonie, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my colleague, the Minister of Transport, indicated that the 
Government of Canada had contributed as much, if not more, per 
passenger, at Montreal's airports than at Toronto's facilities. The 
hon. member opposite knows that.

	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have been looking at the brochure that the Liberals have been 
sending around to households throughout Canada and I guess we 
see the election strategy is before us. However, I carefully looked 
through it and cannot find anything about the broken promises on 
the GST. I cannot see anything in there about the promised day care 
spaces they were going to create. I cannot see anything in there 
about the Somalia affair. I cannot find any of the highlights of this 
35th Parliament.
<P>
	I looked but there are no coupons for the 1.4 million 
unemployed. It is too slick to line a bird cage.
<P>
	I ask the Minister of the Environment, is it true that this brochure 
is actually the Liberal contribution to national composting week?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I might just as well ask the hon. member about the fresh start 
program or the no start program that is being carried around by his 
colleague in his pocket, which may be why he is complaining about 
a bad smell. Why does it not say anything about the Reform plans 
to destroy the pension system, the health care system and the social 
welfare system for Canadians?
<P>
	Furthermore, I wonder if we might get some kind of medical 
opinion as to why the hon. member and his colleagues are so 
fascinated by the Liberal program. There must be something in it 
they really fear if they keep talking about it. It confirms it is a good 
program for all Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
hon House leader has caught me. I have found some interesting 
things in here. The three things I found most interesting were 
reforming the Young Offenders Act, reforming the parole system 
and reforming the employment system in this country. If we really 
wanted to do it right we would just elect a Reform government and 
this document would not be necessary.
<P>
	In the spirit of non-partisanship to which we have become 
accustomed I wonder if the environment minister could tell us what 
he is going to do to protect all Canadians from the noxious gases 
that seem to be flowing freely here in the House of Commons 
today.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I think the answer would be embarrassing to his colleague who 
asked the first question because he is the first who complained of a 
noxious smell. I identified for him the source, the Reform  program

question is directed to the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs.
<P>
	The Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs is still all over the 
map with the linguistic school boards issue. After cosying up to 
Alliance Quebec and <I>The Gazette</I>, he tried to drive a wedge 
between Quebec and the bishops; now he is painting extreme 
scenarios in an effort to encourage Catholic pressure groups.
<P>
	Can the minister tell the House what his real objective is in 
making this kind of remark and in stirring up possible conflict?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the government's objective is of course to help 
Quebec society modernize its school system. That has been our 
objective from the beginning.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois has given vent to all sorts of insults and 
accusations since this issue first came up. The question is why, and 
the answer is crystal clear: from the beginning, the Bloc has tried to 
create antagonism between anglophones and francophones with 
respect to the school issue, because the Bloc wants to make the 
Liberals out to be a pro-English, anti-French party.
<P>
	The Bloc is wasting its time, because the Liberal Party of Canada 
includes all sectors of Quebec and Canadian society.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
psychology, what the minister just did is called projecting.
<P>
	There has been a failure to act. We have heard his inflammatory 
remarks, and now, with the company he has been keeping over the 
last few days, we do not know what to think.
<P>
	Can the minister confirm that his sole objective is to delay the 
amendments Quebec has requested by calling for a joint 
parliamentary committee, which will never see the light of day in 
the 35th Parliament in any event, and that all this is merely a 
strategy so that the movements opposing Quebec's consensus can 
get organized and block this consensus that exists in Quebec?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council

Mr. Speaker, the Government of Canada has said it was very happy 
to sponsor the proposal  submitted to us by the National Assembly 
and thus to help modernize the school system.
<P>
<B>(1140)</B>
<P>
	We are going to do this with full respect for the democratic 
values of Quebecers and of other Canadians. The official 
opposition, the Bloc Quebecois, keeps droning on about Alliance 
Quebec and <I>The Gazette</I> for reasons I explained earlier, but 
everyone disagrees with the Bloc on this issue.
<P>
	Let me give a few examples. Agnès Gruda of <I>La Presse</I> had this 
to say: ``In the end, Ottawa is right. Pushing for a vote on the 
constitutional amendment before the federal election is completely 
artificial. It has taken Quebec City two years to come up with its 
request, which it forwarded to Ottawa only two weeks before the 
election call. There is no national emergency that requires us to 
move full steam ahead in an emotional climate that can only be 
detrimental to the debate''.

the question my colleague from Saskatchewan asked, I cannot help 
but think that canoe museums, hotels, tennis courts and boxes in 
stadiums do not help to move grain.
<P>
	We are coming to an election apparently. That means people 
seeking election will go to the electorate and make promises.
<P>
	I would like to ask a question of the government with respect to a 
very explicit promise made in 1993 by the Liberals. It was written 
right in the red book. It was the one that said the government would 
appoint an independent, underline independent, ethics counsellor 
who would report directly to Parliament. These words are directly 
from chapter six of that book. That has not happened. The ethics 
counsellor is not independent. He reports to the Prime Minister and 
he does not report to this House. He has not yet.
<P>
<B>(1150 )</B>
<P>
	As the Liberals now go to the electorate, how will they explain 
this discrepancy between what they have said in words and what 
they have actually done when they had a clear opportunity to fulfil 
that promise without anything impeding them?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it has been a real achievement to create the position of ethics 
counsellor. One can debate about whom the individual should 
report to but I think this is a meaningful response to the 
commitment in the red book.
<P>
	If my hon. friend is serious about his question, then he will 
abandon his position as a Reformer and support the Liberals so we 
can go on and make further progress in this area of ethics. We have 
a government we can be proud of when it comes to integrity, 
comparable to any other in Canadian history.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the question 
actually was not whether or not what the counsellor is doing is fine. 
It really is not. In the red book the Liberals promised that he would 
be independent and that he would report to Parliament. That has not 
happened.
<P>
	As these members of Parliament seek re-election, what do their 
words, whether printed or spoken, really mean? Are they prepared 
to fulfil them if they get another mandate? And we do not think 
they will.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
a very substantial part of the Liberal platform has been put into 
effect. We can be proud of what we have achieved.
<P>
	The hon. member's question strongly creates the impression that 
he expects the Liberals to be re-elected. Otherwise he would not 
have asked the kind of question he did. I thank him for his 
endorsement. I will use it in my next pamphlet.

	<B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question was intended for the Minister of Foreign Affairs.
<P>
	Since February 28, Quebec volunteer Serge L'Archer has been 
held hostage in the Sahara desert by Toubou rebels who are against 
the authoritarian regime of Niger.
<P>
	Who is in a position to inform the House of the latest 
developments surrounding the detention of Mr. L'Archer in Niger?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Don Boudria (Minister for International Cooperation 
and Minister responsible for Francophonie, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it will be a pleasure to answer the hon. member's question.
<P>
	I personally had an opportunity to meet authorities of Niger, 
including a number of ministers, the ambassador and several 
others, and I asked them to do everything in their power to secure 
Mr. L'Archer's release as soon as possible.
<P>
	I personally spoke to members of Mr. L'Archer's family and to 
his employer, the CECI. The Canadian government is still 
demanding the release of Mr. L'Archer. Our ambassador has 
intervened locally, on our behalf, to have him released as soon as 
possible. We have reiterated our request for his immediate release 
to those who are holding him hostage.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, since so 
far, the minister's actions do not seem to have been successful, I 
would like to ask another question.
<P>
	Considering that Libya has right from the beginning financed 
and trained the group of rebels who are holding Mr. L'Archer 
hostage and that it still seems to have some influence with this 
group, does the government intend to put pressure on Libya in an 
attempt to obtain the release of Mr. L'Archer?

	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Minister of Transport has falsely claimed that the $60 
million Pearson settlement combined with the $185 million rent 
gift to the new Pearson airport authority will create 10,000 jobs. 
The truth is with legal costs added to those figures no jobs will be 
created without the spending of additional money. Where is that 
going to come from?
<P>
	The Pearson contract that the Liberals breached prohibited the 
contract holder from introducing a passenger head tax at terminals 
1 and 2. What is the Minister of Transport going to do to ensure that 
the new airport authority will not subject those using Pearson 
airport to a passenger head tax to pay for his costly error in 
handling the Pearson contract?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Don Boudria (Minister for International Cooperation 
and Minister responsible for Francophonie, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
if this government had structured the agreement with the 
independent airport authority in such a way as to tie its hands 
completely, the member would be the first to criticize the 
government.
<P>
	We have created a local airport authority in Toronto as we have 
done in other cities across Canada. We strongly believe that there is 
no one better than the local community to direct the airport and 
make it work properly and in a prosperous manner for the benefit of 
all Canadians, not simply to hand it over to a group of lobbyists the 
way the Reform Party was advocating we do not that long ago.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister completely ignored the question. I will try a 
different transportation mode.
<P>
	In answer to an earlier question he stated that the infrastructure 
program was the answer to the highway repair system.
<P>
	The total federal spending on the infrastucture program 
amounted to 40 per cent of one year's collection of federal excise 
revenues on fuel. The transport committee travelled from one end 
of the country to the  other and heard from a majority of people that 
there had to be dedicated revenues of at least 20 per cent of that fuel 
tax revenue. The government ignored them.
<P>
	Why does the government bother to consult with Canadians if it 
is going to ignore what it hears?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Don Boudria (Minister for International Cooperation 
and Minister responsible for Francophonie, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I take note of the further input and support by the hon. member 
along with his other colleagues for the infrastructure program 
initiated by the Liberal government.
<P>
	He knows of course that the program was immensely successful. 
Obviously that is why he is asking for an extension of the program. 
Need I remind Canadians as well that over 100,000 jobs were 
created by the previous infrastructure program. Phase two of the 
program is well under way. The province of Ontario has yet to sign 
but we hope it will very shortly. This will enable municipalities that 
have the greater responsibility for roads together with the province 
and the federal government to construct even better roads in the 
province, which is our wish.
<P>
	I thank the hon. member for his continued support for the 
infrastructure program.

Speaker, as a rural member of the House, I have often heard the 
minister of agriculture state that he has set goals in conjunction 
with the provincial ministers of agriculture for greater exports in 
agriculture products and agri-food.
<P>
	The minister has set that goal at $20 billion of exports by the turn 
of the century. How well are we doing in reaching that goal and 
what strategies are in place to serve agriculture in this area?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Fernand Robichaud (Secretary of State (Agriculture 
and Agri-Food, Fisheries and Oceans), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, when 
we look at agri-food exports it is certainly a good news story, the 
kind of story Canadians want to hear about.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Statistics Canada figures show that we are already exporting 
$18.8 billion worth of agri-food and agricultural products. We must 
recognize however that this could not have been achieved without 
the efforts by this government, and the minister in particular, in 
leading trade missions abroad to promote Canadian agricultural 
and agri-food products.

	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the government House leader. He is aware that it has 
been discovered that the amendments which were made to the 
Canada Elections Act with respect to staggered voting hours are 
going to have an adverse effect on Saskatchewan, I might say an 
unexpected effect on Saskatchewan. An oversight that was built 
into the legislation has come to light.
<P>
	The Prime Minister received a letter from the premier of 
Saskatchewan asking that the government address this problem in 
some way, either legislatively or alternatively, and I quote from the 
letter: ``that the Chief Electoral Officer provide a clear 
interpretation of the original intent of this amendment''.
<P>
	I wonder what the intention of the government is with respect to 
this problem and whether it will be consulting with the Chief 
Electoral Officer to see whether anything can be done about this.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I thank my hon. friend for a useful and important question.
<P>
	I draw his attention to the actual text of the legislation. It 
establishes voting hours by time zone and not by province. 
Saskatchewan has two separate time zones, each covering a 
different portion of the province.
<P>
	This is not limited to Saskatchewan. I am informed that part of 
eastern Quebec is in a different time zone than the rest of the 
province. It is in the Atlantic time zone. I am referring to an area in 
the Gaspé. Part of Ontario is in a different time zone than the rest of 
the province, namely, Kenora-Rainy River.
<P>
	The matter could most easily be dealt with if the legislature of 
Saskatchewan passed a relevant resolution to declare the province 
of Saskatchewan all under the same time zone for electoral 
purposes. In any event, I am informed that because of the way the 
act is written it does not mean that anyone in Saskatchewan is 
deprived of the right to vote in normal voting hours.
<P>
	I have consulted with the Chief Electoral Officer in this regard 
and if there is further information to provide I will be happy to do 
so.
<P>
	I want to point out again that the legislation is not based on 
voting hours in provinces but on time zones. That is the reason why 
this issue has arisen.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> This brings question period to a close today, 
notwithstanding the fact that I do not have any more information 
than you have.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This may have been our last question period of the session.
<P>

<P>
I want to thank you very much for serving this Parliament and 
Canada as well as all of you have served our people.

respect to how this Parliament was organized in its early days in 
terms of party status and other matters like that, I have never 
questioned your dedication to this institution and the fairness you 
have been able to exercise within the limits that have been set and 
that to some degree you set for yourself early in this Parliament.
<P>
	For the benefit of others, although some members of Parliament 
may well know this, some of us have had the benefit of attending 
Forum for Young Canadians dinners. One thing that has always 
struck me in talking to these young people has been the very deep 
impression that you, Mr. Speaker, have made on them. I am not 
kidding when I say that they rave about you, Mr. Speaker, at dinner 
time. They have come away from the sessions they have had with

work together for the common good within a strong and united 
federation, Canada.

the territory of Canada except with its consent by due process of 
constitutional amendment, and that no province or territory may

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Can the Minister of Justice indicate the number of lawyers defending the federal 
government in the lawsuit initiated by former Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and 
the daily cost of the court case to the federal government?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> During the 
course of the litigation, the government retained five agents to 
represent the interests of the defendants: Messrs. Claude-Armand 
Sheppard, Yvan Bolduc, Vincent O'Donnell, Bruno Pateras, and 
Harvey Strosberg.
<P>
	The agents were assisted as required by members of their 
respective firms. The government negotiated substantial reductions 
from the agents'normal hourly rates.
<P>
	As of January 17, 1997 the Crown had paid out $935,732.60 in 
lawyers fees.
<P>
	In addition to the agents, lawyers with the Department of Justice 
in Montreal and Ottawa have worked on the Airbus litigation as 
required.

<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> In so far 
as the Ministry of the Solicitor General of Canada is concerned, 
the answer is as follows:
<P>
	As is a matter of public record, on December 2, 1993, the 
Minister of Justice wrote a letter to the Solicitor General of Canada 
regarding allegations of wrongdoing by the former government. On 
December 9, 1993, the Solicitor General of Canada forwarded the 
letter to the RCMP.
<P>
	Upon receipt of the informatiom, the RCMP undertook a review 
of the allegations in the Minister of Justice's letter, which it should 
be noted, did not refer to Airbus. Having undertaken this review, by 
letter of February 22, 1994, the RCMP advised the Minister of 
Justice that there were insufficient grounds to commence a 
criminal investigation.
<P>
Question No. 65-<B>Miss Grey:</B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Can the Prime Minister's Office and the Privy Council Office indicate whether 
anyone within those offices, or on contract, was involved in any way in the Airbus 
affair, or the ensuing investigations, and the nature of their involvement?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime 
Minister, Lib.):</B> No one in the Prime Minister's Office was 
involved in the Airbus investigation.
<P>
	The Privy Council Office did not know of the September 29, 
1995 letter of request to the Swiss authorities, or of the RCMP 
investigation of Mr. Mulroney until after the letter became public 
knowledge on November 18, 1995.
<P>
	If the Royal Canadian Mounted Police approached any 
department of the public service, it was as part of the investigation. 
Accordingly, the information requested cannot be released at this 
time.
<P>
Question No. 67-<B>Mr. Speaker (Lethbridge):</B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Can the Minister of Justice indicate any/all individuals he, or his executive 
assistant, met with pertaining to the Airbus affair, including the name of the 
individual(s), the date(s), and the subject matter of their meeting?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.): </B>The Minister of 
Justice had no knowledge of the Airbus investigation that was the 
subject matter of the lawsuit commenced by Brian Mulroney until 
November 4, 1995 when he was contacted by Mr. Mulroney's 
counsel, Roger Tassé.
<P>
	Subsequent to the initiation of the lawsuit on November 20, 
1995, the Minister of Justice and his executive assistant received 
briefings concerning the status of the litigation as required.
<P>

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="COMPETITIONACT">COMPETITION ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-67, 
an act to amend the Competition Act and another act in 
consequence, be read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was speaking about some changes to 
the act concerning deceptive advertising and marketing practices.
<P>
	The Competition Act will offer the bureau two avenues, criminal 
prosecution whereby the bureau will refer cases to the attorney 
general if an infraction has occurred, or civil resolution to rectify 
conduct which, though problematic, has occurred unintentionally. 
Under the new civil regime most of the deceptive practices now 
prohibited under the act will remain practically unchanged and will 
become reviewable matters.
<P>
<B>(1230)</B>
<P>
	The bureau can call upon either a judicial member of the 
competition tribunal, the Federal Court of Canada or a provincial 
superior court. Redress can be obtained through a court order or by 
way of consent. Orders to publish information notices as well as to 
pay administrative monetary penalties of up to $200,000 for 
companies and $100,000 for individuals may be issued. Consent 
orders may be entered into and will then be legally binding.
<P>
	Measures such as these will expedite decision making and 
ensure it is done consistently and by a specialized body in the vast 
majority of cases. At the end of the day we will have quicker and 
more effective resolution of instances of misleading advertising 
and deceptive marketing practices.
<P>
	I now turn to regular price claims, essentially comparisons 
between regular selling prices and cut rate prices. As we all know 
consumers like to wait until products they want are on sale rather 
than buy them at the regular price. Advertising showing how much 
one can save over the regular price can therefore be a powerful tool 
to attract consumers. The Competition Act already prohibits 
materially misleading regular price claims.
<P>
	Representatives of the retail sales sector as well as some 
consumer groups have asserted that the act does not give clear 
guidelines on what kind of regular selling price claims may be 
made.
<P>
	Under the amendments the government is proposing, 
representations as to the ordinary selling price will be valid if they 
meet one of two tests. One is based on the price charged for a 
substantial volume of sales. The other is based on the price at 
which the product has been offered for sale for a substantial period 
of time. According to the new provisions, when determining 
whether an order is called for the judge will take into account the 
nature of the product and the relevant geographical market. Even if 
the representations fail to meet either test no order will be made if 
such representations are not otherwise misleading.
<P>
	On quite another subject, we are proposing amendments to the 
provisions requiring advance notice to the bureau of large merger 
transactions. An efficient pre-notification process is essential to 
allow the bureau to determine whether a transaction would have a 
negative effect on competition before the transaction is finalized.
<P>
	A number of measures are proposed that would improve the 
process for businesses by reducing the regulatory burden for no 
issue transactions. This will be achieved through reduced 
information requirements and greater flexibility to waive the 
requirement for pre-notification or for some of the information 
required under certain circumstances.
<P>
	Other measures are directed toward facilitating the review of 
transactions raising potential concerns. For  example, the amend-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10242"> 10242 </A></B>
<P>
ments will provide more realistic conditions for the issuance by the 
tribunal of a provisional order to delay the completion or 
implementation of a proposed transaction.
<P>
	It is widely recognized by experts that some provision for 
requiring pre-notification of mergers is essential to preserve the 
effectiveness of the merger review process. A more efficient 
process will benefit the players directly involved: the bureau and 
the merging parties. Ultimately improvements are beneficial to 
society as a whole if they help to safeguard competition, which is 
still the best way to provide consumers and business with a wide 
choice of products at the best possible prices.
<P>
	I will say a few words about the amendments dealing with 
prohibition orders. The Competition Act provides that the court 
may, when it has found a person or company guilty of an infraction, 
issue a prohibition order enjoining the offender from continuing or 
repeating the offence. Independent of any finding of guilt, the 
prohibition order can also be issued if the parties consent and upon 
resolution of a contested case.
<P>
	Amendments proposed in this area open up some new 
possibilities. In some cases it may be preferable to require 
defendants to commit themselves to the adoption of acceptable 
behaviour. That is why we propose to allow the courts to issue 
orders requiring defendants to take specific measures to conform to 
the requirements of the act. Among other advantages this may help 
avoid lengthy and extensive litigation.
<P>
	In the past amending the Competition Act has been along and 
difficult task. The amendment procedure we have adopted is based 
on partnership and respect among stakeholders often with differing 
views. The amendments we are proposing reflect a consensus 
among stakeholders. We hope to build on the choices we have 
made to provide for a more regular review of the vitally important 
Competition Act.
<P>
	As I said in my earlier remarks before we broke for question 
period, the act is functioning generally well but these changes will 
enhance its operation.
<P>
	The details of the bill under review will be considered in detail in 
due course. I have merely provided an introduction to some of the 
principal changes contemplated and an indication of the benefits 
that may result from its passage. This package of amendments is 
balanced and achievable. It is the result of extensive consultation 
with stakeholder group representatives and consumers. The private 
sector, the judicial community, academia and law enforcement 
agencies took part in the deliberations of a consultative panel 
created to make recommendations to the government. I thank all 
individuals and organizations that have worked with dedication to 
review the Competition Act, as well as those who have provided us 
with the benefit of their opinions.
<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
	Before coming to the House on being elected in 1993 
competition law was an area of practice for me. I can say from my 
experience as a practitioner in this area that the consultation that 
goes on with the private sector, with people interested in the 
strength and operation of the Competition Act, is one of the best 
examples of the system working properly.
<P>
	The amendments to the act at this time, as did earlier revisions to 
the act, represent a considerable effort on the part of government 
and stakeholders to arrive at valuable and timely solutions to 
sometimes complex issues. The proposals before us today have 
been carefully developed and considered. I believe they merit the 
support of the House.
<P>
	That concludes my remarks on the Competition Act, but I might 
just take a moment while time still remains to me to say this may 
well be my last speech before the House. I will not be seeking 
re-election. As such I wanted to take a moment, first and foremost, 
to thank the people of St. Paul's riding in central Toronto, for 
putting their confidence in me and asking me to come here in 1993 
to represent them. It has been an honour and privilege to do so.
<P>
	I also recognize the staff of the House, table officers, pages and 
all those who assist us in the functioning of our work. If people 
watching our proceedings on television think it is easy and 
straightforward, they really need to know the hard work that goes 
on behind the scenes, behind the curtain, at the table and in the 
Speaker's chair to assist us in moving business along in the House.
<P>
	I also thank members of my personal staff in Toronto and in 
Ottawa who have contributed enormously to my ability to serve my 
constituents. They have my gratitude.
<P>
	In closing I will say a word about serving in the House and about 
my colleagues. Some people refer to serving in Parliament as 
serving in an exclusive club. I think that is a confusing description. 
It is exclusive only in the sense that it provides Canadians from all 
parts of the country the opportunity to meet, work together, share 
views, learn, grow and do a better job as a result. In that sense it is 
very exclusive and a privilege.
<P>
	The House is a microcosm of our great country. It has been my 
honour to serve.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Duncan (North Island-Powell River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it was an eloquent ending to a speech by the parliamentary 
secretary when he talked about his departure from Parliament.
<P>
	This is my first Parliament. I was rather surprised at the lack of 
surprise in the calling of an election when in actual fact we do not 
have a fixed election date. Many things have to be put in place to 
run the electoral process. I know I am off topic but it all points to 
the fact that a fixed election date is probably a pretty good idea. It  
works in a lot of democracies and I think it would work very well 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10243"> 10243 </A></B>
<P>
here as well. It would certainly level the playing field in terms of 
all parties knowing exactly where they stand.
<P>
	I am joining in the debate today on Bill C-67, an act to amend the 
Competition Act. From the outset I would like to say the Reform 
Party has no serious reservations with the bill. In fact we are 
pleased to see the inclusion of some of the amendments to the 
Competition Act. It is important that we keep the debate about 
competition open for discussion, what it is and how it could or 
should function. In this way we could continue to respond to a 
changing business environment and to ensure the legislation set out 
is both flexible enough to respond to the marketplace and 
efficiently administered in order to be effective.
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
	The Reform position on competition is clear. We support 
vigorous measures to ensure the successful operation of the 
marketplace, such as promoting competition and competitive 
pricing and strengthening and vigorously enforcing competition 
and anti-combines legislation with severe penalties for collusion 
and price fixing. The intent of Bill C-67 supports this philosophy.
<P>
	It is useful to review the Competition Act to see how it works 
and what it is designed to do. It is designed to promote competition 
and efficiency in the Canadian marketplace. It forms the legislative 
framework for some of the basic principles for the conduct of 
business in Canada, applying with few exceptions to all industries 
and levels of trade.
<P>
	We can all agree the act is honourable. The act contains both 
criminal and non-criminal provisions. Criminal offences include 
conspiracy, bid rigging, discriminatory and predatory pricing, price 
maintenance, misleading advertising and deceptive marketing 
practices.
<P>
	As we see in Bill C-67 the issue of telemarketing falls under 
these provisions. Other areas that fall under the act are reviewable 
matters including mergers, abusive dominant position, refusal to 
deal, consignment selling, tied selling, market restriction and 
pricing. This would include such areas and items as gasoline 
pricing.
<P>
	The enforcement and administration of the Competition Act are 
carried out by the director of investigation and research who heads 
the competition bureau at Industry Canada. At present that 
individual is Mr. Konrad von Finckenstein. When the bureau 
becomes aware of a possible competition offence, the facts are 
examined to determine whether they raise a concern under the act. 
If the director believes on reasonable grounds that an offence under 
the act has been or is about to be committed, an inquiry is 
commenced.
<P>
	Inquiries can also commence when the minister so directs or 
when six Canadians make an application for an inquiry. Recently 
we saw an inquiry commence on the issue of gas pricing in the 
Ottawa area, for example.
<P>
	Although the director can use formal investigative tools to 
gather information, in cases where the director believes a criminal 
offence has occurred matters are referred to the Attorney General 
of Canada for prosecution before the criminal courts.
<P>
	Bill C-67, which the Reform Party supports, enhances the 
current Competition Act. We are pleased to see the issues of 
misleading advertising and deceptive marketing enhanced and the 
issue of deceptive telemarketing addressed. The act currently 
addresses deceptive marketing. Bill C-67 provides for a more 
effective means of punishment and is an improvement.
<P>
	If consumers find themselves victims of deceptive marketing, 
for instance false advertising, the bill sets out new provisions that 
will make the system more effective both in terms of 
administration and cost. Under the current act, when infractions are 
committed criminal prosecution is obligatory. The new provisions 
will create a dual regime of civil and criminal offences.
<P>
	In the case of serious infractions involving repeat offenders or 
fraud, a criminal regime will be maintained. In less serious cases 
where an individual or corporation was unaware of the law, the 
amendments would allow for the infractions to be addressed 
through civil court by means of fines, cease and desist orders and 
information notices. This means that civil offences could be 
addressed without lengthy court delays which can only be an 
advantage to both the consumer and the taxpayer.
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
	Another area which catches our attention is that of the provisions 
set out to address deceptive telemarketing. Telemarketing as 
defined by the bill is the practice of using person to person 
telephone communications for the purpose of promoting directly or 
indirectly the supply or use of a product, service or any other 
business interest.
<P>
	We can all attest to the growth of the telemarketing industry, 
somewhat ruefully perhaps. I am sure we can all tell stories of 
being interrupted once or twice by an eager telemarketer during 
dinner or at some other inconvenient moment. How best to handle 
the interruption is a subject for discussion. In my case, I am 
thankful for the invention of the answering machine and private 
listings.
<P>
	Whether we appreciate the work of telemarketers or not, there 
are serious issues concerning telephone marketing which should 
concern us all. It is safe to say for the most part that telemarketers 
are above board, but as with any industry, there is the possibility of 
deception. Many people, particularly seniors, are at the risk of 
being taken advantage of at the hands of unscrupulous people.
<P>

	In the buying and selling of products over the phone there are 
rules of logic we must all follow. It is wise for instance to be 
suspicious of anyone who might offer money or grand prizes over 
the phone for a small fee. As well, many of us know it is 
inadvisable to give a credit card number to anyone over the phone.
<P>
	As we do more and more everyday activities by phone and as 
progress and technology make that more and more possible, the old 
rules simply do not apply across the board. It is not that simple. 
This can leave the consumer confused: Do I or do I not provide my 
credit card number to this individual?
<P>
	The only solution is to ensure that laws exist to address 
unscrupulous practices. In order for both the industry and the 
consumer to benefit, the consumer needs assurance that the 
marketplace is being monitored to assure fair and legal practices. 
Where telemarketing is concerned, sound competition policy not 
only means a confident consumer, it means an educated consumer.
<P>
	By setting out what is required in order to conduct fair 
telemarketing practices, Canadians will know what they can 
demand from any financial transaction conducted over the 
telephone. We are satisfied that the provisions set out in Bill C-67 
address these issues sufficiently.
<P>
	I mentioned earlier that it is important to keep discussion on 
competition open in order to ensure its effectiveness and efficiency, 
but the issue of competition has taken on a broader context in the 
last few years. This is particularly the case where global 
competition now plays a direct role in determining the economic 
policies of Canada.
<P>
	Competition has become the mantra of the 21st century. 
Governments around the globe promote its merits and its values in 
generating wealth and in contributing to innovation. Competition 
dictates policy in everything from free trade in softwood lumber to 
the information highway and whether we have direct to home 
satellites in Canada.
<P>
<B>(1250 )</B>
<P>
	If we look closely, we will see that competition is the reason 
given by governments to explain many things, including why they 
must spend money on business subsidies and infrastructure 
programs for example. In fact it seems that the notion of 
competition has dominated every policy paper, federal budget, 
government initiative, piece of legislation, committee report, study 
and countless conferences we have seen since the government 
came to power. Sometimes it is sad to say it is nothing more than a 
euphemism for political patronage and/or vote buying.
<P>
	For the average consumer it must be confusing. As a voter trying 
to understand economic policy, the emphasis on competition has 
left many more questions than answers. Can competition be good if 
the result is downsizing and the loss of jobs? Can competition be  
good if it means lower wages? Is competition good, we wonder, 
when the success of the new Wal-Mart means the closure of the 
local business down the street?
<P>
	The average consumer should not apologize for being confused 
or for asking questions or for feeling some anxiety. For too long 
voters have been left out of the economic process. The answer that 
because it is good for competition hardly suffices in their attempts 
to understand which government policies are sound. The truth is 
that fair competition is a good thing as long as competition in and 
of itself is not what dictates good economic policy. Fair 
competition is integral to sound economic policy.
<P>
	The Reform Party is a strong supporter of the competitive 
marketplace but we are very aware that competition alone is not 
enough to ensure the economic stability we seek. Nor will it alone 
create the kind of marketplace that builds strong industries and 
businesses and protects the consumers.
<P>
	Reformers do not accept that in order to have competition it must 
come at the expense of the taxpayer. Reformers believe in 
competitive strategies that have substance. We believe there are 
ways in which we can increase competition by allowing the 
taxpayer to function freely in the marketplace without 
compromising the interests of the consumer or at great cost to the 
taxpayer. In fact, our definition of a competitive Canada would not 
only save the taxpayer money but would also provide economic 
stability.
<P>
	For the sake of good and fair competition, we would take the 
politics out of economic decision making in Canada. We would not 
use competition as an excuse for the unreasonable waste of 
taxpayers' money spent on business subsidies. We would eliminate 
grants and subsidies to businesses. A business should be able to 
survive on its own merits. Taxpayers should not support inefficient 
or ineffective businesses in this manner.
<P>
	For the sake of good and fair competition, we would support the 
removal of all measures that insulate industries, businesses, 
financial institutions, professions and trade unions from domestic 
and foreign competition. That would mean dropping Canada's 
internal trade barriers once and for all.
<P>
	In order to realize fair and good competition, Reform would 
orient federal government activities toward the nurturing of 
physical and human infrastructure. We would give greater priority 
to the development of skills, particularly those that would provide 
future job flexibility within a co-operative training environment.
<P>
	We would base physical infrastructure spending on economic 
criteria rather than on the basis of artificial temporary job creation. 
In order to realize a fair and competitive marketplace, we would 
invest in basic scientific research and ensure grassroots investment 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10245"> 10245 </A></B>
<P>
in  research and development in order to keep Canada on the 
leading edge of innovation.
<P>
<B>(1255 )</B>
<P>
	If Canada is truly competitive, we will see a better country where 
the entrepreneur is valued and the small business person is free to 
grow, where our children are educated and provided with the skills 
they need to succeed, where families are relieved from an unfair 
tax burden and where Canadians are free from worrying about their 
futures. Instead they must be empowered to reach out and grasp 
every opportunity that comes their way.
<P>
	Competition must mean something to the average citizen, not 
just to bureaucrats and policy makers. Canadians must see real 
evidence of competition in their everyday lives and feel the effects 
that a truly competitive society provides. That means direct to 
home satellites. That means freer internal trade. That means 
prudent regulation of our financial institutions. That means 
reasonable interest rates on our credit cards. That means fair prices 
at the grocery store and at the gas station. For that is a country built 
on sound economic and social policies where the result is fair and 
good competition, and that is the kind of country Canada can be.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak today on Bill C-67, an act to amend 
the Competition Act and another Act in consequence.
<P>
	Reading the bill, I got the impression that we were dealing with a 
bill from the 1970s, from the Trudeau years, when the present 
Prime Minister was Minister of Justice. The present one seems to 
share the same lineage.
<P>
	While the throne speech announced steps to reinforce the 
economic framework by updating the legislation on competition, 
bankruptcy and copyright, here we are faced instead with a bill that 
represents one more intrusion into provincial jurisdiction. Thus, all 
the new civil provisions on misleading advertising and unfair 
business practices are a direct intrusion into an area of provincial 
jurisdiction, namely, local commerce.
<P>
	In 1989, the Supreme Court recognized the infringement of the 
old legislation, the Combines Investigation Act, on provincial 
jurisdiction. Today, in the current legislation, all provisions on 
misleading advertising and unfair labour practices are criminal 
matters, and rightly so, because of the weight of the federal 
government in criminal law. However, Bill C-67 is proposing to 
create a parallel civil system for such offences.
<P>
	Let us take the example of Quebec. It has had consumer 
protection legislation for a number of years. This legislation has 
even been amended to better meet the needs of the public. It is 
really forward-thinking  legislation, in a way. Now, however, with 
Bill C-67, there will be two sets of legislation covering misleading 
advertising and unfair business practices.
<P>
	It is quite surprising in this day and age when the prevailing view 
is that business must be regulated as little as possible so as to 
facilitate the development of small and medium size businesses, to 
see a bill brought out at the end of the session, almost on the sly, 
which repeats the same process we saw ad nauseam in the 
1970s-the systematic intrusion by the federal government in 
provincial jurisdictions. As if the provincial governments were 
incapable of looking after their own jurisdictions.
<P>
	The present government probably espouses this basic principle 
that in Canada there is a national Parliament, and it is the one in 
Ottawa. The others are mere branch Parliaments which should go 
along with Ottawa's every whim. But that is not how things work.
<P>
	The Constitution sets out certain rights. The provinces assume 
their responsibilities. Quebec, for instance, has passed the 
Consumer Protection Act. I believe that the bill before us today is 
one more reason for Quebecers to continue having a voice in the 
House of Commons, that will stand up for their interests and 
constantly fight overlap and eliminate it whenever possible so that 
businesses are not hampered by red tape, which they could do 
without in today's market.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	For example, I recently attended a trade mission in Maine where 
200 business people from that state met 200 business people from 
Quebec, mainly citizens from the Quebec, Chaudière-Appalaches 
and Lower St. Lawrence regions, who were there for the first time.
<P>
	During the long bus trip, I had several hours to speak with 
business people from the Lower St. Lawrence and they told be 
some horror stories about problems they encountered when dealing 
with the government and about the complexity of the regulations. 
Today, if I were to show them Bill C-67 amending the Competition 
Act, they would realize we are trying to make things even more 
complex; this seems totally inappropriate.
<P>
	For instance, these business people told me it was simpler to 
register the brand name of a product made in Quebec in the United 
States than in Canada. This kind of situation is unacceptable. The 
measures contained in Bill C-67 will increase duplication instead 
of eliminating it, as it should. What we need is legislation that 
makes things simpler while taking provincial jurisdiction into 
account. That is why, in a sense, I am happy to see this bill die on 
the Order Paper. This way, when we come back in the next 
Parliament, we will have taken the time to study the bill in 
committee and to include the respect of provincial jurisdiction as a 
basic principle.
<P>
	When the federal government agrees to take that approach, the 
results are usually positive. The infrastructure program for 
example was initially designed  in a way that respected municipal 
and provincial jurisdictions, making it possible to allocate funds in 
an 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10246"> 10246 </A></B>
<P>
appropriate way, without having to invade jurisdictions, at least for 
the part that was defined on the basis of local population.
<P>
	But there seems to be a hard core of people from the Trudeau era 
in this government, and the Minister of Industry could be a spiritual 
son of this era, for he seems to believe that, unless a piece of 
legislation comes from the federal government, it is not good 
enough and will not produce the expected results.
<P>
	When we say that the Bloc Quebecois wants to defend Quebec's 
interests, this also means, in concrete, practical terms, ensuring 
that the legislation will not create problems for our business people 
and fellow citizens as consumers. Given the current situation, the 
government should go back to the drawing board and take into 
account the opinion of the Supreme Court, which confirmed that 
the former act, the Combines Investigation Act, encroached on an 
area of provincial jurisdiction. The government should keep this 
precedent in mind and make sure that, when the bill comes back to 
us, it will have been amended accordingly.
<P>
	Several provisions deal with telemarketing. The advisory 
committee felt that telemarketing was a serious problem in Canada, 
and that it should be tackled by the federal government, rather than 
by the provinces. Again, this is a somewhat paternalistic approach, 
given that Quebec's Consumer Protection Act regulates 
telemarketing quite efficiently. As in many other cases, the 
provinces can certainly agree among themselves to co-operate in 
ensuring that regulations are compatible. This is the way of the 
future.
<P>
	We live in an era where free trade is being promoted. The 
government signed agreements with the United States and Mexico, 
and it wants to extend free trade to the whole American continent. 
But on the other hand, it introduces bills which create local barriers 
to telemarketing, while also generating insidious effects that were 
not anticipated.
<P>
	The effect of creating more regulations is that major 
telemarketing companies, the ones that can easily afford lawyers, 
can always circumvent an act such as this one.
<P>
	For example, there is a marketing company in Trois-Pistoles, 
which is in my riding. It is a small telemarketing company that is 
just starting up. Whenever regulatory problems occur, as would be 
the case with the amendments to the Competition Act, it adversely 
affects the company's competitiveness and its ability to get 
contracts, because such a small business cannot afford the lawyers 
that could help it find its way through the legislative maze.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	Therefore, if the federal government really wants to help small 
and medium sized businesses to expand, to get  the largest possible 
number of government contracts and to compete on a level playing 
field, it should not introduce bills such as the one before us today.
<P>
	While Bill C-67 only criminalizes certain illegal telemarketing 
practices, we must warn the federal government not to interfere in 
this area of jurisdiction, as it does in many others, by providing for 
civil remedies which should be the provinces' prerogative.
<P>
	This is a far cry from this government's so-called flexible 
federalism. On the whole, Bill C-67 tends to shore up the Bloc's 
arguments, since the federal government, which should be among 
those promoting total respect for Canada's Constitution, in sticking 
to its centralizing tendency, is passing laws which simply are not in 
its jurisdiction.
<P>
	Let us imagine this bill being introduced in the House, without 
the Bloc. Federalists all have a rather centralizing approach. Many 
such laws were adopted in the past. But today, because we are in the 
House, and we have a right to speak here, having been elected by 
the people, and because we hope to be re-elected, the public can 
rest assured that we represent it and that we will ensure that the 
very best and most appropriate legislation possible is adopted.
<P>
	It is essential that there be no more errors like those made in the 
privatization of Pearson Airport and the creation of ADM, over 
which the federal government has practically no authority 
anymore. It does not have the sense of responsibility needed to rein 
in ADM or seriously address the air transportation problem in the 
Montreal area.
<P>
	On such issues, Bloc members have no particular ties preventing 
them from exposing unacceptable situations. We will therefore 
continue to promote our views, so that bills like Bill C-67 can die 
on the Order Paper or at least be sent back to committee for review, 
and so that, when bills come back to the House, they respect 
provincial jurisdiction. I think the least we can ask of the 
government is to take enough time to read Quebec's Consumer 
Protection Act. It will see that it has no business interfering in this 
area.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harb:</B> Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to speak to 
the amending legislation to the Competition Act.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am sorry to interrupt the hon. member. 
It is entirely the fault of the Chair. The member for 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup is entitled to questions and 
comments if there are any.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
legislation came about as a result of the throne speech in which the 
government promised to look into the Competition Act in order to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10247"> 10247 </A></B>
<P>
ensure its fairness and  transparency in order to ensure that it met 
the needs of the 1990s.
<P>
	The main objective of the act will be to ensure that the 
marketplace is fair, that both the rights of the retailers as well as the 
rights of consumers are protected within the framework of the law. 
In some cases transactions may take place where a company or 
potential investors may have to consult the Competition Act. A 
certain segment of the bill will address and deal with those issues in 
order to smooth them out.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	The amendment deals with misleading advertisements as well as 
deceptive marketing practices. The bill also deals with 
telemarketing to ensure that when people use telemarketing for the 
purpose of promoting their product that they tell people 
specifically what they are selling, the price and the implications.
<P>
	Other matters the bill deals with are pricing and specials. If a 
company is trying to put a product on the market and it has a sale, it 
has to truly reflect what the actual intended selling price is before 
and after the special comes on line.
<P>
	It deals with an element that is very dear to my heart and the 
hearts of my constituents, the element of fair competition. While it 
does not specifically mention the issues by name, it deals with 
pricing, price fixing, advertising of pricing, manipulation of the 
market through misleading advertising and so on. In particular, I 
am very much interested in the section that touches on gasoline 
pricing practices in Canada. I believe this act takes another step in 
the right direction in trying to ensure fairness for consumers.
<P>
	A lot more needs to be done. I am extremely delighted to see the 
minister taking the lead on this issue and trying to get this bill 
through the House so it can go to a committee. At committee, all of 
us collectively as well as consumers and interested parties can 
speak to committee members concerning some of the shortcomings 
as well as some of the good things the government and the minister 
have done on this issue.
<P>
	The leadership this minister has shown has ensured that the 
amendments to the act increase the penalties. There will be up to a 
$200,000 penalty per offence. This is great when we compare it 
with what we had before. In some cases the penalties were $2,000 
or $5,000 or $10,000. The fact that these measures are now in the 
bill and that the court can even increase the penalty so it fits the 
offence is excellent news.
<P>
	Why do I like this act? I like the amendment concerning 
misleading advertising and deceptive marketing practices. I have a 
letter which was received from a company in the United States by 
one of my constituents. It is from Andrews, Barton &amp; Blaine, a 
company in San Clemente, California: ``Re: Award control number 
134248098''. It begins:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>As Sweepstakes Administrators for DAM, Inc., it is our responsibility to locate 
and notify scheduled award recipients and to arrange for delivery of award cheques 
to them.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Here is the cheque. The cheque is made to the order of the name 
of my constituent in the amount of $7,500 and is dated April 3, 
1997. The cheque is not signed. The letter goes on to say:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Therefore, it gives me great pleasure to advise you that our most recent list of 
scheduled cash recipients has your name on it.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>So there is no misunderstanding, let me repeat this urgent news. A cash award is 
definitely yours.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	There is a definite statement that an award is going to be given to 
my constituent.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>All you have to do is claim it, and correctly answer the required skill question.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	If my constituent answered the question, she could win $7,500. 
The cheque has already been written and delivered. My constituent 
is required to answer what is 110 times 20 plus 8 minus 5 according 
to the quiz sent out in the mail by the company.
<P>
	It goes on further:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>No purchase is necessary, and there is no obligation on your part. However, to 
assure that each recipient gets the correct cash award, we have established strict 
security procedures, which require you to register your Award Control Number, 134 
248 098, with this office by mail or phone before the deadline.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In order to ensure my constituent and probably thousands of 
Canadians that each one of them receives $7,500, the company has 
established a hot line. In order to dish out the money it has opened 
its offices seven days a week, 24 hours a day. It is telling 
constituents and citizens it has targeted that they could use their 
touch tone to call from anywhere.
<P>
	It goes on to state:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Do not mail the enclosed cheque back to us. This will only delay processing your 
claim. When you contact us, we will issue a signed cheque in the correct amount of 
your award and rush it to you. Keep your security code that appears in this letter 
confidential until your award cheque arrives.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The letter goes on and on talking about the award and increases 
the award from $7,500 to $14,413. If my constituent were to 
answer an additional question, the letter continues:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Put very simply-what all this means to you is that you are fully eligible to 
receive-$14,413 in cash.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The number given is a 1-900 number. In tiny letters at the bottom 
of the letter it says the call would cost $4.99 per minute or that the 
average call is for eight minutes. It does not say whether this is the 
minimum length of time they have to answer the quiz but I presume 
it is.
<P>
	This is an utterly misleading communication. The company had 
no intention whatsoever of awarding that amount of money. It was 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10248"> 10248 </A></B>
<P>
purely and simply to rob my  constituent of $40 if she called the 
eight minutes required by the company.
<P>
	The legislation deals with that aspect. It clearly states that the 
marketer would have to disclose basic information to the consumer 
in a timely manner and prohibit certain other deceptive practices.
<P>
	If the amendments to the act were to pass, Canadians and 
constituents who have dealt with situations like this one would 
have the answer. The government would be able to deal with the 
issue.
<P>
<B>(1320 )</B>
<P>
	How often do constituents in my riding as well as others receive 
letters from companies describing wonderful holidays they could 
take or the wonderful time they could have on the sandy beaches of 
the Caribbean, in Europe or elsewhere around the globe?
<P>
	These companies ask them to send a cheque in a certain amount, 
in some cases up to $200. When the constituents send the cheques 
they discover that a further $1,500 or $1,600 is required. Even 
when that happens, individuals get to their destination only to find 
their holiday has turned into a horrible nightmare. The bill will deal 
with those concerns.
<P>
	I want to share with the House information one of my 
constituents sent to me in a letter complaining about an 
organization. The letter reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Dear Mr. Harb:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Are you aware of what-are asking senior citizens to do?</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The nerve of them to ask us to fight-government, so that they can feather their 
nests.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Is there anything you or the Prime Minister can do to stop them?</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This enclosure will explain what they are doing.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This organization sent out a petition on pensions, telling seniors 
in my constituency that the overhaul done by the Government of 
Canada to their pensions will substantially cut their pensions and 
end universality. It also told them that the only way to stop this 
action was by sending a contribution in the amount of $35, $50, 
$75, $100 or $250. If they could not afford to send money, they can 
simply sign the petition and pay a processing charge of $3.50 to 
help with the cost of handling the petition.
<P>
	When constituents want to introduce a petition in the House of 
Commons there are no processing costs involved. All they have to 
do is sign the petition and it will be sent here. We as members of 
Parliament on behalf of constituents, whether on the government or 
opposition side, have the responsibility to table all petitions that 
can be certified by the House of Commons. I do not know whether 
there were any petitions tabled in the House signed by senior 
citizens concerning the pension plan.
<P>
	I wrote a letter to the constituent on the matter. I promised to 
raise the matter at the appropriate time. This is the time to tell her 
that issues such as this one will be dealt with by the amendment to 
the Competition Act as proposed by my colleague, the Minister of 
Industry.
<P>
	The bill will create a criminal and a civil regime in the 
competition system to allow enforcers to deal with much more 
serious offences. This section will streamline the Competition Act. 
It will make it more flexible and allow the government to deal with 
serious offences and to assign the resources accordingly.
<P>
<B>(1325 )</B>
<P>
	The amendments to the Competition Act which are before the 
House of Commons are extremely important. Members from all 
sides of the House have spoken in support of the amendments 
today.
<P>
	Congratulations must go to all those who worked on this bill, in 
its drafting, in writing to the department, in consultations, and to 
those who gave their views to the department, the ministers and to 
my colleagues on both sides of the House who have spoken on this 
issue in the past. Again I want to congratulate the minister on this 
excellent initiative.
<P>
	I look forward to seeing this bill go to committee because I 
would like to propose some amendments in particular as it deals 
with the whole issue of gasoline price fixing across Canada. And on 
that I also want to go on record and commend the Competition 
Bureau on the excellent work it has done. Every time a complaint 
has been raised and somebody asked it to look into a matter 
pertaining to gasoline pricing across the country the bureau has 
looked into it. The bureau has tried its best to address those 
concerns.
<P>
	I understand there are some things about which nothing can be 
done unless the act itself is amended and strengthened so it can deal 
with those specific issues. I am alluding to the relation between 
suppliers and retailers which is the subject of ongoing debate both 
inside and outside this House.
<P>
	The bill before us is a fantastic step in the right direction. The 
amendments are long overdue. I want to join with my colleagues in 
saying how thrilled and delighted I am that finally this act is before 
the House of Commons and we have a chance to deal with it.

	<B>Mr. Harb:</B> Mr. Speaker, let me first thank the hon. member for

<P>
	I look forward to working with him as soon as we return, either 
on Monday or next year, and working with our colleagues to 
continue our work and to make sure consumers on both sides of the 
river have an opportunity to express clearly and effectively their 
views on this legislation, as concerns gas prices and relations 
between businesspeople. We know that this has something to do 
with what they buy in their own areas.
<P>
	This legislation deals with these issues related to competition 
and gas prices. One of the amendments raises penalties to a 
maximum of $200,000 for each company. Offending companies 
will be covered by this bill.

of National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to go back to what was said by the hon. 
members opposite Tuesday evening when it was stated, and indeed 
letters quoted, that this bill, although amended in the other place, 
still does not reflect what those in the province of Quebec, as 
evidenced by testimony given to the committee in the other place, 
really want.
<P>
	I am pleased to see so many members of the official opposition 
here today on a Friday afternoon. I wonder if they would care to 
hear what was said by Quebec interest groups after the bill was 
amended in the Senate. Mr. Michel Arpin, spokesman for the 
regroupement des exploitants de canaux specialises de langue 
français, would like to express his gratitude to the committee on 
transport and communications for approving the amendment of 
Bill C-216.
<P>
	He continued by saying: ``The amendment keeps the objective of 
consumer protection, which was the initial driving force behind the 
bill. It also provides for a response to their vital concerns on the use 
of French, namely on the availability and cost of specialty French 
language programming services. The amendment to this bill is a 
compromise that will facilitate the provision of services to 
francophones''.
<P>
	The Association of Francophones and Acadians of Canada has 
said that it totally agrees with and supports the bill as amended by 
the Senate.
<P>
	The list goes on. The Canadian Association of Broadcasters 
supports the bill as amended. The Speciality and Premium 
Television Association's Quebec members support the bill as 
amended by the Senate.
<P>
	All Canadians must therefore ask why Bloc members opposite 
do not stand up for the consumers of Quebec. Why do Bloc 
members continue to support the backroom boys, the lobbyists, the 
big money interests? Are they not interested in the senior citizens 
of that province, families struggling to get by and the working 
poor? Perhaps they would like to tell us why they know more than 
all the interest groups from inside Quebec who are supporting this 
bill as amended by Quebec.
<P>
	It is obvious that a deal has been struck. Why do they refuse to 
tell Quebecers what deal it is and with whom it has been made?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would ask you 
to check if there is a quorum.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I want to draw to your attention that, 
according to the order made earlier today, and this may also apply 
tomorrow, a quorum is not needed and no one can ask for a quorum 
count. Good try!
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Richardson:</B> Mr. Speaker, why do they refuse to allow 
Quebecers 20th century rules of doing business? Why do they 
refuse to allow the commercial rules of the marketplace in that 
province?
<P>
	This is a new face of the Bloc, a tightly controlled society in 
which freedom of choice for such important products as cartoons is 
removed.
<P>
	The amendment proposed by the Bloc is in my opinion a sad 
commentary on the rigid and backward views of a group removed 
from the generally accepted rules of the marketplace.
<P>
<B>(1335 )</B>
<P>
	Is it therefore any wonder that an industry which is artificially 
created, a company that supplies cartoons, would be supported by 
that party?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10250"> 10250 </A></B>
<P>
	Today's edition of the <I>Financial Post</I> carries an editorial 
concerning the bill: ``Consumers should pay only for the services 
they have requested. Parliament has missed a golden opportunity 
to affirm that principle''.
<P>
	It is indeed a sad day when members of the Bloc turn their backs 
on all Canadians, especially those they are supposedly here to 
represent, and allow this important piece of legislation to die.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
first of all to speak on the amendment.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Unfortunately, I have to rise once again, 
since it seems that the member has already spoken on this 
amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> Mr. Speaker, I could not 
have spoken to this amendment, since I moved it at the end of my 
speech. I never spoke on this amendment.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> One moment. We will check the lists.
<P>
	Unfortunately, the mover of an amendment is considered to have 
spoken on the amendment. It is unfortunate, particularly on this last 
sitting day it seems, but after consultations, I have to inform the 
hon. member that he is not entitled to speak once more on the 
amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> Mr. Speaker, is it because I 
moved the amendment?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It is indeed because the hon. member 
moved the amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am astonished at what we heard from the parliamentary 
secretary, the government member, since many organizations have 
told us that the amendments and legislation will duplicate a 
provincial act, that we already have legislation to deal with this and 
that in any case, people do not want it.
<P>
	When he says the Bloc Quebecois is acting against the interests 
of Quebecers on this issue, I think the hon. member is very much 
mistaken and we will be able to prove that daily during the election 
campaign. It certainly cannot be said that the Bloc Quebecois has 
failed to defend the interests of Quebecers in this House. The party 
critic was very vigilant, ensured that the province's jurisdiction 
would be respected and that substantive issues were given due 
consideration.
<P>
	This bill as presented by the current majority is totally 
unacceptable, and we will do everything we can to prevent its 
passage. We believe this bill is anti-francophones. It will contribute 
to the assimilation of francophones in Canada, and it would be 
misleading to claim this is not so. We will vote against the 
amendment and the bill because to us they are unacceptable.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sue Barnes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Revenue, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this issue of billing in a 
certain manner was the number one issue in London West as far as 
responses or input directly from constituents were concerned in the 
whole time of this Parliament to date. I think the number two issue 
was quite a bit behind that.
<P>
	People were not lobbied in my riding to phone in or write in 
about this issue. This is something that genuinely affected them in 
their pocket books and they felt very strongly about it.
<P>
	I can remember two Christmases ago being in my riding a couple 
of days after Christmas and the phone calls coming in. I had to keep 
emptying our telephone banks and resetting them.
<P>
	This is an important matter for a lot of my constituents. It is not 
an important matter only in London West. It is an important matter 
across the country.
<P>
	I am a little concerned and confused by the Bloc's continued 
attack on the consumers across the country who are concerned 
about negative option billing. Bill C-216 would protect consumers 
in all provinces, wherever there are cable companies.
<P>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
	This negative billing practice in essence requires people to pay 
for specialty channels without being able to say they want these 
options and they choose to pay for them. I have always resented 
any practice which assumes I want a product by not responding. 
This is the type of marketing that I know suits mass industry 
because of the volume. Most people maybe do not pay attention to 
the fine print as well as they should, but we should not punish them 
for not doing so. We should protect them in a manner that they can 
give an informed consent, which the majority of the population is 
capable of. I believe in those choices.
<P>
	There has been a Senate amendment to this and now the Bloc is 
rallying to protect the cable companies which will be the main 
beneficiaries. It will not be the average Canadian. The Bloc has 
allied itself with the big business and special interests in this area. I 
feel strongly that the French language is protected in the bill as 
amended by the Senate.
<P>
	There are people in this country who struggle to pay their bills 
every month. I think the Bloc would be wise instead of trying to 
talk about only part of the issue to consider the consumers in 
Quebec and protect them, as is their obligation in Parliament.
<P>
	Many people have spoken against the bill, one being a strong 
lobbyist and former member of this place. When there are paid 
<P>

<B><A NAME="10251"> 10251 </A></B>
<P>
lobbyists on one side of the argument, they are going to oppose the 
bill because that is their job.  That is the position they are supposed 
to be stressing as strongly as they can.
<P>
	I cannot argue against someone doing their job. I can just say 
there is the position of the lobbyist and the position of the 
consumer.
<P>
	Consumers have contacted my office in my riding, as I am sure 
they have contacted the offices of members of the Bloc.
<P>
	The cartoon channel which is at the centre of this issue is not 
going to be the only channel. There will be others. What is at risk 
here is full consent, informed choice. In my early training informed 
consent was an important principle. It is one that maybe does not 
go well with the concept of mass marketing.
<P>
	However, as a representative of my riding I listen to the people 
and I have considered the bill and supported it at second reading.
<P>
	I Know it is the intention of Bloc members to run out the debate. 
I want to put on record that there are a number of people in the 
House from a number of parties who want to support the bill 
because they are responding to their constituents. I do not see 
anything wrong with that position. I know other issues have to be 
considered but I certainly would not support anything that I felt 
would inhibit the French language in this country. I believe very 
strongly in official bilingualism. I believe very strongly in learning 
to speak French and I support that principle. To me that is the red 
herring in this debate.
<P>
	I have spent time in this Parliament trying to learn the second 
language. This is not a French-English debate, it is a consumer 
debate. The consumers would very strongly wish to have a choice 
in how they spend their money and have their choices spelled out to 
them and then choose to pay for the channels they wish to have. 
Negative option billing is something I cannot support on a mass 
scale. It is a practice. Cable company representatives spoke to me 
after this happened in my riding and they said that they would 
never be doing this again. I do not think there is a lot to fear from 
this point.
<P>
<B>(1345)</B>
<P>
	I know the clock is ticking and I want to put my support on 
record. If there were a vote in this House I would support the bill.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is the House ready for the question?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Question.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The question is on the amendment. Is it

	Dear colleagues, before saying goodbye, I simply want to 
remind you that there are a lot of people in this House who are 
never acknowledged. I am of course referring to the cleaning staff 
and to others who do all kinds of work in this House. We also 
greatly appreciate the services of our clerks-at-the-table.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We have the best class of pages we have ever had. Of course the 
senior pages do marvellous work too. The security, the table 
officers, the people who do so much work around here, we are all 
extremely grateful to them.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> I join you, Mr. Speaker, in 
thanking the staff of the House who, all along this session, showed 
an assiduous and efficient professionalism. I think the official 
opposition must salute the employees of the House and all 
members of the staff for their excellent qualities and especially 
their eagerness to serve the men and women who elected this 
Parliament.
