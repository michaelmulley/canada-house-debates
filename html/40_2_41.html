  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are now in this bizarre situation where we are debating a bill to implement legislation that has already been passed by the House of Commons and the Senate.

One of the strange features of my time here in Parliament is that we actually would need to debate legislation to implement legislation that we had already fully debated and passed in this place a number of years ago, but that, in fact, is what this is about, because of the government's refusal to abide by the will of Parliament, by the decisions of parliamentarians, on the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act back in 2001.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It emerged as a compromise because the government of the day wanted to reduce Immigration and Refugee Board panels from two members to one member. It was thought that to serve the needs of fairness and justice, a one member panel only represented the interpretation of one person and that increased the likelihood of mistakes, errors and inconsistencies. It was thought that some other appeal process was necessary to balance that reduction in the panel from two members to one member. A compromise was struck. Members of Parliament agreed to the reduction of the panels from two members to one but also insisted that the refugee appeal division, the RAD, be a part of the legislation in order to give people a recourse to appeal a decision made by a panel in a refugee determination case.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was a very important piece of the process. It showed Parliament perhaps at its best by reviewing legislation, finding the problems, responding to the needs that the government of the day addressed, and finding a compromise and implementing that compromise. Yet after the fact, the government went ahead and reduced the panels from two members to one, but refused to implement the other procedure that would have ensured some fairness and some justice. The government refused to implement the refugee appeal division.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the folks who serve on the IRB do great diligence in that job and are very concerned about the process and the work they do.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a single person determines the fate of a refugee claimant, a bad decision can mean that the person is removed from Canada ultimately and sent back to a situation where the person faces danger and threats to his or her life.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act was drafted, the refugee appeal division was seen as a fair compromise to satisfy the desire to move from two board members responsible for examining asylum claims to just one.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitrary aspect of the system is being magnified by the government's inaction and the piecemeal approach to implementing the new legislation.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The federal government claims that a safety net already exists, consisting of the opportunity to request a pre-removal risk assessment—also known as a PRRA—a judicial review by the Federal Court, or permanent resident status on humanitarian grounds. However, unlike a refugee appeal division, they do not offer any protection for refugees. The Federal Court provides only for a judicial review and does not provide for a review of the facts of a case.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a flagrant lack of political will to establish the refugee appeal division, or RAD, which, I would remind the House, is already enshrined in the legislation.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are four reasons why the refugee appeal division should be established: efficiency, consistency of the law, justice, and political reasons that I will explain. </div>
</p><a name="Para1416332" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A specialized refugee appeal division is a much more efficient means of dealing with unsuccessful claimants than the Federal Court, an application for pre-removal risk assessment or requests on humanitarian grounds. The refugee appeals division can do a better job of correcting errors of law or fact. </div>
</p><a name="Para1416333" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason is consistency of the law. An appeal division deciding on the merits of the case is the only body able to ensure consistency of jurisprudence both in the analysis of facts and in the interpretations of legal concepts in the largest administrative tribunal in Canada. </div>
</p><A NAME="T1125"></A><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1125"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1130"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1120"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1125">(1125)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para1416334" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In other words, an appeal mechanism helps the system to make decisions by establishing precedents that will be applied to lower court rulings when the facts are exactly the same.</div>
</p><a name="Para1416335" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third reason has to do with justice. The decision to refuse refugee status has extremely serious consequences, including death, torture and detention. As in matters of criminal law, the right to appeal to a higher court is essential for the proper administration of justice. Because human error occurs in any decision-making process, it should be standard practice to have an appeal process, especially to offset the fact that decisions are now made by a single board member.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said earlier, the fourth reason is political. By not establishing the refugee appeal division, the federal government is going against the will of Parliament—which is a serious matter—and of the Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration, which has called for such an appeal division. As I said, this is a serious matter.</div>

It would, however, add unnecessary delays and costs to an overburdened system. It is not just the cost of the appeal division which, as my colleagues previously have pointed out, would be in the tens of millions of dollars, but there would also be other costs to the provinces and the federal government for health care and social assistance. This is why it is surprising that the Bloc would be pushing the bill at a time of economic uncertainty that would increase the costs of services to the province of Quebec.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Based on the recommendations of the Public Appointments Commission Secretariat, we implemented a new process for the appointment of members of the IRB in July 2007.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is essential that refugee claimants and Canadians have the utmost confidence in the decisions of the Immigration and Refugee Board. This selection process helps to ensure that confidence. Since this government took office, there have been 111 appointments and 59 re-appointments to the Immigration and Refugee Board. The board now stands at 90% of its full complement. As a result, more genuine refugee claims can be process and finalized, while more frivolous asylum applications are dismissed more quickly.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, even with a full complement, the rate of applications has increased beyond the capacity of the board, increasing the backlog.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have repeatedly urged the opposition to consider the comments already made by the government during this debate. We have a system where even the most straightforward successful refugee claims are currently taking too long to reach a decision. Unsuccessful refugee claimants regularly take over five years before they finish the various levels of appeals available to them. This is five years of federally funded health care and provincially funded social programs, on top of court costs and IRB costs.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I did not hear and what I think is the reason people want this bill to go to committee is that the system does something very important to Canadians: it is our duty and our social responsibility. The member is familiar with the system and she gave some statistics. However, when we consider that the Parliament of Canada passed an act, we have been through this before. We understood what the role of the amendment to the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act would be and the issue of the implementation of the refugee appeal division. The bill is very straightforward. It is just three paragraphs long, and it asks for enforcement on a bill that has already been passed by Parliament.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Legitimate refugees are determined in a number of ways. Primarily the UN designates which countries have legitimate refugees, but the member will also know that at one point in time almost half of the people applying for refugee status in Canada came here from across the Canada-U.S. border. They landed in the U.S., found out that they could not get the court assistance, could not get welfare, could not get social services or health care, so they came to Canada. The arrangement took a very long time to negotiate with the United States, that when a legitimate refugee lands in safe haven, it is that place of first safe haven that is the jurisdiction in which it has to be dealt with.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to reassert that I have been a member of Parliament for almost 16 years now. We have had many, many cases through our office. It is a very busy office near the Pearson airport. The Peel members deal with a very large number of refugees. As to the idea that somehow it already takes five years to go through all the various levels of appeals and this is going to make it worse, if a situation is taking five years, let us understand why. Maybe when the member's office gets more involved in these over a period of time she will understand that there are many cases where it is not the refugees themselves who are the reason for the delay.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I became a member of Parliament, I had a practice as a chartered accountant and did work for multicultural assistance services in Peel and also for the Peel Multicultural Council, which assisted refugees coming to Canada. People would get off airplanes in the middle of winter wearing sandals, shorts and a T-shirt, and that is all they had to their name. It has been a long time since I looked at the statistics, but there are millions and millions of human beings around the world who have no country, who have no future, who have no life. They are just like every other Canadian in that they are looking for better lives for themselves. A better life for them is where they can have the dignity of a roof over their head, proper nutrition, and an opportunity to be as good as they can be.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It bothers me, it concerns me, and it troubles me, because I remember hearing many times from members—and I am not going to be too partisan on this—the question, why are we letting all those criminals into the country? That was applied to all immigrants and it was applied specifically, for those who perhaps knew the system, to refugees. Somehow they said that immigrants and refugees were all the problem, because those happened to be the ones who were in the newspapers.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was a member of the finance committee, StatsCan reported to us the statistics related to new Canadians.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, we tend to have arguments coming forward to us where the refugee issue is mixed in with the immigration issue. It is different. I know many Canadians do not understand it, but on the refugee side, it is not a great number, but the system is difficult because we have people who got bad information from people who got them into Canada, where they had destroyed their papers, if they had any, or they came from places where there were no papers and it was going to take a long time for them to get papers and they had to go through all the various checks.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He said: Mr. Speaker, I thank the government House leader for seconding this bill. It is very important legislation and is an important part of this government's agenda. We are opening debate on the truth in sentencing act. The amendments to the Criminal Code proposed in this bill will limit the credit that a court may grant a convicted criminal for time served in pre-sentence custody.</div>
</p><a name="Para1416424" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As some in the House may be aware, section 719(3) of the Criminal Code allows a court to take account of the time a convicted criminal has spent in pre-sentencing custody in determining the sentence to be imposed. The code does not set out any formula for calculating this credit, but the courts routinely give credit on a two-for-one basis. In many cases the courts give credit on a three-to-one basis. In other words, for every day a convicted offender has spent in remand, the court will deduct from the sentence it otherwise would impose, two or three days. </div>
</p><a name="Para1416425" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Explanations for the length of a sentence are usually provided in open court at the time of sentencing. However, judges are not required to explain the basis for their decision to award pre-sentence credit. As a result, they do not always do so and this deprives the public of information about the extent of the pre-sentence detention. It leaves people in the dark about why the detention should allow a convicted criminal to receive what is most often considered to be a discounted sentence. This creates the impression that offenders are getting more lenient sentences than they deserve.</div>
</p><a name="Para1416426" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a concern that the current practice of awarding generous credit for pre-sentence custody may be encouraging some of those accused to abuse the court process by deliberately choosing to stay in remand in the hope of getting a shorter term of imprisonment once they have been awarded credit for time served.</div>
</p><a name="Para1416427" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For ordinary Canadians, it is hard to understand how such sentences comply with the fundamental purposes of sentencing, which is to denounce unlawful conduct, deter the offender from committing other offences and protect society by keeping convicted criminals off the streets. </div>
</p><a name="Para1416428" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The practice of awarding generous credit erodes public confidence in the integrity of the justice system.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who defend the current practice note that credit for pre-sentence custody compensates for the fact that the time a convicted criminal has spent in remand does not count toward eligibility for full parole or statutory release. </div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, a prison inmate is eligible for full parole after one-third of the sentence has been served. If parole is not granted, that same inmate will likely be set free on statutory release at the two-thirds point in the sentence. What this means in practice is that if someone is released on full parole at the one-third point in the sentence, every day he or she has served in prison will have counted, in effect, for three days. </div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current system of presumptive release that currently underpins Canada's approach to corrections has recently been the subject of an exhaustive review by an independent panel.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among other things, the independent review panel recommended that statutory release be entirely eliminated and that Canada move toward a system of earned parole.

</p><a name="Para1416434" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The practice of awarding generous credit for pre-sentence custody cannot rest on the foundation of a statutory release and parole system that has itself been subject to strong and impartial criticism and that may therefore be significantly changed in the future. However, those who defend the current practice note that the generous credit for pre-sentencing custody is also designed to take into account such factors as overcrowding and lack of rehabilitative programming for inmates in remand centres.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have received many letters and representations from concerned Canadians on the issue of pre-sentencing custody credit. All too often they cite situations where violent offenders are set free after having served a relatively short prison term because a court has awarded them two or three to one credit for pre-sentence custody. One writer commented that if one of the purposes of incarceration is to reform criminals, then the current practice of awarding two for one is a dismal failure. He writes:</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Criminal Code amendments tabled on March 27 clearly stipulate that the general rule should be one day credit for each day served in pre-sentence custody. If circumstances justify it, credit may be given at a ratio of up to one and a half days for each day served. In such cases, however, the courts would be required to explain the circumstances that warrant departing from the general rule of one to one credit. This would allow the judge the discretion to award credit of up to one and half to one in appropriate cases.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Extra credit for time spent in pre-sentence custody is widely seen as one of several factors that have contributed to significant increases in the remand population in the last few years.

</p><a name="Para1416448" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 2007, more people have been held in provincial and territorial remand centres than were serving sentences in provincial and territorial jails. Overall, remanded accused now represent about 60% of admissions to provincial and territorial jails. </div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several factors are at work that may contribute to the fact that the remand population is rising. Across Canada, court cases are becoming more complex due partly to the rise in the number of complex drug and organized crime related prosecutions. Many cases now involve 10 and 20 appearances before the courts. Longer processing times mean longer stays in remand.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, in 1994-95 about one-third of those in remand were being held for more than a week. Ten years later, however, those held for more than a week had grown to almost half of the remand population.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are important reforms. Canadians have been waiting for a long time. Many say that offenders too often slip through the fingers of out justice system without serving adequate time. As a result, Canadians have been demanding change. They believe there must be more truth in sentencing and that the sentence one gets is the sentence one should serve. This approach set out in Bill <a class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3768035,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3768035&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-25</a> would help restore the people's confidence in the criminal justice system.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This approach is also more consistent with the situation found in other common-law countries where awarding a credit for pre-sentence custody is far less generous than in Canada.

It is not our intention that accused persons be encouraged to remain in remand any longer than is absolutely necessary. Rather, it is our intention that accused persons proceed to trial with as little delay as possible and, if convicted and given a custodial sentence, that they may be sent to prisons that are not overcrowded and offer more opportunities for education and treatment.</div>

This has led to a patchwork quilt across the country of delays in coming to trial. For an accused person, particularly for an accused person whose bail was denied, who was in fact remanded into custody pending a trial, we have an obligation to make sure that those delays are as modest as possible. We believe that the government should entertain a discussion with provincial ministers of justice around a better sharing of resources. </div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some provinces have a greater capacity than others to provide resources to a criminal justice system. For example, in a large organized crime case in which a number of charges are laid, it is a complex case and it can put an enormous pressure on judicial resources, on those of crown prosecutors or police forces in smaller provinces like mine, New Brunswick. We would urge the government not only to think of this bill as a complete solution but as the beginning of a discussion with provincial governments of how all orders of government can better share the responsibility of funding an efficient but fair judicial system.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the concerns we have heard from those who oppose this legislation is that many of the centres where accused persons are remanded, the detention centres where they are held prior to a trial, assuming obviously they have been denied bail, do not offer adequate resources in terms of rehabilitation programs, addiction programs and educational programs. Often they are physically overcrowded and inadequate. In some provinces, like my own, where an accused person is remanded in a provincial detention centre, that is also the place where that person would be sent to serve a provincial sentence. In other words, not all provinces have different facilities where the accused person may be remanded pending a trial and a provincial penitentiary where the person would serve a provincial sentence of less than two years.</div>
</p><a name="Para1416505" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Moncton, for example, and I will assume the accused person is a man because there are different facilities for women, if the person's bail is denied, or as the minister correctly said, in some cases he may choose to waive bail, the person would remain in a remand centre prior to his trial. That is exactly the same facility where he will return once a sentence is imposed, assuming it is a sentence of less than two years. That is one of the problems in looking at a uniform solution across the country. Different provincial jurisdictions have different challenges.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why we believe that this measure is an appropriate beginning, but we would urge the government to also look at other reasons that there can be delays in the justice system.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his comments, the minister also raised the complex question of parole. Last week, I had an opportunity to visit a federal prison in my riding, in Dorchester, New Brunswick. There is a mental health unit in that federal prison, the Shepody Healing Centre. I met with the people in charge of those institutions. I learned a lot about the programming offered to inmates by the federal system, something that is in fact lacking in many situations where people are incarcerated in a provincial institution, at least in some provinces. They also talked about the importance of modernizing the parole system.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The concept of earned parole deserves close scrutiny. Public confidence in the judicial system and in the criminal justice system will be strengthened by a thoughtful and balanced review of our parole system. The public has the misconception that when somebody is sentenced to a term of imprisonment, the person spends the duration of that time incarcerated in a custodial facility. The time has come for Canadians to hear from experts to understand all sides of this question and maybe look at modernizing and reforming the parole system and the concept of earned parole.</div>
</p><a name="Para1416509" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The objective of parole should be to encourage inmates and those who are sentenced to custodial facilities to take advantage of all the programs and opportunities available to rehabilitate themselves, whether it is a mental health challenge, an addiction challenge, or upgrading their education. If these people can be given the skills while they are in a federal correctional facility to improve their circumstances to deal with some of the issues which may have led to their criminal activity, when they walk out of those facilities, we will have safer communities. Part of that process requires a thoughtful review, perhaps by a committee of the House or in conjunction with a committee, to look at what we can do to strengthen that process in terms of increasing public confidence in the justice system.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion, we will be supporting this bill. We will work with our colleagues on the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights to ensure that the bill is examined expeditiously, responsibly and reasonably, but that enactment of this bill is not be delayed in any way. We believe there is a consensus across the country and that transparency in sentencing will enhance public confidence in the judicial system considerably. We have great confidence in Canada’s judges. Very highly qualified men and women have been appointed to the courts at all levels, and we believe it is important to preserve some discretion. This bill strikes that important balance in terms of clarifying the idea of reducing a sentence because of time spent in incarceration before trial. At the same time, we believe the time has come for the public to have a better understanding of a judge’s decision to reduce a sentence because of time spent in a detention centre. </div>

The fact is when the Conservatives came back to the House of Commons, after that premature election in November, they delivered such a disastrous economic statement that entirely missed the concerns of Canadians, those who are losing their jobs and those who worry about the economy, that they were forced to run to the Governor General and beg her to prorogue Parliament so they could come back and push reset on their government.</div>

As I have indicated, one of the challenges is in the remand centres where accused persons are held prior to a trial. Many of them do not have any programming at all, or what programming they have is inadequate in terms of anger management, metal health services, addiction services and literacy upgrading or educational upgrading. Therein lies one of the solutions to the problem of public safety. In order to rehabilitate themselves, many of those who find themselves in the criminal justice system will require this kind of professional help from doctors, teachers and counsellors.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If provinces were able to provide some of these services, I think it would be difficult in a remand context. It is often equally difficult in a provincial penitentiary. Many of these facilities, with sentences of less than two years, also have inadequate programs. This is why I think the Government of Canada has an obligation to sit down with the provinces and discuss whether they can better share the burden of beginning the process of helping people turn their lives around and take advantage of the time they are in remand facilities, those who have been denied bail or who have decided to waive bail because they realize a bail hearing will not result in the granting of bail if the Crown were to object to their release. Because it is pre-sentencing custody, the obligation to impose programs on these people will be very limited, and that is one of the challenges.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The measures the committee proposed to the leader of the Bloc Québécois were part of our election platform. They included subsection 719(3), which gives judges some discretion to offer “pre-sentence credit”. However, in our system, “pre-sentence credit” has become more or less automatic.</div>
</p><a name="Para1416537" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us start at the beginning. Part XXIII of the Criminal Code sets out how judges are to administer justice when it comes to sentencing. It is based on principles of deterrence, denunciation and proportionality. Farther on, when it comes to “pre-sentence credit”, the Code says that it is up to the judge, who can take into account pre-trial detention when sentencing. Why is that in the Criminal Code? At the time, John Turner—I am not sure whether this brings up good memories or bad ones—was the Minister of Justice and soon-to-be leader of the Liberal Party. He was a good friend of former Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau, even though, as I understand it, they crossed swords from time to time in the Liberal Party's history on particular issues.</div>
</p><a name="Para1416538" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact is that the Minister of Justice at the time, John Turner, proposed an amendment to the Criminal Code that would allow a judge to take pre-trial custody into account. In our justice system, pre-trial custody is the exception, not the rule. Under subsection 515.(10) of the Criminal Code, when individuals are charged with gangsterism, when they have committed terrorism offences, when there is reason to believe they will not attend their trial or when they have not complied with the conditions of their release on bail, a judge can order that they be held pending sentencing. Obviously, this is an exceptional measure. We need to remember that in our system, individuals are generally released pending sentencing. </div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, the courts have come to determine that individuals in preventive custody are penalized in a sense, as they are not eligible for parole or rehabilitation and education programs because the conditions under which they are held are stricter than in the case of post-sentencing custody. </div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was really the Supreme Court of Canada that determined the ratio to use for individuals in preventive custody.

Judges determined a ratio, and under the rule of <i>stare decisis</i>, that ratio gradually came to apply in trial courts, appeal courts and, of course, the Supreme Court.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I sent a text to the press on November 22 following the decision by the Quebec court, criminal division. Members will recall that the Colisée operation led to the imprisonment of mafia leaders. The trial of those arrested in 2006 was held in 2008. As an example of the exaggerated nature of this measure, we need only remember that the head of the Quebec mafia, Nicolo Rizzuto, was charged with gangsterism and possession of proceeds of crime. He was sentenced in 2008, but had been arrested in 2006. He is one of the most hardened criminals and heads a criminal organization funded by extortion, proceeds of crime and gangsterism. The mafia is obviously widespread, very much present, very dangerous and very organized. The Supreme Court ruling was handed down in 2000. This mafia head was sentenced to four years in prison. He was arrested in 2006 and served two years' remand. With the rule being two days of sentence reduction for every day served, he was freed without serving the four-year prison sentence. </div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Members will agree that four years in prison is hardly too much for someone in a position like Nicolo Rizzuto's. This is the situation we want to correct. Does that mean suspensions for pre-trial custody should be eliminated? Absolutely not. We acknowledge that when people have been arrested and are in pre-trial custody, they have not been found guilty. The presumption of innocence still applies. We acknowledge that life in these detention centres is tough and the conditions are obviously terrible. We know that if the government ever decided to eliminate this completely, it would go before the Supreme Court and section 12 on cruel and unusual punishment and treatment would be invoked.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other problem the judiciary has with the system is that in a number of sections of our Charter of Rights and Freedoms it talks about the way people who are charged with crimes are to be handled, especially before they are convicted.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The judges confronted with the charter and the fundamental rights that we have all accepted, adopted and value have looked at that and want to know how to deal with it. In many cases, it is cruel and unusual punishment. They want to know how to keep the courts and the criminal justice system in line with the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Their response, almost universally, has been to say that they need to give convicted criminals extra credit. They need to recognize what they were put through in the pretrial setting. This has grown up. It is an absolute sentencing principle and policy that has been followed for a good number of years now.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to be very clear on why we would be supportive of this bill even though we have not made a final decision on it. The average Canadian citizen does not understand it and we know how crucial it is for the citizenry to have an appropriate level of respect for our criminal justice system. If we lose that respect, whether it is for the judiciary, the prosecutors, the bar or the police, we would end up with a system that could lead to chaos and, in some cases, anarchy. We cannot take that chance so we must be very careful in how we handle this. There are alternatives. </div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must say that I was somewhat concerned and maybe even a bit taken aback by the minister's speech this afternoon when he talked about the work that he has been doing with the provincial levels of government to deal with the level of remands and the overcrowding in our system. The truth is that we have done hardly anything at the federal level to assist the provinces. We need more judges, court rooms, prosecutors, police and greater funding for legal aid so the defence bar is able to provide adequate defence within the confines of the charter. If we as a federal government were engaged actively in assisting the provinces, this bill probably would not be necessary because we would not have the practice.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <i>Winnipeg Free Press</i> had an interesting editorial on April 1 after this bill was tabled in the House. It made two solid points. It said that when we are passing as many criminal laws as we are, it does not necessarily mean that we will reduce the crime rate. All it means is that we will have more criminal charges that our courts have to deal with. It went on to say that the biggest challenge, however, would be to make the court system work efficiently enough that no lawyer could claim that a client should get additional credit for time served before sentencing. That is the key. </div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague from the Bloc is not reading the bill properly. I think he said that this would be in exceptional circumstances. That would then limit it quite dramatically. This clause simply says that the judge needs to have evidence in front of him or her that will justify going to one and a half credits instead of just maintaining it at one. Members may remember my earlier comments when I said that it is automatic now. Very little evidence is given. It is automatic now that the offender gets two for one credit.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As opposed to some proposals, I have had discussions with some solicitors general across the country. With respect to the two-to-one, to deal with our criminal justice system, and I know we do a little of it and I will give the minister credit for that, we should be specifically and exclusively targeting repeat offenders. The argument that is made in those conditions of a negative impact on a first offender is much more telling to a judge than if that person is a repeat offender. If they are convicted as repeat offenders, we should be able to argue that they will not get more than one-for-one. The same applies if they are convicted of being part of an organized crime gang. </div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We could set that out and I believe it would buffer us from the charter challenge, which will come in spite of what we heard from the minister. There will definitely be a charter challenge on this on the basis of section 12. This would buffer us quite sufficiently from that if we targeted just those two areas. Those are the ones we want to go after. Those cases are the ones that are causing the disrespect, those people who have been through the system a number of times and still get a two-to-one credit because it is automatic. They would no longer get the credit if they were convicted repeatedly. We could get away with that under the charter. </div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I look forward to the bill going to committee, given the support it has from the other parties.

I hope also in the course of the hearings maybe more evidence will come forward as to where the real problems are around the cases we have in remand, which in many cases target those who we really do not want to target. If we continue with the existing system, it has the advantage for the repeat offender and a major disadvantage for the first-time offender. They are the people who, if we can catch them on the first time, we know we can reduce the rate of recidivism a great deal as opposed to the repeat offenders. We should targeting those people so we can speed up their trials and get them through the system.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that regard, I want to make a point at which the member may have been driving. We have a parole system where people get out because of good behaviour and an automatic return. The vast majority of people do not serve more than two-thirds. However, that calculation goes back to this whole issue of people staying in pretrial custody so they can get two-for-one. If they do that and then get an ultimate sentence, that period of time they have spent in pre-trial custody is not taken into account when they calculate the one-third reduction.</div>
</p><a name="Para1416622" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consider two individuals who have committed the same crime. One manages to get out on bail and one does not. The person who gets out on bail will be convicted and spend less time in custody overall than the person who has been in pretrial custody. That is the normal pattern. The argument that the two-for-one automatically gets people a shorter sentence is not accurate in the vast majority of cases. It is a matter of where they spend that time. The time people spend in pretrial custody is much worse than what they spend in our federal institutions.</div>

The question is if the objective is to reduce remand, which as the member and the minister both mentioned as being more than half of the people in custody, and if the defence and the convicted person use less manoeuvres and tricks because there is no longer any gain, in theory this would speed things up and there would be fewer people in remand.</div>

The petitioners state that whereas the continued existence of the world's 25,000 nuclear weapons risks their accidental or unintentional use, posing a constant threat to our life and climate, Canada has signed and ratified the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, the NPT, in which article VI commits each of the parties to the treaty to work for the elimination of nuclear weapons. </div>

a)	The principle objective of the television commercials, which can be viewed at http://www.tfsa.gc.ca, was to provide Canadians with as much substantive information as possible about the TFSA in a relatively short period of time. Commercials were approximately 30 seconds in length. The commercials encouraged Canadians to contact their “bank, credit union or other financial service provider to open an account today or visit tfsa.gc.ca for more information”. The ‘More Information’ portion of tsfa.gc.ca, which can be viewed at http://www.tfsa.gc.ca/moreinfo-eng.html, makes explicit reference to financial advisors in the list of possible ways to open a TFSA: “Visit your bank, credit union, financial service provider, advisor or planner for more information and to open an account today”.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, the response is as follows:

a)	The confidentiality provisions of the acts administered by the Canada Revenue Agency, CRA, do not permit it to provide details of cases that it may or may not be reviewing or the sources of its information. However, the CRA can advise that as a matter of policy and practice it does not pay for informant information.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c)	The role of the CRA is to ensure that all taxes are paid in full. The voluntary disclosures program, VDP, promotes compliance by encouraging taxpayers to voluntarily correct previous omissions in their dealings with the CRA. A requirement of the VDP is that taxpayers must make a full disclosure before the CRA commences any compliance action or investigation. If they do so, they may only have to pay the taxes owing, plus interest, but not face penalties or prosecution in the courts.

The honour is made even greater for me today by the fact that during the 39th Parliament I introduced a private member's bill which, like Bill C-25, sought to replace the double time served sentencing provisions with a more just and appropriate sentence. I want to thank the minister for taking into account my private member's bill when he introduced Bill C-25 in the 40th Parliament.</div>
</p><a name="Para1416987" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before discussing the various elements of this bill, I would like to briefly describe the implications of the credit granted for time spent in custody. Pre-sentencing custody occurs when it is necessary to ensure the appearance of the accused. In other cases, custody before and during the trial is necessary to protect the public when it is highly likely that the accused will reoffend or obstruct the administration of justice in the event that he or she is set free for that period of time. The severity of the offence may also justify the need to keep the accused in custody. </div>
</p><a name="Para1416988" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Criminal Code establishes that time spent in custody may be taken into consideration during sentencing, but does not provide for any ratio to be applied. The courts, however, have traditionally applied a 2:1 ratio, that is, a credit of two days for each one day spent in custody. In other words, an accused who has spent six months in custody following an offence for which a fair prison sentence would be two and one-half years would only serve a year and a half based on the 2:1 ratio being applied.</div>
</p><a name="Para1416989" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of being incarcerated in a federal penitentiary for a sentence of more than two years, the offender would now actually serve the sentence in a provincial prison. </div>
</p><a name="Para1416990" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The courts justify this ratio by citing the lack of programs in correctional facilities and the fact that pre-sentencing custody is not taken into account when considering eligibility for parole once the sentence has been handed down. That is why the period spent in custody is often referred to simply as down time. However, this ratio is not fixed at 2:1. In some cases it has become 3:1, where custody conditions were especially difficult, either because a correctional institution was overpopulated or because the sanitary conditions were poor. However, it is obviously our hope that such a ratio is rarely applied.</div>
</p><a name="Para1416991" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes the ratio applied is less than 2:1, where the offender is unlikely to be granted early parole because of his or her criminal record or where the offender was placed in preventive custody due to a bail violation. However, there is no uniformity or consistency in the importance attached to these factors.</div>
</p><a name="Para1416992" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last decade the proportion of persons in pre-sentencing custody has actually exceeded the number of adults in post-sentencing custody in the provinces and territories. There are more folks in custody who are awaiting trial than there are prisoners who have been convicted or are in jail. Overall the number of persons in pre-sentencing custody account for approximately 60% of the number of persons admitted to provincial and territorial institutions.</div>
</p><a name="Para1416993" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, the provincial and territorial governments have voiced their concerns regarding the repercussions on the growth of the population in pre-sentencing custody and have requested that the 2:1 ratio be limited. Among the factors that have contributed to this increase is the fact that the court records are now much more complex, take much more time to process and result in a longer period spent in pre-sentencing custody.</div>
</p><a name="Para1416994" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, in 1994-95 some 34% of accused in custody were held for more than a week. A mere 10 years later this proportion has risen from 35% to 45%. The proposal contained in this bill will help reduce court caseloads thereby accelerating the processing of records. </div>
</p><A NAME="T1520"></A><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1520"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1525"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1515"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1520">(1520)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para1416995" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, there have been reports that the increase in the population in custody is due to the choice of the accused to extend the period spent in custody so as to have a shorter sentence once the 2:1 ratio is applied after conviction. This bill is aimed at discouraging and eliminating this behaviour.</div>
</p><a name="Para1416996" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The credit of two days for each day spent in pre-sentencing custody increases court caseloads and allows certain accused to obtain a lighter sentence. This common practice creates a public perception that the sentences imposed simply do not reflect the severity of the crime, especially when the ratio applied for the pre-sentence period is unknown.</div>
</p><a name="Para1416997" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why this bill proposes the application of a 1:1 ratio in all cases with the possibility, if circumstances justify, of granting up to one and one-half days for each day spent in custody. In addition, it proposes to limit the ratio to 1:1 for persons in pre-sentencing custody on the basis of their criminal record or because they have violated their bail conditions.</div>
</p><a name="Para1416998" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bill proposes that the courts clearly indicate the credit for the time spent in custody as well as the sentence imposed. It also requires that the courts give reasons for their decision for any credit granted for time spent in custody. This will make it possible to better evaluate the ratio used and how often a credit is given for time spent in custody. Even a one to one credit will require the courts to explain the decision and why the grant was given for that additional credit.</div>
</p><a name="Para1416999" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These measures will allow for greater uniformity and certainty, and increase public confidence in the administration of our justice system.</div>
</p><a name="Para1417000" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bill will result in an increase in the number of offenders who previously received a sentence under provincial jurisdiction, two years less a day, after taking into account the credit for the period spent in custody, and who will now receive a sentence under federal jurisdiction of two years or more. In addition, offenders under federal jurisdiction will spend more time in federal detention facilities. This increase will also allow for improved rehabilitation among offenders since they can benefit from correctional programs for a longer period.</div>
</p><a name="Para1417001" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons, I encourage my parliamentary colleagues to give their unanimous support to this bill so as to accelerate its passage as quickly as possible.</div>
</p><a name="Para1417002" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enhanced credit for time spent in pre-sentencing custody is seen as one of the several factors that have contributed to considerable increases in remand populations over the past several years. In other words, the longer an individual who has been charged and is awaiting his or her trial, the more the individual can have his or her case remanded, the bigger the benefit the individual receives for the time he or she has spent in pre-sentencing custody. That is not what this was meant for. It was not the intent to assist criminals who are convicted of crimes to seek easier passage of their incarceration time.</div>
</p><a name="Para1417003" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the day, this bill makes sense. It enhances and augments what the minister has described as a bill that needs speedy course through this House and through committee.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The constituents who live in my riding of St. Catharines have long cried out for changes to the legislation, based on a number of court cases in the Niagara area where convicted criminals have benefited from two or three to one additional credits for the days they have spent in pre-sentencing custody. I submit that the constituents of more than just one riding in this country believe this is the right legislation to pass. It should have happened sooner, but it is happening today because this government is ready to move on this justice legislation.</div>

Canada has committed to playing an active role in the Americas and in building strategic relationships with key partners in our neighbourhood. Our neighbourhood certainly is the Americas. The government's policy of re-engagement with the Americas has made a lot of economic sense. It is only reasonable, practical and intelligent foreign policy and trade policy on Canada's behalf that we have become more active in the Americas at our very own doorstep.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Latin America, Peru is a leader, a lynchpin in the political and economic stability of the region. It has been an economic engine with a gross domestic product growth rate of 9.1% in 2008, near the top of the Latin American countries. Peru also has a solid outward orientation. A leader in trade liberalization, Peru is currently pursuing trade negotiations with a number of countries. We need partners like Peru, especially as we move forward on engaging with like-minded countries throughout the Americas. Canadians will benefit. Peru is already an established and growing market for our businesses. Exports like wheat, pulses and mining equipment are just part of that picture.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians also offer services in the financial and engineering fields and this activity is driving strong, two-way commerce between our businesses. In 2008. two-way merchandise trade between our countries totalled $2.8 billion. Canadian exports. like cereals, pulses, paper, technical instruments and machinery, were all a part of this success.</div>

In fact, Canada is one of Peru's largest overall foreign investors with an estimated $1.8 billion worth of investment stock in Peru in 2007 led by the mining and financial services sectors. It is no wonder that Canadian businesses in a number of sectors have been strong advocates of this agreement. Their support has been crucial throughout the negotiating process which began in June 2007.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have negotiated a high quality and comprehensive free trade agreement covering everything from market access for goods to cross-border trade and services to investment and government procurement.

It is not a trade subsidy from the government. We need to counter the arguments against supply management that define it for what it is not.

As I said earlier in a question to the Conservative member, the relative importance of trade with Peru is rather low and negligible. It would not necessarily be my choice for the cornerstone of my speech to you this afternoon. I will address other aspects of equal—if not, in the end, greater—importance than just the absolute figures of the transactions between Canada and Peru. </div>
</p><a name="Para1417127" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I said earlier, given the figures considered, our trade deficit with Peru is fairly substantial. Involved are exports of some $300 million and imports of $2.4 billion. Proportionally, the deficit is quite substantial. </div>
</p><a name="Para1417128" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are a number of issues with the free trade agreement with Peru, and I would like to raise a few. First, the agreement on investment protection in this agreement with Peru is almost a copy of chapter 11 of NAFTA. We know how that works and that it leads the multinationals increasingly to initiate proceedings against governments. Chapter 11 also contains the dispute resolution mechanism, which poses problems and has significant weaknesses. </div>
</p><a name="Para1417129" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bloc Québécois supports investment protection, as long as it is done well. Furthermore, there is the government's almost unhealthy predilection for signing bilateral agreements by the handful and as quickly as possible, ignoring of course the multilateral aspect. In recent times, the WTO is somewhat out of the picture, the Doha round is rather ineffectual and there is little progress. We all know that international trade—globalization—must be governed by rules that are the same for everyone and equal for all. </div>
</p><a name="Para1417130" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If I have time, I would also like to talk about mining companies. There are a lot of them in Peru, nearly 80. It is common knowledge that a vast number of them have their head offices in Canada, but in the end, they are foreign. Knowing that, in Canada, regulations governing mining companies abroad are very weak, they take advantage of the situation. </div>
</p><a name="Para1417131" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Earlier, a member spoke of fair trade and the various components of it, which include the environment, workers' rights and human rights. They are of prime importance in business and increasingly so. They have also been ignored by the multinationals, which have tried to globalize pretty well everywhere on the planet. We know the aim is to make money. Often, it is to the detriment of the people in the country where they have chosen to set up, because they could take advantage of various weaknesses. These are the things that must be considered increasingly to be regrettable, passé. We must look to the future and to development on a much fairer level. </div>
</p><a name="Para1417132" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I was saying earlier, the relative importance of trade with Peru is rather small. With 0.079% of Canadian exports, Peru ranks 48<sup>th</sup>, and 19 <sup>th</sup> when it comes to Canadian imports. This puts Peru in 25<sup>th</sup> place among Canada's trading partners, but it is important to stress its minor role when it comes to our exports. </div>
</p><A NAME="T1620"></A><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1620"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1625"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1615"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1620">(1620)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para1417133" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, Peru accounts for less than 1% of Canadian international trade, 0.31% to be more exact. Both Canada and Quebec have a negative trade balance with Peru. However, it should be noted that Canada imports primarily raw materials from Peru, including copper, while exporting mostly wheat and manufactured products.</div>
</p><a name="Para1417134" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I mentioned earlier, the balance of trade for all exports is $382 million, while total imports amount to $2.458 billion, for a deficit of $2 billion. This shows the ratio of exports and imports, and the numbers speak for themselves.</div>
</p><a name="Para1417135" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Quebec, exports amount to $50 million, while imports total $223 million, for a deficit of $173 million.</div>
</p><a name="Para1417136" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards agriculture, this is a typical agreement. Fortunately, supply management is not affected. Indeed, over-quota tariffs on regulated products and supplies such as dairy products, poultry, eggs and refined sugar, are exempt from tariff reductions.</div>
</p><a name="Para1417137" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The environment and labour laws are also affected by the agreement. The Canada-Peru free trade agreement is accompanied by two side agreements on labour law and on the environment. When it comes to human rights and labour law, Peru is not a problem country like Columbia. However, the standard of living is low, and we can legitimately question the ability of the Peruvian state to implement both environmental and labour law standards on its territory.</div>
</p><a name="Para1417138" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main danger is with Canadian mining companies operating in that country. Indeed, Peru's mining potential is significant and over 80 Canadian mining companies are present in that country. Canada is the number one investor in Peru's mining sector. Given the poor track record of Canadian mining companies and a total lack of will on the part of the Canadian government to regulate their operations, protecting the additional investments of these companies through a new chapter 11 is highly questionable. </div>
</p><a name="Para1417139" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Québécois is opposed to the Conservative government's strategy, which consists in making piecemeal agreements. Instead, we support a multilateral approach. The current economic crisis clearly shows that a market economy can work properly only if it is regulated and stabilized through an institutional, political and ethical framework. Rather than signing piecemeal agreements, Canada should work within the WTO to ensure that the rules governing international trade are the same for everyone. </div>
</p><a name="Para1417140" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Québécois believes that trade can contribute to the prosperity of nations and, in that sense, that it can be a major social and economic development tool. However, this can only be the case if trade agreements include measures that will ensure sustainable development and that will promote the development of the populations involved.</div>
</p><a name="Para1417141" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canada-Peru free trade agreement includes a clause to protect investments that is patterned on NAFTA's chapter 11 and that will allow businesses to sue governments. To include a chapter protecting investments could impede Peru's social and economic development. That country is a minor trading partner for Quebec.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I said, Quebec’s exports to Peru represent 0.14% of total exports from Quebec, and Quebec has a $174 million negative trade balance.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Canada’s main business activity in Peru is in the mining sector, and Peru’s track record on worker protection in that sector is hardly a glowing one.</div>
</p><A NAME="T1625"></A><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1625"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1630"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1620"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1625">(1625)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para1417144" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the absence of any real policy to hold Canadian mining companies accountable, ratifying this agreement will allow those companies to expand their activities without being subject to any rules or consequences when they pollute or when they flout human rights. The Bloc Québécois is therefore opposed to this bill.</div>
</p><a name="Para1417145" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chapter 11 of NAFTA, relating to investments, allows investors from member states in the North American Free Trade Zone to claim compensation from governments of another party to NAFTA when they believe they have incurred a loss as a result of the adoption of regulatory measures that modify existing business operating conditions. The regulatory or legislative changes must, however, be such that they can be considered to be direct or indirect expropriation or a measure tantamount to an expropriation. </div>
</p><a name="Para1417146" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NAFTA is the only major free trade agreement to which Canada is a party that contains such broad provisions regarding the treatment to be granted to investors from other parties. Because the free trade agreement with Peru contains a similar clause, the Bloc Québécois believes that it is not in Quebec’s interests to adhere to the agreement and is opposed to ratifying it.</div>
</p><a name="Para1417147" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, the free circulation of goods can hardly not go hand in hand with the free circulation of capital. Where specific provisions are not incorporated into free trade agreements, bilateral agreements generally provide for the protection of investments coming from the other party, and all such agreements contain substantially similar provisions, that is, a neutral arbitration procedure in the event of disputes between the foreign investor and the host state of the investment. There are currently over 1,800 bilateral agreements of this type in the world.</div>
</p><a name="Para1417148" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The provisions of chapter 11 of NAFTA governing investments have been called into question. They are the source of numerous proceedings that have been brought against various governments in Mexico, the United States and Canada. They sometimes result in several million dollars in compensation being awarded. In a nutshell, chapter 11 defines a complete scheme to govern investments. In addition, the definition of investments is very broad. Some of the provisions of that chapter, including the concept of expropriation, have generated numerous proceedings. In addition, the current trend is toward extending that concept to encompass lost profits.</div>
</p><a name="Para1417149" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are lots of examples of lawsuits I could mention under chapter 11. They often revolve around the concept of expropriation and lost profits. The expropriation of real estate directly affects a company’s assets and operations, but something else is at stake when multinationals sue for lost profits.</div>
</p><a name="Para1417150" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So a host of lawsuits are underway. For example, there is a suit over regulations that were adopted on PCBs. The Canadian government is being sued by S.D. Myers as a result of the issuing of an interim order on the exportation of wastes containing PCBs, which was in force between November 20, 1995 and February 4, 1997. The American company alleges that this order prevented it from doing business in Canada and it wants $20 million US in compensation. According to the decision that was handed down, Canada’s temporary ban on the export of wastes containing PCBs violated two provisions of NAFTA. </div>
</p><a name="Para1417151" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Canada is still appealing this decision, of course, but we are talking here about defending the public interest and protecting the public. This decision means that foreign multinationals have legal authority over matters like this that are essential to the public and to national sovereignty.</div>
</p><A NAME="T1630"></A><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1630"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1635"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1625"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1630">(1630)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para1417152" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is another lawsuit that will show how bad the chapter 11 provisions on investment can be. Another suit stemmed from the prohibition of a toxic waste burial site. On February 19, the British Columbia Court of Appeal heard the appeal of a NAFTA panel decision awarding the American company Metalclad Corporation $16.7 million US in damages. The panel reached its decision last August after a Mexican municipality refused Metalclad a permit to operate a toxic waste burial site. Surprisingly enough, Canada will intervene in this case on Mexico’s behalf to argue that all interpretations of NAFTA must take a government’s ability to protect the public interest into account.</div>
</p><a name="Para1417153" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What I find surprising is that the government is practically copying chapter 11 in this free trade agreement. It is all the more likely and obvious, therefore, that governments will be sued by multinational companies. For example, if there is ever a major development in environmental policy in Peru, multinational mining companies from Canada that might not be used to any regulations could sue the Peruvian government in the same way.</div>
</p><a name="Para1417154" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is also dispute settlement, as I was saying earlier. Many questions have arisen regarding the dispute resolution mechanism in this chapter. The mechanism provides that a company considering that a government has violated the investment provisions can take direct action against the government before an arbitration tribunal. The tribunals hearing the disputes are set up to hear a specific dispute. The deliberations of the arbitrators and their decisions are secret, unless both parties to the dispute decide otherwise. </div>
</p><a name="Para1417155" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the free trade agreement with Peru has a number of improvements in terms of transparency, the Bloc Québécois feels that the resolution of disputes should be done multilaterally and in a centralized manner, rather than on a piecemeal basis between the various countries signing bilateral agreements. </div>
</p><a name="Para1417156" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, the NAFTA provisions on investment are similar to those in the proposed free trade agreement with Peru. They give very broad powers to businesses and give us concern as to the ultimate sovereignty of governments and their ability to take measures to protect the health of people and the quality of the environment. </div>
</p><a name="Para1417157" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I might not have the time to conclude everything I had to say today, but I will now move to multilateralism. </div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The course of globalization, a phenomenon bearing both great hopes and great injustice, must be redirected. The disparity between rich and poor, the failure to respect rights and freedoms and the lack of regulations on the environment and labour give rise to despair more than anything else. Openness to trade and the establishment of international regulations to counter protectionism and protect investment are good things, which the Bloc supports. That does not mean that trade rules should have precedence over the common good and the ability of governments to redistribute wealth, to protect the environment and their culture and to offer their citizens basic public services such as health care and education. </div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quebec is a trading nation. Our businesses, especially the high tech firms, could not survive in the domestic market. For the Bloc Québécois, for Quebec, international business is of almost capital importance, and we also support free trade agreements, but within a specific context. In this case, fundamental aspects of the free trade agreement with Peru prevent us from supporting it. </div>

There are no regulations governing mining companies working abroad. I said during my speech that this is important.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is relatively simple. I also talked about the term expropriation, which now refers to nearly all situations and to all intents and purposes means loss of profits.

As an aside, when it comes to beautiful yellow dandelions on a lovely green lawn, I have always found that to be a pretty sight, but some people do not like it. The company claims that this will cause it to lose profits. Certainly it is going to lose profits. However, what has become of the sovereignty of a country, and of Quebec, to be able to legislate in the interests of public health and based on principles of environmental precaution?

According to a 2007 Human Rights Report, only 9 per cent of Peru's labor force is represented by unions, and more than 70 per cent of it works in the informal sector.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the terms of the agreement, Canada and Peru commit that their labour laws respect the 1998 Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. It also includes a dispute settlement process and a financial penalty should a country fail to respect ILO principles or fail to enforce domestic labour laws. The penalty for non-compliance is determined by a review panel that has the power to require the offending country to pay up to $15 million annually into a co-operation fund. Our labour allies have made the case that, although it is a step in the right direction, those side agreements are just side agreements, with no effective and vigorous enforcement mechanisms, where the last word belongs to a bureaucrat.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I myself have just returned from a mission of the Inter-Parliamentary Forum of the Americas to Peru, where I was in contact with parliamentarians, the government and the public. I observed that there was somewhat the same kind of distance as we have here in Canada and Quebec, between parliamentarians and the government, that is, when it comes to preparing agreements such as the one some would like to adopt today—there is perhaps not enough consultation of parliamentarians. We end up with an agreement negotiated between the two governments that contains elements that may be difficult to accept. For example, in this agreement we have the equivalent of Chapter 11 of NAFTA, which in my opinion gives corporations improper powers. </div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before becoming a federal member of Parliament, I was into economic development support and trade financing for businesses. When it comes to economic development, it is often said that diversifying one's economy is the key. Even we, as federal members of Parliament, say so. Economic diversification is important because it allows a region to vary the sectors on which it relies, which is important in times of economic slowdown like the one we are going through. Economic diversification might have helped to a certain extent to mitigate the crisis we are dealing with.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the same thing with market diversification. When 75% to 80% of an economy depends on only one market we call that putting all one's eggs in one basket. In my own province of New Brunswick, about 80% of exports go to the U.S. When the American market has difficulties, our own businesses also have difficulties and our jobs are threatened.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I worked in economic development and business support, I often repeated one thing to my clients: it is great to diversify one's economy, but the company must also try to achieve market diversification. That will allow it to react when one sector is in trouble. When one country is in trouble, the company can turn to other countries to help it get by. Today we are faced with a global crisis, one that is not limited to just one country. However, the reality is that the diversification of our market through various countries at least gives us the opportunity to identify potential markets, or a potential client or region. If it does not have the tools to identify various markets, it is difficult for an entrepreneur or a company to save jobs.</div>

Earlier, I was surprised to hear some members, primarily NDP members, say that this is not a good thing. I was surprised to hear that, because when I was working with the union members of that company, they were hoping that the government would sign a free trade agreement with Peru, and they would consistently ask when such an accord would be concluded.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unions and the NDP often get close together. However, I can understand why organized labour in my riding is beginning to distance itself from the NDP, because they are finding out that New Democrats are not always there to support union workers.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said that the government erred regarding this issue. It all began in 2006. Taking action back then may not have completely saved one of our companies, but it might have helped to some degree. From the beginning of the process, in 2006, until now, April 20, 2009, over three years have gone before we were able to move forward on this issue. </div>
</p><a name="Para1417239" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I did speak favourably of the agreement, one must understand that, at some point, a government cannot take all the time in the world to act. Sometimes, it must move forward a little more quickly and take the initiative. If the government would stop proroguing Parliament, perhaps we would move forward more quickly on this issue. Moreover, if the government had not called an election not that long ago—when elections were supposed to be held at fixed dates in this country—perhaps we would already have made progress on this issue. </div>
</p><a name="Para1417240" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember hearing people say, precisely on this issue, that they did not want an election or prorogation. Instead, they needed us to implement these measures for, among others, Atlantic Yarns, in Atholville, New Brunswick, to which I referred. These are realities that affect people in my riding and elsewhere, and these are things that they need. </div>
</p><a name="Para1417241" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That being said, we nevertheless need to examine other issues. When we do business with other countries, we have to protect certain things, such as our supply management system. With regard to the Canada-Peru Free Trade Agreement, I was relieved and truly reassured by the fact that everything to do with supply management—the security and future of supply management—will be protected. It is rather surprising, coming from the Conservative government, because it sometimes talks out of both sides of its mouth. At times we wonder if the Conservatives simply want to get rid of supply management. At least in this document it has not been forgotten. </div>
</p><a name="Para1417242" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will have to continue reminding them of the importance of supply management for the survival of various industries: the dairy industry and the egg and poultry industry, both chicken and turkey. These are important files. The Conservative government has at least listened to us this time and understood the importance of supply management, as clearly indicated in this bill.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must ensure, when concluding similar agreements, that there is respect for human rights. I would like to name a few of them, five to be precise: the right to freedom of association, the right to collective bargaining, the abolition of child labour, the abolition of forced or compulsory labour and the elimination of discrimination. These are important issues for Canadian society and citizens. Citizens want these rights to be respected. When doing business with other countries and when making free trade agreements with other countries, our citizens also want those countries to respect the values of the Canadian government and people. </div>
</p><a name="Para1417244" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Canadian values cannot be taken away from us. The essence of being a Canadian citizen can be taken away by few people. We live in a democracy and we worked hard to achieve that. When I say we, I am including those who came before us in this House and elsewhere, those who built this country. They fought to ensure that we could keep the freedom and democracy that we enjoy today. </div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us go back to what I mentioned earlier. If we want to move forward and prosper, we must not be content to follow. We must sometimes take the initiative. When I raised the issue of the agreement between Canada and Peru a few years ago in this House, I was motivated by our neighbours to the South, the Americans, who had previously started the process of negotiating a free trade agreement with Peru.</div>
</p><a name="Para1417246" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let us look at the reality. Our population is only one tenth the population of the United States, and it is certain that our economy is much smaller in volume than the American economy. The Americans, for their part, decided that it was important to do business with that country, even though it is a small market.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I look at this situation, I wonder why the members of this House say that it is such a small market and that it is not worth spending any time on it, although countries with markets much larger than ours and with a larger population consider it is in their interest to have a free trade agreement with Peru. As Canadians and as a government, we must not always be followers. It is sometimes important to act as leaders. To be leaders, we ought to have started the process earlier and accelerated it. Then, perhaps,we would not be among the last to act in signing such agreements.</div>
</p><a name="Para1417248" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have mentioned before, while the American industry was enjoying its benefits, our Canadian companies had to suffer from the inaction of the government. There were delays in moving forward with the implementation of the free trade agreement. It must be hoped that there will not be any more job losses such as the ones in my riding at Atlantic Yarns. We must look to the future. There is no choice. If the government had moved more quickly, there would have been a choice, perhaps, but today, we have no choice.</div>
</p><a name="Para1417249" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the benefits is a responsibility shared by all parliamentarians. Whatever the agreement, there can be comments more negative than others. I am repeating myself because this is important. We have been told by the workers from these plants in our area that we had to act quickly. This might therefore be some kind of lesson, or certainly a comment that some members, particularly those from the NDP, should take into account.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Textile was mentioned earlier. Things are taking a bit longer than they would like, but the fact is that things have to be put in place so that progress can be made. Going against this will mean that nothing will ever get done. Some steps can take a bit longer than others, but that is already better than doing nothing and never being able to help the workers in our communities.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now is the time to think about market diversification so that, once out of the crisis, we can rebuild our economy and diversify our markets. This will allow us to become even stronger and do business pretty much anywhere around the world. It will allow our companies to operate around the world, which, in turn, will ensure that long-term rather than short-term jobs are created. The next time there is a crisis, we will be able to get through it, without people experiencing the dramatic situations they are currently experiencing in all Canadian industries.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that the Conservative government has failed to take action on several fronts with respect to plans to stimulate the economy and the forestry industry, which is a huge part of the economy where I come from. It has failed, in general, to take action. During the last federal election in September and October, the <a class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" href="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</a> himself said that there was no crisis.

The Conservative government probably figured that even if that region was in crisis, it would not touch the rest of the country. That is a shame, because if it had listened to us in the first place, it would have found out about the crisis in my part of the country and we might not be going through the crisis we are going through now.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trying to explain that to a government that refuses to see or to listen is not necessarily easy. It is even harder when that same government buries its head in the sand, convincing itself that nothing is wrong and everything is great. As a member of Parliament and a citizen, when people all around me, including my neighbours, are losing their jobs, that is no fun for anyone. When a person loses a job, it is bad for the economy because less money will flow to our regions.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some companies want such measures, and the people working for those companies want such measures, so as parliamentarians, maybe we should open our eyes and our ears, pull our heads out of the sand and ask ourselves if this will make things better for our fellow citizens and workers in the near future.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personally, I think that it will. It might be a small step, a drop in the bucket. It is a small country, but that does not mean that some of our companies and manufacturers will not benefit.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, let us ensure the well-being of our people. Let us ensure that they have work. Let us also listen to our workers and business leaders. We have to hear from them how important free trade agreements like this one are to them.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps then, within a short time, we will be able to create what we need: wealth. Our people will be able to go back to work and start spending again, which in turn will make the economy run even better so that more people can work. Efforts will have to be made not to repeat the errors of the past, by overlooking the time frame for going forward with such a plan or implementation plan or, worse yet, failing to listen to people, parliamentarians, our fellow citizens, our workers, labour as well as management of Canadian businesses. They might have been able to move things forward faster and prevent the crises faced today. </div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In closing, let me just reiterate what I said earlier. We are seeking to diversify our economies. That is what we are here for and what we are preaching to anyone who will listen. In our respective regions, we are telling people that the economy has to be diversified if we want risks to be eliminated. Should one falter, the others are there for support.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not saying that we should necessarily take after all countries, of course. There are surely countries around the world which are having a much harder time with what we might think are good things. But in this instance, let us make a point of working toward being able to provide what is known as market diversification. Let us allow our companies to have access to additional markets and diversify their markets. That would make it much easier to go through tough times like these. </div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I said earlier, it may not be a big country or a major player, but there is a link with the diversification of our markets I was talking about earlier. This diversification of our markets is just as important as economic diversification within our own borders. It is the same kind of approach that can help find a way out of our problems when a market is in crisis and help our businesses take a wider perspective. True, businesses need to work hard, and spend time and energy if they are to access new markets. If they are not provided with the right tools by the government, it is hard for them to do it. But in all of this, we have to take stock of the situation. There are hard facts that should be considered. It is not all wide open, and we should be realistic and reasonable. </div>

Today, we must work with our people. There are numerous examples. We should be able to maintain some balance. Some things are acceptable, but there are things we should preserve for ourselves. We should make sure we fight for our important and vulnerable industries. </div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few weeks ago, I took part in a parliamentary mission to Peru as part of the activities of the Inter-Parliamentary Forum of the Americas. I had the opportunity to meet Peruvian parliamentarians, government representatives, representatives of the Canadian mining industry and people involved in international cooperation. I found that there were many potential affinities between the two countries and that it would be useful to develop ties with Peru.</div>
</p><a name="Para1417285" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But a red light went on in my head when the Peruvian parliamentarians invited us to take a close look at the contents of the agreement. It is a good thing to want to engage in trade and create wealth in both countries, but the Canadian government has decided to incorporate the equivalent of chapter 11 of NAFTA into this agreement. This chapter allows a company to sue a government if it is not satisfied with an application or a new law.</div>
</p><a name="Para1417286" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case, it is said that these regulatory or legislative amendments must be comparable to direct or indirect expropriation or a measure equivalent to expropriation.</div>
</p><a name="Para1417287" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We understand the Conservative government's rationale even better. I am somewhat surprised at the Liberals' position on this. The Conservative government wants to allow Canadian mining companies to operate in Peru with virtually no restrictions. They have financial power, and they are faced with a democratic country that wants to carve a place for itself, but does not have our abilities.</div>
</p><a name="Para1417288" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another argument. For example, if the Peruvian government were to decide to reorganize how the lands of the indigenous Quechua people are distributed and wanted to improve ownership for the indigenous people who have lived in Peru for centuries and were there even before the Spanish came, the agreement as written would allow a company to say that the government cannot do that without compensating it. That is a fact. I am not making anything up. NAFTA already has such a provision. The Canadian government itself, under the Liberals, was taken to court over its ban on MMT.</div>
</p><a name="Para1417289" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MMT is a gasoline additive, a known nerve toxin. The Canadian government had banned that additive. The American company went before the courts and won its case, and the Canadian government had to pay compensation to that company. That is the tail wagging the dog. Including a provision in an agreement like this one will simply ensure that republics like Peru stop putting forward protectionist measures because it could never compete with companies like we have in this country.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This visit was also an opportunity to realize how important it would be for such free trade agreements to follow consultations among parliamentarians from each country. </div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had the parliamentarians in the House of Commons and their Peruvian counterparts had the chance to discuss before the drafting of the agreement between their two countries started, I think there would have been lessons to be learned and the agreement eventually signed would not have included such a provision.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It does not make much sense and does not reflect well on Canada's reputation. Canada signed an agreement with northern European countries. We supported that agreement which did not include a provision like chapter 11. These being developed countries, it was agreed that our countries would deal with one another as equals and that no increased powers would be given to companies. When signing bilateral agreements with developing countries, we take the liberty of creating a framework that is not in line with the will and development of each country.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During my visit to Peru I saw that that there was a will to change things. People also hoped that the agreement, which had been negotiated during economic good times, could survive the economic slowdown. Experts who made presentations warned us against the impacts of the agreement on agriculture in Peru and also in Quebec and Canada. The supply management system has been protected. It is not included in the agreement per se, which is a good thing, but the agriculture sector will continue to be treated as any other market sector. That is not good for the future of our agriculture and of the Peruvian agriculture.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also had the opportunity to visit the beautiful village of Chincha Baja, which has suffered greatly from natural disasters, including an earthquake. CIDA has a house building project there. The village is on the fringe of Lima, the huge capital city with 8 million inhabitants, where we can see all levels of poverty and wealth. In the village's rural setting I could witness the importance of giving the agriculture sector in a country like Peru the opportunity to organize itself well enough to be able to access our market, but on a level playing field.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was reminded of the situation in Africa. Some African countries produce cotton that is more expensive than the cotton they could import from the United States because of the subsidies the U.S.A. gives to its producers. Agricultural producers in Peru could find themselves in the same situation because we have a well structured agricultural sector and unions. Over the years, we have developed some tools that they do not necessarily have in Peru.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this agreement to become acceptable, we would have to remove the clauses that are similar to NAFTA's chapter 11. Those clauses give excessive power to companies, which can sue governments if their operations are adversely affected. In this case, this is a serious matter, because we are talking about the mining sector. In Peru, Canadian companies are the main stakeholders in that sector. This agreement is going to give them more power, and that is dangerous. This comes at a time when the government itself refused to follow up on the round tables asking to adequately regulate the operations of extractive mining companies. We reached the point where a member of Parliament had to table a bill saying that the government's position was inadequate, and that we want something that reflects more closely what was proposed by the round tables. The Bloc Québécois also drafted a bill along those lines. Today, the Conservative government is going in the exact opposite direction. It is opening up the floodgates, so that mining companies can really do as they please. </div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier, a Conservative member talked about the reputation of Canadian companies abroad. The vast majority of Canadian companies have a good reputation, but a number of them have really engaged in excessive things, and we should be able to discipline and control them. One way to do that would be to follow up on the recommendations made by the round tables. Another would be to at least ensure, in agreements such as the one before us, that we do not give them increased power, such as what the chapter similar to NAFTA's chapter 11 is going to give them. </div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is unfortunate because Peru is a country with abundant resources and a great deal of potential.

During my stay, I was very surprised to see that it does not have any type of employment insurance or social welfare. The informal economy is very pervasive and there is no declaration of income or payment of taxes. There is barter, which does not contribute to collective wealth.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peru's economic growth is presently in the order of 7% to 9%. This is a very good rate of growth that is closely tied to the mining sector. When the economy slows down, as it has in recent months, the situation becomes much more difficult. We are facing a very paradoxical situation.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was the same for trade with Costa Rica. In the present matter, even if trade between Quebec and Peru and Canada and Peru were possible and substantial, there are businesses on location there, and also some international cooperation. However, following my meetings with various international cooperation NGOs, I note that they are very careful to ensure a clear distinction between purely capitalist market-oriented companies—such as the mining sector—and aid to communities, so that no link between the two can take away their independence of action. </div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does that mean that Peru and Colombia do not need aid? No. We agree, and, in any case, the Canadian government could have done more in the area of international aid. What is unacceptable is taking aid away from Africa, which is desperate for it, in order to turn a policy of international cooperation into a policy of support for economic development rather than a true policy on international aid. The Canadian government is acting as if it managed a private company rather than a government. I do not think Canadians and Quebeckers expect this type of behaviour from their government. </div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will conclude my remarks on this point. Peru is a country that deserves solid cooperation. This free trade agreement will not do it. And because the agreement as such cannot be amended during negotiations, the Bloc prefers to vote against the bill for a free trade agreement with Peru, even if it means calling on the government to redo its work to ensure that the rules of the game are clear and will benefit both countries involved—both Peru, a developing country, and Canada and Quebec. </div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How did we come to that position? We went to Peru. We met people from Colombia when we studied an agreement with that country. As for the softwood lumber agreement, many businesses in my own riding were affected. We took part in the consultation process to see if we should support the agreement. Companies and unions told us that the agreement had to be signed and that the companies needed the money as fast as possible to avoid bankruptcy. That was the position of all regions of Quebec and not only of my own. That was a pragmatic position that took the context into account. We never said that the agreement was a great deal.

Considering what we have experienced and the numerous lawsuits of various multinationals, whether concerning Mexico, the United States or Canada, I would like to ask my colleague the following question. Considering that we have asked this government repeatedly for years to ensure that these investment agreements do more to protect the businesses and individuals in the respective countries against foreigners who come in and exploit businesses, and want to have control in terms of public health and environmental precautionary principles, how can this government propose such agreements? The result is an automatic loss of sovereignty and control for each of the respective governments.

Canada could become a major contributor to socio-economic development, but certainly not under the free trade agreement between Canada and Peru. </div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order for this agreement to help increase the wealth of the Peruvian people, it would have to contain measures to ensure sustainable development and help the people to thrive. In addition, the free trade agreement between Canada and Peru contains a clause to protect investment that was copied from chapter 11 of NAFTA and will enable companies to sue governments. We think that this clause could impede the social and economic development of Peru.</div>

It creates a drain on the public treasury. For example, that clause is used in land expropriation cases, but it is also being used increasingly when a corporation can prove that it has lost profits.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many corporations do an excellent job; they respect the environment and abide by the principles of the International Labour Organization.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The agreements that were recently made and that we will be discussing this week, the free trade agreements with Peru and Colombia, have similarities that absolutely must be pointed out. First, Peru and Colombia are not very significant trading partners for Canada. Canadian exports to those countries account for something in the region of 0.1% to 0.7% of our exports. It is important to note, however, that our mining and oil companies make major Canadian investments in those countries. To protect those companies, we have to enter into bilateral agreements that have not been approved by parliamentarians in either country. Those agreements are quite often made by stealth and in great haste, and do not contain protection clauses. If they do, those clauses are so vague and so general that ultimately they are meaningless.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the main things that make Peru attractive to Canadian investors is, of course, natural resources, and mining resources in particular. The same is true of Colombia. Canadian investments in Peruvian mining hover around $5 billion. We are told that 80 Canadian mining companies are conducting mining exploration in Peru. This makes Canada the top investor in mining exploration in Peru.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naturally, it might be tempting for Peru to do business with Canada. People are told that the mining companies will bring money, generate trade, carry out exploitation activities and give them work. Attention also has to be paid to the impact of these companies' activities. They have responsibilities.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While supposedly creating prospects for Canadian businesses, the real intention of this government is to allow Canadian mining companies to go even further.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada never responded. Canada has always maintained that the host country, the one in which our mining companies operate, should put forward its own legislation to protect its territory. However, the host countries are not always in a position to do that, either because they lack the parliamentary resources, because they do not dare do so or because, in the case of Colombia, the government is so corrupt and so close to paramilitary organizations—and the latter can use aboriginal lands—that they will allow a Canadian mining company to set up there and operate with no accountability.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was 12 to 18 months ago. The Government of Canada never responded. The roundtables resulted in excellent reports, with supporting evidence, and asked that a Canadian corporate social responsibility framework be established, among other things. They asked for mandatory corporate social responsibility standards that Canadian mining companies would have to respect when working abroad. They asked for punitive measures for offending companies.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would add that, when it comes to the environment and the International Labour Organization, the agreement under consideration should offer guarantees that companies will respect the environment. In Columbia, for example, Canadian mining companies polluted rivers in a certain region so badly that they turned pink because of heavy use of nitrates and other strong chemicals in the extraction process. Whole populations were poisoned because of it. In Peru, one company has already been taken to task because the level of sulphur in the air around the mine was harmful to residents.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since I do not have much time left, I am going to conclude by saying that, when we are doing business with a country, we must at least make sure that we are not just trying to do business at any cost, but that we do so with the protection of individuals and of the environment in mind. </div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has and will continue to stand up for all industries in Canada, including the steel industry. However, as a trading nation, our steel producers must have access not only to markets but to the tools they need to be competitive, including the ability to address unfairly dumped or subsidized imports. This is particularly true of the steel industry as it is a global industry.</div>
</p><a name="Para1417402" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The steel industry competes in a highly competitive, global market that continues to face many challenges, especially today with what is happening in the world. These include global overcapacity and trade distorting policies such as subsidies, as the member mentioned, in many countries.</div>
</p><a name="Para1417403" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian industry is highly integrated in relation to the North American marketplace. In fact, more than 80% of our exports go to the United States and we import just as much. It is amazing to see the integration of that particular market. With specialized factories on both sides of the border, specialized factories doing one thing but not the other, steel products move back and forth across the border in processed and in finished form.</div>
</p><a name="Para1417404" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any threat to market access in either country would simply disrupt this critical industry that is so important to Canadian families and Canadian workers. That is exactly why our government was so heavily engaged with the United States when the buy American provisions were included in the economic stimulus package. We were worried and we took it very seriously and took very serious steps immediately. We continue to encourage the U.S. administration to implement the provisions in a manner that is consistent with its international trade obligations and consistent with our relationship with the United States. </div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We recognize the gravity of the current economic situation and its role in the promotion of growth and prosperity. In budget 2009, this accelerates and expands federal infrastructure investments with almost $12 billion in new funding over two years. This is great news for the steel industry, for Canadians, for Canadian workers and for their families. </div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the government recognizes that all Canadian industries, including steel, can be confronted with injuries such as dumping or subsidized imports. That is why we have measures, such as our Special Import Measures Act, that allow Canadian producers to seek protection from such imports. That is very important and we have the tools in place to do so. This law is there to protect Canadian producers and the steel industry is one of the most frequent users of this law. Canada has anti-dumping or countervail duties in place against imports of six steel products from twelve different countries, including major exporters like China and India.</div>
