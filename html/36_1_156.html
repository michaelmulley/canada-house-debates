</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (for the Minister of Transport, 
Lib.)</B> moved that Bill C-58, an act to amend the Railway Safety 
Act and to make a consequential amendment to another act, be read 
the second time and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK5"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stan Dromisky (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in the 
House to begin the second reading debate on Bill C-58. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In September 1997, following the train derailment near Biggar, 
Saskatchewan, the Minister of Transport ensured that a number of 
immediate safety actions were taken by the railway. 
Subsequently, the department ensured that a Transportation Safety 
Board interim recommendation on the derailment was addressed so 
that travelling Canadians could benefit from the recommended 
safety enhancements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Shortly after the derailment the minister announced that he was 
delaying the reintroduction in the House of Commons of the 
amendments to the Railway Safety Act.  He directed departmental 
officials to examine other possible improvements to the 
legislation as well to see whether we could improve the 
mechanisms for overseeing safety and regulatory compliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A rail safety review committee was immediately established and 
was composed of railway safety, risk management and regulatory 
experts.  The committee was also asked to consult with the rail 
industry and other stakeholders and to recommend ways to further 
improve rail safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Departmental officials reported back to the minister last 
January and in March the minister announced that he had accepted 
the department's rail safety review committee's recommendations. 
At the same time, he made public the committee's report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that time the minister asked his officials to proceed quickly 
with the committee recommendations that did not require changes 
to the legislative framework, such as improvements to rail safety 
practices and rules.  This work began in the spring of 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I am pleased to inform the House that the legislative 
changes imposed in this bill include a number of new provisions 
recommended by the review committee which will further enhance 
safety in Canada's rail industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These new amendments to the Railway Safety Act were prepared in 
extensive consultation with the railway industry, railway unions, 
the Federation of Canadian Municipalities, the Canadian Safety 
Council, Transport 2000 and provincial officials. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consultations were held as late as October of this year to 
provide stakeholders with an opportunity to reach a consensus on 
the intent of the proposed amendments in Bill C-58. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These proposed changes are fully modernized and reflect good 
practices used in safety regimes for other modes of 
transportation, changes such as:  a new policy clarifying the 
objective of the act as well as the roles and responsibilities of 
all parties relative to railway safety; authority to require 
railways to implement safety management systems; authority to 
require railways to report safety-critical information for the 
purpose of railway system safety performance monitoring; a new 
safety compliance order targeted at safety management system 
deficiencies; increased authority for rail safety inspectors; and 
an improved consultative process.

<A HREF="#LINKT1"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislative framework will allow the department to require 
railways under federal jurisdiction to adopt formal safety 
management systems.  The department would have full authority 
under the legislation to ensure that railways comply with this 
requirement and to take effective action as required to ensure 
full compliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This will also respond to earlier recommendations of the 
Transportation Safety Board with respect to more effective means 
of auditing railway safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The inclusion of the safety management systems is expected to 
improve railway safety by promoting a safety culture within the 
railroads, enabling railways to demonstrate their commitment to 
safety and demonstrating that railways are in compliance with 
regulatory requirements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the consultations with stakeholders it was evident that the 
majority of them wished to have a consultative committee on 
matters of safety.  I am pleased to say, as the minister 
previously announced in March 1998, that the department is 
committed to the establishment of a permanent consultative 
committee of departmental officials and rail safety stakeholders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The objective of this committee, which will be comprised of all 
interested parties, is to ensure that decision making on issues 
of railway safety includes effective consultation.  This would 
involve an active two-way communication to develop a better 
understanding of issues and solutions.  This committee will 
complement the improved consultative requirements contained in 
this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is anticipated that the first meeting will be held early in 
the new year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every year many Canadians lose their lives at crossings or while 
trespassing on railway property.  This is the most significant 
problem facing rail safety and a major effort has been undertaken 
to respond to it.  The Department of Transport has a program and 
a number of initiatives in place, and this act also contains 
provisions to further improve safety at crossings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The department's program in this regard is covered by the 
following four Es:  elimination, engineering, enforcement and 
education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first E stands for elimination.  The objective is to 
eliminate unnecessary and unsafe crossings so that road users 
will be using, wherever possible, those with automated warning 
systems or better physical characteristics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One amendment for crossings would allow the minister to make a 
grant as compensation for closures.  Another would allow him to 
control the opening of new crossings on high speed lines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second E stands for engineering.  As part of the Transport 
Canada crossing monitoring program, the new bill will provide for 
safety reviews at crossings in certain circumstances such as 
serious accidents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third E stands for enforcement.  The railway safety 
inspector's overall monitoring for compliance can result in a 
variety of safety actions being taken for identified 
deficiencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the fourth E stands for education.  Education is vital 
if we are to obtain the full benefits from the other three Es. 
For example, the Department of Transport is a full partner in 
operation lifesaver which educates Canadians on safety issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed changes will also support a national program called 
direction 2006 which aims to reduce by 50% the number of 
highway/railway grade crossing collisions and trespassing 
incidents on railway property by that year.  This program has the 
ongoing support of all stakeholders.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government faces a huge challenge to reduce greenhouse gases 
and improve the environment.  The proposed bill includes an 
authority to make regulations restricting emissions from the 
operation of railroad equipment.  There is at present no such 
authority federally and the proposed Canadian Environment 
Protection Act excludes railway equipment.  This proposed power 
will allow for a cleaner environment and will help Canada meet 
worldwide quotas for emissions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed legislative changes will enhance the ability of the 
railway safety system to give reasonable assurance of the 
continuing state of railway safety in Canada and to contribute to 
sustainable transportation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To conclude, Transport Canada's first priority is and always 
will be the safety of the transportation system in Canada.  I 
believe these amendments to the Railway Safety Act will 
strengthen the regulatory framework that governs safety in this 
critical mode of transportation.  I believe they will provide the 
department with the means to ensure that Canada's railways will 
continue to improve their safety performance as we head into the 
21st century.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills—Grasslands, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am delighted to address this bill which I am sure 
everyone here finds extremely fascinating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-58 was introduced on November 5.  Now a mere 15 days 
later, which happens in this case to be only six sitting days, we 
are debating it at second reading.  The Standing Committee on 
Transport may consider this bill as soon as next Tuesday which is 
eight sitting days after its first reading.  Do I smell a whiff 
of prorogation in the air? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I gave a few stakeholders a heads up as to what was 
happening, they were quite astonished and not at all amused. I 
understand that some of them are already prepared to appear on 
short notice and that they have contacted the committee clerk. 
The minister has been sitting on this legislation for several 
weeks, like a hen sitting on an egg and now suddenly it is full 
speed ahead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is reminiscent of what went on a year ago with the marine 
act, Bill C-9, essentially a good piece of legislation that was 
seriously flawed in a couple of places with regard to financing. 
There were stakeholders who were extremely upset about it but 
they were not heard.  Now, a year later, the flaws in the bill 
are already coming back to haunt us, specifically relative to the 
port of Halifax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a safety bill.  Safety is a relative term.  It means 
different things to different people.  In the transportation 
sector the word safety is often used and has been used to promote 
some dubious proposals, demands and schemes.  There are people 
who do not understand that there is no such thing as absolute 
safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we wanted absolute transportation safety, I suppose we could 
all travel by foot, however we would still run the risk of 
breaking a leg.  A less drastic but equally unacceptable measure 
would be to lower speed limits for all modes of transportation 
and make such things as airline tickets and automobiles beyond 
the purchasing power of most people.  Certainly we would be safer 
but modern society with its emphasis on convenience, time and 
cost effectiveness would never tolerate such restrictions. The 
question then becomes one of what level of safety we are prepared 
to accept. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Railway Safety Act is a relatively new piece of legislation. 
Bill C-58 seeks to legislate amendments recommended by the 
statutory five year review committee, as has been explained by 
the parliamentary secretary. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1020"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT4"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT4"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1020

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The review committee's report was tabled in parliament in 
February 1995. It recommended 69 amendments to streamline railway 
safety and to reduce the bureaucratic burden. The government 
introduced Bill C-43 in May 1996 incorporating 60 of the 69 
recommendations, but the bill died on the Order Paper when the 
election was called in April 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1995 report described the railway mode as an extremely safe 
means of moving freight and people in this country.  Indeed the 
report found that Canadian railways have a good safety record 
when compared with other modes of transportation and when 
compared to other countries' rail operations.  The report also 
noted that work related safety of railways and the manner in 
which their operations are carried out have clearly shown 
improvement.  The picture painted by the Transportation Safety 
Board however is a little murkier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Main track train derailments increased by 75% over the last nine 
years, from 101 in 1988 to 177 in 1997.  We seem to be running 
tracks along the right of way instead of on the rails in this 
country.  Occurrences of train collisions on main tracks have 
increased by 44%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is some good news.  Accidents at road crossings have 
decreased by 39% over the same period.  More good news is the 
total personal injury accidents for all types of rail related 
incidents have decreased by almost 80% since 1988.  The number of 
total fatalities is quite low and it has not changed much in the 
last nine years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In response to the 1997 fatal derailment of a VIA passenger 
train at Biggar, Saskatchewan, the minister announced that he 
would delay reintroduction of these amendments to the Railway 
Safety Act in order to further study other possible improvements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unlike its predecessor, Bill C-58 will now require railway 
companies to draw up and implement safety management systems. 
These systems will have to be vetted and approved by the 
minister.  The minister may also order a railway company to take 
necessary corrective measures if he believes that the safety 
management system is deficient. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is unfortunately no avenue to appeal a ministerial order 
to an independent tribunal, a tribunal similar perhaps to the 
Civil Aviation Tribunal.  There is a rumour that Transport Canada 
is planning a Canada transportation tribunal for rail, aviation, 
marine and pipelines.  I sincerely hope that the rumour is true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One curious change from Bill C-43 was the omission of an 
amendment which would have explicitly given railways the right of 
way through road crossings.  I am not a rail safety expert but it 
seems to me to be plain common sense that road crossing users 
should yield to a train.  Trains are bigger. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-58 goes further than its predecessor in that it increases 
the powers of railway safety inspectors, particularly over road 
crossings.  This includes broadening the inspectors' access 
authority and their authority to obtain documents in order to 
enforce the act.  There are concerns again that there is no 
established independent venue to appeal the decisions of railway 
safety inspectors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another new amendment will insert a policy statement itemizing 
the objectives of the act directly into the legislation.  These 
objectives include: promotion and provision of safety for the 
public and employees; protection of property; stakeholder 
collaboration and participation; the recognition that railway 
safety is primarily the responsibility of railway companies. 
Flexibility, efficiency and modernity are the new catch phrases 
for Canada's rail safety regulatory system.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its 1995 report the review committee recommended that 
Canada's rail safety system be made non-prescriptive and industry 
driven.  It advocated improvements to the overall safety 
framework but recommended leaving the details to the appropriate 
authorities.  Bill C-58 therefore contains a number of technical 
amendments to streamline the regulatory process and reduce red 
tape. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The streamlined safety regulatory system proposed by Bill C-58 
can be summarized as follows:  the government continues to set 
rail safety standards; the railway companies decide after 
consulting with other stakeholders what safety rules are 
necessary and how best to meet those standards; and the 
government approves the rules, allows for exemptions, monitors 
for compliance and when necessary, enforces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new regime will also provide temporary regulatory exemptions 
to railway companies for the purpose of conducting tests related 
to rail transportation. The proposed regulatory regime will also 
require that the railways consult interested organizations as 
part of their process for creating operational safety rules and 
also when applying for exemptions from them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-58 seeks to improve the provisions for the security of 
railway property.  It includes a new designation, screening 
officers to screen persons or goods before they are taken on 
board a train or into a restricted area such as a freight yard. 
The terms of reference for screening are very similar to those 
currently practised by airlines and in airports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to road crossings, most MPs are probably already 
very familiar with the whistling issue.  Many constituents and 
municipalities have sought help from their federal 
representatives to shepherd them through the whistling removal 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whistling through road crossings is an important safety tool, 
but the noise can torment people living close to a railway line. 
The new legislation is still somewhat convoluted, but any 
simplification of the removal process will be welcomed by 
communities requesting the cessation of whistling through 
residential areas, provided of course that other safety 
requirements are met. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-58 will also strengthen and clarify federal regulatory 
powers over road crossings, including legislating ministerial 
authority over the construction, alteration and maintenance of 
such crossings, and making regulations respecting the control of 
vehicular and pedestrian traffic on road approaches to crossings. 
Cabinet will have the power to require railway companies, road 
authorities or persons who have rights to a crossing to conduct a 
safety review of that crossing following an accident. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One significant change to existing rules is the section of Bill 
C-58 which will authorize road authorities to enter onto any land 
in the vicinity of the crossing to cut down overgrown trees or 
brush perceived to be a hazard to safe railway operations. 
However, the government has neglected to tie up some loose ends 
pointed out to it by stakeholders in committee the last time 
around.  Specifically, municipalities expressed concerns over 
potential liability.  They also wanted to know who will pay for 
brush clearing, the local taxpayers or the railways.  Good 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, although Bill C-58 is necessarily limited in 
scope, in fact most of it, if we cut through all the thickets, 
seems to apply in one way or another to road crossings and is a 
step in the right direction toward greater railway safety. 
Although the proposed amendments appear to be good ones, the bill 
is highly technical. I want to hear from the stakeholders in 
committee before passing judgment.  I do hope that we will be 
given the time to do that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Mercier (Terrebonne—Blainville, BQ ):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
September 3, 1997, a train derailment in Saskatchewan led to one 
fatality.  This moved the government to speed up the 
introduction of a bill to bring up to date and enhance railway 
safety by amending the legislation dating back to 1989. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A committee of experts was appointed to prepare this new 
legislative text, and this is what we are now looking at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, it is regrettable that it took an accident and a 
fatality to move the government to speed up introduction of a 
bill that had been needed for some time.  Nevertheless, if it is 
a good law, one that improves railway safety, who could be 
against it. 
There is, however, one point on which we do not agree, and on 
which we will be introducing an amendment.  I will come to that 
later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will start with a brief summary of the objectives of this 
bill.  First of all, to enhance the government's ability to get 
the railways to remedy nuisances and hazards relating to safety 
and to the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, it also improves collaboration between the various 
parties involved in railway transportation, namely the 
companies, the government, the municipal authorities, the 
railway unions, and those who own or lease railroad stock. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, the bill is aimed at reducing harmful emissions from 
locomotives for the good of the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We fully support the objective of this bill. I am also quite 
pleased with clause 18, which should address something that 
bothers people in our region and in many other regions too. I am 
talking about train whistles. In my region, there is a passenger 
train that goes by around 6 a.m., and most people do not 
appreciate being woken up so early in the morning, except of 
course if it is a matter of safety, which is not always the 
case, and municipalities are in the best position to determine 
if it is. Therefore, we fully agree with the proposed clause I 
am about to read. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It states, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>No person shall use the whistle on any railway equipment in an 
area within a municipality if 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(<I>a</I>) the area meets the requirements prescribed for the purposes 
of this section; and 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(<I>b</I>) the government of the municipality—which is the best judge—by 
resolution declares that it agrees that such whistles should 
not be used in that area and has, before passing the resolution, 
(i) consulted the railway company that operates the relevant 
line of railway, (ii) notified each relevant association or 
organization, and (iii) given public notice of its intention to 
pass the resolution. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Notwithstanding this clause, the train conductor may of course 
use the whistle in an emergency. This way, my fellow citizens 
will be able to sleep more soundly in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I now come to our concern, which will be addressed in an 
amendment we will be introducing. 
The existing legislation states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>24.(1) The governor in council may make regulations 
</UL>
<Clause 19 amends this section by adding the following: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(<I>f</I>.1) respecting the construction, alteration and maintenance of 
roads for the purpose of ensuring safe railway operations. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our amendment will ensure that the costs associated with such 
alterations imposed on municipalities are borne by the federal 
government, and not by the municipalities on which these 
alterations are imposed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are my remarks on this bill, which we will support, but 
only after introducing the amendment I just mentioned.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney—Victoria, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
on behalf of the New Democratic Party I am happy to say a few 
words on the Bill C-58 to amend the Railway Safety Act. 
The bill is a complex one and the government has asked that we 
co-operate with it in moving it quickly through second reading to 
committee stage. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1035"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that our transportation spokesperson, the hon. member for 
Churchill, is very keen to review the bill when it goes to the 
Standing Committee on Transport and indeed to hear from the 
various stakeholders and the many witnesses who will appear 
before that committee to deal with the intricacies of that 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For that reason and because it is important to hear from those 
stakeholders we will co-operate with the government's request to 
date.  However, government members should not take our 
congeniality at this stage to mean that we will give them an easy 
time of the legislation when it goes to committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some points in the legislation that are positive but 
important questions remain to be answered.  When dealing with 
bills as intricate and comprehensive as this one, committees have 
to review them very carefully and systematically to avoid 
unintended consequences or unforeseen results.  That is why the 
testimony of the witnesses will be particularly important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill does many things.  It seeks to update the Railway 
Safety Act and it includes some positive measures to strengthen 
enforcement of safety regulations.  It also addresses concerns 
about noise pollution from train whistles which was addressed by 
the previous speaker from the Bloc Quebecois. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since passenger rail service was abandoned by first the 
Conservative government and not reinstated by this government, in 
the part of the country I come from in Cape Breton we miss the 
sound of the railway whistle.  There are others who may miss it. 
When I grew up there were those who would complain about the late 
night whistles, but there was also a rumour that those who lived 
close to the railway line tended to have more children.  Maybe we 
will hear from witnesses in that regard before the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On a more serious note, one area we will be looking at very 
carefully is the clause dealing with the medical fitness of 
railway employees designated as critical to railway safety 
operation.  Admittedly, since these workers are responsible for 
the lives and safety of Canadians, it is crucial that they be 
medically fit when on the job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, however, there is a careful balancing act 
here.  We must be careful not to go too far to infringe on an 
individual's right to work.  Workers must not be prevented from 
working to support themselves and their families unless there is 
good reason.  It would be interesting to see—and it could be a 
very progressive step—if there was some kind of obligation on 
the part of the corporations to assist the workers in ensuring 
their fitness for the job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know there are problems in terms of fitness.  As Canadians 
work harder and harder, do more and more work and have less and 
less leisure time, those who are fortunate enough to work, their 
physical health suffers.  It would be an opportunity to see 
corporations in the railway business take the lead in this area 
and assist in providing their employees with the time and 
facilities, with perhaps some financial incentives, to ensure 
they are medically fit to do the job, especially if that is a 
requirement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another area of particular concern is that the bill in its 
current form empowers railway companies by requiring the Minister 
of Transport to consult with them in certain circumstances. At 
the same time the bill does away with the railway safety 
consultative committee.  This is of particular concern to us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That committee, composed of representatives from industry, 
labour and other stakeholders, advises Transport Canada on 
railway safety issues.  Bill C-58 will be replacing that by 
requiring the Minister of Transport to consult with the 
corporations.  It does not do the same thing for the other 
stakeholders.  That is an important distinction and an important 
area to explore at the committee level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The discrepancy perhaps reflects the Liberals' corporatist 
ideological bias, not to mention the propensity to reward those 
who support them financially.  We are however encouraged that the 
bill at least recognizes the importance of outside consultation. 
It recognizes that government bureaucracy is not infallible and 
that there is a place for outside opinions, but simply consulting 
with the railway companies alone is not sufficient.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us face it.  If a railway company is in business its 
objective is to meet the bottom line.  That is not always 
consistent with the public good.  This is something that we 
understand in the New Democratic Party.  The role of government 
is to ensure, protect and enhance the public good.  That is not 
necessarily the role of a private corporation.  Therefore only 
consulting with railway companies will not give the necessary 
balanced picture that is required.  We believe it is important 
that other stakeholders be consulted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned that we miss the sound of the railway whistle on 
Cape Breton.  We have not given up the fight in that regard.  It 
is my hope that the bill will have some relevance.  Indeed there 
is a private railway company in the part of the country I come 
from and the riding I represent.  It will have significance and 
impact on my riding.  What is lacking is passenger rail service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would take every opportunity in the House to encourage the 
Minister of Transport to re-examine the decision of the 
government not to reinstate that passenger rail service.  At the 
time that it was dismantled by the Mulroney government it was 
clear that members of the Liberal Party were opposed to it.  I 
attended the hearings in my own riding and we still await some 
remedial action in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However I will not take any more time in the House on this issue 
because it has to go to committee.  I have said that we are 
complying with the government's request to move the bill to 
committee as quickly as possible.  Therefore I offer our 
conditional support at this stage. 
<P><A NAME="LINK9"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is with pleasure that I rise today on behalf of the Progressive 
Conservative Party to speak to second reading of Bill C-58, an 
act to amend the Railway Safety Act and to make a consequential 
amendment to another act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is basically the same as the previous Bill C-43 which 
was introduced during the last parliament.  Unfortunately it died 
on the order paper at the call of the last election.  I would 
like to point out our disappointment that the bill was not 
introduced earlier.  I hope this does not reveal that safety is 
not the minister's number one concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill proposes amendments to the Railway Safety Act which 
came into effect in January 1988.  A statutory review took place 
after five years and the result was the previous Bill C-43.  We 
are pleased with the exhaustive consultation which took place 
with the stakeholders involved during the mandatory review and 
with their valuable input.  It should be noted that this is an 
ongoing process.  As the minister has repeatedly stated, safety 
is his number one concern and we will continue to hold him to 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Railway Safety Act which passed in 1988 was a significant 
change in the way we regulate railways and how railways interact 
with government.  This has proven to be a very good approach, and 
with the legislation before us today I hope it will become much 
better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The railway system makes up an important part of our national 
fabric and is a great economic engine for the country. This great 
national work does not come without some unfortunate costs.  What 
I am speaking about is the many lives which have been lost at 
railway crossings every year.  The railway companies work very 
hard to ensure that we have the most up to date technologies and 
warning signals available.  I would like to thank them for their 
effort, but I think the federal government must play a much 
larger role in the safety issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At a time when the government is looking at revitalizing our 
passenger service we should ensure that the railway network is as 
safe as possible.  Where road and rail meet many safety concerns 
have to be addressed.  There are currently too many level 
crossing accidents in Canada.  I am aware that there are some 
innovative ways to prevent these accidents from occurring.  The 
old mentality of creating more bells and guards may not be the 
only way to attack the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. colleague from Cumberland—Colchester, who is the 
official transportation critic for the Progressive Conservative 
Party, will examine the bill in further detail in committee and 
if further changes are needed I am sure they will be welcome. As 
the hon. member for Cumberland—Colchester has proven in the 
House, he is an able defender of the critic portfolio of 
transportation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously I speak of his involvement with respect to toll 
highways in the Atlantic provinces.  He has brought that issue to 
the House and has dealt with it very effectively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to deal with rail safety.  There are a number of 
very good points that are going to come forward in committee with 
respect to this piece of legislation.  There are a couple of 
things I must put forward with respect to rail transportation 
particularly in western Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, rail transportation is a vital economic link 
particularly in western Canada.  In my community of Brandon, 
Manitoba we are blessed with having two main lines, the CP and 
the CN.  One runs through the city and one runs north of the 
city.  We are pleased to have both main railway lines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I talked about the economic viability of western Canada with 
respect to the railroads.  I speak obviously of the 
transportation necessity of moving commodities and products 
throughout western Canada.  The number one commodity without 
question is grain.  We export the major portion of grain that is 
being produced right now.  We get it to ports by rail 
transportation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Potash is important to the province of Saskatchewan.  It is a 
commodity that in most instances is transported to international 
markets.  There are a number of industrial now being produced in 
western Canada that must find their way to globalized markets. 
Again, rail transportation is that vital link.  Also, coal is 
very important to B.C., requiring rail transportation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason I mention those commodities is that there is 
substantial traffic on the main lines in western Canada.  Unlike 
the previous speaker, the hon. member from Cape Breton who not 
longer has the opportunity of listening to train whistles, in my 
area we hear the whistling of trains on a fairly regular basis. 
The reason I mention that is there is a section in this bill that 
speaks to train whistles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take minute to explain the situation that I have 
found myself in with respect to train whistles going through some 
communities with controlled crossings.  Under the current 
regulations the main line railroad continues to blow whistles at 
crossings.  The municipality has on many occasions tried to 
curtail some of that whistling in residential areas.  It has 
fallen on deaf ears. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will read the section in the legislation that says the 
minister will now have the opportunity of looking at whistling in 
municipalities.  Also, municipalities will now have some input. 
Section 23(1) says that the government of the municipality by 
resolution declares that it agrees that such whistles should not 
be used in that area, and has before passing the resolution 
consulted the railway company that operates the relevant rail 
lines, notified each relevant association or organization, and 
given public notice of its intention to pass the resolution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What that now does is give the opportunity for some 
municipalities to improve their quality of life when main lines 
run through their communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this instance the municipality did pass a resolution.  It 
suggested it would pay any additional insurance costs the railway 
might incur.  It was a controlled railway crossing with not only 
whistles but arms that came down to protect the travelling 
public. This legislation would now allow the minister to be 
involved and to allow those types of changes to be made.  That is 
very positive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a couple of other issues that have to deal with rail 
transportation that are not dealt with in the safety bill.  The 
hon. member for Cumberland—Colchester from the Progressive 
Conservative Party will bring them forward.  It has been 
mentioned by previous speakers that railroads are doing a 
reasonable job with respect to safety.  In some cases they have 
also abdicated their responsibility in other areas.  I 
specifically speak of line abandonment and the ability for short 
line operators to work in rural communities, particularly in 
western Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation, however, is of safety.  I compliment the 
railroads for attempting to put into place safety measures that 
are as good as possible.  This legislation will help them do that 
with the assistance of the minister's office.

lot of experience with respect to railroads and rail safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the committee and the minister will listen to those 
proposals put forward in the form of amendments so that this 
legislation can be even better than what is being proposed right 
now.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is a pleasure to participate in a debate on a bill where we 
seem to have some agreement on all sides of the House. I think it 
is fundamentally because of the importance of rail safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members opposite may be aware that this is the 20th anniversary 
of the train derailment in my city of Mississauga which resulted 
in the largest peace time evacuation in the history of our 
country.  We moved a quarter of a million people out of our city 
in stages in about four or five days and did it quite 
successfully actually. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were no deaths and no serious injuries caused by the train 
derailment but the actual derailment and subsequent investigation 
and involvement with CP rail and the hearings that went on really 
brought out some major improvements led by the municipality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When that train derailed, I had an almost out of body experience 
of laying in my bed and seeing the entire sky light up. I thought 
it was Consumers Gas that had exploded or something like that.  I 
jumped into the car and drove over toward the light, which shows 
how bright I was.  I arrived at the corner of Dundas Street and 
Mavis Road just in time for the second explosion, an explosion 
that shot chemicals and chlorine gas into the air. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proof that was later found, in a somewhat frightening way, 
was there were hundreds of dead birds around our city because of 
the chlorine in combination with the explosion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Chlorine is carried in great abundance across this land on our 
rail system.  A lot of those cars that we see trundling through 
our residential communities are not carrying milk.  They are 
carrying dangerous chemicals. Chlorine is a low seeking gas that 
will actually go into the river and sewer systems and wind up in 
peoples' homes.  It is a very serious safety concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I think saved our community from catastrophe was the fact 
that the explosion went straight up and took the chlorine 
mushroom cloud straight up into the air.  It killed some birds 
but fortunately no people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was actually the acting mayor, which is a hard thing to be 
when Hazel is the mayor, but she was out of town at the time this 
accident occurred. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is apparently no truth to the rumour that Hazel was seen 
jumping on the car going through Streetsville in an attempt to 
derail it because, as we all know, she has become extremely 
famous right across the land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In all seriousness, that fame is due to the hard nosed efforts 
that she, the members of council, the staff, the city and the 
residents put forward in demanding improvements to safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the issues in safety has to do with labelling of the cars 
going through.  I am sure members would agree that is extremely 
important for fire departments.  One of the real frightening 
aspects of dealing with that train derailment 20 years ago was 
that our firefighters had to go into the fire not knowing what 
was there.  They were completely unaware because there was no 
labelling system.  They had no idea whether there was another gas 
filled car ready to explode as they went in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Frankly, our firefighters in Mississauga were heroes on that 
night and the next day as they fought the fire. 
They had tremendous difficulty in putting it out and they did so 
in the face of tremendous personal risk.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rail safety is critical to all of us.  We think of it in the 
terms the former speaker talked about, the two rail lines going 
through Manitoba. We think of it in terms more today of hauling 
grain and perhaps freight.  But the reality is there is a 
proposal that is always kicked around, it seems from election to 
election, to put a high speed train in the Windsor to Quebec City 
corridor, where we have the population that could justify such a 
high speed commuter passenger trail, something that would surpass 
the VIA Rail service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are to go this route then safety is clearly a critical 
issue and it is the quality of the beds, the quality of the 
actual infrastructure these trains go across.  If members have 
ever had the experience of travelling on the Shinkansen in 
Tokyo, they will agree and realize that the nature of the 
infrastructure has to be at such a high level to accommodate the 
high speed of trains of that nature that frankly I do not think 
our infrastructure would suffice today.  So we need to address 
safety from that point of view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whistle blowing is interesting.  I have heard members talk about 
that.  Anyone who might be familiar with my part of the world 
would know that the provincial government several years ago built 
a major highway right through Mississauga and connecting up at 
the 410 in Brampton.  It is called Highway 403. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the acquisition of land to accommodate the road right of way 
and all the allowances required, there was one farmer who was a 
holdout.  For years we could never figure out why a train was 
travelling right through the heart of communities like Erin 
Mills, Medowvale and Deer Run in my riding.  We could never 
figure out why the train was blowing its whistle at all hours of 
the night and seemingly with some joy.  The conductor would sit 
right on that horn and the noise of course would result in a 
number of rather dramatic phone calls to my office, since I was 
the councillor of the day, people complaining about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We found out there was an unprotected crossing as a result of 
not being able to acquire the land.  It was a bit of a lovers 
lane apparently and that is all it was used for.  Know the 
blowing of the whistle is important for safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The member still has plenty of time

he spanked his five-year old son for continuing to kick the

</I></B></P><P align=left>The aim of this day is to make better known and to understand 
the factors that contribute to the growth of children, 
especially very young children, so we may help them realize 
their full potential. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Several events will take place across Canada to mark National 
Child Day.  Many communities have organized events for children 
and their families.

Saint-Viateur d'Outrement church to honour the tragically 
shortened life and the memory of Michel Trudeau. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His most unfortunate death hit us all as Canadians.  We, as

exemplified for many years.

in the measure in which they can bring solace, I know I am 
expressing the deep feelings of all parties in offering to Mr. 
Pierre Elliot Trudeau, Mrs. Margaret Kemper and Michel's brothers 
Justin and Sacha our most profound sympathy.

last week I attended the global warming negotiations in Buenos 
Aires. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Little progress was made toward meeting the goals set down in 
Kyoto last year and one simply has to ask “Why?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could it be that many of the delegates to the Kyoto protocol 
arrived home in their respective countries last year only to be 
beat up because of the unrealistic goals they had agreed to? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The distinct lack of agreement in Buenos Aires on key issues 
such as inclusion of developing countries or emissions trading 
mechanisms makes it appear that many countries want to push 
negotiations well into the next century and then use that as the 
excuse for not meeting the global goals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why not have the political backbone and admit it up front.  The

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 1993, 
the Canadian government designated November 20 as national child 
day, to commemorate two major events in the history of the 
United Nations, namely the adoption of the Declaration of the 
Rights of the Child, in 1958, and of the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child, in 1989. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On this day, my thoughts are with the children who suffer from 
hardship, violence and hunger. We do not have the right to 
betray these fragile human beings, nor do we have the right to 
betray their distressed parents, who can no longer meet their 
most basic needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet, this government continues to turn its back on poverty by 
contributing, through its political choices, to increasing the 
ever widening gap between the rich and the poor. Instead of 
indexing its tax system, this government prefers to 
underhandedly take money from the poor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us hope that this child day will arouse the conscience of a 
government more concerned about its visibility than about 
putting children and their parents—

poverty.  He finally discovered that there is third world poverty 
in the country and called child poverty a national disgrace.

pushed half a million more children into poverty since the 
Liberals were elected in 1993.  With only 14 months to go until 
the year 2000, New Democrats call on the finance minister to 
introduce measures to eliminate child poverty come hell or high

</I></B></P><P align=left>The goal of the program is to teach computer and literacy

to the aboriginal people in this area.  The program is 
administered by the Native Alcohol and Drug Abuse Counselling 
Association which is based in Indian Brook at the Eagle's Nest 
treatment centre.  The program requires that all of its members 
are alcohol and drug free. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The program has been an overwhelming success to date and its

continues to have the confidence of the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to point out that the NDP, with all its concern for 
social issues, unemployment, poverty and homelessness, has 
forgotten all these things.  It cannot choose to ask a question 
in that regard.  Again, it must be a vote of confidence in the

since the Deputy Prime Minister mentions poverty and other

</I></B></P><P align=left>Listening to the Deputy Prime Minister defend the solicitor 
general is a little like reading the soliloquy of <I>Hamlet</I>, 
whether he should be or not to be.  It is clear that the 
solicitor general has neither the confidence of the people of 
Canada or even members of the House.

talking to himself about these matters and avoiding important 
matters like the economic and social future of the country which 
the government is dealing with and making progress on.

itself.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, yesterday Canadians sadly observed the first 
solicitor general in history to enter the witness protection 
program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The APEC inquiry is mired in conflict, has a limited mandate and 
has now proven indiscretions by the solicitor general.  The Prime 
Minister should simply pick up the phone and call the solicitor 
general and fire him.  Apparently ministerial responsibility has 
also gone missing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the government refusing to fire the solicitor general because 
it is afraid of testimony that he might give at the APEC inquiry? 
What is more important than ethics?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the government has already said that it intends to 
co-operate fully with the commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member is so interested in the work of the 
commission then let the commission do its work and not try to 
derail the commission with the unwarranted insinuations and 
innuendoes in his questions before the House.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, we can understand the Deputy Prime Minister's 
sympathy for an incompetent solicitor general given his personal 
irresponsibility in the Airbus file two years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact remains that the solicitor general's word has now been 
contradicted.  He did in fact discuss sensitive government 
business in a public place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the Deputy Prime Minister face the reality of the solicitor 
general's breach of office and personally urge for that 
minister's resignation?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to remind the House that Mr. Toole in his affidavit said 
“At no time during our conversation did Mr. Scott suggest to me, 
nor have I learned subsequently, that he was a person who had a

in our conversation suggested to me that Mr. Scott knew what the 
outcome of the APEC commission would be”.

of his responsibilities.  The Prime Minister will be back in the 
country on Saturday evening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He has already spoken about this matter in China.  He is 
following it closely and I am sure he will have more to say about 
it when he is back in our country and he can deal with the 
unwarranted allegations of the hon. member.

position on other issues directly opposite to what the Reform

to give it due attention, but I am sure that we could find other

to ask the federal government to transfer to Quebec all the 
money earmarked for youth programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since this request is very much along the same lines as Quebec's

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources

unemployment is such a serious issue in Canada that all of us

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is not the 
PQ branch that came here this morning to say that the youth 
strategy is not working. It is the consensus among young people 
and the minister should realize that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of trying to convince himself that everything is fine, 
could the minister give us just one good reason to keep youth 
training programs under federal jurisdiction, considering that 
he has already transferred the general manpower training 
programs, and that he himself said this was a better solution? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How come what is good for workers in general is not good for 
young Quebeckers? 
<P><A NAME="LINK83"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am astonished that the member 
would dare talk about a consensus in Quebec, when the PQ branch 
here in this House is ignoring the fact that three-quarters of 
all Quebeckers do not want a referendum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are now saying “we will have a winning referendum”. The 
members on that side of the House have the gall to say that 
those Quebeckers who prefer interdependence with other Canadians 
are losers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the only winning referendum one that is won by the PQ? In 
fact, a winning referendum is one in which Quebeckers express

privatization in our health care system today.  We have a serious

<P><A NAME="LINK116"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Business Development Bank of Canada has a mandate to assist 
in developing small business in Canada.  Can the minister 
indicate if this bank is subject to any constraints on its 
behaviour with regard to its dealings with the business community 
in which it operates?  More clearly, can the minister indicate if 
there is a code of conduct that governs the operations of the 
Business Development Bank of Canada? 
<P><A NAME="LINK117"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the Business Development Bank of Canada was the first of 
the Canadian banks to publish its own code of conduct and to 
establish an ombudsman who could deal with complaints as they 
arose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the administrative responsibility of the 
government, the bank operates entirely at arm's length.  I do not 
tell it what to do or how to do it.  We established its mandate 
in accordance with an act of parliament.  It is doing a very 
impressive job at meeting the needs of small business across 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we really want to meet the needs of small business across 
Canada, we will quickly pass Bill C-53 to ensure that the Canada 
small business financing act is there for the use of small 
business by April 1 next year. 
<P><A NAME="LINK118"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
minister is aware that I have written him regarding the company 
named Eyeland Optical in St. John's, a company that is being 
forced to move from a prime storefront location to make room for 
the expansion of the Business Development Bank of Canada. 
This will probably put Eyeland Optical out of business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does the minister square that action with the bank's mandate 
to assist small business?  Does he not realize that the BDBC in 
St. John's is attempting to put a small business out of business? 
<P><A NAME="LINK119"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I know there was a tendency in Tory days to direct right 
into the bank exactly what to do and how to do it, in particular 
transactions.  We do not do it that way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bank operates as an independent commercial entity.  I am 
aware of the situation the member has raised.  I am informed that 
the bank was unaware that this situation would arise when it 
entered into an arm's length negotiation with the landlord in a 
particular situation.  I am sure the bank is doing its best to 
deal in a sensitive manner with the situation.

Toole confirms, as far as he is concerned, he heard nothing that

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>RAILWAY SAFETY ACT

<A NAME="LINK174">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-58, an 
act to amend the Railway Safety Act and to make a consequential 
amendment to another act, be read the second time and referred to 
a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  When the House was interrupted for 
question period the hon. member for Mississauga West had 13 
minutes remaining for his remarks. 
<P><A NAME="LINK175"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I would like to pick up where I left off which was on the issue 
of safety at rail crossings.  As members know, at unprotected 
crossings there is a requirement for the engineer of an 
approaching train to warn, from a certain distance, anyone who 
might be at the crossing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was telling the House about the example in my own community 
where we were experiencing, in the middle of the night, very 
extended whistles that were disturbing entire residential 
communities.  We discovered that there was one dirt or country 
road in the heart of the city not far from a landmark that many 
members may be familiar with, the Square I shopping centre.  This 
gives members an idea of the density in the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This situation was caused because of an inability to acquire 
this particular piece of property when Highway 403 was built.  It 
was left as an unprotected crossing and, as I mentioned, led to 
what is commonly referred to as lover's lane.  This crossing was 
disturbing an entire neighbourhood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It highlighted for me the importance of putting in proper 
protection at railway crossings.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come from Mississauga.  Recognizing that it is the 20th 
anniversary of the train derailment which occurred in our 
community which resulted in the largest peacetime evacuation in 
history, this is an issue which is very near and dear to my 
constituents and the people in our city. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope there is a vision for improvement to rail services.  I 
think for example of the debate going on right now as to whether 
Union Station should be acquired by the city of Toronto, the 
province, the federal government, a private sector developer, or 
a combination thereof to ensure that the architectural structure 
of Union Station is preserved.  While the history and the 
architecture is important it is the facility itself which I think 
is critical. I can see the day when Union Station would be 
connected to Pearson airport hopefully right through the heart of 
downtown Mississauga out to the airport.  I could see a rail 
connection for charter passenger flights from the Hamilton 
airport connecting into Union Station and the downtown area of my 
community and perhaps even Pearson. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could see in the future an expansion of rail services with 
high quality infrastructure in place which would allow commuters 
going to and from work and other people to access facilities such 
as Hamilton International Airport, Pearson, Union Station and 
everything in between.  The future of rail I hope is not dead in 
this country.  It is very important that we take a serious look 
at issues surrounding safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Short line railways have started up around the country as a 
result of the abandonment of certain sections of rail.  We are 
winding up with private sector businesses getting together in 
some instances almost in the form of a co-op.  I think of the 
short line that connects Collingwood, Stayner and Barrie in the 
south part of northern Ontario. It primarily serves the local 
businesses and allows them to interact with one another. It is 
vitally important if private sector railway companies are 
operating on these short line systems that safety be of prime 
concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that one day the role of rail service in this country 
might be similar to the experience in Europe and in Japan.  The 
bullet train in Japan, the Shinkansen, operates through the 
entire country. As our country grows and the infill of population 
occurs in urban communities, large populations are needed to make 
passenger service economically feasible, particularly when it is 
short line or commuter passenger service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example a subway system cannot work in areas where there are 
not large concentrations of people who can get on and off that 
facility.  The same thing could occur in the area of rail. It is 
not a vision that exists today but I think it is one that we 
should be taking a serious look at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a bit of history to show that this government is 
responding to safety in the area of rail services.  I believe 
opposition parties are supportive of this.  The government 
response to the report of the railway safety act review committee 
was tabled in parliament in June 1995. There were a number of 
amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One was to streamline the administrative process, cut down on 
red tape, provide greater involvement for interested 
organizations in determining the rules which I think is a very 
democratic response. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another was minimized disruption by train noise in communities. 
I referred to the unprotected crossings. It is not just the 
actual noise of the train that causes concern, but it is more the 
whistle as it extends to the broader community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another was to strengthen and clarify federal powers at grade 
crossings, something municipalities are very concerned about.  To 
go under or over the tracks at a grade crossing I believe costs 
$7 million or $8 million in today's terms for a fundamental, 
simple grade separation. 
Municipalities are concerned with the interaction of the 
automobile and the train and would prefer to have those grades 
separated but obviously not at their expense.

<A HREF="#LINKT26"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other amendment was to simplify and improve provisions for 
ensuring that appropriate safety measures are in place and 
finally to clarify and strengthen the power of railway safety 
inspectors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following that, Transport Canada immediately proceeded to make a 
number of other modifications which I would like to share with 
the House.  One is that the new section on testing exemptions be 
amended to include immediate exemptions for a limited application 
of short duration; second, that the new section on whistle 
cessation be amended in order that any relevant association or 
organization be advised of the municipality's intention to pass 
the anti-whistling resolution.  Once again, the importance of an 
unprotected grade crossing without a whistle would endanger 
public safety and is not something that any of us would like to 
see. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill came back to the House in 1996 but unfortunately, or 
fortunately as some of us would not be here if this had not 
occurred, the House was dissolved, there was an election and the 
bill died on the order paper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I am pleased to note that amendments in Bill C-58 
improve even further on the earlier amendment put forward and 
accepted by the government that were originally in Bill C-43.  I 
will just share those with the House: a new policy statement and 
new definitions and, very important, the authority to require 
railways to implement safety performance monitoring.  I refer the 
House to my earlier comments about the identification on the 
actual train cars that may be carrying chemicals that could be 
dangerous and this will help to improve that; a new safety 
compliance order targeted at safety management system 
deficiencies and increased authority even further for inspectors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we can all take some pride in this bill because the 
reality is the government is recognizing the significance of 
safety in the rail system not only in rural Canada in western and 
eastern Canada and northern Ontario but indeed in the heart of 
our hustling, bustling cities where citizens are impacted both in 
terms of noise and in terms of safety. Municipalities can also be 
impacted tremendously in terms of their fiscal responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is great to have this bill here.  It is about time. I 
agree with members that it would have been good if we could have 
done it quicker, but better now than not at all.  I look forward 
to this going to committee and coming back to the House for third 
and final reading with the support of all members. 
<P><A NAME="LINK176"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay—Boundary—Okanagan, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I know the original plan had been that we were going to 
put up one speaker, and I am not going to keep hon. members for 
very long, but I could not end the day without passing some 
comments on Liberal rail safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as the bill goes, we are supporting it to move to 
committee where any bill can be improved.  We certainly hope to 
discuss it openly with our colleagues on the other side and find 
ways to make the bill even better so that Canadians truly have 
rail safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thought it appropriate at this time to talk about the other 
plan of the Liberals for rail safety.  The Liberals are killing 
the economy in this country.  They are making it so that we 
produce fewer goods, we sell fewer goods, we employ fewer people 
and we tax and suck the money out of the economy.  If they keep 
doing that they will have rail safety because there will not be 
as many trains running.  They are putting more impediments in the 
way of business every day, and that includes the railroads. We 
will have the ultimate rail safety, we will have the ultimate 
highway safety and we will have industrial safety because we will 
shut everything down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the Liberals can come up with a better plan for rail 
safety and all the other types of safety than continuing their 
chaotic economic forage into taxpayer pockets and come up with 
rail safety and other types of safety that work in a thriving, 
vibrant economy.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also find it very ironic that the government would introduce a 
bill on rail safety at a time when it is derailing the APEC 
inquiry in Vancouver.  A cabinet minister, the solicitor general, 
made public statements after specifically forbidding the RCMP to 
make any type of public statement which would derail the APEC 
inquiry.  That is an interesting point which I think the Liberals 
have overlooked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently in the United States there was a huge scandal, but the 
outcome of that scandal was not what the president had done to 
initiate that scandal— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  I am reluctant to interrupt 
the hon. member, but this bill is about rail safety.  Political 
derailment may mean a lot of things to a lot of people, but when 
the bill deals with rail safety I am sure the member would want 
to address his remarks to something relevant to rail safety 
rather than derailment in a political sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the member would not want to get derailed in his remarks, 
so I would invite him to get back on the track and stick to the 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Gouk:</B>  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for putting me on 
the right track.  Being as how you wield such power from your 
position, I am sure you also use it to get the Liberals on track 
with their national agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about a government bill, be it rail safety, a tax 
bill, a justice bill, any kind of bill, I think it is appropriate 
to examine and review the credibility with which the various 
ministers bring forward these bills because each bill is brought 
forward in the name of a minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rail safety bill was brought forward in the name of the 
Minister of Transport.  There has to be credibility or those 
bills automatically suffer.  Right now the Liberal cabinet lacks 
credibility because of its failure to take action in one 
particular area and that taints everybody.  It does not matter 
which party.  When we have a problem that we ignore or try to 
cover up it automatically taints everyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have said, in the case of this rail safety bill, that we will 
go along with it.  We will help to move it to committee.  We will 
support this bill.  Our critic said that this morning.  We will 
deal with it openly and honestly when it gets to committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But it already has a black mark attached to it because it is 
presented in this House at the very time when the government is 
lacking credibility because of its failure to act on a real 
problem inside cabinet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not going to continue.  I am sure that hon. members want to 
reconsider their position on how to deal with this particular 
minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will end my remarks by saying that we want the government to 
bring in good legislation.  We want it to be credible and we want 
to be able to support it.  However, it is hard to support 
government cabinet ministers when there is a bad apple in the 
barrel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Is the House ready for the question? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The question is on the motion.  Is it 
the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(Motion agreed to, bill read the second time and 
referred to a committee) 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano:</B>  Mr. Speaker, perhaps we could call 
it 2.30 p.m. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Is it agreed that we call it 2.30 p.m.? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  It being 2.30 o'clock, this House 
stands adjourned until Monday next at 11 a.m., pursuant to 
Standing Order 24(1). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(The House adjourned at 12.25 p.m.)
