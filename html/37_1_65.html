<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>KANESATAKE INTERIM LAND BASE GOVERNANCE ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK3">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK4"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Robert Nault (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.)</B> moved that Bill S-24, an act to implement 
an agreement between the Mohawks of Kanesatake and Her Majesty in 
right of Canada respecting governance of certain lands by the 
Mohawks of Kanesatake and to amend an act in consequence, be read 
the second time and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK5"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Finlay (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I rise to address the House on second reading of Bill 
S-24, the Kanesatake interim land base governance act.  I am 
extremely pleased to be bringing this proposed legislation before 
the House at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As implementing legislation for the agreement with respect to 
Kanesatake governance and the interim land base between Canada 
and the Mohawks of Kanesatake, Bill S-24 is a key element of a 
broader process aimed at resolving the outstanding grievances of 
the Mohawks of Kanesatake and contributing to social harmony and 
economic development for the communities of Kanesatake and Oka in 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been more than a decade since the Oka crisis.  A great 
deal has been accomplished since that time but we can go no 
further in our efforts to resolve outstanding grievances of the 
Mohawks of Kanesatake without this agreement and its implementing 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time to recognize an interim land base for the Mohawks of 
Kanesatake and to establish law making powers for Kanesatake that 
other first nations have exercised for years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In an effort to deal with Mohawk claims to the lands known as 
the Seigneury  of the Lake of Two Mountains, in 1925 the 
Government of Canada began to purchase parcels of land for the 
use and occupancy of the Mohawks of Kanesatake.  Over the years 
this has resulted in a patchwork land base so that today while 
much of the Kanesatake land base consists of adjoining lands, at 
least some Kanesatake Mohawk lands are interspersed with 
non-Mohawk lands in and around the village of Oka. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legal status of these federal crown lands has never been 
resolved, which has resulted in uncertainty about the application 
and enforcement of laws on Kanesatake Mohawk lands.  This 
uncertainty has seriously undermined the ability of the Mohawks 
of Kanesatake to govern themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-24 would eliminate this uncertainty by recognizing for 
the first time an interim land base for the Mohawks of 
Kanesatake.  It provides that Kanesatake Mohawk lands would fall 
under subsection 91(24) of the Constitution Act, 1867, but not 
under the Indian Act.  Like many other first nations, the Mohawks 
of Kanesatake want to extract themselves from the cumbersome 
provisions of the Indian Act, not become further embroiled in 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-24 would ensure that the Mohawks of Kanesatake have 
powers similar to the authorities exercised by other first 
nations under the Indian Act.  They would be empowered to adopt 
and enforce land related laws in such areas as resource 
management, land zoning, residency, waste management, the health 
and quality of life of residents, construction and fire safety. 
In the event of any conflict between Kanesatake laws and federal 
laws, the federal laws would prevail.

<A HREF="#LINKT1"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill provides that the exercise of Kanesatake powers would 
be subject to the terms of a land governance code setting out the 
principles by which the Mohawk council of Kanesatake would 
operate.  The code would ensure open and responsible governance 
by the council, in the best interests of the community, with full 
political and financial accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-24 would also ensure that Kanesatake had the authority to 
enforce its community laws.  Kanesatake and Canada are already 
working with the province of Quebec to conclude a separate 
agreement on the administration of justice, after which 
Kanesatake would have the authority to appoint justices of the 
peace to adjudicate disputes over its laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To ensure that the Kanesatake Mohawk lands and non-Mohawk 
properties in the village of Oka are subject to compatible legal 
regimes, Bill S-24 would require a harmonization of Kanesatake 
laws and Oka by-laws on neighbouring lands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to report that the municipality of Oka and its 
mayor are supportive of the land governance agreement in Bill 
S-24 and that relations between Oka and Kanesatake are greatly 
improved.  Representatives of these two communities are already 
meeting to negotiate a harmonization agreement for their 
respective lands in the village and to address other issues of 
mutual concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to assure hon. members that the agreement to be 
implemented by Bill S-24 is without prejudice to any aboriginal 
or treaty rights of the Mohawks of Kanesatake, to Kanesatake's 
historic grievance in relation to the Seigneury of the Lake of 
Two Mountains or to further more far reaching agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a turnaround under way in Kanesatake.  Although many 
issues remain to be resolved, people are optimistic about their 
future.  They are proud of the Kanesatake police force, which for 
several years now has brought law and order to the community and 
enhanced the security of all residents in Kanesatake territory, 
in neighbouring Oka and their neighbouring municipalities. They 
are proud of their nursing home for the elderly.  They are proud 
of the Mohawk immersion school and youth centre now under 
construction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-24 will lay the foundation for true stability in 
Kanesatake, the kind of stability that is indispensable to real 
economic growth and the sustainable nature of the community. 
With this bill the Mohawks of Kanesatake and their neighbours in 
the municipality of Oka can all look forward to greater economic 
opportunity for the Kanesatake-Oka region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly we are on the right path.  Bill S-24 is proof positive 
that negotiation and reconciliation are the best options for 
Canada, for the Mohawks of Kanesatake and for the non-Mohawk 
residents in the region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to thank our colleagues in the other place for 
their review and approval of Bill S-24.  The hon. senators 
recognize the merits of the of the land governance agreement that 
would be implemented through this proposed legislation.  They 
have embraced the opportunity to contribute to the healing 
process in the Kanesatake-Oka region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to recognize the co-operation we have had from all 
parties in the House with respect to Bill S-24, and to urge hon. 
members to complete this bill at the first opportunity. 
<P><A NAME="LINK6"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo—Cowichan, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, it is indeed a pleasure to rise today and speak to 
Bill S-24, an act to implement an agreement between the Mohawks 
of Kanesatake and Her Majesty in right of Canada respecting 
governance of certain lands by the Mohawks of Kanesatake and to 
amend an act in consequence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me go on record today on behalf of the Canadian Alliance 
that we will be supporting Bill S-24.  However I have a number of 
concerns that I wish to address both today and as this bill moves 
through the committee stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Mohawks of Kanesatake have been faced with a unique 
situation.  For those that are not familiar with the Kanesatake 
Mohawk land claim, let me just take a moment to summarize. 
Departmental officials have described it as “perhaps the most 
difficult Indian claim which the Canadian government inherited 
from pre-Confederation administrations”. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1020"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT3"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT3"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1020
<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The history of this unique situation goes all the way back to 
the year 1717 and the French crown.  More recently, in 1945 the 
government attempted to resolve the land claim through a series 
of land purchases.  The lands purchased resulted in a patchwork 
quilt effect of Mohawk and non-Mohawk lands scattered across the 
Oka area.  This chequerboard approach continued with land 
purchases in the 1960s and the 1980s.  Past attempts to deal with 
the land claim through court actions have also been unsuccessful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I contend that the Indian Act is an archaic and 
discriminatory piece of legislation that should be eliminated 
over time, until now the Kanesatake Mohawks have not even had the 
few benefits of this legislation, as their lands have not fallen 
under the bylaw provisions of the act.  Nor have they ever been 
recognized under subsection 91(24) of the 1867 Constitution Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my understanding that this agreement will provide similar 
powers as subsection 91(24) of the 1867 Constitution, but not as 
a reserve as defined under the Indian Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have several questions regarding some of the nuts and bolts of 
the agreement.  Some of the details concerning bylaw 
harmonization between the municipality of Oka and the Kanesatake 
Mohawks, environmental issues, the issue of willing buyer willing 
seller on lands in the area and the voting process are just a few 
of the issues that are far more appropriate to deal with at the 
standing committee rather than during second reading in the House 
of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a larger issue also at stake here today that I want to 
bring to the House.  That is the due process that the Minister of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development has used to bring the 
bill before the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister has mused publicly about parliamentary reform 
in the broadest terms possible.  He has been chided by his own 
colleagues and a past Liberal prime minister to let the MPs have 
a voice in this Chamber.  The government has been under pressure 
to bring parliamentary reform into effect into the House of 
Commons, and the actions surrounding this bill exemplify why it 
needs to take place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance has suggested a number of efforts to make 
this Chamber more accountable to all the people of our 
constituencies, not just those who voted for us.  We have 
suggested such revolutionary things as free votes, an ethics 
counsellor who reports to parliament not just the Prime Minister, 
secret ballots for the selection of committee chairs, 
improvements to House of Commons debates and empowering MPs to 
vote freely on behalf of their constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Underlining all of these issues is the willingness of the 
government to adhere and participate in an open and transparent 
manner through the entire legislative process.  Without that 
willingness for change on the part of the government, all the 
talk by the government amounts to so much empty rhetoric. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, over the years we have seen far too much empty 
rhetoric from this government.  The willingness to create change 
must acknowledge that the status quo is not acceptable.  It must 
acknowledge that the old way of doing things cannot continue if 
improvements and positive steps forward can be made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me go a step further in this.  Changes by the minister of 
Indian affairs will affect the lives of many native people.  I 
believe that native people in this country need and deserve 
change.  The status quo is not working for our native people. 
Yet without the creation of these changes in an open and 
transparent manner, those involved will always have a suspicion 
that there was a hidden agenda.  Trust is earned, it is not 
legislated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For these reasons we must ensure that all of the right steps are 
taken as we proceed through the bill.  We must ensure that those 
who are in favour of it fully understand it.  We must ensure that 
those who are opposed to it have the opportunity to voice their 
concerns.  We must ensure that those who are affected by the 
changes in this bill, both native and non-native alike, are fully 
apprised of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To some it would seem that these words are an attempt to slow 
this legislation down.  That really is not the case. 
However in this case the minister has his procedural process 
backward.

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should all note that the bill introduced here today has 
already been through the other place.  The chamber of so-called 
sober second thought has already called its witnesses and debated 
the matter.  The very nature of this process upsets me.  How can 
the other place have a sober second thought when the bill has 
been through there first? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the minister does not understand the correct process 
of bringing legislation through the House.  I note his comments 
in the other place on April 25 when he said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without being too derogatory to my own colleagues in the House, 
maybe things will go better if I send them here first.  Perhaps 
that is a good trend to continue.  We will test it for a while. 
We have other pieces of legislation that will be coming your way 
in the next year that we may have some discussions about and 
consider, with the approval of the House leadership. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine, that is what he said that in the other place.  I do not 
think there was any consultation with our House leader on this. 
It certainly did not receive the approval of the Canadian 
Alliance to start in the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not upset over the work that the other place did on the 
legislation.  Indeed senators spent far more time in committee 
than we will be allowed in the House.  However to my knowledge 
they did not call for the legislation to come to them first.  It 
was taken to them by the minister.  I believe that was wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What kind of hidden agenda did the minister have to start the 
life of the legislation in the other place rather than the House 
of Commons?  Was it a make work project to keep our colleagues 
there busy because the government's legislative agenda this 
session is so thin that the wind could blow through it?  It was 
simply rehashed legislation from the last parliament, brought to 
a halt when the Prime Minister called that unnecessary election 
which cost the taxpayers of Canada millions of dollars and 
settled very little. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government also attempted to proceed through all three 
readings of the bill today without even taking it to the Indian 
affairs and northern development standing committee.  This is an 
insult to the role of the House of Commons and its duly elected 
members.  The minister should be ashamed of himself for 
instituting this process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to wonder aloud if this is the same level of transparency 
and accountability that the minister is planning to employ 
throughout the process of the first nations governance act he is 
proposing.  I agree there needs to be greater accountability on 
the part of chiefs and councils to band members and that the 
Indian Act needs to be dramatically altered and eventually 
eliminated.  I agree with a grassroots consultation process.  We 
are certainly the party in the House that exemplifies the 
grassroots democracy of this country.  We know all about this. 
It is not easy to be grassroots, but it is democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe there is a strong correlation between the pace at 
which the minister is attempting to approve and implement Bill 
S-24 and his proposed first nations governance act.  Native 
Canadians are not fooled by the minister's actions.  They 
believe, and I share their suspicions, that the Department of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development is already well on its 
way to drafting the text of the bill prior to the consultation 
process even beginning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, today there are thousands of native Canadians who are 
refusing to participate in the consultation process the minister 
has proposed.  The minister has proposed to do in mere months 
what in all likelihood will take years to fully consult, draft, 
debate and legislate, and so it should. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has gone on record in his own riding that I, as a 
member of parliament, fail to understand the consultation process 
and that more than just the Internet will be used for feedback 
for grassroots band members.  I understand what I think he fails 
to understand.  While he may be talking about a meeting with 
native leaders perhaps over the Internet, and yes they certainly 
need to be consulted, I have been meeting and talking with the 
people who are potentially affected by the bill that he proposes, 
the native governance act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The grassroots people who I have talked to are not sure how they 
will pay their next telephone bill, let alone have access to a 
computer and the knowledge of how to use e-mail or chat rooms. 
Where are the priorities of the minister and the department?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about thousands of people who do not have access 
to potable drinking water.  We are talking about people who do 
not have adequate housing for many months of the year.  We are 
talking about people who cannot receive adequate health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many good examples across Canada.  There are band 
chiefs and councils who have their members' best interests at 
heart and act upon them.  However the House must wake up to the 
harsh reality that thousands of native Canadians face daily. Yes, 
they do want self-government but what does that really mean?  If 
we talk to 10 different people we will get 10 different answers. 
They want to fulfil their right to self-determination.  They want 
decent education and health care for their families.  They want 
to control their own facilities.  Why should they not?  The rest 
of us do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the minister were truly listening to the cries of band 
members he would hear something else.  He would hear that many 
band members are scared of taking control of these services 
before they are ready.  Many band members wonder aloud how people 
with a poor education can be in charge of their bands' education 
authorities.  They wonder how some of their leaders can lead them 
into the 21st century when trust and accountability is lacking 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been talking with native Canadians from seven provinces 
who are facing serious issues, such as third party management, 
health care funding mismanagement, electoral and voting 
discrepancies and education funding allocations.  These are the 
issues that band members, including elders, truly want addressed. 
Rhetoric about consultation means little when children do not 
have quality health care and houses have no running water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us get our priorities straight for those who cannot 
comprehend an end to the relentless barriers placed upon them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I return to the specifics of Bill S-24.  I have had the 
opportunity to meet with grand chief James Gabriel and discuss 
what the legislation means to Kanesatake Mohawks.  I understand 
why it is important to him and to many of his people. I have 
assured him that the official opposition will not needlessly 
oppose the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, and I am sure he understands, we need to ensure there 
is not only due process but the appearance of due process.  All 
voices must be heard, both pro and con.  At the end of the 
process even opponents who do not agree with the outcome must 
feel they have had an opportunity to express their opinion.  The 
end result of the process must be seen as a progressive move 
forward by the majority who will be affected by the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I trust that the minister will seriously reconsider his words in 
the other place and attempt to follow what I believe to be the 
correct procedure.  Perhaps the minister is wary of open and 
honest debate in the House.  He should not be.  He should want to 
ensure that all legislation that impacts on the lives of native 
Canadians is viewed in the full light of this place by all hon. 
members.  We look forward in the coming days to discussing the 
bill in committee.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, 
BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, the purpose of Bill S-24, the Kanesatake 
interim land base governance act, is to implement what might be 
termed an historic agreement recognizing, for the first time, a 
territory for the Mohawks of Kanesatake as well as the powers to 
exercise jurisdiction over these lands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This agreement is the outcome of long months of negotiation and 
is evidence of the desire to create a peaceful and positive 
atmosphere between aboriginal and non-aboriginal peoples 
following on the disturbing events of 1990.  Remedying this 
situation has taken 11 years. 
I think the wounds needed to heal somewhat first, and then there 
had to be negotiations in good faith and by mutual consent 
before the result we now have before us could be achieved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill will make it possible to settle Mohawk property 
rights, thereby reducing the economic uncertainty surrounding 
the ownership and use of the area's lands and resources. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1035"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The events of 1990 had a direct impact on property values, on 
the future of these lands, what would happen to them, who would 
own them and how they would be administered.  I believe that Bill 
S-24 will calm down the situation and show that investment in 
this area is possible.  People can now make informed decisions 
about settling in this area, knowing exactly what the framework 
will be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to point out that the word interim is used 
precisely because there is the possibility of other lands being 
added in future, with the consent of both parties. 
In other words, there is an agreement, as should be the case 
when negotiations occur, on issues on which both sides agree, 
but additions may be made in the future. This is particularly 
true if the agreement works well and yields good results, 
because then some landowners or people who want to clarify a 
situation may be tempted to join those who are already covered 
by the agreement before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois will support the bill. This position 
reflects our party's openness to the comprehensive claims made 
by aboriginal peoples. It is part of a constructive dialogue 
with the first nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have demonstrated this in recent years, since the Bloc 
Quebecois has been present in this House, particularly during the 
first few years, through the work of the hon. member for 
Saint-Jean. He was in contact with first nations officials 
everywhere. Things have not always been easy but we managed to 
build a constructive relation. Whenever bills or measures have 
been proposed to improve relations with one or several first 
nations, we have worked in that spirit. Our support for the bill 
before us today is based on that spirit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to understand the need for this harmonization 
agreement. In order to do so, it must be realized that some 
parts of the Kanesatake lands are not contiguous. In fact, 57 
lands belonging to the Mohawks of Kanesatake are located in the 
Town of Oka. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also important to stress the fact that the current 
agreement was reached after consultations with the Quebec 
government, which is not a party to this agreement. 
These lands really come under federal jurisdiction and formally 
involve only the federal government and the Mohawks of 
Kanesatake, but the government of Quebec was consulted and 
there was an agreement with the town of Oka, with the result 
that this was a consensus of almost all those involved directly 
or in an advisory capacity in the negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should be emphasized that the agreement included a statement 
to the effect that it had been concluded without prejudice to 
any Mohawk rights, whether ancestral or treaty based, and without 
prejudice to land claims involving the Seigneurie du lac des 
Deux Montagnes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An agreement was reached without there necessarily being a need 
to work out all these sorts of issues. 
Waiting to do so would probably have prevented an agreement 
being reached and stood in the way of more harmonious relations, 
which are needed in this sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All these issues are part of what is being negotiated between 
the Government of Canada and Kanesatake.  This is not a 
comprehensive agreement on self-government, nor is it a treaty. 
It is a unique agreement on the management of a certain number 
of lands, taking into account the specific circumstances of 
Kanesatake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a debate and even a referendum in the community. 
Interestingly, the result was very close: 239 voted in favour of 
the agreement and 237 against.  This result shows that it can be 
useful to respect the rule of 50% plus one in a community.  It 
is just about the only rule that is really acceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Grand chief James Gabriel said that the close result was 
indicative of the energetic debate in the community, without 
calling into question the legitimacy of the agreement.  He said 
“It is always healthy to have differing views.  This is part of 
what society is all about”.  It is true that when people want 
society to be democratic, they must accept differing views, and 
that was the case in this process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it interesting that with such a close result the 
federal government is agreeing to pass a bill to implement this 
agreement. I think this is an example the government would 
do well to apply to other cases, such as that of Quebec.

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this instance, in the case of the agreement before us, the 
government of Quebec was consulted, as I said, and informed of 
it.  It gave its general support, as did the town of Oka.  It 
was therefore treated properly with respect to the agreement to 
be signed with the Mohawks of Kanesatake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An indepth analysis of the bill was also done.  We support it. 
We are proud to be able to play a small part in this historic 
moment for the Mohawk nation of Kanesatake, which now will have 
the tools it needs to grow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone wants the communities to have a chance to develop to 
their fullest, to have the powers that will enable them to do 
things and to be accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would have favoured swift passage for the bill.  I listened 
to the arguments by the Alliance member, who said that the bill 
had to go through all the stages, including consideration in 
committee.  That to me indicates a lack of understanding of 
native issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the same spirit we saw expressed in the context of the 
Nisga'a agreement, obviously a much broader agreement, requiring 
thorough consideration.  However, in this instance, it was clear 
from reading the document that we could pass the bill quickly, 
in a single day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We therefore cannot adopt the paternalistic attitude on this 
that the Canadian Alliance has.  It strikes us as a kind of 
refusal to understand the reality of the aboriginal peoples and 
of their particular culture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a broader context, I would like to point out to hon. members 
that the Bloc Quebecois supports the recommendations of the 
Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples.  These called for an 
approach based on the concept of self-government, which 
acknowledges aboriginal governments as a level of government 
with jurisdiction over questions concerning governance and the 
welfare of their people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The entire royal commission report was based on recognition of 
the aboriginal peoples as an independent nation occupying a 
unique place within Canada, and the Bloc Quebecois supports this 
concept. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agreement respecting Kanesatake governance fully reflects 
the spirit of the conclusions and recommendations of the 
Erasmus—Dussault report, and thus constitutes a positive step 
toward a healthier redefinition of the relationship between 
governments and aboriginal peoples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore it is of obvious importance that this bill be passed 
in order to continue to ensure harmonious relations between the 
various communities in the Kanesatake and Oka area.  They have 
had occasion to see what damage can be caused if agreement 
cannot be reached by negotiation in such situations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At least, it seems to me that conclusions have been reached, 
that an agreement that must be respected has been reached, an 
agreement that while approved by the Mohawk community by a very 
slim majority, has nevertheless been accepted and is wanted by 
the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion it is important that this bill be passed as 
promptly as possible. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK8"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
am pleased to join in the debate on Bill S-24 although I am 
always critical of bills that originate in the other place.  I 
firmly believe that legislation should be presented by elected 
officials rather than by unelected people sitting 
undemocratically in the other place.  It is therefore with 
sadness that I enter the debate on a bill which I support and 
would like to see passed but of whose origins I am critical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although we are dealing only with second reading today, there 
was unanimous consent among House leaders to deal with all stages 
of the bill in one day.  The bill would afford basic rights to 
the people of Kanesatake, something for which they have been 
waiting for generations.  It would therefore be fitting and 
appropriate that the House of Commons co-operate for once and 
deal with all stages of the bill to give the people of Kanesatake 
what they have so patiently and peacefully waited for all these 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let it be known that it is the Canadian Alliance, the party that 
stands against any form of aboriginal self-government, that has 
blocked this agreement.  The Canadian Alliance is an obstacle to 
the agreement and is denying the Kanesatake Mohawk people the 
right to self-determination. 
I am very critical of this stunt.  Let it be known that it is 
political mischief on the part of the Canadian Alliance.  It is 
another stunt to create an obstacle to the self-governance 
aspirations of the Kanesatake Mohawk people.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to compliment Kanesatake Mohawk Grand Chief James Gabriel 
and the Kanesatake council for the patience and perseverance they 
have shown during peaceful negotiations to get to this point in 
Canadian history. We can now renew the relationship with the 
people of Kanesatake through a real governance instrument so that 
they can move forward their aspirations with legal authority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-24 fills a legal vacuum because the Kanesatake are not 
covered by the Indian Act.  They never have been because early on 
they saw the shortcomings in the Indian Act and to their credit 
said that they did not want any part of it.  The fiscal and legal 
relationships between the Kanesatake Mohawks and the federal 
government have always been vague. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though they implemented their own rules and regulations 
they had very little legal authority to enforce them.  It came to 
light recently when they wanted to stop people from dumping 
garbage on their land.  They tried to intervene by pointing out 
that it was against their bylaws and local council laws.  They 
found that they had no right to stop the dumping of toxic waste 
on their property.  That should illustrate the depth of the 
problem better than anything else.  Somehow that had to be fixed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On December 21, 2000, the Government of Canada negotiated with 
the Kanesatake to create the Kanesatake interim land base 
governance agreement.  Bill S-24 would ratify the agreement and 
would ensure that certain lands constitute lands reserved for the 
Kanesatake Mohawk within the meaning of the Indian Act but not 
covered by the Indian Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Kanesatake would still not be in the same relationship as 
other first nations on reserves.  It would be an independent, 
free standing and unique arrangement that would serve the people 
of the community very well.  It would serve as a model and would 
prove that the Government of Canada could negotiate individual 
agreements with first nations.  We do not need a cookie cutter or 
boiler plate approach to impose things on people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Kanesatake is a Mohawk community of approximately 2,000 members 
situated on the Lake of Two Mountains about 50 miles northwest of 
Montreal.  A number of lots that make up Kanesatake Mohawk lands 
are situated within the boundaries of the village of Oka.  Mohawk 
land is actually intermingled with land owned by non-Mohawks.  It 
is not a traditional aboriginal community at all.  It is unique 
in that way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Kanesatake has never been an Indian reserve.  They have always 
rejected the model of the Indian Act.  Even with this new 
relationship the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development would not have the right to veto and would not be 
vested with the same authority as he is under the Indian Act.  In 
that way the Kanesatake Mohawk would retain independence even 
though the new relationship with the federal government would be 
defined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The unique land status means that the elected Mohawk band 
council which has never been recognized or had law making powers 
would now have that authority.  Bill S-24 is the enabling 
legislation that would grant real law making authority to the 
band council.  They were always self-governing.  They had rules 
and regulations by agreement but, as I pointed out with the 
garbage dumping issue, they never had the legal weight and 
authority to be able to enforce the rules and regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would cover a number of details.  The Kanesatake 
Mohawks would have jurisdiction to make laws in relation to the 
use and development of the lands of the Kanesatake Mohawk interim 
land base including a relationship to the health and quality of 
life of residents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would also provide for the protection and management of 
wildlife and fish, which is a major issue; the observance of law 
and order; the prevention of disorderly conduct and nuisances, in 
other words self-policing with legal authority; and the 
prevention of trespass including entry on to or occupation of the 
lands without lawful authority, which is control of their own 
boundaries.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They would be allowed to pass laws due to residency.  Fire 
safety and fire protection services would be independent agencies 
unto themselves through the band council.  The construction, 
maintenance, management and use of local works including water 
supplies are very significant issues.  They would have control 
and governance over their own water supplies, which is a huge 
issue across the country and especially in first nations 
communities lately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Zoning would be under the authority of the band council, along 
with waste management, public sanitation and even traffic 
regulation.  They would be able to govern traffic issues 
throughout their reserve.  They are not worried about basic 
traffic issues but about the type of traffic that goes through 
their land.  For example, they may not want trucks full of toxic 
waste going through their land.  They would be able to regulate 
those matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is with a great sense of pride and optimism that I speak on 
behalf of the New Democratic Party in favour of Bill S-24.  It is 
the culmination of many years of hard work.  It is the graphic 
representation of the new approach and the new attitude that 
progressive Canadians have toward our aboriginal brothers and 
sisters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All parties, except for the Canadian Alliance, seem to welcome 
that new relationship.  There is sort of a Eurocentric bias on 
behalf of the Canadian Alliance.  It would like to maintain the 
old status quo and the old paternalistic relationship between 
government and aboriginal people.  Our party rejects that 
paternalistic relationship.  The Canadian Alliance wants to cling 
to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has been a terrible frustration for me as a member of 
parliament trying to defend these issues and trying to promote 
these concepts.  We suffered through the Nisga'a debate which 
should have been the feel good debate of the decade in the House 
of Commons when we finally dealt with a 130 year old dispute and 
signed the first treaty of the century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead it turned into the most divisive debate in the House of 
Commons because members of the Reform Party, the Canadian 
Alliance today, moved 472 amendments.  They lost every one of 
them.  They did not move those amendments to improve the bill. 
They moved those amendments out of pure political mischief to try 
to bury a human rights issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the kind of party that would put human rights to a 
majority vote.  Members of the Canadian Alliance are always 
talking about how there has to be a referendum.  They say that we 
have to let the whole country vote on it.  I say that we do not 
put minority rights to a majority vote.  When will they get that 
through their heads?  It was embarrassing for me to hear 
Canadians stand in the House of Commons with that type of 
approach toward the Nisga'a people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud to say that I have a T-shirt given to me by the 
Nisga'a people that says “Nisga'a 472, Reform Party 0”.  That 
made me feel a lot better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-24 is the realization of a dream.  It is evidence of a 
maturing relationship between the Government of Canada and 
aboriginal people.  It is the very fitting and rightful 
representation of the progress made as aboriginal people take 
their first courageous steps toward true self-governance within 
the legal framework of Canada.  They have always had 
self-governance.  They have the inherent right to be 
self-governing and they were doing it for thousands of years 
before the Europeans ever got here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now there is a formal relationship within the legal framework of 
Canada where they can actually make changes to their day to day 
lives.  They can regulate and enforce.  They have the power of 
law with the expressed co-operation of the Government of Canada 
in this new relationship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to illustrate from a legal point of view the vacuum this 
group of people were in.  There was a well known case on the 
Kanesatake Reserve involving Jean-Roch Simon. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1055"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT9"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Due to a lack of clarity as to the legal status of the 
Kanesatake Mohawk people, it has never been clear which laws up 
until now, federal, provincial, Kanesatake or municipal, apply to 
the lands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In March 1987 Jean-Roch Simon, a member of the Kanesatake 
Mohawks, began building a multi-unit residential building in the 
village of Oka on Kanesatake Mohawk lands.  Mr. Simon received a 
construction loan from the Government of Canada.  He proceeded to 
erect the building on the premise that he would be exempt from 
municipal land use bylaws because the lands in question were 
federal crown lands under section 91 of the Constitution Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is where it gets complicated.  In April 1987 the 
municipality of Oka commenced litigation seeking an order to 
cease the construction and to demolish the building on the 
grounds that it was in violation of municipal zoning and 
construction bylaws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is hard to imagine, but this brings an abstract concept into 
a very graphic illustration where we are dealing with real 
dollars, as well as a loss of opportunity and a loss of income on 
this person's part.  The building was torn down because of the 
confusion as to who had the right to grant municipal permits to 
build on that property. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In August 1993 the case went all the way to the Superior Court 
of Quebec.  It ruled in favour of the municipality and ordered 
the building to be demolished.  The court made no determination 
as to whether the lands came within the meaning of section 91 of 
the Constitution Act.  It found that the lands did not constitute 
federal public property.  This again illustrates what a confusing 
legal morass the Kanesatake Mohawk people were forced to deal 
with all these years.  As this document says, they were in a 
legal vacuum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we should be celebrating Bill S-24 and why I am 
incredibly critical of the Canadian Alliance for being an 
obstacle and a barrier to moving the issue forward.  There is not 
another political party in the House of Commons that would stand 
in the way of basic human rights for aboriginal people except for 
Alliance members who over and over again deliberately, 
specifically and expressly do all they can to interfere with 
people's basic right to self-governance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to go over some of the background history in a 
little more detail because it is instructive that we are all made 
aware for future purposes how this kind of relationship has 
evolved.  Bill S-24 and the agreement that stems from it could 
serve as a model in terms of future fiscal and legal

by Dr. Herbst linking the use of DES in pregnancy to cancer in

</I></B></P><P align=left>DES is a synthetic oestrogen that was prescribed to women 
between 1941 and 1971 to prevent miscarriage and encourage a

children.

In fact every few years a new country is admitted to the nuclear

BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, yesterday, contributors to the employment 
insurance program—that is employers and employees—and the 
unemployed got clear evidence that the Minister of Finance 
wilfully accumulated, at their expense, an amount of $7 billion 
to help pay off Canada's debt. Seven billion dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means that $500 were taken annually from the pockets of 
taxpayers, even though they could really have used that money to 
make ends meet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The employment insurance program was used for a reason other 
than its primary purpose, which is to ensure a decent income to 
a worker who is temporarily out of work. The government turned 
the program into a regressive tax on payroll which deprives the 
poor and the middle class from an income that is theirs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all agree that we must reduce Canada's debt. However, the 
means used by the Minister of Finance is unworthy of someone who 
aspires to become Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When people look at their paycheque, they should remember that 
the refusal of the Minister of Finance to hold a transparent 
debate on the management of the surpluses means that their 
contributions to the employment insurance program are in fact an 
unfair tax on the reimbursement of the debt.

tortured and executed political opponents, exploited forced 
labour, denied fundamental freedoms of expression, assembly 
association and movement, and condoned the growing traffic in 
heroin and amphetamines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Several months ago there was hopeful speculation that the 
pervasive repression would be eased; that the country's 
courageous pro-democracy leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, would be 
liberated from house arrest; that her party, the National League 
for Democracy which won more than three-quarters of the seats in 
the 1990 election, would be permitted to resume its activity; and 
that political prisoners would be released.  That hope now 
appears to be a mirage.

indistinguishable from one generated at a generating station

Third, it is available and on line immediately for resale to 
somebody else. Fourth, it reduces harmful greenhouse gas 
emissions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government owns 68,000 buildings across the country,

</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the big drivers of inflation has been energy costs such 
as home heating fuel.  Just before the last election the minister 
arranged for a rebate program so that individuals could get some 
relief from that.  Sadly, many of the people who received those 
rebates were convicts in jail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How is it that convicts in jail ended up with a lot of the 
relief rather than senior citizens who really deserved that 
relief? 
<P><A NAME="LINK49"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, that is simply not true.  Some 99% of Canadians who 
received the home heating rebate were Canadians who deserved it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no doubt, as we have stated, that there were anomalies 
in the whole situation, the same anomalies that the Alberta 
government found when it made its rebates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would simply point out that there are 11 million Canadians who 
received the home heating rebate. 
<P><A NAME="LINK50"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, one thing the finance minister said is that when these 
massive tax cuts wend their way through the system, everything 
will be fine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A recent poll, however, found that 76% of Canadians have not 
noticed any drop on their paycheques.  The finance minister's own 
focus test group came up with exactly the same conclusion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it that Canadians cannot see that tax reduction on their 
paycheques if those tax reductions are so massive? 
<P><A NAME="LINK51"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, those tax reductions are 21% on average.  That is truly 
significant.  For a family of four with an income of $60,000, it 
is 18%.  A single mother or a single father raising a family and 
earning a salary of $25,000, he or she will now receive a child 
benefit of over $2,500.  That is significant amount of money 
going toward helping Canadian families and we are proud of it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK52"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the bank needs to reduce interest rates to stimulate our economy 
but it needs to increase interest rates to fight inflation and to 
save our sinking dollar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How will the finance minister solve this dilemma? 
<P><A NAME="LINK53"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the fact is that the agreement between the government 
and the Bank of Canada at 1% to 3%, mid point 2%, the trend rate, 
which is the most important rate, not in any single month but the 
trend rate over a series of months, is the core rate and that 
core rate is at 2.1%.

<P><A NAME="LINK54"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, this issue is very important to seniors.  An inflation 
rate of 2% means that the value of a dollar goes down to about 82 
cents in 10 years.  The 3.6% rate, which is the rate the seniors 
are interested in and the actual rate, not the fudged one that 
the bank uses, means their dollar goes down to about 70 cents in 
10 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This inflation is a hidden thief of savings and purchasing power 
for everyone and it is hard on seniors.  What does he propose—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

inflation.  That is why the government signed a five year 
agreement.  It has enabled us to control inflation in the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that as a result of the actions of the government

a low inflation country and we are going to stay that way.

be still beating around the bush.  My question involves 
yesterday's announcement by the president about U.S. energy 
policy, one which will demand more and more energy exports from 
Canada and tighter U.S. control over energy supplies and our 
prices.  Today, because of NAFTA, as the minister knows, we have 
very little control over security, supply and pricing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the minister make a commitment that before Canada enters

Canadians have very little control.  The influence of OPEC is 
obviously a very serious factor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To the extent that action can be taken within Canada, we have 
indicated the kind of action that is already on the books in

one more opponent to what has been almost universally described 
as ineffective and inefficient legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This mess will be dropped into the laps of the provinces that

refused to take that opportunity.

successful treatment of young offenders.  Others have also 
complained of the complexity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I proposed numerous amendments to simplify and reduce the delays

</I></B></P><P align=left>I certainly take exception to the hon. member's comment about 
the legislation being unduly complex and onerous.  We have done

question is also for the Minister of Finance.  With an aging

many cases tripling.  Tuition fees and associated costs are 
becoming unmanageable.

if we take a look at the investments that have gone into basic 
post-secondary education, and if we take a look at the help the

following:  that the Government of Canada may be asked to support 
the U.S. national missile defence, NMD, program to be operated by 
the North American aerospace defence command; that NMD is a 
unilateral initiative of the United States which plans, as it 
states in this petition, to dominate space by integrating space 
forces into war fighting capability; that NMD would be a step 
toward the deployment of weapons in space and lead to a new arms 
race; and that it would violate the 1972 anti-ballistic missile 
treaty and run counter to Canada's commitment as a signatory to

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>KANESATAKE INTERIM LAND BASE GOVERNANCE ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK179">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill S-24, an 
act to implement an agreement between the Mohawks of Kanesatake 
and Her Majesty in right of Canada respecting governance of 
certain lands by the Mohawks of Kanesatake and to amend an act in 
consequence, be read the second time and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK180"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
glad to take up where I left off prior to question period.  I 
will use the few minutes I have left to summarize some of the 
points I was seeking to make earlier in the day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First I want to restate my very heartfelt congratulations to the 
grand chief of the Kanesatake Mohawk people and the band council 
for the years of hard work that have gone into negotiating this 
historic settlement.  It is not often that we as parliamentarians 
have an opportunity to take part in something that is so wholly 
necessary and that in fact makes history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are making history here today as we help the Kanesatake 
Mohawk carve out a new relationship with the federal government. 
They are casting off or clearing up many of the shortcomings of 
the former fiscal and legal relationship with the federal 
government and entering into a whole new era. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier I started to go through some of the long drawn out 
history of the Kanesatake land claim.  I was saying prior to 
question period that it goes back to 1717.  I will not take hon. 
members through the whole long and ragged history of 
pre-Confederation negotiations.  Suffice it to say that this is 
the culmination of 200 or 300 years of a maturing relationship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Both parties should be complimented for the hard work they have 
done and for the fact that they have managed to undertake this by 
peaceful means through negotiation and not through any outbursts 
or violence or road blockades. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would raise a cautionary note, though, so as not to sound like 
I am simply a booster for the federal government in this regard. 
I raise the cautionary note that these new relationships we are 
entering into with aboriginal communities as they strive to 
achieve self-government, which we fully endorse, are only as good 
as the resources they receive.  The relationships will stand only 
if they are followed by implementation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have examples.  I raise this as a criticism of the federal 
government.  There are examples such as Naskapi Cree people of 
northern Quebec, who do have a unique individual self-government 
relationship.  They have been complaining for years that ever 
since they finally got their own details hashed out, the 
implementation has been so painfully slow, shabby and wholly 
inadequate that there have been years of frustration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though we are pleased to see the legislative framework put 
in place today, this whole feeling of goodwill could collapse if 
the federal government does not deliver all the resources 
necessary to fully implement the act we are voting on today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will use the remaining minute or two I have to restate again 
how disappointed I am that the House of Commons could not have 
dealt with this all in one day.  After 300 years of tedious, 
frustrating negotiations we had the opportunity to bring this to 
its final conclusion today.  Unfortunately the Canadian Alliance 
blocked the unanimous consent needed to go through all stages of 
reading the bill and voting on the bill in one day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let the record show that all parties in the House of Commons, 
except the Canadian Alliance, wish to see the speedy passage of 
the bill and the independence and the true self-governance of the 
Kanesatake Mohawk people. 
<P><A NAME="LINK181"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
too am very pleased to rise today to put our position forward and 
on the record on Bill S-24, the Kanesatake interim land base 
governance act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will start by echoing the comments of the member for Winnipeg 
Centre.  A couple of days ago it was understood that we would be 
able to bring forward this piece of legislation, give it all 
readings and go to committee, come back to report stage and have 
this piece of legislation implemented fairly quickly.  Certainly 
we in our party suggested at that time that it was a very 
important piece of legislation which should be able to go through 
the House unmolested.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very disappointed that we do not have that opportunity 
today and that the Alliance Party had, for whatever reason, a 
desire to impede the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill, being an S bill, has had public hearings in the 
Senate.  There are detractors and those who wish to put forward 
their concerns and difficulties with the bill.  It has gone 
through that process.  Unfortunately, for some reason the 
legislation is being held up by the Alliance Party.  I am truly 
disappointed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very good legislation.  It deals with native 
self-governance, an issue that has been in the House for quite 
some time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give a bit of background although I will not go back 
hundreds of years as did the hon. member for Winnipeg Centre.  The 
Mohawks of Kanesatake, a place most of us know as Oka, live on a 
tract of land approximately 50 kilometres west of Montreal.  The 
land has been set aside for the Mohawks but does not constitute a 
reserve.  Its inhabitants include aboriginal and non-aboriginal 
peoples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1990 unresolved aboriginal land claims erupted into the Oka 
crisis which we all recognize as one of the darker days in the 
history of this great country.  Land claims disputes came to a 
crescendo in the Oka crisis, a crisis that, in my opinion, was not 
necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Mohawks erected barricades to block roads.  At the request 
of the Quebec government, Ottawa sent Canadian forces into the 
area to resolve the confrontation and the ensuing conflict.  As 
we all know, one Quebec police officer gave his life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the past 10 years the Mohawks of Kanesatake have worked 
with the Government of Canada to resolve questions and grievances 
regarding land use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In March of 1991, Kanesatake Mohawks and the federal government 
agreed on an agenda for negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1994 a memorandum of understanding over land purchases was 
signed between the Mohawks and the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997 the Mohawks established their own police station and the 
federal government made land purchases in the name of Kanesatake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On December 21, 2000, a new land governance agreement was signed 
between Kanesatake and the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-24 represents the culmination of 10 years of 
negotiations.  It did not happen overnight.  It was achieved 
through negotiations with the band, the Mohawk people and the 
federal government.  The process began in 1991 and is finally, in 
2001, coming to fruition in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-24 would provide legal recognition of a land base for the 
Mohawks of Kanesatake.  It would provide powers of law making, 
policing and other services by implementing the agreement with 
respect to Kanesatake governance of the interim land base. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-24 would ensure that lands in the Mohawk interim land 
base are reserved for Indians pursuant to the constitution but 
not as reserves under the Indian Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-24 would also provide a framework for the exercise of 
jurisdiction and would establish principles for the harmonious

contracts, borrow, expend and invest money, and be a party to 
legal proceedings.  These rights do not exist on reserve lands 
under the present Indian Act.

themselves as opposed to being forced to govern on the basis of

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That list speaks to the abilities of a municipality.  A 
municipality has the right to set laws with respect to fire and 
police protection, water, waste management and traffic 
regulations.  Such bylaws are set by all municipalities.  Bill 
S-24 would give Kanesatake Mohawks the right to make those rules 
and regulations for themselves and for their people.  That is 
absolutely necessary if we are to achieve self-governance for 
Indian people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While violators of those laws would be liable to punishment by 
the Mohawk of Kanesatake, fines or imprisonment could not exceed 
the limits established in subsection 787(1) of the criminal code. 
Kanesatake Mohawks could make laws but they could not exceed what 
is in the criminal code provincially or federally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Subclause 8(1) of the bill specifies that Kanesatake Mohawks 
would not be governed by the Indian Act.  That is a new way of 
governing.  We should take the blinders off and see that it is 
the wave of the future.  It is where we should be heading not 
only with this act and this band but with other bands across the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before the Kanesatake Mohawks could enact the legal powers 
accorded to them by Bill S-24 they would need to adopt a land 
governance code that set out the law of the land.  The code would 
establish rule of law, land use rules, conflict of interest 
rules, rights of appeal and redress, and procedures to amend the 
code.  Again those same rules and criteria are necessary for the 
municipal level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A land use plan must precede any commercial or industrial 
activity such as disposal of waste, storage or transportation of 
hazardous materials.  A land use plan is important when planning 
a community.  Kanesatake Mohawks must embrace a land use plan if 
they are to develop their lands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-24 stipulates that Mohawk of Kanesatake law must be 
consistent with federal environmental protection standards and 
can exceed provincial environmental standards.  This means that 
while Kanesatake would have rights over fisheries and hunting it 
would still need to comply with the Environmental Protection 
Standards Act and the guidelines set out by the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-24 would establish the process by which Kanesatake land 
use rules could be harmonized with the land laws of the 
municipality of Oka.  That is an onerous task.  The area 
inhabited by the Mohawk comprises many small land parcels which 
are occupied by aboriginal and non-aboriginal residents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-24 addresses the issue of governance.  It does not debate 
first nations treaty rights or other outstanding disputes and 
grievances.  It does not deal with land claims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would, as I have said, allow reserves and bands 
throughout the country to look at different models of 
self-governance and adopt the one which suits them.  The band, in 
this case the Mohawk of Kanesatake, could then provide its people 
the services they need.  If its form of self-governance is 
successful it could serve as a model for other bands throughout 
the country.  Perhaps Bill S-24 will take us out of the 18th 
century and into the 21st century when it comes to dealing with 
aboriginal rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am happy to put the position of the Progressive Conservative 
Party on the table.  We support Bill S-24.  We are disappointed 
it could not go forward right away.  As I have pointed out 
already, it is difficult to understand why the Alliance would not 
allow the bill to go forward to third reading.  However it is 
better late than never.  We hope the legislation is passed 
quickly and without too much turmoil.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>NUCLEAR FUEL WASTE ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK183">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from May 15, consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-27, an act respecting the long-term management of 
nuclear fuel waste, be read the second time and referred to a 
committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK184"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure today to speak to 
Bill C-27, an act respecting the long term management of nuclear 
fuel waste. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill mandates the establishment of a long term management 
strategy to ensure nuclear waste is disposed of in a 
comprehensive, integrated and economically sound manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill has three key elements.  The major owners of nuclear 
fuel must establish and implement a long term management plan for 
nuclear fuel waste.  They also must establish a trust fund and 
make set payments to the fund on an ongoing basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support the bill in principle although we have concerns.  The 
onus to act should not fall entirely on industry.  The government 
should have an observer capacity and should share responsibility 
for waste disposal.  By and large, however, we support the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There must be checks and balances to ensure waste is disposed of 
properly and safely.  However it is a major challenge.  There is 
an international aspect to the issue which, although not 
immediately evident, should nonetheless frighten Canadians.  We 
are heading toward an environmental catastrophe not just next 
door but across the ocean.  The impact will affect Canadians from 
coast to coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Radioactive waste is an intriguing problem because it lasts for 
tens of thousands of years.  When we deal with radioactive waste 
we must make sure it does not come in contact with any aspects of 
our biodiversity or ecology for 10,000 years.  The decisions we 
make today will affect generations far down the line.  It is a 
very difficult problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fuel rods used in nuclear reactors last about three to four 
years.  Every nuclear plant deposits about 30 tonnes of nuclear 
waste per year.  What happens to the rods?  After three to four 
years they cannot carry on a nuclear reaction.  However they 
still have a great deal of power.  A lot of energy is locked away 
within used fuel rods and they can still be lethal to human 
beings, animals and plants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People exposed to nuclear materials can be killed outright. 
However they also suffer from high rates of cancer, various 
malignancies and other profound health effects that dramatically 
shorten their lifespan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have about 18,000 tonnes of nuclear fuel in Canada.  That 
will expand as time passes.  The challenge is deciding what to do 
with it.  How do we ensure public safety?  That challenge will 
affect us south of the border as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of principles need to be followed.  They are as 
follows.  First, there must be a commitment to safety and 
environmental protection when disposing of nuclear waste. Second, 
nuclear waste materials must be accepted voluntarily by the host 
community.  In other words, any community in which we deposit 
nuclear materials must give its consent. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1230"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT29"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT29"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1230

<A HREF="#LINKT28"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The decisions that community makes could potentially affect it 
down the road.  We do not know the long term affects of the 
disposal of this material.  We worry about leakage and cracks in 
the tomb nuclear waste material is encased in.  We do not know 
what will happen to that nuclear material 5,000 years from now 
when it will still be lethal and dangerous for human beings, 
animals and plants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the outset there has to be open communication of 
information with the communities involved.  There can be no 
secretive or unilateral decisions made to deposit nuclear waste 
in areas near human habitation.  The communities in the area must 
be made aware and they must buy into it.  In fairness to the host 
community, a benefits provision in recognition of its service to 
the community at large has to be recognized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some very interesting experiments have been done on the disposal 
of this kind of material.  I will talk about two of them.  One is 
called the nuclear powered turbo reciprocating engine.  Rather 
than burying the nuclear rods in the ground, can we extract the 
considerable amount of energy contained within those nuclear 
rods?  That is an intriguing question.  However the question also 
poses some very interesting potential solutions on how to use the 
nuclear rods by extracting energy from them for a longer period 
of time.  That is where the nuclear powered turbo reciprocating 
engine comes into play. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This engine utilizes some of the remaining uranium within the 
rods.  We use uranium-235 in nuclear reactors.  However 
uranium-238, which cannot maintain a nuclear reaction, is in 
sizeable proportions in the effete rods.  The rods can be 
bombarded with atoms which will break them apart and they will 
release considerable amounts of energy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the fuel rods in their original state are used for about 
three or four years in a nuclear reactor, they can be used for 13 
to 15 more years, thus extracting more energy from the effete 
rods than what would have been received in the first three to 
four years.  To use these rods for 18 years rather than 3 or 4 
years is a very interesting proposal.  When using the effete rods 
there is still the problem of disposal at the end of that period 
of time as they are still as radioactive as they were when they 
originally came out of the nuclear reactor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should ask the National Research Council to 
explore this option with researchers in the United States who are 
doing similar research.  It is a simple principle of burning 
rubbish rods and generating energy from them in a way that would 
be very useful for our environment.  This would also lead to 
fewer rods being used if energy could be generated from the 
effete rods.  Therefore the nuclear waste that we would have to 
deal with would be smaller. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another option is called the fusion torch which was established 
some time in the seventies when the possibility of fusion 
reactions existed.  For whatever reason there has been less 
interest in exploring the possibility of fusion.  However the 
fusion torch can be used to burn the effete rods in a different 
way through fusion reaction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While fusion is not a reality at this point in time, I would ask 
the government to have the National Research Council work with 
scientists in the international community who are working on 
fusion as a potential option for dealing with our nuclear waste 
problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am about to tell the House now is truly frightening.  It 
is taking place in Russia and Ukraine and there is active 
Canadian involvement.  We all know what happened to Chernobyl, 
the devastation that incident brought on the population there, 
and how radioactive nuclear tides were spread over a large area. 
What Canadians may not know is that there are many more 
Chernobyls in Russia and Ukraine. 
It is not only a problem for the people there.  Radionucleotides 
are cancer causing and teratogenic materials that enter our 
ecosystem and bioaccumulate into other ecosystems far and wide.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the honour of participating in discussions with members of 
the government on this.  We know many radionucleotides are 
bioaccumulating in the flora and fauna in the Arctic, and that is 
having a dramatic negative impact on the lives and health of the 
people living there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A Mayak reactor, which is located near Ozersk in Russia, was 
supposed to be closed down.  Lake Karachay, which is nearby, is 
the repository of nuclear waste materials from that reactor.  The 
lake is the most radioactive place on our planet.  If people were 
to bathe in the lake it would kill them.  One would think the 
reactor would be shut down, but it is actually expanding, and it 
is expanding with Canadian taxpayer money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian taxpayer money is being used to maintain the Mayak 
reactor that is dumping radioactive waste materials into Lake 
Karachay.  This is having a dramatic, negative and lethal impact 
upon the population there.  Why is Canada funding a reactor in 
Russia that is dumping radioactive waste materials into a lake 
where people could be killed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The goal has always been to shut down a lot of these reactors 
that are effete.  In the last 10 years Canada has put almost $90 
million into shutting them down but we now know that a lot of the 
money was not used for that purpose.  These reactors are not only 
open but a lot of the money has gone into the pockets of the 
Russian bureaucracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is $90 million of Canadian taxpayer money being sent to 
Russia in good faith only to be dumped into the bureaucracy and 
into the pockets of private individuals, and then chewed up with 
no end result? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a G-7 country, Canada committed almost $300 million to make 
sure those reactors were shut down, closed and cleansed of 
radioactive material.  That has not happened.  Russian nuclear 
weapons are being sent to the Mayak reactor so they can be 
reprocessed into MOX fuel, which is a radioactive and lethal 
fuel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian government should be asking some tough questions of 
the Russian government, such as where is the money that was sent, 
why are the reactors not being closed down, and why is 
radioactive material being dumped right into the biosphere with 
no checks or balances whatsoever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were supposed to close the reactors down.  Canadians will be 
shocked to know that we are funding 40 new reactors in Russia. 
However the reactors are using 30 year old technology that has 
been widely dismissed as being dangerous and unsafe by western 
standards.  Why is Canada funding 40 new reactors in Russia that 
have 30 year old technology?  We are exporting to the 
international community technology that is unsafe for us.  Why 
are we doing this? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This will lead to more Chernobyls, more Mayak reactors and more 
nuclear waste being dumped into the biosphere.  It will not 
affect communities in the former U.S.S.R. but it will affect all 
of us.  Our government does not know where the money has gone or 
where we are supposed to spend it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Little has changed in Russia in terms of nuclear reactors, 
cleanup mechanisms, and checks and balances that ought to be 
there.  There are many other Chernobyl-type situations just 
waiting on the horizon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another aspect that would be frightening for Canadians to 
realize is that in Ukraine, which has a number of nuclear 
reactors, the government has stripped the regulating body of its 
monitoring powers.  What is happening is that fewer checks and 
balances are being put in place.  This will have a lethal and 
devastating effect not only on that country but on all former 
eastern bloc countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>CIDA has said that the money that it sent has simply 
disappeared.  Millions of dollars have disappeared.  Money was 
also sent through Atomic Energy of Canada Limited to finance a 
program that would increase the operating safety of nuclear 
reactor plants.  That was a great idea.  Who could argue with 
that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also wanted to clean up Europe's largest nuclear power plant, 
the Leningrad nuclear power station near St. Petersburg, because 
it was unsafe.  The power plant continues to operate.  The money 
that was sent to clean up these operations and to close them down 
has done absolutely nothing at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>CIDA also gave $500,000 to Russia's nuclear regulatory agency, 
GAN, but legislation currently before the Russian parliament will 
transfer the GAN's licensing powers to another group called 
Minatom.  Minatom will be a self-regulating company beyond the 
reach of government.  Why are we sending money to the Russian 
government to fund a regulatory agency that will have no powers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are sending money to an agency that will have nothing to do 
with regulations because the regulatory body has been moved to 
something else and will be a toothless tiger.  It will have no 
checks and balances, no government regulation, no transparency 
and no public involvement.  That is very frightening.  Canadians 
would never tolerate that type of situation here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians would demand, and rightfully so, that the nuclear 
regulatory agency be monitored by a public transparent 
organization.  What Canada is doing with its international aid 
money is sending millions of dollars into a big, black hole where 
it is not producing the intended effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage the minister responsible for international 
development, when she hears about these issues, to take a very 
aggressive position.  The Minister of Foreign Affairs should also 
make immediate interventions with President Putin and the Russian 
government to get to the bottom of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If he cannot do that, Canada should choke off all moneys going 
into these programs and should rally the international community 
to say that no more money will be sent to clean up Russian 
nuclear waste sites or to decommission nuclear reactors until we 
know where it will go and where the other money has gone.  The 
Russian government has a great deal to answer for and has 
poisoned the good will of Canadians and the international 
community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last aspect I want to talk about is the issue of depleted 
uranium.  This came up as a big issue after the war in the former 
Yugoslavia and the gulf war.  A number of our soldiers came back 
with strange illnesses such as malignancies, weaknesses and 
depressed immune systems.  No answers were found as to the cause. 
The Department of National Defence said very clearly that it did 
not believe it was due to anything in particular and that these 
people just got sick as a matter of course. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the larger question of whether or not depleted uranium, 
which is radioactive and can have lethal effects on individuals, 
contributed to the illness of men and women in uniform, not only 
those from our country but also other participants who came back 
from both the gulf war and the former Yugoslavia.

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I emphasize that it is essential for the Minister of National 
Defence to work with the international community to obtain an 
answer for our soldiers.  They deserve one.  We must have an 
answer to determine whether depleted uranium has a negative 
effect, whether on impact the dust created that can travel for 
more than 100 kilometres has a deleterious and potentially lethal 
effect on the health of our soldiers.  We have a responsibility 
in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many people from around the world are looking at this question. 
If we work with our international defence partners on the matter 
together, we will have the answer for our soldiers who have been 
affected in some unknown way as yet by some terrible diseases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Actually a group on the east coast has done some very 
interesting studies.  It found residues of radioactive uranium in 
the bodies of individuals who came back.  If my memory serves me, 
I believe residue has been found in the bodies of 12 of 20 
individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The department of defence has said this was not a problem.  I 
urge the department not to take such a cavalier attitude toward 
the problem and not to completely dismiss it.  It should deal 
with and explore the facts and the signs.  It should not deal 
with it individually but work with the international community 
that is struggling to find an answer to this very important 
problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not only important because of what happened in the past 
but because depleted uranium is still being used.  It is being 
used in the anti-tank ammunition of the A-10 warthogs and 
anti-tank weapons that are used on the ground.  The number of 
countries that are using it has expanded dramatically over the 
last few years.  Pakistan and India, our NATO partners, and many 
other countries are using DU munitions in their military. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not only a problem that has happened in the past.  It 
will happen in the future.  We must find the answer.  A concerted 
international effort by defence departments and scientists from 
around the world will get to the bottom of it.  We owe it to our 
men and women in uniform not only to find the answers but to make 
sure they are treated with more care and consideration.  That is 
our minimum responsibility to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support the bill.  We recognize that nuclear waste is a very 
serious problem, but for it to be disposed of wisely we must have 
buy-in from the communities.  There must be an open and 
transparent process for where it will be put, how it will be 
disposed of, and the tomb these nuclear materials will be encased 
in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also encourage the government to work with the international 
community to look at alternatives.  I have spoken about the 
fusion torch.  I have spoken about the NPTRE that can be used as 
another way of burning effete nuclear rods.  We can use these 
things to decrease the amount of nuclear waste that we will 
ultimately have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage Canada to work with the international community to 
do it.  It is another one of those problems that not only affect 
us but affects the international community and all those who are 
in possession of nuclear reactors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to deal with former U.S.S.R. countries to find out where 
the tens of millions of dollars have gone that we have sent to 
Russia and Ukraine for decommissioning nuclear reactors and other 
nuclear waste material. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has not gone where it should be going.  There are other 
Chernobyls on the horizon.  People will be killed.  Canada can 
play a very important international role with our other partners 
in this regard.  We all have a vested interest in ensuring that 
nuclear waste is disposed of wisely.  I encourage the government 
to work with all of us and the international community to make 
sure that happens.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Serge Cardin (Sherbrooke, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
rise today to speak to the bill on the long term management of 
nuclear fuel waste. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I would like to draw a parallel with the discussions on 
open line shows this morning. Yesterday, the finance minister 
gave his economic update. On a local radio show in my riding 
people were expressing their views on various elements of the 
minister's statement, including the debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why am I talking about the debt? People where saying that over 
the past 30 years previous governments had been accumulating the 
debt. 
The government is now taking steps to pay it down as quickly as 
possible so that future generations are not stuck with reimbursing 
the amounts borrowed by previous generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I want to stress here is responsibility. We must take 
responsibility for what we are doing now and for what we did in 
the past. When it comes to the nuclear world, nuclear waste in 
particular, we are told, depending on the source, that nuclear 
waste can last 200 years, 300 years or 500 years. Other sources 
mention 1,000 years, or even several thousands of years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can we deal responsibly with waste that will affect people 
throughout the world for hundreds, even thousands of years? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since we have been talking about the nuclear industry for a 
number of years, I would like to step into the past and point 
out a few things about the background to the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In February 1998, the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency 
published the “Report of the Nuclear Fuel Waste Management and 
Disposal Concept Environmental Assessment Panel”, known as the 
Seaborn report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a 1978 joint statement, the governments of Canada and Ontario 
asked Atomic Energy Canada Limited to develop a concept for the 
deep geological disposal of nuclear fuel waste. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a later joint statement, in 1981, they agreed not to go ahead 
with the selection of a site for that purpose without first 
holding proper public hearings at the federal level and 
submitting the concept to the approval of Canadian and 
provincial authorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In September 1988, the federal Minister of Energy, Mines and 
Resources referred the concept, along with a broad range of 
nuclear fuel waste management issues, for public review. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On October 4 1989, the federal Minister of the Environment 
appointed an independent environmental assessment panel to 
conduct the review. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that time, the panel's mandate was to review a concept rather 
than a specific project at a specific site. The panel was also 
mandated to review a proposal for which the implementing agency 
was not identified, and to establish a scientific review group 
of distinguished independent experts to examine the safety and 
scientific acceptability of the proposal. 
The mandate also involved reviewing a broad range of policy 
issues. Finally, all those elements had to be reviewed in the 
five provinces concerned.

<A HREF="#LINKT33"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>AECL describes its concept as a method of geological disposal of 
nuclear fuel waste in which the waste form is either used CANDU, 
or Canada deuterium uranium, fuel or the solidified high level 
waste from reprocessing. The waste form is sealed in a 
container designed to last at least 500 years and possibly much 
longer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Waste containers are placed within the confines of underground 
disposal rooms or in boreholes drilled from the rooms. The 
disposal rooms are between 500 and 1,000 metres below the 
surface. The geological medium is plutonic rock of the Canadian 
Shield. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such a facility would cost an estimated $8.7 billion to 
$13.3 billion in 1991 dollars, depending on the amount of waste 
to be disposed of. The panel conducted its review in several 
provinces, including Quebec and Ontario. It did environmental 
impact assessments and consulted the public, namely the natives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Among other activities, the terms of reference directed the 
panel to examine the criteria by which the safety and 
acceptability of the concept for long term waste management and 
disposal should be evaluated. 
It also required the panel to prepare a final report addressing 
whether AECL's concept is safe and acceptable or should be 
modified, and the future steps to be taken in managing nuclear 
fuel wastes in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here are some key panel conclusions. Broad public support is 
necessary in Canada to ensure the acceptability of a concept for 
managing nuclear fuel wastes. Safety is a key part but only one 
part of acceptability. Safety must be viewed from two 
complementary perspectives: technical and social. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To be considered acceptable, a concept for managing nuclear fuel 
wastes must have broad public support, as I was saying earlier, 
and must be advanced by a stable and trustworthy proponent and 
overseen by a trustworthy regulator. Therefore, for the public, 
the level of confidence in the people and organizations managing 
nuclear wastes is very important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After applying these criteria to the AECL disposal concept, the 
panel came to a number of key conclusions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The key panel conclusions are the following:  from a technical 
perspective, the panel believes that safety of the AECL concept 
has been on balance adequately demonstrated for a conceptual 
stage of development, but from a social perspective, it has not. 
It also says that, as it stands, the AECL concept for deep 
geological disposal has not been demonstrated to have broad 
public support. The concept in its current form does not have 
the required level of acceptability to be adopted as Canada's 
approach for managing nuclear fuel wastes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then the panel considered the steps that must be taken to ensure 
the safe and acceptable long term management of nuclear fuel 
wastes in Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here are its main recommendations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of additional steps are required to develop an approach 
for managing nuclear fuel wastes in a way that could achieve 
broad public support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Among other things, we should issue a policy statement governing 
the management of these wastes; initiate an aboriginal 
participation process; create a nuclear fuel waste management 
organization, or NFWMA—but its better to use the full name, so we 
know what we are talking about; a public review of the 
regulatory documents of the AECB through effective consultation 
processes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also need to develop a comprehensive public participation 
plan, to develop an ethical and social assessment framework and 
to compare the options for the management of nuclear wastes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Taking into account the views of participants in our public 
hearings and our own analysis, the commission developed the 
following basic recommendations to governments with respect to a 
management agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was recommended that a nuclear fuel waste management 
organization 
be established quickly, at arm's length from the utilities and 
AECL, with the sole purpose of managing and co-ordinating the 
full range of activities relating to the long term management of 
nuclear fuel wastes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another recommendation was that the agency be fully funded in 
all its operations from a segregated fund to which only the 
producers and owners of nuclear fuel wastes would contribute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was also recommended that its board of directors, appointed 
by the federal government, be representative of key 
stakeholders, and that it have a strong and active advisory 
council representative of a wide variety of interested parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was also recommended that its purposes, responsibilities and 
accountability, particularly in relation to the ownership of the 
wastes, be clearly and explicitly spelled out, preferably in 
legislation or in its charter of incorporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was also recommended that it be subject to multiple oversight 
mechanisms, including federal regulatory control with respect to 
its scientific-technical work and the adequacy of its financial 
guarantees, to policy direction from the federal government and 
to regular public review, preferably by parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the commission pointed out that until the 
foregoing steps have been completed and broad public acceptance 
of a nuclear fuel waste management approach has been achieved, 
the search for a specific site should not proceed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the AECL concept is chosen as the most acceptable option 
after implementation of the steps recommended above, governments 
should direct the NFWMA, together with Natural Resources Canada 
and the AECB or its successor, to undertake a review all the 
social and technical shortcomings identified by the scientific 
review group and other review participants, to establish their 
priority and to generate a plan to address them. 
The nuclear fuel waste management organization should make its 
plan public, carry out public consultations and then implement 
its plan.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members will recall in the Seaborn report, the panel 
recommended that the federal government establish a management 
committee with the objective of finding solutions for nuclear 
fuel waste management and implementing them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However there has been a change of approach and through Bill 
C-27 the government has decided to pass the waste management 
responsibility off to the provinces. In Quebec, Hydro-Quebec 
should be the one in charge of establishing a waste management 
organization. 
I point out that the WMO must establish, by appointing its 
members, an advisory committee to study proposals and make 
recommendations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The idea is to establish a waste management organization 
whose objective will be to set out nuclear fuel waste management 
proposals for the federal government and to implement the 
proposal it accepts. The WMO established by Hydro-Quebec must 
then make available to Atomic Energy of Canada Limited and to 
any owners of nuclear fuel waste produced in Canada, at a 
reasonable cost of course, nuclear fuel waste management 
services as provided in the proposal approved by the governor in 
council. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I gave details about Hydro-Quebec,, I must say that I was 
venturing an opinion and was interpreting a little. 
Would Hydro-Québec make recommendations? If so, would it do so 
individually or in conjunction with the group mentioned in the 
bill? This group is comprised of the Ontario Power Generation, 
Hydro-Québec, a New Brunswick power corporation and Atomic Energy 
of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some aspects of the bill are not clear. For example, we presume 
that all these stakeholders will work on a nuclear waste 
management policy but we can also presume that this would be 
done individually. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for financing, the nuclear energy corporations, such as 
Hydro-Québec and Atomic Energy of Canada, would individually or 
jointly, as I said earlier, create a trust fund that would be used 
for implementing the approved waste management proposal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the bill, Hydro-Quebec would have to pay, 10 days after 
the day on which the bill came into force, $20 million for its 
fund, and $4 million in each subsequent year. Afterward, the 
waste management organization, Hydro-Québec, would be able to 
propose shares to the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also know that there is interest on any late payment. I 
suppose members know about this. We all get into situations 
where payments are due but not in arrears, of course. If the 
funds or the interest are not paid, the bill provides for fines 
not exceeding $300,000 for each day on which the offence is 
committed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this trust, the first withdrawal of funds must be for an 
authorized construction or storage activity. The funds must be 
used to implement the proposal approved by the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Examination of the bill shows that the proposal to the minister 
should include three management approaches, particularly 
concerning the following: disposal in the Canadian Shield; 
storage on site at nuclear plants; centralized storage, either 
above or below ground; a comparison of the benefits, risks and 
costs taking into account the economic area to be determined; a 
description of management services; an implementation plan; a 
timeframe, and especially a program for public consultation and 
an annual financing formula for policy implementation.

<A HREF="#LINKT36"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However there is a hitch in the bill, which provides, as I read 
it and I think that I am right, that only the minister can hold 
public consultations. As we know, consultation is crucial because 
we also know that the capacity to rely on those who will manage 
nuclear waste is just as crucial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course the waste management organization will have to submit an 
annual report of its activities. The form, the updated estimated 
total cost, the financing formula, the amount of the deposit to 
be paid, of course, and the amount of the final guarantees to be 
included in the annual report must be approved by the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All these reports will be tabled and the minister will make a 
public announcement in this regard.  Let me repeat that this 
report still provides for fines of $50,000 to $300,000 per day 
of violation. Should we consider that as an incentive for the 
tabling of these reports on time?  I think so.  Are the fines 
too high given the importance of the reports to be tabled?  It 
is a question worth asking.  The members will answer if they 
want to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian government is the only one that regulates the 
nuclear industry. It has invested more than $5 billion in this 
area over the years and approximately $150 million a year since 
1994, whereas all the other countries of the world, even those 
that use nuclear energy the most, are reviewing their use of 
this type of energy and are even thinking about progressively 
decommissioning their nuclear power plants and opting for 
alternative energy sources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government is determined to promote this type of 
energy as an interesting alternative to fossil fuels, which 
create more pollution in spite of the virulent public 
opposition and the major problem of radioactive waste.  Last 
year, Atomic Energy of Canada Limited estimated that it would 
cost $377 million to decontaminate its plants and dispose of the 
waste. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the Seaborn panel clearly indicated in 1998 that the 
estimated cost of a long term nuclear waste management facility 
ranged from $8.7 billion to $13.3 billion in 1991 . Today, the 
amount is estimated at $15 billion for most countries, such as 
France and the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, the amount of $20 billion, plus $4 million annually 
for Quebec, raises questions in our minds. Will it be enough? In 
November 1999, at a meeting of the parties to the convention on 
climate change held in Bonn, Germany, Canada proposed a plan 
that would give emission credits to countries that export 
nuclear reactors, which would enable Canada to meet its targets 
indirectly without reducing its own emissions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite growing opposition from the people, Canada is continuing 
down the nuclear path instead of favouring renewable energy and 
adopting strong policies for the reduction of greenhouse gas 
emissions.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the last election campaign, the Bloc Quebecois promised 
to suggest that the federal government cancel any funding to the 
nuclear fission industry and that the $150 million that go to 
that industry every year be retargeted for research and 
development in the area of clean energy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since this opens the door to exporting nuclear waste, one has to 
wonder if the government really understands the public's 
opposition to this type of project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the subject of importation, in a previous committee sitting, 
I had the opportunity to discuss with officials from the 
Department of Natural Resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked one of them, with respect to importing nuclear wastes, 
if the waste management organization were to find relatively good 
solutions—being taken for granted, of course, that we support 
nuclear projects and therefore consider that the proposals are 
relatively good—should we fear that nuclear waste might be 
imported to get a better return on our investment in various 
waste management programs or projects that Canada might 
implement? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a major risk because in every one of our communities 
there are waste disposal sites for solid waste or domestic 
waste. We know what this is all about. When I was on the 
municipal council in Sherbrooke, we had a waste disposal site. 
There is one in my ward. One can imagine the problem it creates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to the management of nuclear waste or any other 
kind of waste—of course technically they cannot be compared, 
although as far as a process is concerned it is the same 
thing—nobody wants it in their backyard. We all know that. We do 
not want to see waste imported because it has happened before. 
It has happened in Quebec and I am convinced it has happened in 
other provinces too. We should avoid it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In view of the fact that often the only thing that matters 
for our Liberal government is money, I am afraid that at some 
time in the future waste will be imported to make our nuclear 
waste management system more profitable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is something we must keep in mind because the official from 
the Department of Natural Resources told me that for the time 
being they had more than enough to do in dealing with our own 
waste. What concerns me, not to say scares me, is the fact that 
he said that for the time being they are not considering this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I am told “For the time being, we are not planning on it”, 
am I to understand that their plans may change tomorrow, next 
week or next year? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why the bill must really be transparent. All its details 
must be clear, precise and, to the extent possible, be 
assessed. Moreover, even though consultation is provided for in 
the legislation, we must never neglect to consult. The 
population must be consulted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even if the urgency is evident, we believe that public 
consultation—and let it be clear that we do not want the kind of 
bogus consultation that was held in regards to MOX and that 
lasted only 28 days—is necessary and fundamental. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing will have to be closely considered. The bill 
intends to force Quebec or, more precisely, Hydro-Quebec to 
operate according to the proposal that will be adopted by the 
natural resources minister in Ottawa and to the criteria set by 
him. Is Quebec really in agreement with these criteria? That is 
what we will determine later.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have a concern about the fines provided for in the bill. 
Do members not think that the fines imposed for each day of 
infraction are excessive, considering that this type of bill 
always contains variable factors? We know that the bill contains 
provisions allowing additional delay, but the issue of fines is 
still of concern us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look briefly at the situation of Canada's nuclear power 
stations, we find that the obligation to treat nuclear fuel 
waste is unfortunately something that the Bloc Quebecois cannot 
oppose, but we do strongly oppose the use of fuel and the 
operation of power plants using nuclear fission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members know, in his most recent report, the auditor general 
clearly indicated that the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission 
needs to improve its regulatory regime for power reactors. 
Among other things, the audit pointed out that the 
commission does not use quantitative measures to rate nuclear 
power facilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the auditor general, the rating systems used are 
not always based on specific criteria but rather on the 
judgment and expertise of staff. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we do not believe that the staff would be dishonest and is 
probably competent, we would like to point out that the auditor 
general said, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The criteria for what is acceptable or unacceptable are 
subjective and could be misunderstood. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, as the auditor general pointed out in the report, CNSC 
faces significant difficulties in recruiting and retaining 
qualified staff. Combined with its current regulatory regime, 
which relies heavily on the expertise and judgment of staff, the 
lack of human resource capacity could impact its ability to 
function adequately in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Considering that only a responsible approach is necessary on 
this matter, the Bloc Quebecois will support Bill C-27, while 
maintaining major reservations. The Bloc Quebecois will continue 
to follow the matter very carefully because there are major 
issues involved in this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These issues relate to the huge economic investment required for 
a management regime based on the protection of the environment 
and of the health of Quebecers. The Canadian people and even the 
American people would be affected by this bill. While Mr. Bush is 
not giving a lot of hope on this matter and the Canadian 
government has a strange approach toward this, we consider it 
our duty to ensure first and foremost that the bill does not 
have negative consequences and that the issues will be carefully 
considered at all stages. 
At this point, we agree on the bill but we have very major 
reservations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, people need to have a good 
relationship with the main stakeholders, as, of course, with the 
federal government in its responsibilities on waste management. 
There must also be a trust relationship with the fuel nuclear 
waste management organization.

of the public. The public will have to be consulted, but it has 
to be real consultation and not token consultation, as I said 
earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill will have to be very specific on the potential for 
importing nuclear waste. It must be clear that the waste 
management organization's sole purpose is to manage nuclear waste from 
Quebec and Canada. We know very well that nobody would accept 
nuclear waste from other countries, with all the risks involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our responsibility today is crucial. 
We are making decisions that will have an impact on events that 
could occur in hundreds or thousands of years. Some people are 
used to managing without any long term vision but here we need 
to consider future generations, and much more than the next few 
generations, as we are talking about hundreds and thousands of 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will get a chance in committee to deal with various aspects 
of the bill and we retain the right to move amendments to Bill

families.  It is a problem that is largely unrecognized. 
Therefore we support the essence of this private member's motion 
and compliment the member responsible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion asks Canada to show leadership in the following ways: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(a) by taking action designed to increase the number of signatory 
countries to the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of 
International Child Abduction; (b) by signing bilateral treaties 
that include commitments to respect custody and access orders as 
originally handed down by the courts; and (c) by taking the 
necessary steps within its own borders to combat international 
child abduction. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The scope of this problem is significant.  In the United States 
in one year, 341,000 children were abducted from their parents. 
This is a huge number.  In the United Kingdom roughly four 
children per week are abducted and that number has actually 
increased by 58% over the last three years.  In our country there 
are similar statistics.  We can see that this is not only an 
international problem but also very much a domestic problem, and 
the impact upon families is quite significant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support the Hague convention that deals with missing and 
exploited children, but there are some problems with it.  I will 
point out some of them which need to be addressed by our country 
with the international community.  There is a lack of systemic 
data on the operation of the Hague convention.  It does not allow 
a country by country comparison.  There are also wide variations 
in outcomes that point to systemic problems with the application 
of the Hague convention in different countries.  There is a lot 
of difficulty in locating children who are subject to this 
convention and there is a lack of adequate support for the 
victims' families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also interesting variations among the judicial 
community, especially judges and lawyers.  A lot of people are 
not aware of this.  There are great inter-country variations in 
regard to knowledge of the convention.  I would encourage our 
country to work with other signatories to the Hague convention, 
not only, as the motion says, to add more countries to the 
convention but also to educate the judiciary within the signatory 
countries about the application and the importance of this 
convention.  There has also been quite a significant lack of 
enforceability on some of the orders we have seen with respect to 
the Hague convention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to our own laws, the motion asks that we take the 
necessary steps within our own borders not only to combat 
international child abduction but to ensure that access orders 
are respected within our own borders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many members of the House have spoken to constituents who are 
non-custodial parents and have court orders allowing them access 
to their children.  Unfortunately many of these court orders are 
not respected by the custodial parents.  As a result, 
non-custodial parents continue to engage in battles to see their 
children.  There is not enough protection within our own borders 
today to ensure that non-custodial parents have access to their 
children.  At the end of the day, children need two competent 
parents, not one, if it is at all possible.  If there are two 
parents, they should still remember, no matter what has come 
between them, that the children come first.  With the safety of 
the children paramount and where both parents are competent, even 
though they may not be together, they should both have access to 
the children, according to court decisions.  Too often that is 
not the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A senate report done on custody, access and divorce shows very 
clearly that Canada is lagging behind in its enforcement of these 
orders and that many non-custodial parents are denied access to 
their children.  I would encourage the government to review that 
report.  It is an excellent report supported by members from 
across party lines.  The government should fulfil and implement 
the conclusions within that report. 
The report contains many excellent suggestions that would help 
children who have been racked by the divorce of their parents.

for this motion and emphasize that the Canadian Alliance supports 
this private member's motion.  We also encourage the government 
to work with its international partners to strengthen the Hague 
convention and to ensure that the signatories are living up to 
the requirements therein.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>INTERNATIONAL CHILD ABDUCTION 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK199">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK200"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Sue Barnes (London West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will 
briefly capture some of the essence of what I hear as agreement 
in the Chamber on this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As outlined in the government's initial response to the motion, 
we do celebrate the fact that Canada has an internationally 
recognized record of achievement domestically and on the world 
stage in responding to parental international child abduction. 
Today I am here to say that the government's position is 
supportive of the motion before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Twenty years ago Canada initiated negotiations that led to the 
drafting of the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of 
International Child Abduction.  From the original three 
countries, including Canada, the number of countries that have 
become party to the Hague convention has risen to over seventy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has consistently encouraged countries to become party to 
the Hague convention, which remains the only multilateral 
international instrument designed to prevent and resolve cases of 
parental international child abduction.  Canada is at the 
forefront of international efforts to ensure that the Hague 
convention is implemented effectively in other countries.  In 
particular, Canada was represented at the recent fourth special 
commission which met in March 2001 to review the operation of 
this convention.  Everything can always be improved, of course. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In cases where the Hague convention does not apply, Canada 
offers significant assistance to left behind Canadian parents, 
always with the goal of securing the safe return of the child to 
Canada.  Canada has also negotiated two innovative bilateral 
agreements, one with Egypt and one with Lebanon, which are not 
party to the Hague convention itself.  This has helped us develop 
measures to help resolve cases of child abduction to non-Hague 
convention countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a co-ordinator of much of this work, Canada has in place a 
world recognized best practice program to prevent and resolve 
cases of missing and abducted children. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1340"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT42"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have our missing children program.  I remember that from 
my days as parliamentary secretary at then Revenue Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The partners in this program, the RCMP, the Canada Customs and 
Revenue Agency, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Immigration 
Canada, as well as the Montreal urban community police, are there 
to help Canadians in this very trying time period whenever a 
child has been child separated from their parent.  If we can 
assist, we do a service to everyone involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will evaluate the motion of hon. member for 
Rosemont—Petite-Patrie. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International 
Trade back in 1998 drafted a report called “International Child 
Abduction: Issues for Reform”. Those initiatives demonstrated 
the longstanding commitment by the Government of Canada to seek 
methods of preventing international child abduction where 
possible and to find the remedies when abductions occurred. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A manual for parents on international child abduction was 
prepared by the Department of Foreign Affairs.  That can be 
obtained through members of parliament.  It is an effective tool 
in assisting parents to understand the processes and options 
available to them when a child is abducted by another parent, 
which sadly occurs more than we would like it to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The manual also serves as an important preventive tool which 
alerts parents to the causes of parental child abduction and the 
steps they can take to protect the children involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal Departments of Justice and Foreign Affairs are 
working in collaboration with the federal central authority and 
with provincial and territorial central authorities to examine 
even better ways of collecting national statistics on 
international child abduction cases that are managed under the 
Hague Convention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this year's our missing children conference, which is being 
organized by the department of immigration and brings together 
all the key players in the area of missing and abducted children, 
sessions will be devoted to international child abduction and to 
reporting any new initiatives under way to improve the operation 
of the convention, both here and abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have to deal with those countries that currently do not 
perform as well as we would wish under the Hague Convention.  For 
the sake of Canadian children, we must encourage all countries to 
re-examine their priorities with a view to improving the 
operation of the Hague Convention in their own respective 
jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Departments of Foreign Affairs and Justice will continue to 
raise with other countries problems encountered with the 
operation and the implementation of the Hague Convention. 
Through policy and operational linkages previously established, 
particularly between the provincial and territorial central 
authorities and the relevant federal departments, specific 
problems being encountered in other countries can quickly be 
identified and raised in appropriate ways through our consular 
and diplomatic networks.  This is work that the government 
intends to intensify. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child 
Abduction is an effective instrument that addresses only one of a 
multitude of issues that often prevail in international child 
abduction cases.  It attempts to deal with and provide guidance 
on one of the most complex and emotional issues that we, whether 
as parents, lawmakers or interested individuals, may ever have to 
deal with; a cross-border child abduction.  It assists in 
providing a framework for proceeding when our family ties are 
under severe stress or disintegrate to the point that the 
children disappear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The underlying principle of the Hague Convention is to respond 
in a way that protects the best interests of the affected 
children.  Canada is committed to this principle and also 
committed to making it work, even when family disputes cross 
international borders and those situations have internally broken 
down families to the point where the abduction has taken place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a non-partisan issue.  It is an issue that can grip the 
hearts and intellects of all members in the Chamber.  I hope we 
can work together to advance the cause before us to all our 
benefit.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, you 
will easily understand that it makes me proud to rise today to 
speak to Motion No. 219, which is aimed at preventing tragedies 
that will mark you for the rest of your life from occurring 
again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am particularly happy to see that on May 29 every member of 
the House will be called upon to vote on the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I may I will read the motion moved by my colleague from 
Rosemont—Petite-Patrie: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should show 
leadership on the international stage: (<I>a</I>) by taking action 
designed to increase the number of signatory countries to the 
Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child 
Abduction; (<I>b</I>) by signing bilateral treaties that include 
commitments to respect custody and access orders as originally 
handed down by the courts; and (<I>c</I>) by taking the necessary steps 
within its own borders to combat international child abduction. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1999 in Canada more than 350 Canadian children disappeared. 
The worst tragedy that may befall a family is to lose a child. 
Children may be lost in a senseless accident or to a fatal 
disease, be it slow or fast. Families eventually have to 
overcome their grief. 
When a child is lost under those circumstances, the wound heals 
with time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a child simply vanishes, I do not think a mother can ever 
get over the loss, nor a father, although as we well know most 
children are taken away by the father.  The figure in Quebec for 
1999 was 61 children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Rosemont—Petite-Patrie has brought forward this 
motion in part because he is well aware of the situation but also 
because his partner is experiencing this very trauma.  This is a 
motion anchored in peoples' day to day realities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few weeks ago there were news reports of a father being 
intercepted at a New York airport with his son.  He was 
attempting to return to his country.  Why was there success in 
this case?  It was the result of considerable co-operation 
between police, customs and airport authorities. 
In these situations, which are always dramatic, time is the 
child's worst enemy. Effective measures must become the rule. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When parents report that a child is missing and there are good 
reasons to believe that the child may have been abducted—usually 
a child does not simply vanish into thin air—we must act quickly. 
The third part of the motion deals with the need for quick 
action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think everyone knows how important this motion is and how 
important it is to make it clear to the international community 
that for Canada the right of a child to be with his or her 
parents is sacred. Abducting a child, taking a child from one of 
his or her parents, is unacceptable. The only way to show that 
something is unacceptable is to make it impossible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of my colleague from Rosemont—Petite-Patrie, I am taking 
the liberty of thanking all parliamentarians who spoke to the 
motion. I thank the government for saying loud and clear that it 
will support the motion. What I am reading into this is that we 
will soon see practical measures because of the government's 
commitment in this regard. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK202"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Loyola Hearn (St. John's West, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
not going spend a great deal of time on this, but it is such an 
important issue.  As has already been mentioned, it is a 
non-partisan issue, and we want to be on the record as supporting 
it. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1350"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of us as parents and friends of those who have children 
realize how important it is to keep family units together.  In a 
great country like Canada where the family is such an important 
unit, perhaps it is even more true than anywhere else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we think that families can be divided because one or other 
decides to leave and go back to his or her place of former 
residence, or perhaps just to take off and take one or more of 
the children, we all realize the impact it has on the family and 
on our community generally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our country, our government, should take whatever steps we can 
at an international level to ensure that other countries feel the 
same way as we do.  In the agreements we sign we should make sure 
that in the event these happenings occur, which they should not, 
we can quickly move on them without having to see people go 
through devastating experiences.  I am thinking of the book 
written by Betty Mahmoody, <I>Not Without My Daughter</I>.  Those 
of us who have read it or seen the movie understand what that 
family went through.  Certainly we all have our own examples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just a couple of years ago in the St. John's area a father took 
his three young children and disappeared.  It is has been a 
couple of years.  No one knows where they have gone, if they are 
still in the country or have left the country.  It has had a 
devastating effect on the family and certainly on the community 
generally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is melting pot of nationalities.  Because of that many of 
our younger people marry people who come from other countries and 
sometimes, if things do not work out, they leave.  Occasionally 
they have taken the children, which has caused tremendous grief. 
It is interesting that in many of the cases where young people 
have been abducted security forces at airports have had concerns 
that something was wrong but did not have the proof or the 
authority to do anything about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those of us who have travelled extensively over the years 
remember that the times when we went to airports and the first 
prominent people standing around were members of the Royal 
Canadian Mounted Police.  It might be worth while asking if we 
have been too lax in airport security.  I know we have good 
people checking our suitcases and frisking us.  That is all 
wonderful, but many things go through airports that cannot be 
detected by a scanner, whether they be hand-held or otherwise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Professional people understand and identify problems.  Looking 
for signs is important.  There is an old saying that forewarned 
is forearmed.  Perhaps we could tighten up the security, even if 
it means having the RCMP again playing a prominent role at 
airports.  The extra cost is very little in comparison with the 
grief caused to too many families.  As I say, because of our 
international involvement and the type of country we have, we are 
susceptible to such things happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we move ahead in this regard, it is not something we should 
only deal with if a meeting happens to be called somewhere along 
the line.  It is an issue Canada should push and should keep 
pushing until we get everyone agreeing with us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many people agree with us.  Sometimes the more people come 
together, the more others are embarrassed not to do so.  Despite 
their own national concerns about family units and how they 
operate and whatever, surely there is no one anywhere in the 
world who would deny the right of children to be with their 
parents, certainly the ones most responsible for looking after 
them.
