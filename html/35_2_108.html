	<B>Mr. Ian Murray (Lanark-Carleton, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
gives me great pleasure to recognize a group of students who are 
with us today from Canada World Youth.
<P>
	Seven Canadian and seven Russian youths are taking part in this 
exchange program. The students are spending three months in 
Smiths Falls and Brockville, Ontario and then will travel to Russia 
for three months.
<P>
	Canada World Youth, founded in 1971, is a non-profit 
organization that co-ordinates international exchanges and 
non-formal education experiences for youth. This program creates 
unique cross-cultural learning experiences, develops leadership 
skills and provides opportunities for young people to become 
involved with international and community development issues.
<P>
	The seven Russian students are billeted with seven Canadian 
families for the three-month period. Volunteer work placements are 
sought to allow participants to learn how small businesses and 
community service organizations function.
<P>
	I commend the organizers for their hard work and dedication 
which have made this exchange so successful for the last 25 years.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="EMPLOYMENTINSURANCE">EMPLOYMENT INSURANCE</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Bernier (Beauce, Ind.):</B> Mr. Speaker, part time 
workers, women for the most part, are penalized by the new 
employment insurance rules that require far too many hours of 
work for them to qualify. They will have to work 910 hours, or the 
equivalent of twenty-six 35-hour weeks.
<P>
	Under the old legislation, anyone who worked 15 hours a week 
or more was covered, but now there are workers who, while paying 
premiums and theoretically being eligible for employment 
insurance, will in fact never qualify because the number of hours of 
work required is excessively high. Nor will they qualify for a rebate 
on their premiums. This is a grey area.
<P>
	In a region like ours, in Beauce, requiring so many hours of work 
to qualify is tantamount to excluding part time workers from the 
program. I suggest that the legislation be made more flexible so 
that part time workers are not made poorer still.

town and the centre as racist and sexist.
<P>
	The minister of immigration still refuses to offer a simple 
apology for the actions of her department which unfairly damaged 
the reputation of the people of Vegreville. The mistake was 
commissioning a third party study to deal with isolated charges of 
racism and sexism when these charges should have been dealt with 
quickly and firmly by management.
<P>
	By calling for a study, her department was indicating that there 
was a widespread problem when that was not the case. The report 
verifies that there were isolated incidents only.

was as widely circulated as this study was, would be leaked and it

temporary, and as the auditor general states, did not amount to 
100,000. The construction industry lost 51,000 jobs this year.
<P>
	As well, he calls into question the Liberal definition of 
infrastructure and points out that golf courses and canoe museums 
do not fit the definition.
<P>
	When I was mayor I sat on the Federation of Municipalities 
Infrastructure Committee. We described infrastructure as roads, 
sewers, streets, bridges and any project that was connected to the 
environment. It is irresponsible to spend millions of dollars without 
proper accountability, no controls and a definition of infrastructure 
broad enough to build a golf course.
<P>
	The Liberals' promise of jobs, jobs, jobs is still in the same state 
as roads and sewers: in decay.

<P>
	It is imperative that the federal government find some way of 
giving relief to those lower income Canadians who are now subject 
to a 25.5 per cent withholding tax on their U.S. benefits but not 
entitled to a tax refund for overpayments.
<P>
	This policy unfairly penalizes Canadian residents and most, as 
seniors, at a time in their lives when they can ill afford it. Indeed, 
many are trying to survive on less than subsistence incomes.
<P>
	I appreciate that amendments to international treaties require 
lengthy and laborious negotiations. Nonetheless I implore the 
finance minister and the government to make every effort to bring 
needed change to this unfair U.S. tax policy.

significant and long term. We know that such children have more 
risk factors and fewer supports.
<P>
	It is not a simple problem in need of a simple solution. It is a

it has been estimated that there are 110 million uncleared

month. Over the last 50 years land mines have probably inflicted 
more death and injury than nuclear and chemical weapons 
combined.
<P>
	With only 23 nations supporting a global ban on the use of 
anti-personnel land mines, they have become the weapon of choice 
in guerrilla type operations. They are cheap, at $3, easy to set and 
highly effective.
<P>
	Land mines are indiscriminate in their action. The United 
Nations has estimated that land mines are ten times more likely to 
kill or injure a civilian, primarily women and children, after a 
conflict, rather than during combat situations.

<P>

government has still not identified all the contaminated federal 
sites, that it has no overall plan for doing so, and that the eventual 
costs to the public of decontaminating these sites are also not 
known. The auditor general is concerned because of the health, 
safety and environmental risks of such a situation, not to mention 
the potential impact on the public purse.
<P>

of listing, identifying and clarifying the degree of contamination of 
federal sites, given the health and environmental risks associated 
with such a situation?

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (Parliamentary Secretary to

is well aware of the auditor general's concerns. In fact, we have 
already been working to deal with contaminated sites in Canada.

looking at contaminated sites and we are developing a template to

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (Parliamentary Secretary to

a committee is looking into it. This has been a problem in Canada 
since World War II. Each federal department has responsibility for 
dealing with contaminated sites.

dealing with it, and it is being dealt with.

<P>
	Yesterday, among the horror stories revealed by the auditor 
general, we learned that, in order to save $71 on a repair contract 
for a ship moored in Nova Scotia, the government spent $30,000 to 
move it to Newfoundland, $30,000 in taxpayers' money wasted to 
save $71. Unbelievable!
<P>
	Is the Deputy Prime Minister in a position to explain to us how 
this could be, what twisted logic was used to justify the decision by 
someone, somewhere, that it was normal to spend $30,000 in order 
to save $71?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, as I 
said yesterday, the auditor general will surely find, among a total of 
$120 billion in expenditures, a few projects that have not been very 
successful.
<P>
	We agree, and we take the findings of the auditor general to 
heart. We wish to provide far more efficient government, and we 
are, moreover, the first government in 50 years to have really 
reduced government expenditures in absolute terms. We want to 
see Canadians drawing the full benefit of their tax dollars. This is 
why we always give the utmost attention to the auditor general's 
recommendations and correct our mistakes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I fail to understand how the minister can pass 
off these little failed projects as trifles, when the auditor general 
has identified $2.5 billion in waste in his report for 1996.
<P>
	The minister tells us that he wants to tighten up controls. He 
makes it sound very simple, but what about the senior public 
servant who has made an error in judgement? What will happen to 
him? What will happen to the person responsible for making such 
an irresponsible decision?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, if 
someone had the authority to punish all of the errors committed by 
the opposition party, there would not be one of them left.
<P>
	What is important is that we have markedly reduced 
expenditures that were not in the public interest. We have cut 
government expenditures by $15 billion. We have reformed the 
public service and the various departments.
<P>
	I believe that, with the recommendations of the auditor general, 
we can continue to properly serve the Canadian public, including 
Quebecers, who want good value for their money.

	The transport minister said last week that he was open to a 
lowering of the federal aviation fuel tax and that he had discussed it 
with the finance minister.
<P>
<B>(1425 )</B>
<P>
	However, the parliamentary secretary was unclear yesterday as 
to what the result was.
<P>
	My question is for the parliamentary secretary. Will this 
government follow Alberta's lead and reduce the federal aviation 
fuel tax?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we agree wholeheartedly with the 
hon. member's position that Canadian Airlines is a very important 
company for this country.
<P>
	The Minister of Transport wants it to survive and succeed and so 
does this government. He is meeting with all the people necessary 
to meet with in order to make that happen.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, taxes kill jobs and this particular tax is capable of killing 
many jobs. The aviation fuel tax is an excellent example. It puts our 
airlines at a competitive disadvantage.
<P>
	The old way of dealing with economic sectors that are in trouble 
has been grants and handouts. The new way of dealing with that is 
tax relief. If Canadian employees are willing to make sacrifices to 
save their jobs, surely the federal tax collector would make some 
sacrifice as well.
<P>
	Again, we are asking the parliamentary secretary for an answer 
to this, not a general comment. Will the federal government offer to 
reduce the federal aviation tax as a means of saving these 16,000 
jobs at Canadian?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. leader of the third party is 
again right. There have been sacrifices, many of them made by the 
employees of Canadian Airlines. However, I remind the hon. 
member that there have been many sacrifices made by the 
Canadian taxpayer for Canadian Airlines as well. Therefore we 
have to act responsibly and act in their best interests.
<P>

<P>
	The minister went out to British Columbia. He has been 
working hard at facilitating discussions. He has met with Mr. 
Kevin Benson, the president of Canadian Airlines. That meeting 
has been successful. He has met with six of the unions. Four of 
those unions have come on board, including the largest union, the 
machinists union, led by Mr. David Ritchie.
<P>
	We can say that those discussions have been fruitful. There have 
been some serious proposals put on the table and they are now 
under active consideration.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we understand all that and have understood it for a long 
time. Our question is very simple. These workers are going to have 
to make a final decision this weekend as to whether to accept this 
restructuring package. It includes proposals for reducing the 
overhead and operating costs of the airlines. However, if they know 
there is going to be a reduction in the federal aviation tax that 
makes a difference with respect to the acceptability of the entire 
package.
<P>
	I simply ask the parliamentary secretary, who seems to be 
moving in the right direction, can he go the whole way and just tell 
the House and tell those workers that the federal government is 
offering a reduction in the federal aviation fuel tax?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, sometimes the answer cannot be as 
simple as the question. We have to do the appropriate thing in the 
best interests of Canadians. We have to meet with the appropriate 
individuals, the president of the company and the union officials. 
Four of the six unions have all come on board. They have been very 
active.
<P>
	Yes, Canadian Airline employees have made their sacrifices but 
so have Canadian taxpayers. We have to ensure that the Canadian 
taxpayer is also protected.
<P>
	As I said before, all those serious proposals have been made to 
the Minister of Transport. He has been there since last Sunday 
facilitating these discussions. All those proposals are under active 
consideration at this very moment.

	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs.
<P>
	Most regrettably, the negotiations of recent days to send a 
multinational force to the great lakes region of Africa are still 
stalled. The indecision of the international community angers us 
and makes us wonder about its effects on possible future conflicts 
in that region of Africa. Despite continued opposition in Kigali, the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs suggested yesterday that one  possible 
intervention might involve dropping food by parachute for 
subsequent distribution by humanitarian organizations.
<P>
<B>(1430)</B>
<P>
	Has the minister obtained a consensus, and, if so, when would 
this operation begin and how would it work?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, following the meetings in Stuttgart, we looked very 
closely with our colleagues at actions we might take. We concluded 
it would be quite possible to establish headquarters in Uganda, to 
undertake certain reconnaissance operations in Zaire and especially 
to parachute in aid for the refugees.
<P>
	We made this recommendation yesterday to the other partners, 
and I expect to receive a response tonight or tomorrow morning. 
Afterwards, things should go very quickly. We need the 
co-operation of the other partners to ensure all resources are 
mobilized for this vital operation in Zaire.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, nobody 
understands why the international community is becoming 
increasingly bogged down in this matter. Why is it so slow to react?
<P>
	Would the minister explain to all Canadians why the 
international community seems totally incapable of acting? Is there 
any real political will here? If not, this should be made clear.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in case the hon. member did not notice, about 10 days ago 
over .5 million refugees returned to Rwanda, which was the 
original purpose of the mission. That part of it has been 
extraordinarily successful. The original mission was established to 
have the refugees return to Rwanda. Most of them have now 
returned.
<P>
	It may stretch the imagination of the hon. member but frankly if 
that was the objective of the mission and most of it has now been 
achieved, the question is what do we do to ensure that it is 
completed. That has been the cause of some of the uncertainty by 
other members of the coalition.
<P>
	There is no lack of political will. I will be glad to table my 
telephone bill in the House of Commons to show how much will we 
have been exercising in the last several days.
<P>
	The reaction is, as I said, we must work in co-operation with the 
other potential partners so that we can have a full mobilization of 
this effort, so we can complete the task that was started by the 
initiative two weeks ago of Canada, where we have had enormous 
success with the refugees going back. But we want to make sure the 
job is fully and effectively completed.

	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, during question period yesterday the Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Minister of the Transport said that Canadian 
Airlines lost $1.2 billion over the last 10 years.
<P>
	That is true, but it did not stop the government from taking $32 
million a year in fuel taxes from the financially troubled airline. 
Maybe that is because the government is in worse financial shape 
than the airline is.
<P>
	The government's insensitivity to Canadian's employees is 
deplorable but perhaps it is understandable given that the average 
Liberal pension is higher than the average working wage of 
Canadian's employees.
<P>
	The employees are not looking for handouts. They are looking 
for fairness. When is this government going to do the fair thing and 
end its unfair aviation fuel tax, a tax that is destroying Canadian 
jobs and Canadian companies?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am a little amazed at the question 
put by the hon. member only because we know that the hon. 
member is an active member of the transport committee who has 
always been very facilitating and very helpful in situations on bills 
and so on.
<P>
	Today he chooses this very difficult time that is taking place 
between a company and its employees in trying to restructure an 
airline, the goodwill that is being demonstrated by three different 
levels of government in the facilitation, the team work being put 
forward by not only the federal government but the Government of 
Alberta, the Government of British Columbia. It is a team approach 
that will see this airline survive and be prosperous. The hon. 
member's intervention and political gainsmanship are not helping 
one bit.
<P>
<B>(1435)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Government of Alberta does not have any trouble 
figuring out what the right thing is. Why does this government?
<P>
	Thus far the Canadian auto workers and CUPE have not agreed 
to the democratic process of allowing their members to vote on 
Canadian's restructuring process. The parliamentary secretary says 
four out of six. These were the other two.
<P>
	Buzz Hargrove, the head of the CAW, is actually in a conflict 
position. He has members in Canadian facing a salary reduction 
while he is trying to negotiate a raise for those same members in 
Air Canada. Faced with this dilemma, there is no way he can act in 
the best interests  of both parties simultaneously. Canadian's 
employees are rallying today, asking for the right to vote.
<P>
	Parliament is the final court of appeal. Is it listening? Is it going 
to act?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B> Yes, Mr. Speaker, this government is in the 
process of doing its job and trying to help Canadian get back on its 
feet.
<P>
	The hon. member speaks of the union between the leadership and 
its employees. It was three weeks ago that the Minister of Transport 
brought this issue to the floor of this House, on November 8, when 
he said that he completely agreed the employees of Canadian 
should have the right to vote on their future and on the restructuring 
program that has been proposed by Mr. Benson, CEO of Canadian 
Airlines.
<P>
	We are on side with the company. We are trying to work with the 
company and its employees. We want to see Canadian Airlines 
survive.

for the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.
<P>
	The Canadian Coast Guard was to release last Thursday the 
impact study on its new fee structure for commercial traffic, but the 
tabling of this study was cancelled at the last minute. Yet everyone 
knows that the study has been completed. The consultants' contract 
ended two weeks ago.
<P>
	Will the minister admit that he is refusing to release his bogus 
study at this time because most of the findings are being strongly 
disputed by all stakeholders in the St. Lawrence shipping 
community, including almost every business analyzed in the study?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Fred Mifflin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the report the hon. member talks about is a report on 
the impact study of the marine service fees. I want to make sure the 
house understands the question.
<P>
	The impact study, as I have promised time and time again to this 
member, uses seven initiatives to look at 1,400 traffic flows and 15 
commodities. This is a very complex study that examines the 
impact of the $60 million marine service fees which represent a 
very small portion of what it costs this government to provide.
<P>
	The hon. member knows it is user pay, user say. The report is in 
the final stages but despite what the hon. member may surmise and 
suggest, the truth is the report has not yet been completed. It is not 
put together. I have not seen the final report.

<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, from what I hear 
the industry saying, I would be inclined to believe that perhaps the 
minister is not tabling his study because he is embarrassed.
<P>
	Does the minister recognize that he cannot go ahead with his 
plans to raise an additional $20 million in fees in 1997, since such 
action could obviously have serious consequences on the 
businesses and jobs affected by this fee hike?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Fred Mifflin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I think the hon. member has missed the whole point of 
the impact study. The point of the study was to find out what the 
impact would be at $60 million. But it also examines what the 
impact is in a general sense.
<P>
	The hon. member is suggesting that I should go ahead with the 
impact study, release it and then go ahead with increased fees. I do 
not think I want to do that.
<P>
<B>(1440)</B>
<P>
	The purpose of the study is to find out what the future moves 
should be. Before I table any study, I have to look at what the 
impacts are, which is the purpose of the study, before we go ahead 
with the next move. And for the information of the hon. member, it 
is not another $20 million because in effect we are collecting $26 
million now. We will move when we are ready and when we have 
studied the impacts on the overall industry to make sure that we are 
being fair, decent, balanced and reasonable.

will take this opportunity to have the chemical product industry pay 
for part of the costs of this monitoring activity.
<P>
	Will the minister confirm that, as regards its agency project, the 
Canadian government wants to recover 60 per cent of the costs 
from the chemical product industry, while the American

services?
<P>

<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and

<P>
	On the minister's behalf I want to assure the hon. gentleman that 
the government has been in very close dialogue with all of the 
stakeholders that may be potentially affected by the new Pest 
Management Regulatory Agency. Every effort is being made to 
incorporate their very helpful advice into the administration of the 
agency to make sure that it can be operated on the most economical 
basis possible. Provision is being made for an economic 
stakeholders advisory committee so that those stakeholders who 
will be affected by this regulatory system can have ongoing input 
into the future. The objective is to make this system efficient so 
that the cost savings can accrue back to the industry which would 
be subject to that regulation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, there 
will be a problem. Given this gap of 45 per cent, will the minister

costly for companies to develop their products in Canada and that, 
consequently, these companies will pass on the bill to farmers, who 
will also become less competitive, unless they buy directly from

women owned businesses employing five or more people has

Speaker, I do not know whether we can identify any inherent 
strengths in the female gender that make them successful as 
entrepreneurs but I can say that the statistics are correct.
<P>
	Women have demonstrated extraordinary success as 
entrepreneurs. They are appearing as entrepreneurs and are starting 
businesses in record numbers. As recently as this past January, 
Statistics Canada reported that the percentage of women who are 
members of Canada's entrepreneurial class has increased 
significantly. At the same time 11 per cent of Canadian employed 
women are now self-employed as entrepreneurs.
<P>
	We have tried to overcome some of the obstacles that continue to 
inhibit the ability of women to succeed as entrepreneurs largely 
through mentoring programs, assistance programs, ACOA, the

they can succeed at it.

who had been given responsibility for Tran Trieu Quan's case no

<P>
	Just recently, for example, my colleague, the Minister for 
International Cooperation, attended a meeting in Vietnam. He had 
several meetings, in person, with ministers in that government, and 
asked that pressure be brought to bear on the government. At the

	<B>Mr. Robert Bertrand (Pontiac-Gatineau-Labelle, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister's efforts during Team Canada's 
Asian trip in 1994 have finally enabled Canada to sell two Candu 
nuclear reactors to China.
<P>

of Regional Development-Quebec tell us what economic benefits 
Quebec can expect from the signing of this major contract?

<P>
	<B>Hon. Martin Cauchon (Secretary of State (Federal Office of 
Regional Development-Quebec), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my colleague for his excellent question.
<P>
	We have indeed announced the sale of two Candu reactors to 
China. This is excellent news, because the contract is worth $4 
billion. Canada's share in the financing, in other words, its 
financial contribution, is $1.5 billion. This means economic 
benefits worth $275 million for the Province of Quebec. In terms of 
job creation, it means 8,000 person years. The two reactors will 
take some six and a half years to build-a substantial contribution 
to the economy.
<P>
	This announcement is proof of the Government of Canada's 
ability to help businesses export and develop new markets, an 
important consideration in this time of globalization. It also shows 
that the Canadian government is bringing jobs home, which is vital.

my question is for the Minister of Labour.
<P>
	On October 24, Bradson Mercantile Inc. locked out its 365 
security officers and immediately replaced them with scabs. The 
security officers employed by Bradson are assigned to supply 
protection at several sites in the Ottawa-Carleton region.
<P>
	Does the minister think it is acceptable that approximately 273 
scabs provide protection at 32 federal government buildings in the 
Ottawa-Carleton region, including 2 at Elections Canada, 20 at the 
Museum of Nature and no fewer than 50 at Statistics Canada?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Public Works and

question is for the minister of immigration.
<P>
	The review of the immigration centre has clearly hurt the people 
of Vegreville by unfairly tarnishing their reputation. This $42,000 
government commissioned study should never have been done. 
This issue should have been dealt with quickly and decisively by 
competent management.
<P>
	Will the minister simply apologize for the damage done by her 
department and show some concern and consideration for the 
people of Vegreville?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I stated previously in this House 
that the study conducted at the centre in Vegreville was on the 
operations of the centre, not on the community of Vegreville per se, 
particularly since the study showed problems at the centre. The 
people of Vegreville themselves are not being judged.
<P>
	The mayor of Vegreville himself, who took the time to read the 
report, concluded it was an internal review of the operations at the 
centre.

	<B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	Bank profits are soaring over last year's record profits while 
consumer credit card debt has soared to 20 per cent of personal 
debt. Some credit card holders are paying up to 25 per cent over the 
prime rate while interest on savings accounts is paid at 3 per cent 
below prime.
<P>
	Last week when I asked the minister if he would consider 
bringing back the Usury Act to outlaw interest rate gouging by 
banks, oil companies and retail stores on credit card accounts, he 
said that he would look into it.
<P>
<B>(1500 )</B>
<P>
	In view of these record bank profits and in view of record low 
interest rates will the government now take action to protect 
consumers from this outrageous interest rate rip-off and bring the 
credit card interest rates and interest paid on savings accounts more 
in line with the Canada prime rates?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
mention to the hon. member that every one of the large Canadian 
banks has a low interest rate credit card which is available to 
consumers. Indeed, I might also mention that in the past few days 
two of the major banks have lowered their interest rates on their 
low interest rate cards and they are below 10 per cent.
<P>
	As far as the other issue of bank profits is concerned, we make 
sure that the banks pay considerable taxes to the federal 
government. I might add that a conference board study a few years 
back indicated that the banks paid taxes to federal, provincial and 
municipal governments amounting to $6 billion annually. This 
year, with higher profits, they will pay more taxes to the federal 
government.

	<B>Mr. Roger Gallaway (Sarnia-Lambton, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Canadians sometimes purchase excess amounts of frozen food such 
as poultry while in the United States. Upon entry to Canada these 
are taken from them if the individual refuses to pay the excess duty 
in accordance with agriculture Canada regulations.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-food. 
Why is the department insisting on filling our Canadian landfill 
sites with frozen American turkeys while it steadfastly refuses to 
allow them to be donated immediately to community food banks 
and kitchens?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. gentleman raises a point 
which I will be happy to investigate further.
<P>
	The critical issue that we must be very careful about is food 
safety. We had an issue arise a number of years ago with respect to 
surplus food being brought into Canada and used by certain British 
troops who were training at the Suffield station in Alberta. They 
brought their own rations with them. There were surplus rations. 
We were asked if we would allow those rations to be donated to a 
food bank. It seemed like a good idea. However, upon reflection we 
refused to give that permission because of the risk of contaminated 
food being transferred. As it turned out, that judgment in that case 
was absolutely correct because of the subsequent BST fiasco in the 
United Kingdom.
<P>
	While I do not mean to link that case to the one referred to by the 
hon. gentleman, I use it as an example to illustrate the very high 
standards of food quality we maintain in Canada, not only in the 
commercial sector but also in the food bank sector.

	<B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a 
question of privilege with regard to a very grave matter relating to a 
deliberate attempt by the minister of fisheries to deny me 
information. I refer you to Beauchesne's sixth edition, page 25, 
citation 97:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-``While it is correct to say that the government is not required by our rules to 
answer written or oral questions, it would be bold to suggest that no circumstances 
would ever exist for a prima facie case of privilege to be made where there was a 
deliberate attempt to deny answers to an Hon. Member-.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I also refer you to citation 24:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The privileges of Parliament are rights which are ``absolutely necessary for the 
execution of its powers''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I have a copy of a directive from the minister of fisheries that 
involves my personal privileges as a member of Parliament and the 
privileges of all members of Parliament from British Columbia. 
The directive states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We have been instructed by the Minister's office to report to them all telephone 
calls from MPs and Senators. The report is to include the name of the individual, the 
office they are associated with, phone number and the issue along with a summary of 
what information was given to the caller.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The messages are to be e-mailed or faxed to me within 24 hours of the call having 
been received. Attached is a form which is to be used.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Please ensure all your staff are advised to report all such calls to you immediately.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This directive went to all regional directors in the Pacific region 
of the department of fisheries. As the fisheries critic for the Reform 
Party in this House, there can be no doubt this directive was aimed 
to discourage public civil servants from talking to me as a member 
of Parliament.
<P>
	As a member of Parliament I will have less access to public 
information than a member of the general public. How can I work 
on its behalf? How can I carry out my job of representing my 
constituents if public servants are discouraged from speaking with 
me?
<P>
	This is an obvious attempt to stifle the work of a member of 
Parliament. If a general member of the public makes an inquiry to 
the department of fisheries, they are normally given a courteous 
reply. Public servants are paid with taxpayer money. They are 
public servants, not political servants of this government. It is not 
their job to spy on members of Parliament.
<P>
	If public servants at the department of fisheries in the Pacific 
region, that is British Columbia, are required to record the nature of 
the conservation with a member of this House within 24 hours it 
will discourage public servants from speaking with members. If 
public servants at fisheries speak, they will have to explain to the 
minister what they said and be prepared to explain why they said it. 
Why would a public servant risk the wrath of the minister by even 
having a conversation with a member of Parliament?
<P>
	This directive by the minister of fisheries will have a chilling 
effect on the normal flow of public information to members of 
Parliament. The public service is not the military or the police. I 
recognize that members of the military may not be able to respond 
to questions from members of the House. But is the minister of 
fisheries turning public servants into his own regiment that is 
required to snitch on conversations with members?
<P>
	Should members of this House be named on such an enemy's 
list? Are public servants required to inform the minister of their 
conversations with representatives of foreign governments within 
<P>

<B><A NAME="6798"> 6798 </A></B>
<P>
24 hours? Are members of  this House being treated worse than 
possible foreign spies and possible enemies of the country?
<P>
	The actions of the minister of fisheries have impaired my 
privileges as a member of this House. The minister's action 
prevents me from doing my job. Members of Parliament should 
never be treated as enemies.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I ask that you investigate this matter and give me 
your ruling.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Colleagues, any question of privilege is listened 
to with great attention by your Speaker. As the hon. member 
knows, I was given notice. I was given a newspaper report.
<P>
	The hon. member refers to a communique of some kind that 
came directly from the minister.
<P>
<B>(1510)</B>
<P>
	The minister is not in the House today. I wonder if the 
honourable member could wait until the minister is here. Perhaps 
there is a clarification but I would like to hear a little more 
information before I make a ruling on this.
<P>
	I would prefer to hear directly from the minister before I hear 
additional evidence, keeping in mind that I will hear additional 
evidence after I hear from the minister.
<P>
	Would that be acceptable to you, my colleague?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cummins:</B> Certainly, Mr. Speaker. I would be happy to 
make a copy of the directive which I quoted from available to you.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I would appreciate a copy of the directive but I 
hold everything in abeyance until the hon. minister of fisheries is 
here so that I can get something to go by. Perhaps there is an 
explanation to this. We will return to this when the hon. minister 
returns to the House.

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="GOVERNMENTRESPONSETOPETITIONS">GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Paul Zed (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
pursuant to Standing Order 36(8), I have the honour to table, in 
both official languages, the government's responses to six 
petitions.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER">*  *  * </H4>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="GUNCONTROL">GUN CONTROL</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the key elements of this 
government's gun control policy are now well known. Last 
December 5 legislation was adopted and given royal assent, which 
acts on those elements.
<P>
	That law imposed tough criminal penalties on those who choose 
to use firearms in the commission of crimes. It banned several 
military type assault weapons. It banned most handguns. We have 
taken strong measures to deter the smuggling and illegal movement 
of firearms, and all of this while respecting the legitimate interests 
of law-abiding firearms owners who use their guns for hunting, 
sport shooting or collecting.
<P>
	We have introduced a process by which everyone with firearms 
will be licensed and all firearms in Canada will be registered to 
their owners.
<P>
	In the period since the adoption of Bill C-68, the government has 
been at work in preparing regulations to give effect to its 
framework.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
The process of preparing those regulations has involved the 
broadest consultation with interested groups and parties, 
particularly with aboriginal people and other firearms users.
<P>
	Today, in tabling the regulations under the Firearms Act, the 
government marks another critical milestone. It is determined to 
advance toward achieving tough, sensible and effective gun control 
in Canada.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I should mention that among those with whom we have 
consulted are members of the User's Group on Firearms, 15 
persons from across Canada representing firearms owners, sport 
shooters, sustenance hunters, recreational hunters, dealers, 
collectors, police chiefs and police officers.
<P>
	The User's Group on Firearms has brought to my attention some 
unintended consequences arising from Bill C-68 for a small group 
of firearms owners and dealers. I am looking into possible 
solutions and soon hope to announce a plan to deal with those 
unintended consequences.
<P>
	I would like to take a moment in tabling these regulations today 
to acknowledge and to express gratitude for the remarkable work 
done by the dedicated professionals within the Department of 
Justice. The excellence of their work, the depth of their 
commitment and, frankly, the extent of their patience has really 
been quite extraordinary. On behalf of the government I express 
both gratitude and admiration for their efforts.
<P>
	Let me deal in a summary way with certain of the subjects dealt 
with in the regulations that I am tabling today. First, licensing for 
firearms owners will begin early in 1998. Individuals will have 
until January 2001 to obtain a licence.
<P>
	A major goal of this legislation is to prevent an escalation of 
violence in already difficult or abusive domestic situations. Before 
someone is issued a licence to acquire a gun any current or former 
spouse or common law partners, within the last two years, will be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6799"> 6799 </A></B>
<P>
notified. This will ensure that those persons have the opportunity to 
voice any concerns about their own safety or the safety of other 
persons. This provision responds to a key recommendation from 
the Vernon inquest, people who sat and looked at the evidence as 
opposed to sitting in a political seat and judging which way the 
wind is blowing.
<P>
<B>(1515)</B>
<P>
	In terms of registration we remembered that the guns most 
commonly used in crime in Canada are non-restricted rifles and 
shotguns. That is a fact. Many are illegally obtained from the 
rightful owners. And that is a fact. The registration system is the 
foundation of the government's efforts against gun theft and 
trafficking. Registration will help police track stolen guns and will 
act as an incentive for owners to store them properly in accordance 
with laws already on the books. It will also be an additional tool to 
ensure the safety of police officers responding to domestic violence 
or other potentially dangerous calls.
<P>
	The recent and very tragic events in Winnipeg on the weekend, 
and in Courtenay, B.C. some weeks ago, demonstrated once again, 
as though more evidence were required, the importance of 
complying with safe storage if tragedies and random crimes are to 
be prevented.
<P>
	Registration of firearms will begin at the same time as the 
licensing of owners, resulting in a simpler process for firearms 
users. Individuals will have until January 1, 2003 to register all 
their firearms.
<P>
	With these regulations, the government has confirmed its 
commitment for reasonable fees for firearms users, business 
owners and industry. For example, the fees for a five-year 
possession licence in 1998 will be $10 rising to $60 in the year 
2000. That is $10 for a five-year licence.
<P>
	As previously announced, in 1998, individuals will pay $10 to 
register all of the rifles and shotguns they own as long as they are 
registered at the same time. By the year 2001 that fee will rise to 
$18 to register as many rifles and shotguns as they own, provided 
they are registered all at the same time. Those are more than 
reasonable fees.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Commencing on January 1, 2001, every individual will be 
required to have a firearms licence in order to buy ammunition. 
Until that date, the proposed regulation will allow individuals who 
do not have a licence to use another approved form of 
identification. This change will make it more difficult for people 
who have stolen guns to get ammunition.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	For example, this change will make it more difficult for people 
with stolen guns to get ammunition, such as those convicted in the 
tragic Battersby murder here in Ottawa a few years ago.
<P>
	Let me briefly touch on the way these regulations apply to the 
aboriginal peoples of Canada. First of all, the principles in the 
Firearms Act apply to all Canadians. Everyone, including the 
aboriginal peoples of Canada, will be required to licence 
themselves and register their firearms. But the regulations, as we 
have always committed, adapt those principles to the reality of the 
aboriginal way of life and the traditional rights that aboriginal 
people possess.
<P>
	These adaptations respect existing aboriginal and treaty rights 
under section 35 of the 1982 Constitution Act. Sustenance hunters 
and trappers, both aboriginal and non-aboriginal, will be exempt 
from registration and licensing fees.
<P>
	In addition, the regulations will reflect the reality in the 
aboriginal communities of communal ownership of firearms, of the 
lending of firearms, the use of firearms by children below the age 
of 12, of the sometimes great difficulty that aboriginal people have 
in taking proficiency tests, particularly if it is in a language which 
they do not speak, and the particular challenges that aboriginal 
people sometimes face in terms of safe storage if they are using 
their firearms in remote locations in the exercise of aboriginal 
hunting rights.
<P>
	We have learned also during consultations with aboriginal 
people that aboriginal communities are anxious to administer the 
Firearms Act locally within their own communities. Therefore we 
are embarking on discussions on community administration of the 
Firearms Act by aboriginal communities.
<P>
<B>(1520 )</B>
<P>
	Let me touch on one other matter before I conclude. Members of 
the House will know that three provinces and two territories have 
chosen to opt out of the administration of gun control as it now 
stands. Others have chosen to join with those provinces and 
territories in challenging the constitutionality of the new law.
<P>
	The decision by these provinces and territories to abandon their 
role in the administration of gun control is nothing less than a 
shocking abdication of their responsibility. The governments of 
those provinces and territories pretend that their objection is to the 
registration of all firearms. The reality is that they have abandoned 
their role not only with respect to registration but with respect to 
gun control as a whole. They have shown that they oppose gun 
control. They will not take any further part in the issuance of FAC, 
they will take no further part in the administration of safety 
courses. They have walked away from their responsibility in 
relation to gun control.
<P>
	Up to the present time the responsibility for ensuring community 
safety through gun control, especially in those provinces and 
territories, was the joint responsibility of the federal, provincial 
and territorial governments. As of the moment when they walk 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6800"> 6800 </A></B>
<P>
away from those responsibilities, the Government of Canada is 
going to take up the responsibilities that they are abandoning.
<P>
	I look across the way and I see fellow travellers, I see the Reform 
Party and the NDP who voted against gun control, people who are 
in the grip of the gun lobby, people who have riding associations, 
such as the Reform Party, where the president is David Tomlinson, 
the national executive officer of the National Firearms Association; 
hardly a source of objective views.
<P>
	I want to assure Canadians, and particularly Canadians in 
Alberta, Manitoba and Saskatchewan and the two territories, that 
despite the irresponsible decision of their provincial and territorial 
governments, this government takes its responsibility seriously. 
We will stand up to the gun lobby. We will stand up for Canadians.
<P>
	Let the New Democratic Party kneel before the gun lobby. Let it 
betray its principles of decades. Let it walk away from its former 
reputation as the party of principle. Let the Reform Party solidify 
its position as the party of the extreme, the party in the grip of the 
gun lobby, the party incapable of taking a position in favour of 
community safety if it means that they have to offend Mr. 
Tomlinson and his National Firearms Association.
<P>
	We shall meet in court the arguments put by those provincial and 
territorial governments. We have every confidence that we shall 
prevail. We shall stand up for gun control in those provinces and 
throughout the country for the safety of Canadians in large urban 
centres but particularly in the rural communities where most of the 
guns are found.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In closing, let me say that the regulations that are tabled today, 
and the gun control law itself, illustrate this government's 
commitment to do everything possible to keep homes and streets in 
Canada safe. We believe that the laws of this land should reflect the 
peaceful, civil and tolerant heritage that is so much of what Canada 
is all about.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The government rejects absolutely the vision of the gun lobby 
for the future of this country. Canadians have made clear by their 
overwhelming support for this law in Saskatchewan, in Alberta, in 
British Columbia and throughout this country that they want the 
government to choose a path different from the one the Americans 
have chosen so that our children can inherit a Canada which is 
peaceful and civil.
<P>
<B>(1525)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as we are seeing today, the firearms issue has stirred up a 
lot of emotion and animosity between hardliners and those who 
want no controls.
<P>
	Much was heard from the latter group, but also from the federal 
government, the Liberal government before me, whose caucus is 
divided on this issue.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois, however, has always taken a realistic 
approach, avoiding exaggeration and theatrics. Our sole goal is to 
defend the legal rights and obligations of Quebecers in this regard. 
As a result, all of English Canada has benefited.
<P>
	We were, and we still are, in agreement with the principle that all 
owners of firearms should obtain a permit and that all firearms 
should be registered in the name of their owners. We support this 
principle, but not at any price, and certainly not in the face of 
intolerance and arrogance and threats to constitutional 
jurisdictions.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois has succeeded in getting the government to 
make a number of amendments to its gun control legislation, and 
we are proud to have done so. These amendments in no way alter 
the purpose of the bill, which was and still is to protect the public.
<P>
	This bill and the regulations tabled today in the House will not 
prevent all tragedies. There will always be negligence in this area 
of jurisdiction regarding the use of firearms. But the purpose of the 
regulations and the legislation is to at least try to reduce the number 
of unfortunate incidents.
<P>
	I would like to take this opportunity to thank the members of the 
Bloc Quebecois who, through their solidarity, succeeded, where the 
Reform Party failed, in getting the government to take a more 
moderate approach, in accordance with the wishes expressed by a 
great many Quebecers. We would, however, have liked the minister 
to be more receptive to the amendments we proposed. But we 
understand.
<P>
	We understand that the firearms lobby is extremely powerful. 
We understand that there were certain difficulties within his 
caucus, and, in the circumstances, we are still very pleased at what 
we have achieved with respect to this legislation.
<P>
	Today, in tabling the gun control regulations, which we shall 
examine with the same serious and professional approach as we did 
the bill, we can boast from now on that the Bloc Quebecois has 
made some considerable progress. I must take this opportunity to 
thank the minister for this. He has responded to some of the 
demands made by us in this House.
<P>
	Firearms owners will have three years to obtain a permit, that is 
from January 1, 1998 to January 1, 2001. The cost of this five-year 
gun ownership permit will be $10 in 1998 and $60 in the year 2000, 
very reasonable amounts which we ourselves proposed to the 
minister during his appearance before the standing committee on 
justice and during discussions in committee or in this House.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6801"> 6801 </A></B>
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois made sure that the government set fees that 
were reasonable, and that took regional realities into particular 
consideration.
<P>
	Another point we have gained is the individual registration of 
firearms. Owners have until January 1, 2003 to register all of their 
firearms. The charge in 1998 will be $10 for all firearms belonging 
to the same person, without restriction, provided they are all 
registered at the same time. Starting January 1, 2001, the fee will 
be $18.
<P>
	This is a great victory for all hunters, trappers, collectors and 
sports enthusiasts in Canada and Quebec. There was a great deal of 
insecurity and ambiguity in this area. Now, with these regulations, 
we know that the minister made a wise decision. But this is not the 
only victory we have won for these hunters, these trappers, these 
collectors, these sports enthusiasts, with respect to the regulations.
<P>
	The government is bowing to our demand for recognition of the 
Quebec and even Manitoba firearms handling certificates and 
courses for provinces with such courses and certification. This is a 
very considerable gain because, here again, there was no certainty. 
We made these gains through the Bloc Quebecois' perseverance 
and insistent questioning.
<P>
<B>(1530)</B>
<P>
	The regulations will apply equally to all, both aboriginal and 
non-aboriginal citizens. Public safety makes no distinction, and 
there was no need to make a distinction in the regulations. I am 
glad this was changed.
<P>
	Sustenance hunters and trappers, both aboriginal and 
non-aboriginal, will have to obtain a licence and register their 
firearms but will be exempted from registration and licensing fees. 
The safety objective has been achieved, but there is also a 
recognition of the rights of sustenance hunters and trappers-both 
aboriginal and non-aboriginal-in the way registration is handled. 
We insisted on this point, and we got what we wanted.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois will remain vigilant in its analysis of the 
regulations as regards the storage, display, handling, 
transportation, possession and sale of firearms, to ensure the 
regulations are fair, applicable and, whenever possible, reflect local 
circumstances.
<P>
	However, there are not just positive points in this ministerial 
statement. There are also negative elements. I feel I must point out 
certain discrepancies between what the Minister of Justice said in 
his statement this afternoon and his government's throne speech.
<P>
	In the throne speech, there was talk of flexibility, withdrawal 
from areas under provincial jurisdiction, and the federal 
government showing some understanding of the powers of the 
provinces. Today, in his statement, the minister made it clear that in 
this respect at least, the throne speech was meaningless, because 
the minister has unilaterally taken on the responsibilities of the 
legislatures of Alberta, Manitoba, Saskatchewan and the two 
territories which refuse to accept the legislation on gun control.
<P>
	On the other hand, I deplore the refusal of these provinces and 
territories to implement the legislation, but I cannot tolerate that 
our federal big brother should style himself the great protector of 
the citizenry, at the expense of the legislatures.
<P>
	In fact, gun control comes under the administration of justice 
and is therefore exclusively a matter of provincial jurisdiction. The 
federal government has no business taking on this constitutional 
authority which belongs to the provinces. I urge the government to 
keep its word, respect its own Constitution and initiate discussions 
with the provinces and convince them to act responsibly.
<P>
	Furthermore, there is some ambiguity as to how the federal 
government will apply the regulations with respect to costs. Will 
this be one more instance where Quebec is disadvantaged because 
it immediately agreed to implement the regulations with respect to 
costs? Quebec will pay the initial administration cost for its own 
territory. Am I to understand that, as a result of the federal 
government's action vis-à-vis the provinces which refuse to 
implement the gun control legislation, Quebec and the other 
provinces which were willing to implement the legislation will be 
charged part of these administration costs a second time? I wonder.
<P>
	The minister will have to answer these questions in the course of 
our analysis of the regulations. Instead of taking on powers that are 
not his, the minister should use his powers of persuasion to 
convince the dissenting provinces and territories.
<P>
	Quebecers may rest assured that we will stay the course on the 
regulations and the legislation. We will, of course, be guided by a 
concern for public safety, common sense, fairness and respect for 
regional differences. We will be extremely vigilant.
<P>
	In concluding, I would like to announce to the House that my 
colleague from Portneuf will take part in the consideration in 
committee of these regulations. I am confident he will be as 
vigilant as the caucus has always been.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we finally 
have the regulations. They were tabled once, they were withdrawn 
and now they are back.
<P>
<B>(1535 )</B>
<P>
	I will pick up on the comments the justice minister made with 
regard to his shock and alarm over the provinces that are opposing 
the bill and refusing to administer various aspects of the bill. What 
I find shocking and alarming is the fact that the minister would 
bring forward a bill that he expects the provinces to  administer 
without first gaining their approval for the bill's contents, approval 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6802"> 6802 </A></B>
<P>
for their duties and responsibilities. Why did the minister not first 
gain their approval?
<P>
	The minister told this House that he was in continuous 
consultation with the attorneys general of the provinces. Yet when 
three of them appeared before the standing committee, they told us 
there was minimal consultation. That is an explanation as to why he 
is now in this position.
<P>
	The aboriginal justice minister from the Northwest Territories 
appeared before the committee. He told us very clearly that it was 
impractical to enforce the FAC requirements because there is no 
access to facilities to get things, such as passport photos, which are 
required to obtain an FAC. Therefore that regulation was not being 
abided by.
<P>
	The minister speaks about gun control. This is not gun control. 
This is the registration of firearms. There is no one in this country 
who is not in support of reasonable, common sense control of 
firearms. In fact, we hear this expressed all across the country. The 
fact of the matter is the bill does not do that. There are portions of 
Kim Campbell's Bill C-17 that are not being enforced or at least if 
they are, they are not protecting people's lives.
<P>
	The examples the justice minister gave of the incident in B.C. 
and the incident in Winnipeg have nothing whatever to do with this 
bill. They have to do with safe storage which was contained in Bill 
C-17.
<P>
	Neither the justice minister nor the member from the Bloc nor 
anyone from the government has explained how the registration of 
a rifle or a shotgun is going to reduce the criminal use of firearms. 
We asked the police chiefs and the representatives of the Canadian 
Police Association how this is to be done. None of them could tell 
us how this was going to be done. In fact, one of the criminologists 
who appeared before the committee said that we would not see any 
results from this bill in terms of safety for 15 years. Is that not 
wonderful. And this is being touted as a safe tool by the justice 
minister.
<P>
	The minister is in the grip of the coalition for gun control. He is 
in the grip of those who would support a lack of common sense in 
the expression of legislation.
<P>
	The justice minister claims the majority of Canadians support 
this bill. If that is the case, then why is that in the last three 
provincial elections, those in Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Ontario, 
all three parties which made this the central issue in their 
campaigns and opposed the registration and licensing portion of the 
bill returned to power? In fact in Ontario it was the third place party 
that formed the government.
<P>
	Do not give us this nonsense that the bill has a high percentage of 
support. The best poll we can have is an open election wherein the 
matter is an issue and the people have an opportunity to vote on it.
<P>
	We have what may be a constitutional crisis. It is certainly a 
crisis in federal-provincial relations because the minister failed in 
his duty and responsibility to consult with the elected 
representatives of all the provinces and the territories in order to 
gain their support. He did not gain their support. He ploughed on 
with a piece of legislation that they are not prepared to support. The 
people of those provinces are not prepared to support it as well.
<P>
<B>(1540)</B>
<P>
	Politicians are not foolish. They are not going to oppose 
something that has 75 per cent or 80 per cent support of the people. 
They are not going to oppose it as the justice minister would 
suggest. This is nonsense. There is not a single individual I know 
who will buck the safe, proper and wise control of firearms. This is 
not control of firearms. This bill is simply an imposition upon the 
law-abiding people of society who happen to own, collect or use 
firearms in recreational activities. This bill is directed at them.
<P>
	There are other matters. What about the smuggling problem? 
The MacKenzie Institute submitted a report indicating that if the 
bill went through there would be an explosion of smuggling into 
this country. What has the justice minister done about the 
smuggling problem? What actions has he taken and what are the 
results of those actions? We have heard nothing from the justice 
minister on that issue.
<P>
	The government talks about making society safer yet it 
introduces bills like Bill C-41 which allows violent offenders 
access to alternative measures. It invites the courts to use matters 
such as conditional sentences where violent offenders do not see 
the inside of a prison after committing rapes and other serious 
personal attacks upon individuals.
<P>
	We saw where the minister stood in relation to section 745 of the 
Criminal Code. We saw whom he voted for. Did he vote for the 
safety of society or the safety of individuals? Did he vote against 
putting people like Debbie Mahaffy and other victims of crime 
through hell one more time? No, he did not. No, he did not. He 
voted in favour of the criminal. Certainly he did.
<P>
	When we look at what the minister has done with what he calls 
gun control legislation, I am concerned about certain aspects of his 
exemption. He says now that sustenance hunters will be exempted. 
What does that mean? Does it mean only aboriginal people can 
hunt all year round, or does it mean anybody? If that is the case, 
then how do we interpret Assistant Deputy Minister Mosley's 
comments to the Senate committee when he said that the 
regulations cannot exempt anyone from the bill? How do we 
explain that? He said that the regulations cannot override the 
contents of the bill which requires all Canadians to register their 
firearms.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6803"> 6803 </A></B>
<P>
	I wonder if the justice minister is now taking on the additional 
responsibility of administering these regulations and the act in the 
three provinces and two territories. What is the additional cost 
going to be? That was not contained in the proclamation that 
attended as he tabled the bill. How much is the cost going to be? 
How much is it going to cost the federal government to fill the 
role of administering this bill in the three provinces and the two 
territories as he said today he would do? What is the cost going 
to be?
<P>
	Would that money not be better used in other areas? There is no 
question in the minds of thousands of Canadians that it would be. 
We need to strengthen our police forces. We need to strengthen the 
law enforcement agencies and place more of their members on the 
street to protect our society from the kinds of people that the 
minister's Bill C-41 allows to walk free after committing very 
personal and serious crimes against individuals.
<P>
	I listened to my Bloc colleague talk about a bill which he does 
not seem to know very much about. Under section 103 or 104 at 
least there is the appearance of an imposition or encroachment 
upon the provincial jurisdiction to enforce the Criminal Code or at 
least enforce this bill. The onus is still on the justice minister and 
the government to tell all Canadians, gun owners and non-gun 
owners, how the registration of a rifle and shotgun is going to 
reduce the criminal use of those firearms.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	The government has not told us. We have asked them repeatedly. 
The gun coalition could not do it, the chiefs of police could not do 
it. When talking to frontline police officers they will tell you they 
are the ones who have to knock on the doors and answer 
complaints. They are the ones who will tell you whether this bill is 
going to be of benefit to them. We have talked to them and they 
have told us why in their opinion this is a bunch of nonsense. That 
is different from their chiefs. We got their answers, we heard what 
they had to say.
<P>
	My time is up. We will examine these regulations in depth. 
Again we wonder why the justice minister had to pull the 
regulations back in June. The stories we have heard is the minister 
pulled them back because he got trampled in a stampede by his own 
backbenchers when they had a look at them. We will see whether 
there is another stampede coming from his backbenchers.
<P>
	I do know this, in the next election there will be a stampede and 
it is going to be over some of the Liberal backbenchers who have 
fought hard to have common sense entered into this bill. I hope all 
hon. members and the people of this country will take a serious 
look at these regulations.

<P>
briefly on behalf of the NDP with respect to the minister's 
statement on regulations tabled in the House earlier.
<P>
	The government and the Minister of Justice will recall very 
clearly that when this legislation was introduced it was not 
supported by the vast majority of law enforcement agencies to 
which he refers. In fact the legislation that has given birth to these 
regulations was something that in my view and in the view of many 
Canadians was not a direct or a very positive response to dealing 
with the rising amount of crime in Canada but in fact was a feel 
good piece of legislation, something that the Liberals are very 
famous for in this country.
<P>
	I want to draw a comparison. Members will recall and so will 
other Canadians when a great deal of smuggling of tobacco from 
the U.S.A. was going on, rather than deal directly with increasing 
resources to support our customs officers and to enforce laws 
which existed to stop smuggling, the Liberals passed feel good 
legislation which reduced the tax on tobacco to eliminate the 
smuggling. While that eliminated the smuggling of tobacco in 
Quebec and Ontario it cost the taxpayers of Canada $2 billion. The 
smugglers turned to smuggling firearms and other items.
<P>
	The Liberals responded to the increase in the smuggling of 
firearms not by providing resources and money for enforcement so 
that smugglers could be stopped but by passing yet another piece of 
feel good legislation which does not solve the problem.
<P>
	I say that because when the legislation which has given birth to 
the regulations was before the House, I spoke to many police 
officers, the chief of police and others in Regina and they said that 
they would prefer, if they had an option, to have more resources 
committed to enforcement.
<P>
	Many of these police officers also said that the problem would 
not necessarily be cleared up by more money thrown at 
enforcement. It would help a great deal but what needed to be 
looked at is what the NDP has been saying all along and that is the 
roots of the increase in crime are unemployment and poverty. The 
other thing that is driving crime are the great inequities in our 
society.
<P>
	Rather than address these inequities and try to beef up initiatives 
to eliminate poverty, especially child poverty, to create more jobs, 
to create more equality in society, the government has done the 
opposite. We can recall in the last few budgets cuts to health care, 
cuts to education, cuts to all kinds of transfer payments to 
provinces. We have seen as well a knee-jerk reaction with respect 
to these regulations, tax increases for working and middle class 
Canadian families, yet huge tax cuts for the very wealthy.
<P>
	I remind members of Bill S-9 which provides wealthy Canadians 
with tax deductions for making contributions to American 
universities while the government cuts funding for our own 
universities.
<P>
	With respect to these regulations, these are again feel good 
efforts on behalf of the government. They are not dealing with the 
real problems in our society.
<P>
	There were a number of questions that we wanted to ask the 
government that it would not answer today. Why did the federal 
government and Minister of Justice not consult with all of the 
attorneys general with respect to some of the implications of the 
act? If the minister did consult, why did he not take some of the 
advice of three or four of them who are quite concerned about it?
<P>
	Our view is that this bill and these regulations will not control 
guns but will increase the red tape and bureaucracy of law 
enforcement agencies. It will initiate a massive registration 
program that will not be effective because if it was such an 
effective tool, why is the government waiting three to five years to 
register all the guns in the country? I cannot see why these sorts of 
things are that pertinent at this time.
<P>
	I will summarize by saying that this regulation initiative on 
behalf of the government is a knee jerk reaction, it is feel good 
legislation that does nothing to address the roots of crime in this 
country and that is good government.

	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I believe it is ironic that the 
regulations for the new firearms act were tabled  today because the 
question 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6806"> 6806 </A></B>
<P>
that I have had on the Order Paper for exactly one year concerns 
that very matter.
<P>
	On November 27, 1995, I placed Question No. 252 on the Order 
Paper and, in accordance with Standing Order 39(5)(a), I requested 
an answer within 45 days.
<P>
	After 71 days Question No. 252 died on the Order Paper when 
the government prorogued the House.
<P>
	I placed the same question on the Order Paper again when the 
new session opened on February 27, 1996. It was renumbered as 
Question No. 4. Once again I asked for a response from the 
government within 45 days. As of today Question No. 4 has been 
outstanding for 274 days. The question has been on the Order Paper 
for one year.
<P>
	Why is it so imperative that we have an answer? The firearms 
regulations have been tabled. The government is pretending that 
they are a matter of public safety. The question that I asked was 
fundamental to that. It is Question No. 4 on the Order Paper. 
Anybody can look at it. It wants to get from the government 
information with regard to stolen firearms from the police and from 
the military. It is really fundamental to all that we are discussing 
here.
<P>
	If they cannot safely store their firearms, if they are at risk 
because criminals know where to access those firearms, the very 
regulations which the minister is putting forth now will create that 
same situation but nationwide. Criminals will then know where to 
access those firearms. If we as common citizens place that 
information in the public domain, how can we possibly store them 
any better than the police or the military? That is why my question 
is so important.
<P>
	In a democracy, in government as we have it in Canada today, if 
that information is not readily available and accurate for the public 
to examine, how can we possibly put forth laws which will improve 
public safety? How do we know those are the best laws we can have 
in this country?
<P>
	That is why it is so imperative that I get an answer to my 
question. It is not a complicated question. I realize that my 
frustration shows by the fact that I cannot get an answer. We have 
to have open and accountable government. That is why I am asking 
for the government, as quickly as possible, to answer that question. 
I would even settle for a partial answer. I have appealed to the 
government to give me any information it has on this matter.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Zed (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the comments which have been made by my hon. 
colleague, but oftentimes when members put questions they think 
that we can press a button and give them an answer.
<P>
	Since the hon. member has raised this matter a number of times, 
it is important that I spend a bit of  House time to review exactly 
what he has asked for and draw his attention to the fact that the 
question he has put, as he created the question, is very broad. In 
fact, it is so broad that it is taking, I would suggest, probably 
hundreds of hours of work by civil servants throughout the country 
to collect the information he has asked for. It is not that he should 
not want to get the information. I do not impugn his motives.
<P>
<B>(1605 )</B>
<P>
	I know the hon. member has expressed an interest in receiving 
the information, but when one looks at the broadness of the 
question it asks not only about the information being stolen from 
the RCMP but also from provincial police forces, municipal police 
forces, individual police forces and military establishments. One 
can see very quickly that it is such a broad question that the answer 
obviously has to be as comprehensive. I would suggest that it is 
going to cost literally thousands and thousands of dollars to get this 
information.
<P>
	I am happy to hear for the first time my hon. colleague suggest 
that he acknowledges that this is a very broad question and that 
maybe he would like some partial information or a bit of 
information that might be available based on the breadth of his 
question. On that basis I would be happy to see if there is a 
possibility of getting some information.
<P>
	While I am on my feet, the other question the member referred to 
is Question No. 52. I am also happy to hear that he is interested in 
some partial information. However, I would draw his attention to 
the fact that Question No. 52 asks to go back 10 years. 
Unfortunately, that information, as my hon. colleague would know, 
is not readily available. There is no computerized compilation of 
that kind of information.
<P>
	Therefore while I understand his frustration, I think he should 
also appreciate the cost of getting this information and the 
hundreds of hours of civil servant time involved. Perhaps if he 
would craft his question a little differently we would be able to 
accommodate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> Mr. Speaker, the member 
knows this information should have been in the public domain and 
the government should have had this information before it even 
brought the legislation. It begs the question whether it is costing 
thousands and then could save millions because it could save us 
millions if we had this information. I really think the minister 
should seriously reconsider the argument he is putting forth.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be 
quick. I do not understand. If the question is simply to institutions 
of this country such as police forces and the military, why is this 
information not available after almost a year? The question 
obviously to the government member is has the request gone 
forward to these institutions. If it has and there is some problem, 
that is a 
<P>

<B><A NAME="6807"> 6807 </A></B>
<P>
justification. However, if they have not made that request  then 
there is no justification for the delay and there is a dereliction of 
duty here.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Zed:</B> Mr. Speaker, I ask that all questions be allowed to 
stand.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is it agreed?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="JUDGESACT">JUDGES ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed from November 20 consideration of the 
motion in relation to the amendments made by the Senate to Bill 
C-42, an act to amend the Judges Act and to make consequential 
amendments to another act.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this bill was 
brought forward by the government as a very simple and 
straightforward bill, a bill that we were advised was housekeeping 
and a kind of innocuous bill. However, the more we look at it and 
the more I hear about it from people trained in the legal field, the 
more concern I have about it.
<P>
	Some of the concerns I have are of course justified by what the 
justice minister has said.
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	I would just like to quote what the justice minister told the 
Senate committee when he appeared before that committee earlier 
this year: ``There is no provision in the Judges Act for a federally 
appointed judge such as Madam Justice Arbour to be granted a 
leave of absence without pay to work for an international 
organization such as the UN. Nor does the act permit the salary and 
expenses of a judge during a period of leave to be paid by any 
organization or entity other than the Government of Canada or, in 
the case of expenses, by the government of a province.
<P>
	``The amendments to the bill now before this committee have the 
full support of the Chief Justice of Canada and the Canadian 
Judicial Council. They would permit this type of arrangement to be 
entered into by Madam Justice Arbour and, in exception cases, by 
other judges. The provision contained in the bill's proposed new 
section 56.1 would be a narrow exception to the  general 
prohibition set out in section 55 of the Judges Act against the judge 
engaging in any occupation or business other than her or his 
judicial duty''.
<P>
	If that is accurate, if the purpose of section 56.1 would be a 
narrow exception to the general prohibition set out in section 55 of 
the existing Judges Act against any judge engaging in any 
occupation or business other than her or his judicial business, it 
seems very clear that this act should have been passed before Judge 
Arbour accepted the appointment to her position with the UN on 
August 1.
<P>
	What is the situation today? This bill went before the Senate and 
it came back with an amendment that I have some concerns about 
and which I will be offering an amendment to.
<P>
	The question is very clear and of great concern. Is Judge Arbour 
now in violation of section 55 of the Judges Act? If she is not, what 
is the purpose of this particular amendment, section 56.1, which 
would exempt her from section 55, which creates a prohibition for 
her or other judges to accept employment in any other form?
<P>
	We now have an Ontario federal court justice who has now 
accepted a position with the UN, a prestigious position, there is no 
question. However, there are at least three learned individuals who 
have expressed concerns about Bill C-42. Professor Morton 
appeared before the committee. In another debate on another 
amendment to the bill, I spoke to the comments he made before the 
committee. Professor Russell and Professor Manfredi also 
expressed grave concerns about the legality of what is happening 
here.
<P>
	I am not going to belabour the House at this time on this bill. I 
am simply going to move the following motion:
<P>
<B>(1615 )</B>
<P>
	I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the motion be amended by deleting all the words after the word ``that'' and 
substituting the following therefor: ``a Message be sent to the Senate to acquaint

	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The motion has just been handed to the 
Chair. If the hon. member will give the Chair a little time to rule on 
whether it is receivable, I will get back to him as soon as it can be 
done.
<P>
	Resuming debate, the hon. member for St. Albert.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak to the amendment to the motion that has been put 
forward by my colleague from Crowfoot.
<P>
	We have talked about this particular motion before, which is in 
essence a message from the Senate that it does not feel comfortable 
with Bill C-42 as passed in this House and sent over to it back in 
June of this year.
<P>
	The Senate had serious concerns with several sections of the act. 
The government amended the act in the Senate. It was not the 
deliberations within the Senate which led to the amendments. The 
government realized that the bill was in trouble in the Senate and 
put forth these amendments in the other place. The government 
realized that the bill was in trouble in the other place-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The amendment has not yet been ruled 
receivable. Accordingly, since the hon. member for St. Albert has 
spoken to the main motion, the only solution the Chair can see is to 
permit the member to speak on the understanding that shortly we 
will have a ruling that the motion is receivable, as long as all 
members understand what is happening.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> I am speaking to the amendment, Mr. Speaker. 
We did ask the Clerk if he felt that the amendment was in order and 
he gave an initial presumption that it appeared superficially to be in 
order. I hope that once there has been a chance to read it in detail 
that it is found that the motion is in order. Therefore I am speaking 
to the amendment that has been tabled by my colleague from 
Crowfoot.
<P>
	As I was saying, Bill C-42 which was passed in this House and 
referred to the other place ran into serious opposition in the other 
place. The government realized that it had serious problems in the 
other place and therefore put forth the amendment we are now 
talking on today which the other place has sent back to us for our 
consideration.
<P>
	Not only did the bill run into serious opposition in the other 
place but the government realized it was somewhat out on a limb, if 
I may use that terminology. The government wanted to legitimize 
the appointment of Madam Justice Arbour to the position of 
prosecutor working in The Hague for the United Nations. Of course  
as we know, the Judges Act as it stands today does not allow for 
that, yet she is over there. Therefore the government wants to get 
this through as quickly as possible to save the embarrassment of 
her being, if I may euphemistically say, in legal limbo. I think one 
could actually argue it is far beyond legal limbo, but let us stay 
there at the moment.
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
	I refer to my speech of last week. I talked about the preamble, 
the perception of conflict of interest and the perception of 
impartiality being compromised. My remarks of last week stand 
regarding the preamble.
<P>
	Dealing with the amendments proposed in the message we 
received from the other place which has been amended by my hon. 
colleague from Crowfoot, I do want to speak to these and several 
issues.
<P>
	The first one deals with the amendment to the act which would 
allow Madam Justice Arbour to apply for a leave of absence 
without term. It is an open-ended authorization. She could be gone 
for five years, she could be gone for ten years or she need not even 
come back. There is no requirement for her to come back in this 
authorization. It is an absolutely open-ended authorization for her 
to apply for a leave of absence without term.
<P>
	Section 99(1) of the Constitution states that Parliament and only 
Parliament has the authority to remove people from the bench. That 
has been put right into our Constitution. It is not part of the Judges 
Act, it is part of our Constitution. It says that only Parliament can 
remove someone from the bench. We almost had to deliberate on 
that particular situation two or three months ago.
<P>
	The reason that only Parliament and not the government can 
remove a judge from the bench is written in the Constitution is that 
we want to ensure there is absolutely no opportunity for 
government interference in the judiciary. That is a clear and simple 
fact which has been around as long as Canada has been around: the 
government cannot interfere with the judiciary.
<P>
	The amendment by the other place gives a specific exemption to 
a specific member of the bench for her to apply for an open-ended 
leave of absence that theoretically does not require her to return to 
the bench. My point is: If the government approves that leave of 
absence, has the government removed Madam Justice Louise 
Arbour from the bench which is the prerogative of Parliament and 
no one else? That is why we amended the motion to make that leave 
of absence term certain. We said that it is not to exceed three years.
<P>
	The testimony that I read before the committee of the other place 
suggested that she be gone for about two years. We have given 
ample time for her to return yet we have made the leave of absence 
term certain. This  government cannot understand that we want to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6809"> 6809 </A></B>
<P>
ensure the government cannot, should not and does not interfere 
with the impartiality, integrity and the independence of the 
judiciary.
<P>
	We have said that if this has to be-and we do not like that it has 
gone this way, and I have argued this before in this House-but if it 
has to go this way, then surely they should do their homework 
properly and put in a term certain. Then we can be assured that 
Madam Justice Louise Arbour will return to the bench and that 
Parliament's prerogative, that which is only given to Parliament, is 
preserved. Parliament and Parliament alone has the right to remove 
people from the bench. It does not rest with the Minister of Justice 
who could grant this leave of absence and then prevent her from 
returning which would usurp Parliament's roles and 
responsibilities.
<P>
	On the second one, we know that this legislation was drafted in a 
rush. When legislation is drafted in a rush, we usually end up with 
bad legislation. This was bad legislation right from the beginning. I 
have talked about that before. Then when they had to come up with 
an amendment in a hurry, I think it also was poorly drafted.
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
	To briefly go through the amendment which has been referred to 
us by the other House, the first paragraph gives the judge 
authorization to apply for a leave of absence. The second one gives 
her the right to moving expenses. The third one says that if she 
accepts the appointment she will not get paid. The fourth one deals 
with her pension benefits and so on.
<P>
	When we look at the text of the second paragraph which deals 
with moving expenses, we find that it is poorly worded. It says that 
she is entitled to moving expenses regardless of the situation. I 
would have thought that she would only be entitled to moving 
expenses if she elected to take a leave of absence. If she does not 
elect to take a leave of absence, then surely she would not be 
entitled to moving expenses. However, the clause is drafted to say 
that she is entitled to moving expenses. I do not know where she is 
going if she does not take a leave of absence, but she is entitled to 
moving expenses whether or not she takes a leave of absence. That 
is a poorly drafted clause which requires amendment.
<P>
	It is simple. When things are done in a rush they can be done 
wrong. The government has to look carefully at the amendment 
which has been put forward.
<P>
	The amendment deals with the fact that if she takes a leave of 
absence to work for the United Nations, she is not entitled to be 
paid by the Government of Canada. The Minister of Justice has told 
us that the UN must give an appearance of impartiality, integrity 
and independence from any country, because she will be working 
on behalf of all countries, for all of humanity. I would go along 
with that. However, if she takes the  appointment she cannot be 
paid by the Government of Canada and she must be paid by the 
United Nations.
<P>
	The minister has said that the Judges Act requires that she be 
paid by the Government of Canada. He is asking for a special 
exemption for Madam Justice Louise Arbour in order for her to be 
paid by someone else, presumably by the United Nations.
<P>
	Section 57 of the Judges Act deals specifically with the fact that 
only the Government of Canada can pay judges on the bench. 
Section 56 has been amended to grant a special exemption which 
will allow her to be paid by someone else, but section 57 says that 
she cannot be paid by someone else. There is a conflict. I am sure 
the minister thought that it was drafted well enough to allow 
Madam Justice Louise Arbour not to be paid by the Government of 
Canada but to be paid by someone else; however, we must 
remember that section 57 was written long before anyone 
contemplated a specific exemption being allowed for one specific 
member of the bench.
<P>
	I have argued against that, but nonetheless the government has 
pursued and insisted that this motion go forward. If we are going to 
be dragged into this against our will, then surely the government 
should write the legislation properly. That is why we have said 
``notwithstanding any prohibition against accepting any salary, fee, 
remuneration or other emolument described in section 57'' she is 
entitled to be paid under section 56.1(3).
<P>
	We on this side are doing the minister's work by cleaning up his 
legislation when in fact we do not even agree with his intent. 
However, if we are going to be dragged into it, then surely it should 
be done right.
<P>
	We are dealing with members of the bench. We are dealing with 
people of integrity. We are dealing with people whose integrity has 
been compromised, in my opinion, by the minister. We are dealing 
with people whose integrity should be beyond question, whose 
independence should be beyond question. I am quite comfortable 
with the fact that these people exercise great diligence in ensuring 
that they are not compromised in any way and lo and behold the 
minister has stepped right in and muddied the waters to a great 
degree.
<P>
<B>(1630 )</B>
<P>
	The last amendment moved by my hon. colleague is that under 
section 56.1(5) the benefits payable under these sections will 
commence to be paid at the expiration of the leave of absence 
without pay. This gets back to my earlier point. She is gone and we 
do not know when she is coming back. Perhaps she is gone until 
retirement. Perhaps she is gone with no intention of returning. We 
have no idea when she will return or if she will return. Can she 
return? Does she have any desire to return? We do not know.
<P>
	My hon. colleague has said that until we know that point, 
perhaps any benefits that are payable to her  through her service on 
the bench here, or to other members of the bench, should be held in 
abeyance until she returns. The amendment he put forward is 
reasonable but it may be a little too draconian. That is why I 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6810"> 6810 </A></B>
<P>
suggest we make an amendment to the amendment by my 
colleague from Crowfoot.
<P>
	I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the amendment be amended by deleting all the words after and including the 
words ``and that the following words be added to section 56.1(5)''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The amendment of the hon. member for 
Crowfoot has been found to be receivable, and the Chair so rules. 
The subamendment will have to go through the same rigorous 
process and the Chair will rule as quickly as possible.
<P>
	Debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order. You have ruled 
that the amendment by my hon. colleague from Crowfoot is in 
order. My subamendment is strictly to delete the last paragraph of 
the member for Crowfoot's amendment. Therefore I would expect 
the Chair to find the subamendment in order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kilger:</B> Mr. Speaker, would members consider suspending 
the House, if the Chair so desires, while the ruling is made on the 
subamendment? The understanding is that there are no other 
speakers on this matter, because we are prepared for the question. 
You asked for debate and no one rose.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I appreciate the courtesy members are 
extending. The subamendment is receivable and therefore that 
issue is dispensed with. Is there further debate?
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (North Vancouver):</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of 
order. I have an inquiry. Questions and comments zoomed by there. 
I was going to get up and ask a question of the member. Did I miss 
the opportunity to do that?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> This is Wednesday afternoon indeed. 
There is a questions and answers period and the Chair omitted 
them. I thank the hon. member for North Vancouver who has the 
right to ask questions or comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, thank 
you. I listened carefully to the speech of the hon. member. I have a 
couple of questions based on things that happened in the 
discussions during question period in the House on this issue over 
the last couple of days.
<P>
	I remember that the member was accused of being meanspirited 
a number of times in the House over the issue of the appointment of 
the judge.
<P>
<B>(1635 )</B>
<P>
	Therefore I would really like to ask the member whether he can 
really answer that charge and explain why he is not meanspirited in 
this particular case. I would  also like to ask him why he is 
concerned about the impartiality of this judge when she comes 
back, if she does, to the country.
<P>
	Finally, in fairness to the government, does the member feel that 
its motives are well intentioned or does he feel there is really 
something more behind this?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I might indicate to the House that we are 
not to impute motives. We are not to get into questions of motives 
in the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am glad you have pointed out that 
we do not get into motives, because the member for North 
Vancouver is perfectly correct when he quoted the Minister of 
Justice. Perhaps that was imputing motives but we will let that go 
by because, as you know, I am not that kind of person.
<P>
	However, the point is while the accusations may have been made 
in this House, the reason I have objected to this particular bill and 
to the amendments that have come back from the other House has 
nothing to do with being meanspirited or being motivated by 
anything other than upholding the independence and integrity of 
the judicial system and the bench.
<P>
	We have, unfortunately, a situation where an individual 
exception to the law has been granted to one particular judge. I 
have argued in the House that the particular exception should be 
introduced by way of a private bill rather than a public bill. I feel 
the Minister of Justice has used the rules of this House in such a 
way that we have less scrutiny in this particular private business 
than more scrutiny on this particular piece of private business.
<P>
	There was a quote by a previous speaker, which I cannot give off 
the top of my head, but he said that the reason we have private bills 
in this House is to ensure that they receive more vigorous scrutiny 
because they are exceptions to the rules than what public bills 
receive because they are a matter of public policy. Private business 
should require even more scrutiny.
<P>
	This exemption to the act for one particular person went through 
here as a public bill, went over to the other House and has been 
returned with amendments from the other House. It is now back 
here as a private bill, in essence as a hybrid public-private bill, 
which is disallowed by the rules of this House. We have even seen 
the rules of this House being used to the advantage of the Minister 
of Justice rather than to the advantage of all members of this House 
so that we can provide even more vigorous scrutiny to the 
exemption being granted.
<P>
	As far as the impartiality of the bench, I take great exception to 
the way it is being used and abused. We now have a member of our 
bench who is supposed to be impartial. I have not question 
whatsoever about her integrity, but she is now going to be a 
prosecutor and is no longer sitting in judgment. She is taking sides.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6811"> 6811 </A></B>
<P>
	Can one imagine the hypocrisy of a situation where the United 
Nations came back to Canada and reached into our bench and said 
it would like to have this judge on the defence? We have two 
members of the bench from Canada, one prosecuting and one 
defending war criminals in The Hague. How ludicrous, how partial 
and how totally unindependent that would be. Yet half of that 
transaction is what is being contemplated, approved and passed 
in this House.
<P>
	If it is ludicrous to have a member of the defence and 
prosecution working on these cases in the United Nations then 
surely it is just as ludicrous to have one member of the bench on the 
prosecutor's side.
<P>
	I will also come back to the last point the member made. We are 
dealing with crimes against humanity. We are dealing with horrific 
crimes that were committed in Bosnia, the former Yugoslavia and 
Rwanda. In the news today are the hundreds of thousands of people 
who are starving and the hundreds who are being slaughtered, 
massacred every day. These are crimes of great human tragedy no 
matter where they happen in the world.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	Is a member of the Canadian bench the only person in the world 
who can act as a prosecutor? Is that the only person who could be 
found to uphold justice in the world, who can act as a prosecutor 
against these crimes? I ask that question. I do not in any way take 
away from the seriousness of these crimes and the fact that the 
criminals must be prosecuted. However, I seriously do question if 
she is the only person who could be found to do the job. That is the 
point I wanted to make.
<P>
	Finally, I presume she will return to the bench. Remember she 
and she alone has been granted special dispensation by the 
Government of Canada. She has to decide on a case that involves 
the Government of Canada against someone else.
<P>
	The defence counsel could will ask: ``Madam Justice Louise 
Arbour, how can you be independent here when you are deciding 
between the Government of Canada as the defendant and someone 
else and you have been granted special dispensation by the 
government?'' The appearance of impartiality, of integrity, of 
independence goes right out the window. That is an important 
principle which is being seriously undermined and eroded, aided 
and abetted by the Minister of Justice.
<P>
	I find that repulsive and quite odious. I certainly hope the 
Minister of Justice will see the sense of the whole thing and 
withdraw this concurrence.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I find it rather odd that the Reform Party has latched onto 
such a question. I would consider it an honour for all Canadians to 
be represented abroad by a  fellow Canadian. You might find this 
particularly odd out of the mouth of a Bloc member, but it is true.
<P>
	It is deplorable that the Reform Party has latched onto such a 
case as this to make political hay, to make the newspapers, or for 
whatever reason, and is using every means possible to put other 
cases before the House of Commons, when the matter could be 
resolved once and for all with Bill C-42.
<P>
	I have already spoken to Bill C-42 and criticized the work done 
by the Senate on certain amendments. I criticized the Senate's 
meddling in a matter of this sort and its forcing the House to some 
extent to decide on each case individually, to come back with a 
specific bill for each judge wishing to do any sort of work 
internationally.
<P>
	The Reformers are doing much the same thing. They introduce 
an amendment and then an amendment to an amendment. They will 
try every means to delay the work of the House on this bill, whose 
objective is clear: to permit judges with the experience or certain 
abilities, who have a vision of things international, to provide 
assistance, as other countries are entitled to expect from Canada, 
from a democratic country with a lot of experienced judges.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	It is Justice Arbour in this case, but it could be Justice 
Bellehumeur or any other judge looking for an opportunity to fulfil 
a specific international mandate. All kinds of reasons are being put 
forward to delay passage of this bill. They are going to great 
lengths to deter judges who might want to fulfil specific 
international functions.
<P>
	We have before us a Reform amendment adding yet more 
requirements. The Reform Party wants to make it quite clear that 
Canada will not pay moving, transport and other costs, although 
this is already provided for in Bill C-42.
<P>
	Section 56.1, as proposed in Bill C-42, gives the government 
discretion. Of course, I am not 100 per cent behind everything the 
people across the way do, but we must realize that voters have 
given the Liberal government opposite a mandate to manage public 
funds. We must at least trust our friends in this regard. There is a 
time to condemn, but there are times also when we must realize 
that it is pointless to protest, and I think this is a case in point.
<P>
	I will take a moment to read section 56.1, so that you and the 
people listening to us can see the risk of going too far in making 
changes and waging procedural battles in the House for the sake of 
it.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6812"> 6812 </A></B>
<P>
	Section 56.1 states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(1) Notwithstanding section 55, a judge may, with the authorization of the 
Government of Canada, participate in international activities or international technical 
assistance  programs or in the work of an international organization of states or an 
institution of such an organization, and may, if the participation is so authorized, 
receive moving or transportation expenses and reasonable travel and other expenses 
either from the Government of Canada or from an international organization or an 
institution of such an organization.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Could it be any clearer? The government may provide financial 
assistance at the time of approving participation. Take Justice 
Arbour for example. Upon receiving a request from her, the 
government may authorize Justice Arbour to participate in 
international activities and specify in this authorization that it will 
be up to the judge to have her expenses reimbursed either by the 
UN, or whatever organization hires her, or by Canada. Canada can 
contribute by paying these costs.
<P>
	At present, Canada gives money to the UN every time it 
participates in an international aid mission. Shall we stop at paying 
a judge's moving expenses if that is the kind of contribution 
Canada wants to make? Section 56.1 very clearly provides that the 
government may, in authorizing participation, confirm with the 
international organization or an institution of such organization 
who will pay the moving and transportation expenses or any other 
expense associated with the function the judge has applied for and 
been selected.
<P>
	I cannot understand why we have a Reform amendment on this 
today. Let us stop playing this little game, for which a number of 
us, including myself, were condemning the Senate a few days ago. 
My point was that the Senate was wasting its time on insignificant 
changes. This bill had already been passed here, and moved on to 
the Senate. After great philosophical discussions, after consulting 
such eminent publications as <I>Frank</I>, a highly serious newspaper on 
which the senators based their demands for amendments, after this 
most serious work, the Senate sends us back the bill, and the 
Reform jumps on the bandwagon to call for other amendments, 
whereas they had every opportunity to question the witnesses and 
to propose amendments at the appropriate time.
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	The first time this bill came before the House, they did nothing, 
because they did not believe it was a serious bill, or so I heard in 
the House. Now, today, they realize that it is fairly significant, for 
the senators have said so-and they are such a reliable source.
<P>
	Today, amendments are being presented, and for some reason 
they are attempting to make political hay with this bill.
<P>
	I wish it to be known that we in the Bloc Quebecois are totally 
against the proposed amendment to clause 56.1(2) of Bill C-42. I 
would invite the Reform Party members to look at this bill a little 
more seriously so we can move on to something else.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was 
listening to the speech by the member. I wonder why Bloc 
members feel they can oppose this motion but at the same time they 
want to vote in favour of the bill as a whole as it went through this 
House.
<P>
	He says that a specific exemption for one person is not possible, 
and they would not want to do that, but that the bill as a whole 
seems to be in order. I wonder if he would give us a quick synopsis 
of why he would agree that the entire bill is actually in order 
compared to this amendment.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> Mr. Speaker, our position is quite clear. 
When Bill C-42 was passed, we supported the bill. We still do 
today.
<P>
	What the Bloc Quebecois, the official opposition objects to is the 
amendments made by the Senate. We said so openly, we said it in 
debate, I said so myself and I say it again today, that we should not 
even be looking at all the changes, all the amendments proposed by 
the Senate because they are not well founded, they are frivolous 
and useless. What the Senate has done hardly justifies the $42 
million or $43 million it is given annually to do a job that has 
already been done in the House.
<P>
	Today I will say again that Bill C-42 provides for all kinds of 
cases. It was not intended to deal with one specific case. The Senate 
wanted to do just that. The Reform Party is doing the same, by 
amending this bill so that every time a judge wants to take on 
international responsibilities, it would be necessary to go back to 
Parliament to pass specific legislation.
<P>
	I say this is useless. We passed Bill C-42 in this House, heard 
witnesses, worked on this bill in committee and passed it at first, 
second and third reading. We went through all the different stages. 
The Reform Party was there, and its members did not propose any 
changes.
<P>
	The legislation we adopted at the time could be applied to 
anyone, not just Judge Arbour or Justice Lamer or other judges, but 
to all judges throughout Canada and Quebec.
<P>
	The amendments before the House today are an attempt to 
narrow the scope of this bill so that it will apply only to one 
particular judge, Judge Arbour. I say that the legislator should not 
use his legislative power to pass this kind of legislation.
<P>
	That is why we are against this amendment, as we were against 
similar amendments proposed by the Senate.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened to the response given by the hon. member and I can 
understand his frustration with the Senate. Reform has long 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6813"> 6813 </A></B>
<P>
proposed an equal, elected and effective Senate. It is supposed to be 
the House of sober second thought.
<P>
	Does the member not think it is actually a good sign when the 
Senate does something? It has returned a bill to the House and 
indicated it has given consideration to it. Is that not a very 
important signal that the Senate is prepared to give sober second 
thought to something? The bill has been sent back here and the 
Senate has said: ``Take another look at this. Is this really what you 
want?''
<P>
<B>(1655 )</B>
<P>
	Does the member not think that is quite a good thing to happen?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have to say right off that the 
Bloc Quebecois and the Reform Party are a thousand leagues apart 
on this matter. They want an elected Senate with greater powers; 
we say the Senate is useless.
<P>
	We are already overgoverned in Canada. We have a federal 
government, provincial and municipal governments, school 
boards, and we could add parishes, church authorities, and that 
means even more people. Canada is overgoverned. We do not need 
a Senate, whether its members are appointed, as is now the case, or 
elected.
<P>
	Is it good to have the Senate propose amendments to a bill? I say 
that once a bill is introduced to 295 members elected to represent 
the people, broken down, studied, analyzed and discussed in 
committees where experts and witnesses of all sorts are heard and 
briefs are submitted, there is no point in a Senate-appointed or 
elected-making other changes.
<P>

<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> When this bill was last

<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier (Gaspé):</B> On a point of order, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	Before we start debate on Bill C-62, I would like some 
clarification about what happened when members were called to 
the House to vote. Our television screens showed 20 minutes 
remaining before the vote. Then the bells suddenly stopped ringing 
and the House resumed debate on Bill C-62 without giving 
members any notice. What is happening exactly? I would like to 
understand. How is this government being run?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6814"> 6814 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> Order, please. During the 
sounding of the bells, the hon. Chief Government Whip asked the 
Chair to defer the division until 5.45 p.m., which is what 
happened.
<P>
	We then resumed debate on Bill C-62 now before the House. We 
can now resume debate if an hon. member wishes to speak.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order 
concerning the extension of the sitting. The government did request 
an extension, but our Standing Orders state that such a request must 
be made during the last hour, which was not the case. I would 
appreciate it if the Chair could rule on this point.
<P>
	I brought the matter to the attention of the Table earlier and I 
thought we had an understanding with the government. It looks like 
the government attempted to destabilize us and proceed anyway. I 
would like the Chair to rule on this point. I think the government's 
request was not made in accordance with the Standing Orders of 
this House.
<P>
	I was extremely vigilant in immediately making my request to 
the Table.
<P>
<B>(1720 )</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
rise on the same point of order. I would like to concur with with 
remarks of the member who brought forward that point.
<P>
	As I understand it, a motion to extend the sitting hours can only 
occur in the last hour that the House is sitting. Government Orders 
were extended because of Statements by Ministers and that last 
hour did not occur, according to the Table, until 5.06 p.m. The 
order to extend the hours was brought in before five o'clock, which 
meant that opposition parties could not be ready for that particular 
extension or prepared to oppose the extension of hours because we 
were not in the last hour yet.
<P>
	We tried to rise on a point of order, but the bells had already 
begun to ring. I do not know how we could have protested this. 
However, I would agree with the Bloc member that the motion for 
the extension of hours was inappropriate and outside the standing 
orders, and opposition parties were not able to respond because of 
the timing of the motion.
<P>
	The motion should not have been accepted by the Chair. It was 
out of order and it should have been ruled out of order at that time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on the 
same point of order. Further to the comments made by the Reform 
Party whip, I wish to point out that I drew this matter to the 
attention of the Deputy Speaker who was in the chair at that time, 
prior to 5.06 this evening. Therefore, we recorded our objection 
prior to  the last hour even commencing. Standing Order 26(1)(b) 
was not complied with.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> Mr. Speaker, earlier, I spoke without notes. I 
had written notes and, with your permission, I will be more explicit 
in my approach.
<P>
	Pursuant to Standing Order 26(1)(<I>b</I>), the motion to extend sitting 
must be proposed in the last hour of government orders. However, 
the ministerial statement made by the Minister of Justice pushed 
everything back. The government had to table its motion after5.04 p.m. Unfortunately, it tabled it at 4.58 p.m., a few minutes 
before the end.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, you should not have allowed the government's 
motion. This is the issue on which I am asking you to rule, that is 
whether Standing Order 26(1)(<I>b</I>) was complied with. Personally, I 
come to the conclusion that the answer is no, and that you should 
not agree to the government's request to extend the sitting.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> The Chair thanks the hon. 
member for Berthier-Montcalm, the Reform Party whip and the 
hon. member for St. Albert for their interventions in respect of this 
matter.
<P>
	Standing Order 26(1) provides that except during Private 
Members' Business when the Speaker is in the chair, a member 
may propose a motion without notice to continue a sitting. I do not 
need to go into all the details. However, the motion must be 
proposed under Standing Order 26(1)(b), as the hon. member has 
pointed out, in the hour preceding the time at which the business 
under consideration should be interrupted by dinner hour, private 
members' hour or the ordinary hour of daily adjournment.
<P>
	The question that arises here is whether the motion was proposed 
within the hour prior to the ordinary hour of daily adjournment.
<P>
	As the hon. member pointed out, the proceedings today were 
extended by reason of ministerial statements. It appears that the 
motion made by the chief government whip which resulted in the 
extension of time was made six minutes before the last hour before 
the ordinary hour of daily adjournment. The motion at the time was 
accepted by the Chair and was put to the House. Fewer than the 
requisite number of members rose to object and the motion was 
deemed carried.
<P>
	In view of the fact that the matter was a procedural motion and 
that it was proposed at a time contrary to the standing orders, the 
Chair is of the view that the motion is indeed out of order and has 
not been adopted.

	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
my understanding of Standing Order 78 that the government must 
give one full day's notice of a time allocation motion. I believe that 
notice was just given a few minute's ago and here we have moved 
to the motion itself which is to limit debate to only one more day.
<P>
	I would ask the Speaker to look at that. It seems there needs to be 
a day's notice and I do not think that has been given.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont-Dundas, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
proper notice was given last Tuesday for the next sitting which 
means any future sitting so the motion is in order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Mr. Speaker, as I understand it, there needs to be one 
full day of debate on this. Could you explain this? It seems this is 
being rushed through. Time allocation is being rushed through as

they are out of line here.

	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> The Chair is ready to rule

<P>
	I draw his attention and the attention of the House to Standing 
Order 78(3)(a). The notice, as indicated by the chief government 
whip, was given last week. The motion is in accordance with the 
notice that was given and under paragraph (3)(a) in the last 
sentence:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Any proceedings interrupted pursuant to this section of this Standing Order shall

	The House was debating Bill C-62. Accordingly, the debate on 
Bill C-62 is deemed adjourned. There has been an interruption in 
the proceedings by reason of moving the motion. I now propose to 
put the motion proposed by the Minister of Labour to the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Mr. Speaker, perhaps you could inform me on

allocation?

	<B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Labour and Deputy 
Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it has been impossible to reach an agreement pursuant to 
Standing Orders 78(1), 78(2) or 78(3) regarding the proceedings on 
amendments by the Senate to Bill C-42, an act to amend the Judges 
Act and to make consequential amendments to another act.
<P>
	Pursuant to Standing Order 78(3), I give notice of my intention 
to propose a motion of time allocation at the next sitting of the 
House, for the purpose of allotting a specified number of days and 
hours for the consideration and disposal of proceedings at that 
stage.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Standing 
Order 78 calls for the introduction, if any, of a notice of time 
allocation to be given during the orders of the day. We are now in 
Private Members' Business because you have already called for 
Private Members' Business. Therefore, I think the time allocation 
notice is out of order.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="6818"> 6818 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> The hon. member for St. 
Albert has raised a point of order with respect to the validity of 
the notice given by the Minister of Labour pursuant to Standing 
Order 78(3) of the Standing Orders of the House. I would point 
out to him that the wording of the standing order says:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A Minister of the Crown who from his or her place in the House, at a previous 
sitting, has stated that an agreement could not be reached-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	There is no reference to the fact that the notice must be given 
during the time for Government Orders, although it is clear that the 
motion that is subsequently made based on the notice must be made 
during the time for the consideration of Government Orders. 
Accordingly, I believe the notice given by the Minister of Labour is 
valid.
<P>
<B>(1820 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Mr. Speaker, just for clarification, can the 
government House leader or a minister rise on a point of order to 
bring that in or does he have to rise during debate?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> The minister did it on a 
point of order. It has been done in the past on a point of order, I am 
apprised, and from my own experience I can confirm that is the 
case. I am sure the hon. member, had he been here in the last 
Parliament, would have seen it done that way on numerous 
occasions.
<P>
	I believe that the notice which was given by the Minister of 
Labour is in order, as I have indicated.

	<B>Mr. Eugène Bellemare (Carleton-Gloucester, Lib.)</B> moved 
that Bill C-316, an act to amend the Parliament of Canada Act (oath 
or solemn affirmation), be read the second time and referred to a 
committee.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, like all my colleagues in the House from 
whichever political party, I was honoured and proud to be elected 
to the Parliament of Canada on October 25, 1993.
<P>
	On November 9, 1993 at my swearing in ceremony, I had the 
honour as a re-elected member of the Canadian Parliament to 
pledge allegiance to the Queen of Canada, as required by the 
Parliament of Canada Act. This meant more to me than simply 
swearing allegiance to the Queen as a person; it meant swearing 
allegiance to everything the monarchy represents, which includes 
the Canadian Constitution, Canadian citizens, all our Canadian 
institutions, laws and customs.
<P>
	Having been re-elected to Parliament by the electors of the 
Carleton-Gloucester riding by a record 46,800 votes  in my 
favour, about 35,000 votes more than my nearest challenger, I felt 
proud and honoured but above all I felt duty bound not only to my 
electors but to all my constituents and all Canadians no matter what 
their political beliefs. I felt duty bound to protect and serve all of 
them. For this reason I wanted to clarify our parliamentary oath by 
adding to the present oath of office to the Queen a pledge of 
allegiance to Canada and its Constitution.
<P>
	Since I first introduced this bill in 1993, I have had many 
conversations with Canadians and have received many letters from 
my constituents and from Canadians from various regions of the 
country as well as from my colleagues applauding this initiative.
<P>
	The point was well made when someone close to me once asked: 
``Are we the only country in the world where politicians do not 
swear allegiance to the country?''
<P>
	A local radio station recently held an open line show 
commenting on my private member's bill.
<P>
	A Canada-wide citizens association launched a campaign 
supporting my bill. I would like to read a letter which I received 
recently from the association:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Dear Mr. Bellemare:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I can assure you that Canada First and its more than 1,500 members support you 
wholeheartedly in your attempt to make MPs swear an oath of allegiance to the 
country and the Constitution as well as the Queen of England.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>For your information, we are immediately launching a Canada-wide campaign to 
obtain support for your proposal. You can expect anywhere from upwards of a 
thousand letters of support over the next few weeks from our members.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Yours truly,</BLOCKQUOTE>
Lowell Green,<BR>
 President, Canada First.
<P>
	I have also been interviewed by the media across Canada on the 
same subject. All of my colleagues in the Liberal Party are also 
supporting me in my initiative. It is with this support that I present 
it today.
<P>
	Our allegiance to the Queen is in no way questioned in my 
private member's bill. She is the embodiment of our parliamentary 
system and part of our historical heritage.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	There are those who think that the bill I am presenting is 
redundant, that the oath of allegiance to the Queen already implies 
an oath of allegiance to Canada and to Canadians, and that it would 
be pointless to add an oath of allegiance to Canada and to the 
Constitution.
<P>
<B>(1825)</B>
<P>
	I know from experience that things that are not spelled out are 
often interpreted differently by different people.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6819"> 6819 </A></B>
<P>
	That is why I think it important to affirm what one believes 
when making an affirmation of loyalty, and in this case I proudly 
affirm my loyalty to Canada and to Canadians.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Canada is a country which is part of the Commonwealth and as a 
member country of the Commonwealth we are headed by the 
Queen. The existing oath made by members of Parliament is a 
swearing of allegiance to the Queen. However, the oath of 
allegiance pledged by all members of the House is almost identical 
to the oaths pledged in all the Commonwealth countries which may 
lead to confusion or discussion.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I would like to point out that we have all been elected by 
Canadians, by citizens of Canada, and I trust that we represent all 
Canadians, and not people living in other Commonwealth countries 
such a Australia, Bangladesh, Ghana, India, Pakistan or Nigeria.
<P>
	As an elected representative, each member sitting in the House 
of Commons, including members of the opposition, represents not 
just those who voted for him or her, but also all the inhabitants of 
his or her riding, without exception and regardless of their political 
affiliation.
<P>
	Members of the Bloc Quebecois, members of the official 
opposition, in accordance with the system of government 
established under the Canadian Constitution, say they represent 
Canadians living in Quebec. They even swore an oath of allegiance 
to the Queen when they were sworn in to the House of Commons. 
Why did they not want to support my bill the first time I tabled it, 
two years ago?
<P>
	The official opposition has a duty to keep a careful eye on the 
government, on behalf of all Canadians, in order to ensure that the 
party in power does not take unfair advantage of that power, that 
the government fulfils its duties for the common good of all 
Canadians, as provided for in the Constitution.
<P>
	The Constitution is what enables Bloc Quebecois members to 
present their views in the House of Commons, with all the freedom 
it gives them. It is a source of pride and a privilege to be able to 
take part in the creation of legislation, as we do in Parliament, 
under the Constitution. Bloc Quebecois members are, I trust, fully 
and sincerely involved in that process, I also trust that they respect 
the parliamentary system, the rights of the citizens of Canada, as 
well as their role as the official opposition on behalf of all of the 
people of Canada.
<P>
	In all good conscience, do their votes on each bill, motion or 
amendment count for something? I wonder, are their votes in the 
House a deception? If not, let them admit that they respect the rules 
which allow them to  express their opinions in this House, that is to 
say the rules set out in the Constitution.
<P>
	If a member of Parliament takes an oath and considers it a mere 
formality, what credibility does that member, and the party he 
represents, have when performing his duties? Do Bloc Quebecois 
votes count for anything in the House of Commons?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	If ``a pledge to the Queen is a pledge to the collectivity, and that 
is still very important'' as Lucien Bouchard noted in the Ottawa 
<I>Citizen</I> on September 24, 1993, then is Canada not that collectivity 
as embodied in our Constitution? If the present oath is an oath to 
the Canadian community, then let us say it outright.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The Constitution represents the rights, duties and freedoms of 
the people of this country. When we take an oath of allegiance to 
the Queen, we pledge allegiance to the British parliamentary 
system whose cornerstone is the Constitution. The Queen, the 
monarchy, represents all our democratic institutions.
<P>
	I would like to point out that taking an oath of allegiance only to 
the Queen is rather ambiguous. To many people, she is a person 
who has very few connections with Canada.
<P>
<B>(1830)</B>
<P>
	In fact, every country in the Commonwealth has become 
independent. However, we must realize the Queen represents more 
than just herself. She represents institutions that guarantee respect 
for the fundamental rights of all Canadians. She personifies the rule 
of law under which we live.
<P>
	This oath of allegiance is important for Canada as a nation. 
Members elected to the House of Commons must take this oath to 
affirm, loud and clear, their loyalty to the country and to the 
citizens they have a duty to represent.
<P>
	The Constitution represents different things to different people. 
To a legal expert, it is the constitutional documents by which a 
nation is governed. To others, it is the ideology that presided over 
the creation of a country. To others again, it is a symbol of the rule 
of law, of fair and equitable government for all citizens.
<P>
	In the spirit of the Constitution, it is entirely acceptable to want 
to criticize, change and improve it to make it reflect the new 
realities of life in Canada. But I hope we all agree that the 
Constitution is essential to the responsible governance of this 
country and that it is thanks to the Constitution that we are all here, 
on behalf of all Canadians, to promote their well-being in a free and 
democratic society.
<P>
	The primary function of a Constitution is to protect the 
fundamental rights and freedoms of citizens against  possible abuse 
by their government. A country where there is no respect for the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6820"> 6820 </A></B>
<P>
Constitution is a country where citizens are exposed to severe 
abuse by their politicians.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A member of Parliament who would refuse to swear solemnly to 
respect and defend the constitutional laws which are the essence of 
our society would be a member we could not trust to defend his or 
her constituents against abuses of power and despotism.
<P>
	If the official opposition takes its role seriously as the watchdog 
of the government, as it says it does, its members should therefore 
be the first to applaud and support this addition to the oath of 
allegiance.
<P>
	This oath to Canada and the Constitution should be the first 
essential commitment taken by a member of Parliament on behalf 
of his constituents if democracy and the respect of human rights are 
indeed valuable to this person.
<P>
	That some may not agree with all the clauses of the Constitution 
is perhaps understandable. However, it would be immoral and 
reprehensible if politicians refused to uphold the constitutional 
clauses that protect the fundamental rights and liberties of 
Canadian citizens.
<P>
	If human rights and democracy have evolved and progressed 
through history, it is in great part due to the fact that we have 
realized our leaders need to be reined in by the rules of law as 
specified in the Constitution in order to hinder any abuses of power 
they may feel the urge to commit.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The most developed countries, with the highest quality of life, 
are those whose constitutional rules are taken seriously and really 
respected by those in government so as to protect those most 
vulnerable and to ensure that those in power govern for the good of 
the people.
<P>
	Simple laws may be amended. Here and elsewhere the 
Constitution is amended, but one thing must remain sacrosanct: the 
primacy of the constitutional rules protecting the fundamental 
rights of our society.
<P>
	Of course the matter of the distribution of powers among various 
governments is important. However, politicians' quarrels must not 
overshadow the matter of priority-our commitment to the people 
and the protection of their fundamental rights.
<P>
	One thing is clear: in the history of the most democratic 
countries, one factor vital to their progress was respect for the 
constitutional rules ensuring everyone equal representation and fair 
government. These rules enable dissenters to speak out freely in 
our society and Canadians to express their approval or disapproval 
of government action.
<P>
	Canada differs from the other members of the Commonwealth. 
The oath, which I changed and which I made with respect to my 
constituents, indicates clearly that I represent Canadians and not 
the people of the Commonwealth as a whole.
<P>
<B>(1835)</B>
<P>
	The change to the oath of allegiance is part of a series of other 
measures Canada has taken since the second world war as an 
expression of its national identity and its maturity.
<P>
	Unfortunately, the bill I put before the House today is not a 
votable item. Therefore my colleagues will not have an opportunity 
to decide on this expression of attachment to our country and our 
Constitution.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I would hope that each of my colleagues sitting in the House 
today would like a chance to go on record and officially tell their 
constituents that they are not only proud to represent them but they 
would swear in the House of Commons to uphold their rights and 
defend their liberties.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Zed (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
with great pleasure that I speak on Bill C-316 today. I congratulate 
the member for Carleton-Gloucester for his determination and his 
conviction in bringing this matter forward. Members will recall 
that this is the second time he has brought this issue to our 
attention.
<P>
	In the first session of this Parliament he brought us Bill C-201. 
That bill was considered by this House and several members spoke 
in favour of it but ultimately it did not proceed.
<P>
	The member, who obviously believes passionately in his idea, 
was not deterred and rather than abandon this project he has 
steadfastly introduced this bill again in this new session. When his 
name was drawn he proceeded anew.
<P>
	This member is neither the first to recognize the importance of 
oaths and affirmations nor is he alone in proposing changes with 
respect to oaths in use in Canada today.
<P>
	In the previous Parliament the member for Hamilton West, today 
the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Transport, proposed 
a bill with similar objectives. The member for Parkdale-High 
Park spoke eloquently in favour of that bill. Recently our 
colleague, the member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, sponsored Bill 
C-223 which, like the bill before us today, proposed amendments to 
an oath, namely the one found in the Citizenship Act to provide for 
an oath or solemn affirmation of allegiance to Canada and the 
Constitution.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6821"> 6821 </A></B>
<P>
	What is it that these members are trying to capture in their bills? 
Obviously something is happening, a desire I would suggest to 
express patriotism and pride in a place that we can all share.
<P>
	I have no polls or focus groups results to back me up but I 
suspect that these bills reflect the strong beliefs of a great many of 
our constituents. Those beliefs are overwhelmingly positive. They 
speak of the quality of life Canadians enjoy, the rights and 
freedoms they exercise. They speak also of nation building and the 
future we possess collectively.
<P>
	Despite its positive tone and motivation some members may be 
reluctant to share in the enthusiasm that the member for 
Carleton-Gloucester has in this bill.
<P>
	The technicians among them may argue that this bill is flawed. 
Others may claim that it is redundant because the Constitution 
already requires that a member take an oath before taking his or her 
seat in the House and ask what is the point of two oaths.
<P>
	I would respectively suggest that is not what today's debate is 
about. Rather, this debate invites all of us to speak with greater 
clarity on our roles and responsibilities in this place and our 
commitment to a Parliament and a country which can welcome 
debate on the wide range of views which membership of this House 
represents.
<P>
	I have no problem with the principles expressed in the member's 
bill. I congratulate him for bringing this matter forward. It 
rekindles the pride I have in the work we do here, our Parliament 
and this country. I think it does us all good to pause and reflect on 
our reasons for being here and the solemn oath and affirmation we 
each made before being seated in our places.
<P>
	For this I thank and salute the member. I know he was 
disappointed when his bill was not made votable but as a fellow 
member I want to offer him some congratulations and 
encouragement. The desire and pride which this bill expresses will 
continue to grow. It is one of Canada's and Canadian's greatest 
strengths. Members and Canadians from all walks of life are 
shedding their traditional reluctance to acknowledge their 
patriotism and commitment to Canada. Today's debate is but one 
step in that process and I invite the hon. member to carry on. He is 
among good company. Congratulations.
<P>
<B>(1840)</B>

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak to Bill C-316 presented by the hon. member for 
Carleton-Gloucester.
<P>
	Like my colleague from Fundy-Royal, I would like to 
congratulate the member for Carleton-Gloucester for the energy 
with which he has defended the principles underlying Bill C-316, 
the purpose of which is to have  members of the House of 
Commons or the Senate swear an additional oath before occupying 
their seats.
<P>
	It cannot be said that the member is not persistent, because he 
presented Bill C-201 during the first session of the 35th Parliament, 
at which time I expressed the official opposition's point of view, 
although in the case of private members' business we are more 
likely to express our own personal views.
<P>
	Shortly after the October 25, 1970 election, I swore the 
following oath in the presence of Robert Marleau, the House clerk: 
``I, François Langlois, do swear, that I will be faithful and bear true 
allegiance to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II''.
<P>
	This oath takes four seconds to pronounce. The hon. member for 
Carleton-Gloucester has taken 20 minutes to explain what his 
oath means. I do not need additional explanations regarding the 
oath I swore other than to do my work as a parliamentarian as 
conscientiously as possible, to carry out my duties in the House, in 
committee and as a representative throughout Canada to the best of 
my abilities and, when the time comes, to be accountable to those 
who elected me in Bellechasse. I do not need to swear an oath other 
than to the established authority.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to turn to you as a constitutional 
expert. You are well aware that in a monarchist system such as the 
one we know, which is probably held in high esteem by many in the 
House, the government is embodied in the person of the monarch, 
not in other institutions, but in the monarch, who is, of course, 
much more a symbol than a daily reality. It has been at least 200 
years since we saw a monarch exercise any real power, the right of 
veto in particular. But we do have a symbol.
<P>
	Like the hon. member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, who last week 
wanted to replace the oath of allegiance to Her Majesty with a 
different kind of oath to be taken by new Canadian citizens, that is 
immigrants to this country, what the hon. member for 
Carleton-Gloucester is proposing today is basically to push the 
monarchy slowly, little by little, ever so quietly, out the back door, 
so as not to generate any debate.
<P>
	My position as a Quebecer is clear. In a sovereign Quebec, the 
matter of the monarchy will be settled very quickly. We have 
always said that we wanted a republican state in which the 
president would be selected in the manner we deemed most 
appropriate. Some might prefer election by universal suffrage, 
while others might favour election by the members of the National 
Assembly, or by an electoral college. That will be something to be 
debated. We have taken a position on this.
<P>
	If I were in English Canada, however, I would be worried. It 
would worry me that, by gradually doing away with the symbols, 
the question of the institution of the monarchy in Canada is being 
challenged. I would invite  the monarchist leagues, the loyalist 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6822"> 6822 </A></B>
<P>
leagues, to be on their guard, to write to the hon. member for 
Carleton-Gloucester, to the hon. member for 
Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, and to other members from English Canada 
in this House, to make their views known.
<P>
	If there is to be a debate on the monarchy in Canada, it is not 
going to be settled through minor bills here and there. Instead, it 
needs to be settled by an open debate, by a referendum in English 
Canada.
<P>
<B>(1845)</B>
<P>
	You know as well as I do that the Constitution of 1982 requires 
the consent of each and every province of Canada to change the 
status of the monarchy in this country. Some of the people listening 
to us still believe in the monarchy, in Queen Elizabeth II, who is 
doing an exceptional job of keeping the monarchy afloat, and I 
think everyone can see that for themselves.
<P>
	I think it is rather misplaced to challenge the status of the 
monarchy through the back door, so to speak, at a time when Her 
Majesty is doing her best to maintain this tradition in what remains 
of the empire and in the very heart of the empire.
<P>
	The loyal subjects of this Dominion should be concerned about 
these rather sneaky attacks against the institution. I hope people in 
English Canada will wake up to this fact. If they do not, it may be 
an indication that people want to change Canada's constitutional 
status, especially that of English Canada, from a monarchy to a 
republic. If that is what people want, let them write to their member 
of Parliament. Otherwise, if nothing is done about it, bills like 
these will be passed.
<P>
	As long as Canada is what it is today, these bills do not mean a 
thing. To adopt the principle of the bill would mean that the oath we 
all took here in this House, the oath I recited earlier and which was 
taken by everyone who ever sat in this House since 1791, since the 
Constitution Act was passed-the oath is the same; only the name 
of the sovereign has changed over the years-no longer has any 
value.
<P>
	So if this oath had no value for those who were here in the past, 
why should it have any for those members who are here today? 
Why bother to add another one? Does the hon. member who moved 
this motion not believe in the value of the oath which he took?
<P>
	As far as we are concerned, we have an additional argument. On 
the face of it, this bill constitutes an addition which is not 
compatible with the Constitution of Canada, in that section 128 of 
the <I>Constitutional Act, 1867</I>, the British North America Act, 
already provides for the oath to be taken by members of the House 
of Commons, the Senate or a provincial legislative assembly, and it 
is the one I recited earlier.
<P>
	If we want to change section 128 in order to add another oath, 
what we need is not an ordinary bill but a constitutional resolution. 
The hon. member for Carleton-Gloucester, who knows this 
Parliament, should have known that he had to introduce a 
constitutional resolution in order to change the oath.
<P>
	He knew, though, that in so doing he would reopen the 
fundamental debate facing English Canada. Does English Canada 
still want a monarchy for its Canada? The debate will not be 
resolved by a private member's bill. It is a national debate for 
English Canada that extends from the Atlantic to the borders of 
Ontario and from Ontario to the west and north of Canada, because, 
in Quebec, I think the question is already resolved.
<P>
	Except that, obviously, the monarchy is not mentioned in any of 
our policies, because our aim is not to criticize Canada's head of 
state, but simply to carry out our plan to create what this country 
lacks. And what this country lacks is another country, which is our 
country of Quebec, a sovereign republic of Quebec.
<P>
	Therefore, I cannot support the motion and the bill of the hon. 
member for Carleton-Gloucester.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellemare:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask two questions. 
First of all, I would like the consent of the House to ask questions 
or to comment on the speech by the member for Bellechasse.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> Is there unanimous 
consent in the House for the hon. member to ask questions?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> No. The hon. member 
may have a chance to make comments at the conclusion of the 
debate if there is time left in the hour. I would remind him of that 
fact which may be helpful to him.
<P>
<B>(1850 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in rising 
today to speak on Bill C-316, I would like to make mention that 
when the parliamentary secretary on the government side rose he 
congratulated the member for bringing the issue forward for a 
second time. I guess that really means that Reform can take that as 
a major compliment, because it has been Reform policy since 1987 
that this oath needed to be changed.
<P>
	In fact if I read from the blue sheet it says: ``The Reform Party 
supports amending the MP's oath of office, such that they swear or 
affirm allegiance to their Queen, their constituents and to Canada''. 
We have long had that in our policy position.
<P>
	The difference between the Liberals and Reform is that we 
would make it happen. It is part of our policy. The Liberals have the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6823"> 6823 </A></B>
<P>
power to pass the bill brought  forward by this member. They have 
the power, but for some reason they have chosen not to do it.
<P>
	The first thing I would like to do is ask for unanimous consent of 
the House to make the bill votable.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> Is there unanimous 
consent of the House that the bill proposed by the hon. member for 
Carleton-Gloucester be made a votable item?
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> I hear a no. There is not 
unanimous consent.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (North Vancouver):</B> Mr. Speaker, it was worth one 
more try. I have tried this on all of the non-votable private 
members' bills, but democracy did not prevail.
<P>
	As I mentioned, this is an interesting bill from the Reform 
perspective because it has been the Reform position for at least 
eight years that this needed to be done. However, the Reform 
position was not driven by the presence of a separatist party in the 
House. It was driven by the recognition that MPs, in swearing only 
their allegiance to the Queen, were placed in the position of 
ignoring any allegiance to their constituents. They are forced to 
ignore any allegiance to the people of Canada, the people who pay 
their salaries. And in the case of Liberal MPs, the people who pay 
their gold plated, extreme pension plans.
<P>
	I noticed that the Deputy Prime Minister did not even flinch in 
her seat, so I can tell that she is not the least bit embarrassed about 
those pension plans but most Canadians are quite outraged about 
them.
<P>
	As I said, Reformers have long wanted to see MPs swearing 
allegiance to their constituents so they focus exactly where their 
allegiance should be.
<P>
	I want to mention that the Reform caucus shortly after becoming 
elected in 1993, most of us and perhaps all of us, took a separate 
oath of allegiance in our constituencies. In my riding office in 
North Vancouver on January 7, 1994 I took an oath of allegiance to 
my constituents. I would like to read the preamble as well as the 
oath because it relates directly to the topic we are discussing.
<P>
	A copy of this oath of allegiance to my constituents is hanging 
on the wall of my office. This is a statement of principles and a 
pledge of commitment by me as the Reform Party member to my 
constituents.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I, Ted White, having been elected by the voters of the Federal Constituency of 
North Vancouver to represent you in the 35th Parliament of Canada, do hereby 
sincerely pledge that I am committed to the following principles as I carry out my 
duties on your behalf:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I am committed to the development of a new and stronger united Canada: a balanced 
democratic federation of provinces, distinguished by the acceptance of our social 
responsibilities, and  the recognition of the equality and uniqueness of all our provinces 
and citizens.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I am committed to equality for all Canadians, regardless of race, language, 
culture, religion or gender; and will give true and faithful representation to all my 
constituents.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I am committed to being your democratic and fiscal conscience in the 35th 
Parliament and I am prepared to demonstrate this commitment by showing 
leadership by example.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I believe you have sent me to the House of Commons to present your views in that 
forum, not to represent Ottawa's views to you. I believe that the House of Commons 
must be the house of the people, not the house of the parties. The word ``politician'' 
must mean a representative of the people, not a servant of the party. To that end, I 
shall not only encourage you to communicate with me, but I am committed to 
consulting your views at every opportunity, and shall make myself available to you 
regularly, within our constituency. I need your advice and guidance.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I believe that when decisions are to be made on contentious issues of major or 
national importance, it is my duty to seek the consensus view of my constituents, and 
to represent that consensus in Parliament, even if it conflicts with my own personal 
view.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I believe you have placed me in a position of great trust. I shall therefore conduct 
my personal and public life with honour and integrity-</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I further pledge that I shall honour, to the utmost of my ability, all of the 
commitments made in this statement.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1855)</B>
<P>
	It finishes with the final part of the pledge:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I, Ted White, your member of Parliament, do pledge, that I will be faithful and 
bear true allegiance to the Canadian federation and to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth, 
and that I will faithfully represent the people of the Electoral District of North 
Vancouver in the Canadian House of Commons.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It is dated in North Vancouver on January 7, 1994.
<P>
	Members can tell from this that Reform has long had a 
commitment to have the oath changed to really represent the way 
we feel about Parliament and what we should be doing here as 
MPs.
<P>
	Members can also tell from that oath that, unlike the Liberals 
and the old line parties, I do not believe this desk and this chair 
belong to my party. They belong to my constituents. They do not 
belong to me. This seat and this desk belong to my constituents and 
I am pledged to represent them from this position.
<P>
	When the hon. member for Carleton-Gloucester introduced the 
bill, he mentioned that he respects the views of people of all 
political beliefs, and yet in this House he has made mean-spirited 
attacks on Reformers on regular occasions. In fact, the whole thrust 
of his bill seems to be couched in the form of an attack on another 
group of representatives in this Parliament. It is true that most of us 
do not agree with the position that group is espousing. However, 
the reason for bringing forward this change to the oath should not 
be based on attacking  another group for its beliefs, it should be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6824"> 6824 </A></B>
<P>
based on the feeling that there is a real need to change the oath for 
good reasons.
<P>
	However, as I said earlier, the general thrust of the bill is good. It 
is exactly in line with what Reformers have wanted to do, even if 
our reasons for wanting to do so are somewhat different.
<P>
	I would like to mention once again the section from the blue 
sheet, just to remind members that this has long been Reform 
policy. It was put in our material in 1987. I am sure the member has 
never taken the time to read the blue sheet. If he had he would have 
found a whole slew of policies that he would be very pleased with.
<P>
	This particular policy reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Reform Party supports amending the M.P.s' oath of office such that they 
swear or affirm allegiance to their Queen, their constituents and to Canada.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	We are obviously going to be supportive of Bill C-316. I am very 
sorry that there was not unanimous consent to make it votable. 
Despite other differences between us as members, I sincerely 
support the member's right to have a votable bill and I am truly 
sorry that did not happen.
<P>
	In conclusion, Reform is supportive of this bill and would have 
voted in favour of it had it been a votable.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Guelph-Wellington, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the hon. member for Carleton-Gloucester for 
introducing Bill C-316, for his love of Canada and for his love of 
Parliament. He has spent a lot of years here.
<P>
	While not votable, I believe that this legislation allows us to 
debate an important issue for us as parliamentarians and for all 
Canadians.
<P>
	The bill proposes to amend the oath for members of Parliament. 
It changes the wording so that we as members of the House of 
Commons would swear or affirm that we will be loyal to Canada, 
rather than to the Queen. Given that a number of members of 
Parliament want to break up Canada, this is an important 
distinction.
<P>
	Regional interests have always been represented in this House 
and in the British House of Commons. In fact, Welsh, Scottish and 
Irish separatists have sat and continue to sit in the House of 
Commons in Great Britain. Unlike Canada, they do not have the 
numbers to make up the official opposition.
<P>
	A great number of my constituents, and I am sure the 
constituents of the hon. member for Carleton-Gloucester, are 
troubled by the presence of the Bloc Quebecois in this Parliament. 
While recognizing that Bloc members were freely elected, the fact 
that they sit in the national Parliament to represent regional issues 
is difficult to accept.
<P>
<B>(1900 )</B>
<P>
	The Bloc members argue that they are here to represent the many 
Quebecers who support the break-up of Canada; that is of course 
when they wish to discuss separation. Many seem to be unsure of 
whether they want their own country, a partnership or some sort of 
association with Canada. None seems to be able to convince 
anyone outside of their own caucus of how this would benefit 
Quebec and Canada.
<P>
	However, despite the fact that on two separate occasions 
Quebecers have rejected the idea of whatever it is the separatists 
are trying to sell, they remain in this House.
<P>
	Members of the Bloc are Canadians. They benefit from Canada 
like everyone else in this House. They are supported by the 
Canadian government. They were elected by Canadians to serve 
Canadians and they are paid through the taxes remitted by 
Canadians. Each and every one of them is allowed to sit in 
Parliament because they have affirmed their loyalty to the Queen.
<P>
	Bill C-316 makes an important distinction. Certainly there are a 
number of Canadians who feel a strong attachment to Queen 
Elizabeth II. For example, Guelph is know as the royal city because 
Guelph was the name of the royal family at the time of our 
founding in 1827. I see you are surprised by that, Mr. Speaker. Like 
most municipalities, our coat of arms includes the crown.
<P>
	Some may find discomfort with the change in the oath of 
affirmation. I understand and appreciate that. They do not want us 
to ignore Canadian traditions. However, elected officials' affirming 
their loyalty to Canada also acknowledges the traditions that make 
us unique and that have helped to make us the greatest nation on 
this earth.
<P>
	The current oath used by members of Parliament is similar to 
that used in Great Britain. In Great Britain members say: ``I'', and 
give their name, ``do solemnly, sincerely and truly declare and 
affirm that I will be faithful and be true allegiance to Her Majesty 
Queen Elizabeth, her heirs and successors according to law''.
<P>
	It is interesting that refusing to state this oath prohibits members 
of the House of Commons from voting and taking part in debate. 
When a member breaks the rule he or she is subject to a fine of 500 
pounds and their seat is declared vacant. Members cannot draw a 
parliamentary salary or expenses unless he or she has taken the 
oath of affirmation.
<P>
	In the United States, article 6 of the constitution states that 
senators and representatives shall be bound by oath or affirmation 
to support this constitution. Their oath, sworn in public in either the 
House of Representatives or the Senate, states: ``I do solemnly 
swear and affirm that I will support and defend the Constitution of 
the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic, that I 
will bear true faith and allegiance to the same, that  I take this 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6825"> 6825 </A></B>
<P>
obligation freely without any mental reservation or purpose of 
evasion and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of 
the office in which I am about to enter, so help me God''. This oath 
is said in public together before each new Congress.
<P>
	There are some who believe that changing the oath or solemn 
affirmation will mean that the separatists will disappear from this 
Chamber. This is probably not true. As I have said earlier, 
nationalist separatists sit in the British House of Commons. 
Members of the Bloc Quebecois claim they can affirm loyalty to 
the Queen, head of state of Canada, while they attempt to destroy 
this country. Unfortunately, swearing an oath of allegiance to our 
country will probably not change that position.
<P>
	Does this bill deal with mere symbolism? In a press release 
issued following the introduction of the bill, the hon. member for 
Carleton-Gloucester said: ``If this bill were to pass I acknowledge 
that it would create a certain dilemma for people who want to be 
elected to destroy or separate our country. However, I think that an 
oath of allegiance to our country will strengthen the sentiment of 
pride which the majority of members feel when they arrive in the 
House of Commons''.
<P>
	The member also spoke about the loyalty that we as members of 
Parliament must carry out to the country and the tradition of 
tolerance and compromise.
<P>
<B>(1905)</B>
<P>
	The presence of separatists in the House of Commons is perhaps 
the greatest example of our tolerance and understanding as a 
nation. We are fortunate to have in this Parliament representatives 
from a variety of ethnic groups, women, unilingual francophones, 
unilingual anglophones and a number of members who were born 
outside Canada. We bring together a variety of tradition, history 
and culture.
<P>
	Each of us in our very own way contributes through our talents, 
our experiences and our hopes for a better Canada to serve our 
constituents in a national forum. We are here because we want to 
help address problems and make the future better for our children 
and our grandchildren. Perhaps the fact that the separatists are here 
and are in such a prominent position really shows how great our 
country really is.
<P>
	We are so tolerant and we are so democratic that we allow a party 
which is determined to break up the country to sit in this House of 
Commons as the official opposition. We are here to solve 
problems, not to create them.
<P>
	I remain hopeful that Canada will remain strong and united. 
Perhaps pondering our roles as elected representatives, pausing to 
affirm our loyalty to Canada, will remind us that Canada has served 
us well. We owe it to our history and to our future to work to better 
this great country.
<P>
	I doubt this bill will mean that the separatists will leave. I doubt 
it will mean that their narrow and negative vision of our country 
will change. However, I do think that any reminder that we are here 
to serve Canada should be supported, and I congratulate my 
colleague and my friend for bringing forth this piece of legislation.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> Resuming debate. If the 
hon. member for Carleton-Gloucester speaks now he will close 
the debate.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Eugène Bellemare (Carleton-Gloucester, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, again, I would like to see a vote on this bill. If Bloc 
members are really convinced that my bill should not be passed, 
they should have the courage to rise in the House and vote before 
the public, before the voters, to indicate how they want to deal with 
this bill. They should tell their constituents that they do not stand 
behind the fact that a member should protect the rights and 
freedoms of his constituents.
<P>
	The hon. member for Bellechasse told us that he took an oath of 
allegiance to the Queen, not to Canada or the Constitution. He went 
on to say that the case of the monarchy will be settled according to 
the position of the sovereignists. The hon. member for Bellechasse 
said a lot when he said that I rose in the House to challenge the 
monarchy through the back door. I am sure the hon. member for 
Bellechasse was not listening to my speech.
<P>
	I would like to send him a copy of my speech so he will realize I 
said that in addition to the oath of allegiance to the Queen we also 
took an oath of allegiance to our constituents regarding their rights 
and freedoms.
<P>
	I want to ask the hon. member for Bellechasse and the other 
members of the Bloc Quebecois whether they are going against 
what was said by their own leader, Lucien Bouchard. When asked 
whether he took an oath of allegiance to the Queen as a person,Mr. Bouchard answered that he took an oath of allegiance to the 
community. What community was he talking about, since he had 
been elected to the Parliament of Canada, not to the Parliament of 
Quebec where he is now?
<P>
<B>(1910)</B>
<P>
	The hon. member for Bellechasse noted that my bill would 
require an amendment to the Constitution. I have great respect for 
his legal background, but I may point out that we are talking about 
an act of Parliament, not about the Constitution.
<P>
	I wonder whether he would take an oath that he would defend the 
rights and freedoms of his constituents. That is the basis for my 
bill. He said that someday Quebec will be sovereign, which I very 
much doubt. I am convinced that Quebec will never separate from 
Canada.
<P>
	During the last referendum, his colleagues in the Parti Quebecois 
as well as sovereignists and separatists in Quebec mentioned 
keeping the Canadian passport and  the Canadian dollar. If they 
want to keep the Canadian passport, why do they not want to pledge 
<P>

<B><A NAME="6826"> 6826 </A></B>
<P>
allegiance to Canada? What does the Canadian passport mean? 
They want to keep the Canadian dollar. Do they want to keep it so 
they can have the portrait of the Queen on their bills or the faces of 
various Conservative or Liberal Prime Ministers? I wonder.
<P>
	And what an ambiguous question they asked in the October 1995 
referendum. Quebecers did not realize it really meant they wanted 
to separate from Canada. That is the whole point today, and that is 
why the Bloc Quebecois obstructed my bill.
<P>
	In conclusion, I would like to say to the member for Bellechasse 
and to all his colleagues in the Bloc Quebecois that when members 
of the Quebec National Assembly are elected, they swear an oath to 
the Constitution and to Quebec, to the Constitution of Quebec, and 
to Quebecers.
<P>
	We are here in the Parliament of Canada, where all members, 
regardless of their political affiliation, may offer criticism 
whenever they wish in order to improve the lot of all Canadians and 
to improve the Constitution and our laws.
<P>
	Why, when they are elected in Quebec, do they swear an oath to 
the Province of Quebec and to the citizens of the Province of 
Quebec, but when they are elected to the Parliament of Canada in 
Ottawa, they refuse to swear an oath to the Constitution and to 
Canada? That is the question, and it is still the key point in my bill.
<P>
	My bill requires that a member respect his constituents, 
regardless of their political affiliation, their race, their language or 
their religious beliefs. We are here to protect the rights and 
freedoms of those who elected us.
<P>
	If a member refuses to do that, what does that suggest about him 
as an MP? It suggests that he does not wish to respect the two 
principles I have mentioned, and I accuse Bloc Quebecois members 
of betraying their own constituents.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> The hour provided for 
consideration of Private Members' Business has now expired and 
the item is dropped from the Order Paper.

<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 deemed 
to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="IMMIGRATION">IMMIGRATION</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, on October 
8, I asked a question of the Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration concerning the imposition of a visa requirement for 
Portuguese visitors to Canada.
<P>
	Portugal is the only country in the European Union for which 
such a thing is required, and this is profoundly unfair and 
discriminatory. This country is, moreover, an ally and a friend, as 
well as a fellow member of NATO. The population of Portuguese 
origin living here numbers close to half a million, which makes it 
one of the largest ethnic communities in Canada and in Quebec.
<P>
	This measure, which the immigration minister of the day 
described as temporary, was taken by the Mulroney government in 
1986, as the result of certain immigration irregularities involving 
Portugal. The Liberals, who were then in opposition, were 
vehemently opposed to this decision. At that time, the hon. member 
for York West, who was the Liberal critic in this area, denounced 
this measure by saying: ``That action would be unwarranted and 
unfair and I have asked the minister to abandon the proposal and to 
avoid needlessly penalizing the Canadian Portuguese community, 
and a European friend and ally''.
<P>
	This unjustified requirement generates enormous problems for 
family members wishing to visit relatives here.
<P>
	I have asked a number of questions of the minister and her 
predecessor. I have prepared press releases, so far to no avail. The 
Bloc Quebecois supports this campaign.
<P>
	I am therefore again condemning this measure, because visa 
applicants are being subjected to unacceptable interrogation and 
red tape at the Canadian embassy in Portugal. They are also being 
required to pay a fee which keeps going up. Sometimes, as well, 
they have to cope with either refusals or intolerable delays. While 
this is going on, the event they were invited to, such as a marriage 
or a baptism, has often come and gone.
<P>
	In her response to my question in the House on October 8, the 
minister said she was, and I quote: ``quite prepared to reopen 
discussions with the Portuguese authorities on this question''. The 
next day, she met José Lello, the secretary of state for Portuguese 
communities abroad, during his visit to Ottawa. Why did the 
minister not take advantage of this excellent opportunity to put an 
end to this discriminatory and totally unjustified requirement?
<P>
	I can understand the Portuguese community's anger and 
annoyance at the attitude of the Canadian government. Canadians 
and Quebecers of Portuguese origin make a significant contribution 
to our society. They are exceptionally hard workers. I know the 
<P>

<B><A NAME="6827"> 6827 </A></B>
<P>
community well, especially in Montreal and the  Outaouais. I know 
that all members of the community want to see the end of the visa.
<P>
	Various Portuguese-Canadian organizations are circulating a 
petition in Canada on this issue. It will be tabled in the House 
shortly. Those signing it state that the visa hinders the development 
of bilateral relations in the areas of culture, education, job training 
and trade. Furthermore, it prevents Portuguese citizens from 
regularly visiting their relatives for various family events when 
their presence is required.
<P>
	I would like to conclude by again requesting the Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration to immediately remove the visa 
requirement for Portuguese visitors. Canada must implement a 
policy of reciprocity with Portugal, which does not require a visa 
from Canadians.
<P>
	I take this opportunity to salute my many friends in the 
Portuguese community in Canada and Quebec.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Maria Minna (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I must admit I 
am unclear as to why the hon. member for Bourassa has asked that 
this particular response be clarified. The Minister of Citizenship 
and Immigration was straightforward and unambiguous in her 
original answer. I am puzzled that he did not understand the answer 
the first time around. Nevertheless, let me try to explain this issue 
in simple terms yet again.
<P>
	Canada values its warm relations with Portugal. Our two 
countries have had a tradition of strong economic and cultural 
links. I know that both countries are anxious that this friendship 
continue. The hon. member has asked why we impose a visitor visa 
on Portugal. He has implied that there is something arbitrary in our 
decision. Let me assure him that it is simply not the case.
<P>
	Citizenship and Immigration Canada has a responsibility to 
protect the integrity of our borders and our immigration program. It 
is a job that the department takes very seriously. Last year, 39 
million visitors came to this country. This movement of people 
presents this country with both opportunities and challenges. 
Visitor visa requirements are an important tool which allow us to 
manage this flow of people effectively and efficiently.
<P>
	The decision to impose or remove a visitor visa is not an 
arbitrary decision, far from it. Such a decision is taken only after 
thoughtful consideration of all alternative measures. The benefits 
of removing the visa requirement must be weighed against the 
potential for abuse.
<P>
	When we look at removing a visitor visa requirement, we have to 
take many different factors into consideration. Does the country 
that the person is coming from have effective passport controls? Is 
there potential for forgery and abuse? Are there a large percentage 
of visitor visas refused each year? If so, why is that?
<P>
	CIC officials conduct an ongoing review of countries affected by 
visitor visa requirements. Departmental staff keep a vigilant eye on 
the changing international landscape in order to develop policies 
which are fair and effective.
<P>
	I can assure the hon. member that the visitor visa requirement on 
Portugal has no negative impact on regular immigration from that 
country. I would like to point out that the department has a one-day 
processing service in Lisbon.
<P>
	As the minister said, she would be more than willing to look into 
this issue in the future if it becomes necessary.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> The motion to adjourn the 
House is deemed to have been adopted. Accordingly, it being7.21 p.m., this House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m. 
pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 7.21 p.m.)
