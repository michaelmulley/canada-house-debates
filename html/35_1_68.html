builders across the country.
<P>

	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot):</B> Mr. Speaker, Canadians have 
told the government repeatedly that they are worried about the 
economic state of this country. The 1994 budget demonstrated 
quite clearly that the government did not get the message.
<P>
	Perhaps the government will listen to an outsider, someone 
who is not directly affected by the economics of this country. 
One of Asia's top bankers says Canada's economy is in danger of 
self-destruction and without greater economic growth Canada's 
envious quality of life will be endangered.
<P>
	I agree with the view of the person who sits on the outside 
looking in. Our economy could crumble under the weight of 
high taxes, massive public debt and unnecessary government 
regulations.
<P>
	The positive aspect of this government's budget reminds me 
of a person who adds a needed piece of furniture to a house that 
is burning down. I urge the government to introduce further 
spending reductions, to put out the fire and restore our

attacking crime in our communities. That response is entirely 
understandable. Violence and killings have no place in a 
civilized society.
<P>
	We on this side of the House are deeply concerned about these

more punishment alone, and I emphasize alone, will not solve

	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance. In a report 
tabled in the House in November 1989, the Liberals, who were 
then the Official Opposition, called upon the government of the 
day, and I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-to abandon the proposed GST and to undertake without delay 
consultations with Canadians and provincial governments on a fair and 
integrated reform of the entire tax system.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Does the Minister of Finance believe as strongly today as he 
did during his days in opposition that the federal tax system is in 
need of a complete overhaul and that a simple analysis of 
possible alternatives to the GST would not be enough to 
eliminate the inequities of the tax system?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec): </B>Mr. Speaker, as the Leader of the 
Opposition knows full well, in our budget we proceeded to 
review thoroughly several aspects of the corporate tax system, a 
move which was essential to restoring equity to the tax system. 
At the same time, he also knows that we have kept our word by 
setting up a finance committee to review the GST. I am, 
therefore, very confident and proud of our party's and our 
government's handling of the tax system.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, judging from what has been accomplished thus far, I 
think there is cause for concern about the seriousness of the 
government's intentions, because the only true reform carried 
out to date is totally inadequate. It should not even be equated 
with the word reform.
<P>
	In the event the promised reform is carried out, will the 
Minister of Finance recognize that, in so far as the sales tax and 
income tax are concerned, the federal tax system should not 
encroach upon existing fields of provincial jurisdiction?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, the position the government has taken 
and one that we took with the budget is one that respects the 
jurisdictions of both levels of government. In fact at two 
successive meetings with the ministers of finance we discussed 
this very subject. There were no complaints. We recognize very 
clearly the absolute necessity of working together.
<P>
	In terms of what we did in the budget within our own field, we 
began quite a profound restructuring of corporate taxation. We 
eliminated a number of abuses where companies were not 
paying tax on foreign passive income. We examined the number 
of expenditure openings, loopholes, exemptions and closed 
them.
<P>
	As a result of our budget, we have re-established a substantial 
portion of fairness within our fiscal system.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister did not answer my question. I asked him if 
the government was going to respect provincial fields of 
jurisdiction with respect to tax matters. What we got was a long 
litany about the budget. That is an entirely different matter. I 
have another question for the minister and I hope this time that 
he will answer it. As his government prepares to reduce transfer 
payments, depriving the provinces of substantial revenues in the 
process, will the minister recognize that if GST reform were to 
mean a reduction in the provinces' tax base, this would be 
completely unfair as it would only add to their financial woes?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec): </B>Mr. Speaker, first of all, as far as 
transfers to the provinces are concerned, not only have we not 
reduced these payments, but in terms of equalization, we have 
increased them.
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	Second, we have agreed to a moratorium along with other 
provincial finance ministers while our social programs are being 
reviewed. Both the federal government and the provinces will 
save money as a result of this review.
<P>
	As for our co-operating with provincial governments, I think 
it is obvious when you consider the meetings and even the 
discussion we had yesterday with the Minister of Industry 
concerning the elimination of tariff barriers. We do not need to 
be told what to do, as far as the provinces are concerned.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Finance. The <I>Toronto Star</I> quotes 
the chairman of the finance committee, which must submit its 
report on an alternative to the GST on June 1. The committee 
chairman, the member for Downsview, suggests that a single 
sales tax must be  contemplated and that such a tax should be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4202"> 4202 </A></B>
<P>
hidden to reduce the anger and frustration of consumers when 
they realize they are paying 15 per cent tax on the sales price.
<P>
	Can the Minister of Finance assure us that he has ruled out the 
finance committee chairman's suggestion to put in place a single 
national sales tax collected by Ottawa?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec): </B>Mr. Speaker, first of all, this issue is 
before the finance committee. But I will still answer the 
question. The hon. member knows full well that the committee, 
including members from the Bloc Quebecois, is now working on 
the report.
<P>
	They are in the process of writing it and I eagerly await it. 
However, I should tell you that the hon. member's position 
contradicts that of his leader because when he says we will 
harmonize taxation between the two levels of government, we 
will really do it because that is what many provinces want.
<P>
	We want to introduce a sales tax that respects provincial 
jurisdiction because that is what the business community, 
consumers and provincial governments want.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue):</B> I have a supplementary 
question, Mr. Speaker. Does the minister also share the opinion 
of the finance committee chairman, who claims that a hidden tax 
would reduce ``counter shock''-the anger and frustration of 
consumers when they realize they are paying 15 per cent in 
taxes?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec): </B>Mr. Speaker, I said many times that I 
am not in a position to make comments on a report that has not 
been submitted yet.

everything about it, perhaps we could meet later.

my question is for the Minister of Justice.
<P>
	Over the past several weeks Reform MPs have repeatedly 
questioned the government on criminal justice issues. The 
purpose has been to prod the government into actually doing 
something about violent crime.
<P>
	In response the minister has said that violent crime is not 
going to be resolved by tinkering with statutes or changing acts 
and that the real answer is to attack the underlying causes of 
crime.
<P>
	Could the minister specifically identify the underlying causes 
of crime to which he refers and tell the House whether any of the 
reforms he has promised will have any immediate effect on 
these causes and on the safety of Canadians?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, the record will disclose that 
in response to the questions that have been put I have said that 
there are already two answers to the issue of crime.
<P>
	The first is legislative reform to ensure that the Criminal Code 
and the Young Offenders Act and all the other statutes are 
enforced as effectively as possible. That is one response.
<P>
	But of equal and perhaps in the long term greater importance, 
I have spoken about the root causes of crime. In that connection I 
have spoken about developing at long last a national strategy for 
crime prevention and in order to achieve that establishing a 
national crime prevention council. We propose to do just that.
<P>
	In response to the question by the hon. leader of the Reform 
Party may I say this. The specific steps will be the creation of the 
council and the reform of the statutes. I have mentioned that in 
weeks ahead I will be bringing to the House proposed 
amendments to both the Criminal Code and the Young Offenders 
Act.
<P>
<B>(1425 ) </B>
<P>
	As for the root causes, I believe the national council on crime 
prevention will once and for all collaborate, harness and put to 
constructive use the energy you see in communities across the 
country, including Edmonton, which is among the leaders, 
toward community based programs for crime prevention linking 
social services and-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> But, Mr. 
Speaker, I did not really hear any references to the underlying 
causes of crime to which the minister refers and I did not hear 
specifically any reference to the failure of individuals to accept 
responsibility for their actions as one of the roots of crime.
<P>
	Many Canadians no longer have confidence in the Liberal 
philosophy of the past, the philosophy behind the original Young 
Offenders Act that individuals are not primarily responsible for 
their own actions and that crime is primarily the fault of society.
<P>
	Will the minister state unequivocally today that whatever the 
details of the criminal justice reforms he brings forward they 
will fully recognize the principle of personal accountability for 
criminal acts?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, I can give that commitment 
without hesitation. I am confident the hon. member will find 
that in the proposals we will bring forward to lengthen the 
maximum

<HR>
<B><A NAME="4203"> 4203 </A></B>
<P>
sentences for serious violent crimes in the Young Offenders Act, 
for specific changes in the sentencing provisions of the Criminal  
Code, that he will find ample scope for accountability by 
individuals who commit crime.
<P>
	Let me say something else in response to his question. He asks 
about root causes. The record of committees and commissions 
and inquiries is replete with references to the fact that longer jail 
terms and harsher penalties and more police do not solve the 
problem of crime because they do not get at its causes. The 
causes are patent. They are poverty and they are dysfunctional 
families and they are abusive children and it is hopelessness.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my supplementary question is for the minister.
<P>
	Yesterday in question period the minister made reference to a 
meeting he held with Margo B., the Quebec mother raped while 
doing secretarial work in a church by an inmate of the 
Cowansville penitentiary on day parole.
<P>
	The minister will recall that Margo B. asked the Quebec court 
to compel the accused to take a blood test to determine whether 
he was HIV positive but the court denied her request saying that 
such an intervention would compromise the rights of the 
accused to privacy and security of the person under the charter.
<P>
	Would the minister assure us that the criminal justice reforms 
he proposes will establish the principle that where the rights of a 
perpetrator of crime and the rights of a victim of crime conflict 
it is the rights of the victim that will prevail in Canadian law.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, I spoke to this issue 
yesterday in the House. I said on that occasion on the facts of 
that particular case and dealing specifically with the right of a 
victim of sexual aggression to know whether the perpetrator is 
infected with a communicable disease is a matter we are 
considering.
<P>
	Questions of constitutional law and privacy arise but I want to 
assure the hon. member, as I assured the House yesterday, that 
by the fall of this year we will bring forward a decision on that 
question and let the House know what our approach is. We are 
giving consideration to making such tests mandatory for the 
sake of the peace of mind of people like Margo B.

	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
in his report, the Auditor General denounced some provisions of 
the Income Tax Act that allow big Canadian corporations to 
invest in tax havens and bring dividends back to Canada without 
paying a cent of tax. The problem arises because Canada signed 
tax conventions with several countries that are now considered 
as tax havens.
<P>
<B>(1430) </B>
<P>
	How does the Minister of Finance justify having countries 
like Barbados, Cyprus and Malta, tax havens recognized by the 
Auditor General, still on the list of countries with which Canada 
has tax conventions that unduly allow some Canadian 
companies to avoid taxes?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member knows 
very well that the key word really is ``unduly'', that the 
countries with which we signed these treaties impose some taxes 
and that if we did not have treaties with them, Canadian 
companies would be liable to double taxation, which would 
make them uncompetitive.
<P>
	The hon. member also knows that in the Budget of February 
22, we eliminated many of these openings so that we could tax 
passive investment, in order to reduce taxes on our companies' 
operating profits.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
all experts agree that the most recent budget provisions in no 
way solve the problem of tax evasion by Canadian companies.
<P>
	Does the minister not agree that it is absolutely indecent to 
ask ordinary citizens to pay more and more tax, even if it breaks 
them, while conventions which he maintains with countries 
considered by the Auditor General to be tax havens cost the 
Canadian government hundreds of millions of dollars in tax 
evasion?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, again, as the hon. 
member knows, in our Budget, we largely followed the Auditor 
General's recommendations. As for tax havens, we eliminated 
most of them, but some remain. We live in an interdependent 
global economy; Canadian companies do business outside 
Canada and we do not want to put them in a position where they 
cannot compete with companies in other countries.

<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House

the applicant's qualifications are a matter of record and often a 
matter of public knowledge. This record and this public 
knowledge are something that exist quite apart from any 
interview, no matter how lengthy that interview is. If we are 
looking for competence and merit, we want to look at a person's 
record of achievements, a person's training and a person's 
qualifications. That is what counts. An interview may be useful 
but that cannot outweigh these other factors.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul E. Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as I suggested in this House on Monday, Standing 
Order 110 provides a mechanism whereby nominees can be 
scrutinized by a parliamentary committee before a final 
decision is made by cabinet. The current system of making the 
appointment and then bringing the person before committee 
does not allow members of Parliament meaningful input.
<P>
	I repeat my request. Will the Solicitor General forward all 
nominations to the National Parole Board to the standing 
committee on justice for review before any final appointment is 
made?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, I

I want to point out to him that the rules in this regard make this a 
matter of discretion, an optional matter for the minister. The

some of the people who submit application for appointments 
may not want it to be made public in terms of the impact on their 
existing employment and there are similar factors.

Régie des télécommunications and is asking the federal 
government to delegate appropriate regulatory powers to the 
province. Speaking on that issue, the Quebec Minister of 
Communications said that the current situation clearly 
illustrates the inadequacy of the Canadian constitutional 
framework as regards communications.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs. 
Does the federal government intend to legislate and delegate the 
powers of the CRTC to Quebec's Régie des télécommunications, 
as requested by the Quebec Minister of Communications?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy 
Council for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs

Speaker, as I already indicated, we have no problem consulting 
with Quebec to see if some responsibilities in the 
communications sector could be delegated to that province. Our 
approach will not be based on jurisdiction, even though the 
Supreme Court clearly indicated, as did Quebec's Superior 
Court and Court of Appeal before it, that communications come 
under exclusive federal jurisdiction.
<P>
	Under the circumstances, our approach is based on the 
principle of efficiency; in other words, it is a matter of 
determining who can provide the most efficient service. We will 
thoroughly review the decision, get the advice of our experts and 
negotiate with Mrs. Frulla-Hébert. Also, we will be particularly 
careful not to create overlapping in a field which comes under 
exclusive federal jurisdiction.

mean that the minister intend to rely on the fact that

development as a whole?

<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney

we are engaged at present is to deal with high risk offenders who 
give reason for concern about the safety of the community upon 
the completion of their jail term or their terms of imprisonment.
<P>
	In that connection I raised with the territorial and provincial 
ministers of justice and attorneys general in March when I met 
with them the approach which we said we would take during the 
election campaign which is to ask the provinces to work with us 
to amend where necessary the provincial mental health 
legislation to permit assessments of such persons in the prisons 
and then involuntary detention under mental health legislation 
at the end of their criminal sentences so that they can either be 
treated or detained as required for purposes of public safety.
<P>
	I am happy to report that I have had constructive co-operation 
and expressions of support from my colleagues in the provinces

legislative base will be present for us to treat the kinds of

proposed changes to the criminal justice system he will protect 
innocent victims of crimes like these, those who are left behind, 
those who are being stalked by convicted killers, by tightening

denying them parole or is it going to be continuing the parole as 
usual?

Nonetheless, on Friday the minister of revenue stated that the 
Liberal government was committed to living by the strict letter

<P>

Canada's dogmatic application of the OTC does not violate the 
NAFTA and the FTA thus putting Canada at the risk of U.S. 
retaliation?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of National Revenue):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have answered the question in general terms 
previously. The objective of this program is to give Canadian 
companies an opportunity to bid for overseas contracts and thus 
make it attractive for their Canadian employees to go overseas 
and take part in that work.
<P>
	It is not a program to assist American or other companies to 
do the same thing overseas. The legislation is clear in this 
regard. Indeed, as I mentioned before, I am limited in my 
opportunity to apply the law.
<P>
	With respect to the NAFTA and the FTA provisions, I am 
informed that we are within the spirit of the NAFTA and the 
FTA. However I will again check the matter at the request of the

	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer):</B> Mr. Speaker, my supplementary 
question is for the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	According to officials in the department of international trade

change in the enforcement of the OTC violates article 1402 of 
the FTA as well as articles 1102 and 2103:4 of the NAFTA.
<P>
	In light of the international agreements, will the minister now 
consider amending the Income Tax Act so that the overseas tax 
credit does not violate Canada's international obligations?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of National Revenue):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, unfortunately I do not have articles 1402 and 2103:4 or 
the other paragraph the hon. member has mentioned.

	If members of the Reform Party or other members of the

give ministers the courtesy of at least providing us with either 
the text of the documents they are referring to or advance 
warning so that we can prepare for questions in the House.

question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	Last month the government made a very big deal about 
announcing a new series of very expensive short term make 
work projects for unemployed youth. Once we get beyond the 
press releases we find that only 2,500 of Canada's 405,000 
unemployed youth will have a shot at those programs this 
summer. That is less than 1 per cent.
<P>
	Will the minister admit that these programs are not a long 
term solution to youth unemployment and that implying they are 
is creating false hope for Canada's unemployed youth?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, contrary to what the hon. 
member says, the initiatives we announced will affect far more 
than 2,500 students. In fact under the summer employment 
program there will be 60,000 summer students employed across 
the country.
<P>
	Under the internship program, which is a very crucial 
program to deal with the critical problem of enabling young 
people to make their transition from school to work, there will 
be about 8,500 in the first round this year, going up to a number 
close to 60,000 in the full year of operation two years from now.
<P>
	Under the youth service corps my colleague will be 
announcing very soon a number of LEAD sites which will lead 
to close to 10,000 to 15,000 young people being employed.
<P>
	In addition, we are undertaking a number of co-operative 
ventures with the provinces to help to provide national standards 
in the schooling system.
<P>
	I do not know where the hon. member gets his information. It 
clearly has nothing to do with the major initiative the 
government has announced.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am sure 
the minister will admit what he is talking about are programs 
that were previously announced. In some cases he is talking 
about programs that will actually take effect in years to come. 
Indeed this summer there will be 2,500 new positions opened up.
<P>
	The facts show that despite having dozens of these programs 
over the last 20-odd years, youth unemployment has almost 
doubled since the 1970s to its present 17.4 per cent. It is no 
coincidence that unemployment has risen with the debt and 
deficit levels.
<P>
	Will the minister acknowledge that the debt is the single 
biggest killer of jobs in the country and every day it fails to cut 
spending his government is contributing to high levels of 
unemployment?

<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, it seems to me the most 
important requirement for a program of assistance to seniors or 
to any Canadian through government administration is to make 
sure that they have good, effective service, that it does not take a 
long time, that there are no delays, and that it is a personalized 
service.
<P>
	Under the program we are introducing, because we will be 
able to finally bring management into the modern age through 
the development of new information technologies we will be 
able to have a much speedier system. It gives us more 
opportunity to provide direct personalized service on an 
individual basis through phones or other bases.
<P>
	Surely to goodness in this day and age even the Bloc 
Quebecois is interested in better service.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
why does the federal government insist on attacking senior 
citizens, considering that most of them find it very difficult to 
deal with a system that is so impersonal?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic

absolutely irresponsible. There is nothing we are doing that will 
hurt seniors. By saying those kinds of things in the House the 
hon. member is responsible for spreading false alarms.
<P>
	The fact of the matter is we are bringing in a better program, a 
more efficient, more personalized and more direct service to 
give better service to seniors. We have to ask the hon. member to 
stop spreading that kind of misstatement and misinformation.

	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Health and has been 
inspired by Mrs. Helga Lopp of Prince George, B.C.
<P>
	Mrs. Lopp has been waiting over two years for a vital 
operation to cure a life-threatening condition. Yet, because of 
cutbacks in the operating room assignment times, the one doctor 
capable of performing the operation has a backlog of over 300 
patients.
<P>
	The minister has repeatedly said in the House that the health 
care system in the country is healthy. I do not believe it. 
Reformers do not believe it. Certainly Mrs. Lopp does not 
believe it.
<P>
	Is the Minister of Health prepared to stand in the House today 
and acknowledge that the Canadian health system is not well and 
that bold measures must be taken to restore the health care 
system so that it works in Canada?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am prepared to stand in the House today to say that the 
principles and the values of the Canada Health Act will prevail.
<P>
	I do not believe that any Canadian whose life is threatened 
imminently has had to wait for two years for surgery.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my supplementary question is for the Minister of 
Health. I sent her the letter for her eyes only. She has the letter.
<P>
	Ministers of the crown have stood in the House and have 
stated over and over again that the health care system is based on 
a principle of universality. Stout defenders of this principle who 
ignore the fact that Canadians like Mrs. Lopp are not getting the 
health care they need offer no hope.
<P>
	Does the minister realize that the people who wait in these 
ever growing lines for health care will eventually hold her and 
the government responsible? When will the minister come out 
of hiding-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. Minister of Health.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the hon. member for his question. I want to affirm to all 
Canadians today that the government takes its responsibilities 
very seriously.

	We want to tell all Canadians that yes, their health care system 
will be protected. They will be treated based on their need, not 
on their wants and not on the size of their pocketbooks.

I say to the hon. member that I really do not know because we are

<P>
	We have to find out first of all what we can release in terms of 
the commercial confidentiality. As the hon. member knows, 
VIA does business with both CN and CP. To make a comparison

evidence given in committee yesterday. A hired gun of the 
tobacco industry said that NAFTA might stand in the way of the

introduce plain packaging to discourage the use of cigarettes.
<P>
	What does the government intend to do about this? If it is 
found to be the case and NAFTA does stand in the way of this 
obvious good measure in terms of public health, will the 
government reconsider its support of the North American free 
trade agreement?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am so happy to see the member on his feet, but about the 
question, that is another problem.
<P>
	I do not think NAFTA has a lot to say about the way we should 
control that type of problem in Canada. Sometimes we hear 
things in committee we do not agree with. Evidently the hon.

	<B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans)</B> 
moved that Bill C-29, an act to amend the Coastal Fisheries 
Protection Act, be read the second time and referred to a 
committee.
<P>
	He said: Madam Speaker, I am pleased to rise in my place to 
address the substance and rationale for Bill C-29. In doing so, 
may I express on behalf of the government and all the 
government supporters and as well on behalf of Atlantic 
Canadians, all those who have traditionally depended upon the 
resources of the sea for a livelihood and for a reason to be in 
many of our isolated and rural communities of Atlantic Canada, 
our thanks and appreciation to all members and to all parties in 
the House for the rare show of unanimous support to expedite 
the passage of Bill C-29, an act to amend the Coastal Fisheries 
Protection Act.
<P>
	It is seldom in the life of a Parliament that such a rare show of 
unanimous support is forthcoming in the pursuit of a cause that 
is so worthwhile for all Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1520 ) </B>
<P>
	For generations fishermen have worked hard to make a living. 
It is a very tough existence but a good life from the resources of 
the ocean on the Grand Banks of Newfoundland. All of that is 
threatened today.
<P>
	We confront a very grim question. The question is will a way 
of life that has been sustained for 500 years now survive?
<P>
	Environmental conditions have had a role to play in pushing 
down fish stocks. There are fewer, in fact historically low levels 
of young fish on the Grand Banks today. These fish are growing 
more slowly. They take longer to mature. More are dying 
because of natural causes. Indeed, we have record low levels of 
temperature on the east coast, 65-year record low temperatures. 
Therefore, we have a more natural death of fish stocks.
<P>
	All of these ecological factors are happening today, but these 
factors are only one small part of the resource crisis that we face.
<P>
	Beginning in the mid-1980s there was massive destructive 
overfishing of cod, flounder and other resources on the nose and 
tail of the Grand Banks just outside Canada's 200-mile 
economic zone. The fisheries in this area just outside the 
200-mile limit is regulated by an organization called NAFO, the 
Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization. The catches set by 
NAFO are determined as a consequence of the scientific 
evidence that is gathered from all of the nations that participate 
in fisheries outside our 200-mile limit. Canadian scientists on 
Canadian fisheries patrol vessels, Russian scientists, Japanese 
scientists, European union scientists all collaborate to establish 
what the proper harvesting levels should be to sustain the 
resource. NAFO, as an organization, works collaboratively to 
set quotas and to start harvesting plans in a manner that is 
sustainable.
<P>
	During the 1980s Canada fished within the quotas set by 
NAFO. So did the fleets from most other countries fish within 
the quotas established by NAFO. We did what we thought was 
right then in the mid-1980s. We know now that we took in fact 
too much fish.
<P>
	I have to say here and now that even as we fished within the 
assigned quotas as did many others, the European union in the 
mid-1980s showed no such restraint. The European union as a 
member of NAFO would participate in establishing global 
quotas, would be assigned its share of the quota and then would 
unilaterally establish for itself its own quota and fish according 
to its own fishing plan.
<P>
	Canada and many other nations set out to do the right thing. In 
retrospect it turned out we were not doing the right thing. The 
European union in the mid-1980s set out to do the wrong thing 
and regrettably it succeeded.
<P>
	The heavy overfishing of cod and flounder in the mid-1980s 
severely depleted those resources. It was in the early 1990s that 
nature, because of a changed environmental condition on top of 
the heavy overfishing of the mid-1980s, dealt a second crushing 
blow. These stocks which were depleted, weakened and 
overfished are now in a rate of rapid decline.
<P>
	How many Canadians realize that the once great 2J, 3KL cod 
stock, an important part of the protein, the food basket of the 
planet earth, a cod stock that once sustained the great North 
American fleet, all of the European fleet, the Spanish and 
Portuguese fleet, the Russian fleet, the Japanese fleet, a stock 
that fed a good part of the planet, the once great northern cod 
stock has been decimated and that the spawning biomass of that 
stock since 1989 has declined by 99 per cent. A scant four or five 
years later only 1 per cent of the spawning biomass that existed 
five years ago remains today. This stock is in crisis. This 
resource that belongs to the planet earth is on its last legs today.
<P>
<B>(1525) </B>
<P>
	Man has been slow to realize, but we had better realize soon, 
that we cannot command nature. We can only obey nature. If we 
do not understand that in the context  of fish stocks, we face a 
terrible consequence for our ignorance. We face the commercial 
if not the biological extinction of once massive fish stocks.
<P>
	This could happen to northern cod. It could happen to 
southern Grand Banks cod, 3NO cod, and it could happen to four 
endangered species of flounder as well on the Grand Banks.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4213"> 4213 </A></B>
<P>
	Canada has stopped fishing all of these endangered stocks, 
every one of them. Canada has participated with NAFO in 
putting moratoriums in place, the most recent in February in 
Brussels, to protect 3NO cod. Prior to that, four moratoriums 
were put in place to protect flounder. A moratorium was put in 
place to protect the great northern cod stock that I have just 
described as having been devastated. There is a moratorium in 
place to protect American plaice in area 3M on the Flemish Cap.
<P>
	Within Canada we have not only participated in moratoriums 
to protect straddling stocks, but today as the minister of 
fisheries I preside over 14 moratoriums within Canadian waters. 
We have shut down virtually the entire cod fishery, the entire 
groundfishery of all of Atlantic Canada. We have done all that 
we can in the name of conservation. We have even denied after 
500 years of settlement and existence the right of those who live 
in the Atlantic region to take simple biblical level technology, a 
simple hook and line and fish food for a living.
<P>
	We can do no more than we have done literally in the name of 
conservation. We submit that those who come from distant 
water nations to fish off our shores can do no less than what we 
have imposed upon ourselves.
<P>
	We proposed a bill to give Canada the capacity, authority and 
ability not to extend our jurisdiction out beyond 200 miles, not 
to make a territorial grab, not to expand our economic zone and 
not to pull unto ourselves more territory or water. That is not 
Canada's nature. It is not Canada's way. It is not part of our 
history. It is not part of our culture. We have never been an 
expansionist power or some kind of imperialistic power.
<P>
	We propose a measure today to give us the ability to enforce 
the conservation measures necessary to protect endangered 
species not just for ourselves but for the world.
<P>
	Overfishing has occurred on the nose and tail of the Grand 
Banks, overfishing on occasion by Canadian fleets. Let us have 
the courage, the integrity and the honesty to admit that and stop 
that overfishing. We have demonstrated in the last months that 
where a Canadian vessel breaks the rules Canada shall reach out 
the long arm of its enforcement power and impose proper 
conservation measures. A month ago we went out 300 miles to 
arrest the <I>Stephen B</I>, a Canadian tuna boat fishing against 
ICCAT rules, to protect bluefin tuna, a highly migratory species. 
We went out 228 miles to arrest the <I>Kristina Logos</I>, a Canadian 
registered vessel catching  3NO cod.  We are not asking the 
world to accept a standard that we do not impose upon ourselves 
first.
<P>
<B>(1530) </B>
<P>
	The vessels overfishing on the nose and tail of the Grand 
Banks can be divided into two rough categories, those that 
belong to the multilateral organization that I described earlier, 
NAFO, that fish within NAFO quotas and according to NAFO 
rules within a NAFO management plan, and those that do not.
<P>
	A moment go I said that European vessels in the mid-1980s 
did not abide by NAFO's rules even when a member of NAFO. 
Even today some European vessels do not comply fully with the 
rules but by and large the quotas and the management plan set by 
NAFO are complied with by European union vessels.
<P>
	While we occasionally have differences, we have the means 
as a member of NAFO to settle those differences by agreement 
and within an existing management structure.
<P>
	May I say there is nothing so unholy, nothing so repulsive, 
nothing more predatory than the spectacle of tying up Canadian 
fishermen, tying up Canadian boats, closing down Canadian fish 
plants, wiping out the very reason for existence of Canadian 
coastal communities in the name of conservation, and even as 
that sacrifice is made to restore this resource for future 
generations, watching a handful of what we call flag of 
convenience pirate vessels targeting those same endangered 
species that we Canadians have set aside to be saved to rebuild 
this fragile resource. I say to the pirates their day has come and 
we are going to stop that kind of predatory action. We are going 
to stop that kind of exploitation.
<P>
	Why? Because we have some desire to be in conflict on the 
high seas? Not at all. It is contrary to our nature. Because we 
have some macho desire to flex our muscles on the high seas? 
Not at all. It is contrary to our nature, to our history.
<P>
	We hope that we as a House of Commons who have come 
together to produce this legislation, unanimously proposed, 
unanimously supported, unanimously implemented, will not 
have to move against a single vessel. We hope that those who 
make exploitation, risk capital, their gain, will understand that 
their best course of action is to pull up gear and leave.
<P>
	We do not want to confront a single vessel on the high seas. 
We do not want to arrest a single vessel on the high seas. We do 
not want to interfere with a single crew, wherever it comes from, 
whatever flag of convenience it flies on the high seas. But we 
will confront and we will arrest and we will seize and we will 
prosecute each and every one if they do not pull up their nets and 
leave the zone.
<P>
	Last month Canada arrested a Canadian registered vessel, the 
<I>Kristina Logos</I>, 228 miles out. The vessel was flying the 
Panamanian flag, with a crew from Portugal. We towed it into 
port in St. John's.
<P>
	Do you know what we found? We found over 100 tons of 
product aboard that freezer vessel. Do you know what else we 
found? We found nets with something close to legal mesh size. 
Of course a legal mesh size would allow a small juvenile or baby 
fish to escape because it could swim through the mesh. Yet 
aboard that boat were 100 tons of juvenile cod, juvenile 
flounder, and juvenile redfish. I was down in the hold of that 
boat. I want to tell my colleagues that I saw not a single fish of 
the 100 tons in that hold that was bigger than the palm of my 
hand. I want you to stop and think about that. Not a single fish 
aboard that vessel was longer than the palm of my hand.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4214"> 4214 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1535) </B>
<P>
	Those who come from Atlantic Canada know when you are 
catching those kinds of fish you are slaughtering the species. It 
is a crime against humanity. It is a crime against an important 
resource that belongs not to a single nation but to the planet. 
That is what was found in the hold of that vessel.
<P>
	You ask yourself, how can they catch such a small fish? It 
looks more like it belongs in the aquarium at home, not in the 
hold of a commercial fishing vessel. How is it done? Then 
fisheries officers uncover what is called a liner. Inside the legal 
sized fishing gear is put a liner so that everything that swims 
into that net is being held inside it. Nothing can escape, not 
juvenile fish, not any species. Everything goes into the hold of 
the boat.
<P>
	Who are these people? The people who own these vessels see 
them as an opportunity to make profit. These are people who do 
not have the mentality of fishermen. Fishermen believe you 
must harvest the sea as a farmer does his land. A farmer knows 
you must sustain the fields. You must leave them to lie fallow on 
occasion. You must replant a different product from time to 
time. You must sustain the power of the fields to produce crops.
<P>
	The ocean is no different. It cannot be exploited, it must be 
harvested. You must catch fish in such a way as to leave the 
young, let them grow older, let them reproduce. You move your 
effort from fragile stocks on to healthier stocks.
<P>
	Not these vessels, not these pirates, not these flags of 
convenience or stateless vessels. No, they do not have the mind 
of a farmer or a fisherman, they have the mind of a miner. Take 
the resource. That is understandable in mining, it is not 
renewable, it is not sustainable. You take the resource, mine it, 
clean it out and then move on.
<P>
	That is not acceptable to Canada. That is why Canada as 
represented by all of its political parties today will act in record 
time to pass this bill.
<P>
	Our legislation says: ``The bill will enable Canada to take the 
urgent action necessary to prevent further destruction of 
straddling stocks and to permit their rebuilding while 
continuing to seek effective international solutions''.
<P>
	Lest anyone be in doubt, let me affirm once again three 
fundamental commitments by the Government of Canada. First, 
Canada is committed to the rule of international law. Second, 
Canada's goal remains effective international controls over high 
seas fishing. Third, the Government of Canada will use the 
powers under this legislation only where other means to protect 
threatened straddling stocks have failed.
<P>
	Our commitment to the third principle is no less strong than 
our commitment to the first two; that is, the rule of law and our 
desire to seek effective international controls to deal with the 
problems of high seas fishing.
<P>
	That is why even as we propose a measure that allows us to go 
beyond 200 miles and to use the force required to ensure that 
NAFO conservation rules and other conservation measures are 
respected, we continue to work at the UN Conference on High 
Seas Fishing which will undertake its third session in August in 
New York to seek a permanent solution to the problem of 
overfishing.
<P>
	The measures we take today under Bill C-29 are an interim 
measure, a temporary measure. They are necessary now because 
if we do not act those fish stocks will disappear, perhaps forever.
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
	The world needs, and Canada needs, not a temporary solution 
taken by one nation but a permanent solution taken by all nations 
under the auspices of the UN. That is why Canada has worked 
hard at the UN both last summer and again this spring and we 
will do so again in August to get a new convention on high seas 
fishing.
<P>
	I say to those people in Atlantic Canada who ask if it is too 
late, no, it is not too late. We can build this resource. It takes the 
commitment not of a single province, not of a single region, not 
of a particular group of people, but the commitment of a nation. 
I say to those people in Atlantic Canada who believe that their 
country has abandoned them in this crisis and that Canadians 
elsewhere in Ontario or Quebec or British Columbia, 
Saskatchewan or Manitoba do not know or do not care about this 
crisis, it is not true.
<P>
	This is a particularly proud day for me, not as Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans but as a member of Parliament from 
Newfoundland. I have been here for 14 years. I stand here today 
in an emergency debate and look across and see colleagues from 
every party and from every part of Canada who give the 
confidence that this measure is supported. The country does care 
and does have the will to solve this problem.
<P>
	I would like to acknowledge the work over many years to raise 
the consciousness of the nation to this crisis of all the Atlantic 
premiers. Members would understand if I were particularly to 
acknowledge the work of Premier Wells of Newfoundland. He 
went across this country to raise the consciousness of the nation 
about this problem.
<P>
	Members would understand as well if I said that it takes a 
Prime Minister with vision, it takes a Prime  Minister with 
courage and it takes a Prime Minister with great integrity to 
have said during the heat of an election campaign that Canada 
will act and to have delivered during the calm of the first serious 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4215"> 4215 </A></B>
<P>
and sober days of government the ability to act. I thank our 
Prime Minister.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta):</B> Madam Speaker, the minister 
has requested that Parliament act expeditiously in passing this 
bill. I am curious as to when we can expect this act to come into 
force.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Tobin:</B> Madam Speaker, if the House gives passage to 
this measure today-and we have had some discussions with all 
of the parties and I acknowledge that and thank them for 
it-then the matter will be referred to the Senate as early as 
tomorrow.
<P>
	It is up to the Senate. It is its own creature, of course, its own 
authority. If it considers this bill as quickly as tomorrow it could 
pass and be given royal assent tomorrow, which I think would be 
almost a record passage of any bill before this Parliament. We 
would publish the regulations within a week and I can tell you 
we will be enforcing them very soon afterward.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cummins:</B> Madam Speaker, at this time the minister did 
not acknowledge that Canada is renegotiating the Pacific 
salmon treaty with the United States.
<P>
	I am curious. The minister is taking unilateral action on the 
east coast with this bill. Is it in any way likely to jeopardize 
relations with the United States and in particular the 
negotiations which are ongoing on the salmon treaty between 
Canada and the United States on the west coast?
<P>
<B>(1545 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Tobin:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the member for the 
question. I think he has asked a very important and relevant 
question. I am glad he has raised it and has given me the 
opportunity to respond.
<P>
	I had lunch today with a very enjoyable luncheon companion, 
the American ambassador. I did so for two reasons. First I 
wanted to have the opportunity to raise a number of outstanding 
issues, one of which was the issue of the Argentia base in 
Newfoundland and the American closedown of that base. We 
wanted to ensure there were reasonable conditions for the 
American departure there.
<P>
	The second reason was that I wanted to talk specifically about 
the bill, what it does and what it does not do, to assure our 
friends and colleagues south of the border that we have a bill that 
is targeted at a particular problem which needs to be addressed. I 
thought there was certainly-I will not comment on the 
American formal response-some understanding for the plight 
we face. We had a separate discussion on the whole question of 
the Pacific salmon treaty.
<P>
	I made very clear to the American ambassador, as did the 
Prime Minister when he spoke to the president a few weeks ago, 
that the successful conclusion of a salmon  plan with our friends, 
the United States, is urgent and important for Canada.
<P>
	I can assure the member there is no connection nor was any 
connection drawn by the American ambassador between the bill 
and its provisions and the separate question on the Pacific 
salmon treaty that we are attempting to resolve.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé):</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to 
start with a question and at the same time congratulate the 
minister for agreeing to answer questions, because I know that 
on a motion or a bill like this at second reading, ministers do not 
have to take questions, so I want to praise his courage. At the 
same time-I will have to repeat it later-we will support this 
motion.
<P>
	The minister talked about the harsh decisions recently made 
by Canada concerning the closure of 14 fish stocks in Canadian 
waters. I myself favour sustainable harvesting and, when it is no 
longer sustainable, I agree with the minister that we must take 
all necessary measures and impose a moratorium.
<P>
	However, the minister has been in office for nearly six months 
now and not all stocks are threatened to the same extent. I want 
to ask the minister this: If some stocks should recover a little 
more quickly, will we allow at least some exploratory fisheries, 
so that the new selective gear being produced can be used and 
several species can be harvested. The Bloc Quebecois even 
made a few suggestions in this regard.
<P>
	I would just like the minister to comment on this and remind 
him that even if the motion to end over-fishing was tabled by the 
Liberals, the Bloc Quebecois did not hesitate to support this 
project because it was a good idea. I want to make sure that, if 
some good questions or ideas come from Quebec, the minister 
will not hesitate to support them either.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Tobin:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the member for his 
question and acknowledge his long involvement and interest in 
matters having to do with the fishery. The member has had a 
career in advance of coming into the House dealing with the 
fishery and fishermen in the province of Quebec.
<P>
	The member has suggested that wherever possible and 
wherever stocks warrant we need to have exploratory fisheries, 
developmental fisheries or test fisheries. I totally agree with the 
member and would say to him that even in areas where we have a 
moratorium it is important for us to have some sentinel or test 
fisheries under way. In addition to the scientific evidence there 
is no better solid base of information for what is happening than 
to have an experienced fishing crew in a boat on the water 
conducting these test fisheries.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4216"> 4216 </A></B>
<P>
	I totally concur with his suggestion. It is my intention to have 
such test fisheries occurring everywhere. The moratorium 
would continue. The commercial aspect of the fishery would 
continue. Having a few boats here and there to try to develop 
underutilized species or test the circumstance with respect to 
stocks in the moratorium is a sensible suggestion. I tell the 
member that the intention is to put the scientists and the 
fishermen shoulder to shoulder in the same boats working 
together. We have to close the gap of suspicion and mistrust 
between fishermen and scientists by having them work together.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	I want to make another point. I acknowledge with great joy 
and enthusiasm the quick support of the Bloc Quebecois, just as 
we have had quick and strong support from the Reform Party.
<P>
	My friend from Delta is also someone who had experience in 
the fishery before he came into the House. He was a fishermen 
for many years and knows the industry well.
<P>
	I acknowledge the support of the Bloc Quebecois. I 
acknowledge the instinctive quick reaction to support a sound 
policy. I tell my hon. colleagues that I look forward, 
notwithstanding their wishes in other areas, to spending many 
years working with them in the House in the interest of Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joe McGuire (Egmont):</B> Madam Speaker, I too 
congratulate the minister for introducing the legislation today. It 
is just one more step in a lot of decisions the minister has been 
making over the past seven months. There have been more 
decisions made over the past seven months than have been made 
over the past seven years.
<P>
	I congratulate him on his very active efforts on behalf of the 
people of Atlantic Canada and on behalf of the people of his 
province. Many of his fellow citizens in Newfoundland are not 
going to fish for quite a number of years and some will never 
fish again. For Newfoundlanders I suspect that is a sentence of 
death. They are giving up and losing an awful lot for the sins we 
have committed in the past, both ourselves and people from 
other parts of the world.
<P>
	I see by the map that the legislation covers the nose and tail of 
the Grand Bank. Adjacent to it is the Flemish Cap, a very 
important breeding ground for cod and other groundfish.
<P>
	Could the minister explain why the legislation stops short of 
the Flemish Cap and whether he has confidence that NAFO with 
the agreements he secured a month and a half ago is in a position 
to police that area?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Tobin:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the member for his 
question. It is a very good question and gives me an opportunity 
to make a couple of things clear that are perhaps less than clear.
<P>
	The legislation gives Parliament of Canada the authority to 
designate any class of vessel for enforcement of conservation 
measures. The legislation does not categorize whom we would 
enforce against. The legislation makes clear that any vessel 
fishing in a manner inconsistent with good, widely 
acknowledged conservation rules could be subject to action by 
Canada. We cite as an example the NAFO conservation rules. 
Any vessel from any nation fishing at variance with good 
conservation rules could under the authority granted in the 
legislation be subject to action by Canada. There are no 
exceptions.
<P>
	The government and I have said that we will stop foreign 
overfishing, not foreign fishing forever but improper fishing 
practices. We have said we will do it by agreement where it is 
possible to reach agreement and by unilateral action where 
unilateral action is necessary.
<P>
	We believe we have the means. We hope we have the will and 
the measures within the NAFO regime for NAFO to police itself, 
for NAFO to take the steps required, and for NAFO member 
states to police their own vessels. We are a member state of 
NAFO. We believe that Canada can police Canadian vessels. We 
believe that all other NAFO member states can and should do the 
same. Our expectation is that they will do the same. If one is a 
party to an agreement one should want to see that the agreement 
is lived up to fully.
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	What we do not have is the capacity to make an agreement 
with flag of convenience vessels or with stateless vessels 
because they belong to no organization.
<P>
	In answering the member's question let me say that the areas 
outlined on the map are NAFO regulatory areas. They cover 
straddling stocks and stocks regulated by NAFO. The area that is 
not outlined on the map, including the Flemish Cap, is not part 
of the straddling stocks that affect Canada. That is why we have 
not claimed any territory beyond those affected or covered by 
our own straddling stocks.
<P>
	As I said, this is not an extension of jurisdiction; this is a 
conservation regime that we are introducing today.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé):</B> Madam Speaker, as the Minister 
of Fisheries mentioned, the Official Opposition does support the 
bill. However, we would like to add a few words and say 
ourselves that we do support the minister's legislation.
<P>
	This bill will allow the Governor in Council-for me in 
French it means the cabinet-to make regulations concerning 
straddling stocks, the classes of foreign fishing vessels to which 
the prohibition will apply, and the conservation and 
management measures with which these vessels must comply.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4217"> 4217 </A></B>
<P>
	These measures have also been formulated by Canada in the 
context of NAFO, and I think they were supported by the 
majority. Indeed, they did receive the support of a majority of 
members. I guess you cannot go against common sense, and I 
think that Canada is well-advised to put its Coast Guard and its 
national defence system, if necessary, at NAFO's disposal for 
surveillance and monitoring purposes over that organization's 
fishing area.
<P>
	As I said, the Bloc Quebecois supports this government 
initiative. As I also mentioned yesterday at a press conference, 
after the Minister of Fisheries made his speech, I believe this is a 
good compromise between diplomacy and enforcement or other 
monitoring measures. This legislation will empower the 
minister to use force but, at the same time -as we will see later 
on in Committee of the Whole-, we will ask the minister and 
the cabinet to make sure that this retaliatory tool will be used 
with discretion. To that end, the Attorney General will have to 
give his consent and authorize the arrest of fishing vessels.
<P>
	As I said, the Bloc Quebecois believes that international 
agreements negotiated in the context of NAFO must be 
respected. Canada will now be able to take action and arrest 
those fishing vessels flying a flag of convenience, which are 
commonly called stateless vessels. According to the law of the 
sea-Madam Speaker, I always have a hard time with that 
law-a vessel which does not fly a flag is a pirate vessel. Canada 
will be able to arrest these vessels, even outside its territorial 
waters, but inside the waters which are part of NAFO's 
regulatory area.
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	In the bill under consideration, we have the improved version 
of the Coastal Fisheries Protection Act which was amended in 
the House by Bill C-8. The Bloc Quebecois, at the time this bill, 
which is now a law, was passed, unless the other Chamber or the 
other place, as one should say, has not yet disposed of it, said it 
was concerned about the expressions regarding measures that 
might be taken ``to disable -a vessel'' and the use of ``the force 
that is necessary.'' Very soon, in Committee of the Whole, I will 
ask whether the Cabinet is now prepared to tell us the definition 
of these words, even if the Minister assures us in advance that 
this Act will be applied with great discrimination.
<P>
	I would also like to add that Bill C-29 is also a means for the 
Bloc Quebecois to show its desire to be a positive element in 
Canada. We in the Bloc Quebecois know the points on which we 
disagree with Canadians, but our position here will let 
Canadians know the points on which we can agree. And this the 
Minister also pointed out a little while ago.
<P>
	In this regard, I was given an opportunity to speak a little 
about sovereignty. Even the journalists asked me the question: 
What political gain is there for the Bloc Quebecois in these 
measures? There is no political gain.  It is out of maturity, as 
people, that we say yes to measures that must be taken at the 
international level to protect the world heritage. And in the 
context of sovereignty, since I had begun to speak of it, the Bloc 
Quebecois has made some suggestions. And when Quebec 
becomes sovereign, we too will be a member state able to take 
part in NAFO. Consequently, we would like to reassure the 
Minister of Fisheries that a sovereign Quebec will also comply 
with NAFO's management rules. It is in this sense that the Bloc 
Quebecois is expressing its support today in the House of 
Commons.
<P>
	As I or the Minister said, it is rare for all the parties to agree so 
quickly on a bill. The Minister said yesterday that it was a way 
for all Canadians to speak in a single voice, but as I said a 
moment ago, even if Quebec were sovereign, Quebec and 
Canada would also have spoken in a single voice in the issue at 
hand.
<P>
	Why did the Bloc Quebecois accede so quickly to the 
Minister's request? We did so because we are also aware of the 
fact that Canada has exhausted all of the diplomatic avenues at 
its disposal. As the Minister said, I worked in the fisheries sector 
for a number of years, and I know that action was taken. Many 
successive deputy ministers took action. There were even 
ambassadors who are now sitting in this House who were 
involved in these activities. We therefore saw what was coming.
<P>
	We are pleased once again to see that the government has 
managed to achieve an honourable compromise in this matter. I 
will try to go faster because, in any event, we have made our 
agreement known. I will just try to go over the points in order to 
be very sure of the rationale behind them.
<P>
	Here is another important point that I would like to raise. We 
realize that, while increasing the size of the area to be monitored 
beyond the 200-mile limit, we will still cover an area slightly 
smaller than the area managed by NAFO. This may require 
increasing marine or air surveillance. When we increase this 
kind of thing, it may mean increased costs as well. As these 
decisions are made, I would expect the minister to suggest to 
Cabinet that they use the tools they have, including National 
Defence and the Coast Guard, and at the same time try to 
minimize costs by using these resources efficiently. We must not 
forget that foreign overfishing is only one of the reasons why 
fish stocks have gone down. The minister also mentioned 
climatic conditions as a contributing factor.
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
	We must make sure that we have enough money left to initiate 
what I would call an industrial diversification strategy. The 
minister said that we must rebuild fish stocks, and I agree, but in 
fact, we are going to give nature a chance to do the job.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4218"> 4218 </A></B>
<P>
	A while ago, I made a few suggestions to the minister, and I 
think there are still some areas where the Bloc Quebecois and 
the Liberal Party can work together. We will have to consider 
this new approach to fisheries. Using the best selective fishing 
devices to catch the stocks we want to catch also means setting 
up land-based infrastructures to receive the catch.
<P>
	If we look at the history of fisheries, first it was salt fish 
because there was no other way to preserve fish. With the advent 
of refrigeration, we started to produce frozen blocks, but now 
the market seems to be saturated. Considering the absence of 
fish from Canada, I would have expected an increase in the price 
of fish in the United States, our main customer, but I did not 
notice any increase in prices, which means there have been 
substitutions.
<P>
	There are other countries that sell other kinds of fish, even 
cod, and they have moved into our markets. This means that 
when we start fishing again, we will have to be very creative and 
look to market niches such as fresh fish. These are things we can 
do now, because we have the requisite transportation 
infrastructures. We have airports in Newfoundland, the Gaspé, 
New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island, so that we can reach 
our markets very quickly.
<P>
	I will leave a list of suggestions for the minister and his 
deputy ministers, and I think we should use these five years to 
make a start with these strategies because the $1.9 billion that is 
now on the table to support the fisheries strategy is mainly 
income support for the fishermen, in my opinion. On this score, 
we have some differences of opinion with the Liberals because 
when we in Quebec speak of manpower training, we would 
prefer that this area come under provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	If the minister wants us to agree somewhat more on this issue 
as well, perhaps he could transfer the fisheries envelope directly 
to the Quebec Department of Fisheries, as this would allow us to 
adapt programs to the way things are done in Quebec. Exchanges 
of technology and know-how could be made between Canada 
and Quebec. It could be amusing to have a little competition in 
this area. I apologize for injecting a touch of humour into the 
proceedings, but sometimes it makes a bitter pill somewhat 
easier to swallow.
<P>
	One final comment about the $1.9 billion envelope. I 
mentioned being opened to ideas, but we do have some concerns 
at the present time. Perhaps I did not explain clearly a while ago 
the reason why we are not receptive right now to the idea of 
putting in place dockside reception infrastructures. Until now, 
vessels were specialized factory freezer-trawlers. What we 
need to do is set up markets at the unloading points in order to 
make use as quickly as possible of species classified as 
underutilized. They are underutilized because the volume 
caught is marginal. Now that cod and flounder stocks have 
declined, monk fish and skate tails will be very important. I 
wanted to re-emphasize this point to make  certain that the 
government listens to this idea, because we need to develop 
strategies geared to the industrial sector concept. This is one 
such example.
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	In conclusion-
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I will say in my own voice because I want all Canadians to 
hear me that the Bloc Quebecois will support the bill. We want to 
be sure that all foreign vessels that want to overfish will be 
stopped. It does not matter if Canada has to fight under 
international law because we have a good reason to make that 
kind of case if some countries want to fight against us.
<P>
	I am not the minister but the speech I made is an 
encouragement and if he does not do his job in the future, I will 
check.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	For the benefit of my francophone friends, let me repeat that 
the Bloc Quebecois supports this motion because it considers 
the foreign fishing now taking place to be outrageous. The 
minister mentioned it and the deputy ministers painted a picture 
of the situation for me this week. We are no longer talking about 
the haphazard catching of small fish. We are now dealing with 
deliberate attempts to catch small fish. When we speak of small 
fish the size of the minister's hand-we could have a minister 
with large hands, but that is not the case-this means that fish 
too small to reproduce are being caught. We can no longer 
tolerate this situation.
<P>
	Speaking for the Bloc Quebecois, I support this bill and 
applaud the fact that it will be passed very quickly.
<P>

<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I understand the hon. 
member for Regina-Lumsden has switched his presentation 
time with the member for Delta.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden):</B> Madam Speaker, 
yes. First of all I would like to express my appreciation to the 
member for Delta for allowing me to speak first. I have a plane 
to catch shortly and I want to say a very few brief words on 
behalf of the New Democratic Party caucus.
<P>
	First of all as the fisheries and oceans critic for the New 
Democratic Party I would like to inform the government that our 
caucus does support Bill C-29. I would also like to say that we 
do not just support the bill, we would also like to commend the 
government on the legislation tabled yesterday in the House of 
Commons. I would like to offer my personal congratulations to 
the minister for his very impassioned plea and his very articulate 
speech this afternoon in support of this bill and in defence of 
Canada and its responsibility to protect this very important 
national and renewable resource.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4219"> 4219 </A></B>
<P>
	It is high time that the fragile straddling stocks, those species 
which swim inside and outside the 200-mile limit in the nose 
and tail area of the Grand Banks, are protected from foreign 
vessel overfishing.
<P>
	The previous government under Brian Mulroney allowed this 
situation to go on for far too long without acting in the best 
interests of the fishery and the best interests of Canada. I am 
very pleased to see the Liberal government taking action to 
protect these endangered stocks which have been very 
significantly depleted over the years, in particular from 
so-called flag of convenience plundering. It is our hope the bill 
will ultimately help the fishery as well as the depleted stocks.
<P>
	I have spoken with fishermen and other contacts in the eastern 
provinces. The general consensus is that people are very pleased 
to see this long overdue legislation. There is some concern 
however about whether the legislation goes far enough since 
there are foreign vessels fishing off the 200-mile limit under 
flags such as Spain and Portugal and not just flags of 
convenience.
<P>
	My question to the minister during the course of the review 
would be will the government be able to deal with these vessels 
as well? My sense is that these sorts of restrictions will be 
imposed on members of the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries 
Organization. The minister has affirmed that this legislation 
will address this very important question to those people in 
Atlantic Canada.
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	Also I hope the government will back up this legislation with 
the resources necessary to enforce it, in particular by having 
enough personnel and equipment to monitor the situation on a 
regular full time basis.
<P>
	Having just met with members of the United Fishermen and 
Allied Workers' Union from the west coast of Canada, I am 
aware of the history of government mismanagement of the 
fisheries resource on the west coast by the previous government 
as well.
<P>
	Besides concerns regarding stock management there is a 
burning concern, and I would even say a raging debate, 
regarding the Department of Fisheries and Oceans licensing 
policy as witnessed recently in the roe herring fishery. 
Corporate boat owners, or armchair fishermen as they are 
called, are being allowed to rent their licences to active 
fishermen who pay exorbitant prices to lease the licence for a 
specific fishery.
<P>
	The Government of Canada has not officially recognized 
these rental practices but at the local level DFO officials 
sanction them. This is a very serious situation in licensing which 
is destructive to the fishery industry, not to mention the loss in 
revenue to the government from licensing.
<P>
	The point is that I hope the government will not just stop here 
with Bill C-29. It is our hope in the New Democratic Party that 
the government will learn from this situation on the east coast 
and will not leave the  situation on the west coast to deteriorate 
to the point at which it is beyond help.
<P>
	We as New Democrats hope that the lesson in this terrible 
condition on the east coast will ensure that the west coast fishery 
is protected for future generations of Canadians. In summary, 
the New Democratic Party in the House of Commons supports 
this bill. We will facilitate its quick passage in this House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta):</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to 
acknowledge the co-operation we have received from the 
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans on a variety of issues 
concerning the fisheries. He has been most helpful and we do 
appreciate it. That being said, our job is not to be a cheerleader 
for the minister; rather our job here is to point out what we feel 
are shortcomings in government legislation, if there be any. 
That is what we are about to do.
<P>
	We clearly agree in principle with this bill and will support it. 
Taking action on foreign fishing is long overdue. We suggest 
that if this action had been taken 10 years ago we might not have 
had the tragedy we have on our hands now.
<P>
	The bill was tabled in the House yesterday morning; I was 
only briefed on it late yesterday afternoon. We want to support 
this bill because we believe it imperative that action be taken. 
However it is difficult to do so entirely when we have not had 
time to fully investigate the consequences of the bill.
<P>
	The minister has said the bill must be passed quickly because 
it is an emergency situation. This has been an emergency 
situation for years. The government did not just compose the bill 
last night. We could have presented constructive criticism which 
might have made the bill a better one if we had been brought into 
the process at an earlier date.
<P>
	The function of Parliament is to debate issues so that the best 
possible solution is developed. We question whether the best 
possible solution has been reached with this bill. We sincerely 
hope this bill will achieve the desired results but we are not 
confident it will. This is a serious move the government is 
making and there will be no turning back.
<P>
	In a news release yesterday DFO stated: ``in February 1994 
NAFO reviewed the 3NO cod stock at Canada's request. It 
imposed an international moratorium on this stock''. The news 
release went on to say: ``Fishing activities by vessels that carry 
flags of convenience and by several stateless vessels are 
conducted without regard for international conservation 
controls. Such vessels are targeting fish stocks now subject to 
NAFO and Canadian moratoria''.
<P>
	To ensure the international moratoria was adhered to, Canada, 
along with the European Community, Japan and Russia 
participated in a high level joint demarche to non-NAFO states 
fishing in the NAFO area requesting them to stop fishing.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4220"> 4220 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1620 ) </B>
<P>
	This action had been agreed to by the participants of the 
September 1993 NAFO annual meeting. Meetings took place in 
Panama and Honduras in February with both governments and 
the principal suppliers of the so-called flags of convenience 
undertaking to address the problem on a priority basis.
<P>
	The violators had agreed to act. Rather than acting 
unilaterally, would Canada have been better off to go back to 
NAFO and obtain its support for police action to enforce the 
conservation measures which NAFO had agreed to? We ask this 
because we cannot help but wonder what the consequences of 
enacting this legislation will be, in that we will be acting 
unilaterally.
<P>
	Will this bill be supported by the international community? 
Will this bill set a precedent and therefore give licence to 
countries that may not be as reasonable as Canada to extend their 
own jurisdiction into international waters? Is giving this licence 
in the best interests of Canada? Will this bill be viewed by the 
U.S. as being in its best interests? We are curious as to what the 
U.S. view is of this bill. If the U.S. has a negative view, as I 
suggested, will it have any effect on the current negotiations 
under way on the west coast salmon treaty? I am concerned that 
the government has not fully thought through this bill and the 
possible consequences.
<P>
	The joint news release issued yesterday by the Ministry of 
Fisheries and Oceans and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs states 
that the ongoing process to strengthen the high seas fisheries 
conservation is currently focused on two recent major 
developments.
<P>
	One is the compliance agreement approved in November 1993 
by the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization. This 
agreement requires that its parties control their vessels to 
prevent any activity that undermines conservation measures 
established by regional fisheries conservation organizations 
such as NAFO.
<P>
	The other major development cited in the news release is the 
United Nations conference on straddling fish stocks and highly 
migratory fish stocks which has been under way since 1993. It is 
aimed at developing new global rules to prevent high seas 
overfishing of the stocks concerned. It is scheduled to enter its 
final negotiating session in August of this year.
<P>
	What the news release fails to mention is the lead role Canada 
played in negotiating the FAO agreement. It fails to mention the 
lead role Canada played in the decision to convene the United 
Nations conference on straddling fish stocks and highly 
migratory fish stocks. It also does not mention the lead role 
Canada is continuing to play to bring these critical and 
important negotiations to a meaningful conclusion this summer.
<P>
	Will this unilateral action on Canada's part jeopardize these 
developments? Will this unilateral action encourage other 
nations to throw caution to the wind and exert territorial 
jurisdiction beyond the 200-mile limit?
<P>
	What assurance can the minister give Canadians that the 
proposed legislation will be supported by the international 
community? The implementation of Bill C-29 is dependent on 
co-operation and support of the international community. 
Without that, it is no more than a whistle in the wind.
<P>
	At the same time that the minister threatens action against 
foreign vessels outside the 200-mile limit, we question the level 
of enforcement within Canadian waters. Perhaps no action 
better exemplifies the government's real intentions and 
priorities than the actions it has taken in the last few months to 
conserve stocks within our own 200-mile limit.
<P>
	I am thinking of yesterday's hearing of the Standing 
Committee on Fisheries and Oceans in which we heard from 
fisheries observers who had been thrown out of work by the 
government. These observers are our first line of defence 
against overfishing within Canadian waters. Without 
experienced observers we have no way of knowing whether 
vessels within our waters are dumping undersized fish 
intentionally, catching the last few remaining juvenile cod in 
our waters or accidentally catching a second species that may 
already be overfished.
<P>
	Talk about catching pirates makes good headlines. But why 
did the government undermine the only program with ears, eyes 
and teeth to conserve our fish stocks, the observer program?
<P>
<B>(1625 ) </B>
<P>
	In February the government selected a firm to take over the 
observer program effective April 1. By the end of March it was 
clear to the government that the company was not able to 
provide the experienced certified observers, but it went ahead 
anyway.
<P>
	The tender process had been organized such that the winning 
contractor would be required to use certified observers who had 
extensive experience in the offshore on foreign vessels. The 
tender required the contractor to submit a list of 30 experienced 
observers on April 1 and a final 20 on April 30. The winning 
company, Biorex, was not required to comply with these tender 
requirements to produce experienced observers and the results 
are already being felt.
<P>
	The silver hake fishery is now open. The minister has 
authorized Cuban and other foreign vessels to undertake this 
fishery in our waters. Yesterday the committee heard that we 
have Cuban vessels in Canadian waters manned by 
inexperienced observers, observers who have never been 
involved in the silver hake fishery before but more important, 
who have never undertaken work on foreign vessels in an often 
hostile environment.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4221"> 4221 </A></B>
<P>
	If an airport control tower were staffed by inexperienced 
controllers, we would know very quickly the sad results. The 
seas however are silent. We do not know if the Cuban vessels are 
taking a cod bycatch or dumping unwanted species at sea. We do 
know that their careless actions have led to the destruction of 
fish gear of Nova Scotia fishermen.
<P>
	Problems have already arisen with vessels from Nova Scotia 
in 3-O, an area adjacent to the tail of the bank, an area 
specifically covered by Bill C-29. Just last week there were 
reports of Scotia Fundy vessels in 3-O without observers. 
Newfoundland vessels in the same area manned by observers 
were directed to leave the area because their cod bycatch was 
over 11 per cent, which is over twice the allowable limit.
<P>
	The same reports indicated that vessels without observers 
appeared to have dumped their catch of undersized redfish 
overboard. Neighbouring ships reported sailing through three or 
four miles of waters covered by dead juvenile redfish.
<P>
	Is it that Biorex cannot find enough observers to provide 
adequate coverage for Scotia Fundy vessels or is it that DFO 
does not consider it a priority to have observers on vessels in 3-0 
where cod bycatch is often twice the allowable limit?
<P>
	In an unrelated case the court in Bridgewater, Nova Scotia 
levied fines against two Scotia Fundy skippers in the last few 
weeks. The captains had dumped their cod bycatch of some 
22,000 kilograms while fishing in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. 
There were no observers aboard the vessels.
<P>
	I believe if the minister tabled in this House the coverage 
records and the number of days at sea over the past four years for 
the observer program, the records would show a declining 
number of sea days by observers and inadequate coverage.
<P>
	This is the nuts and bolts of our conservation effort. It does 
not make headlines like stories of promised action against 
pirates by our naval frigates, but it is the story of our 
government and how it has failed to conserve our fish stocks.
<P>
	Observers did not use expensive equipment or cost a great 
deal of money, but they were effective. I ask the minister to 
strengthen and protect a program that he knows works, a little 
program that works effectively to protect our dwindling 
groundfish stocks.
<P>
	Officials from the Department of Fisheries and Oceans and 
Department of Foreign Affairs have been careful to point out 
that Canada was not extending its jurisdiction with Bill C-29 but 
merely extending the protection to an endangered fishery. 
Despite this unilateral action Canada is still committed to 
bilateral and multilateral negotiations on managing fish stocks 
in international waters.
<P>
	While Reform members agree in principle with the 
government's action, we are concerned that through a  unilateral 
action Canada's role in the delicate ongoing multilateral 
negotiations through the UN and NAFO may have already been 
adversely affected. Also we are concerned about the 
implications of this action on the delicate negotiations currently 
under way to establish a new Pacific coast salmon treaty with the 
United States. Obviously the government's actions change 
Canada's negotiating framework in these different sets of 
negotiations.
<P>
	While we give the government our support on this critical 
conservation issue, we would have preferred a multilateral 
approach to this uncertain unilateral action.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé):</B> Madam Chairman, this is my 
first Committee of the Whole. We are talking about clause 5, on 
page 4, with reference to section 8.1 of the Coastal Fisheries 
Protection Act, right? There was something I wanted to know. 
Perhaps someone could enlighten me. When section 8.1 was 
amended, the Cabinet was to provide definitions in the 
regulations. I wanted to know what the meaning of ``disable'' 
was and how far that could go.
<P>
	Do the minister and his officials have a definition ready for 
Cabinet now or can I get one later when it is ready?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans):</B> 
Madam Chairman, I would be glad to give an answer.
<P>
	Clearly the intent of the Government of Canada is to use the 
least amount in the event that Canada decides to seize, arrest or 
inspect a vessel. We use the minimum amount of force required 
to conduct an inspection. In other words, it is clearly Canada's 
intention at every stage of the game to avoid injury or worse to 
any vessel on the high seas, our own or other vessels.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4222"> 4222 </A></B>
<P>
	That is what is intended. We are signalling here that we want 
to proceed in a manner that is the most peaceful possible in the 
circumstance. That is what is intended by the wording in the 
clause.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier (Gaspé):</B> Thank you, Madam Chairman. I will 
accept that definition for the time being, but whenever 
something is put out in writing, I would like to get a copy.
<P>
	While I have the floor, I have to say that I am unfamiliar with 
the procedure in committee of the whole. Would the minister or 
the House allow me to go back to page 2, clause 2 regarding 
section 5.2? I have another question on the meaning of certain 
words. It refers to a vessel of a prescribed class preparing to fish.
<P>
	Can the minister define the expression ``prepare to fish'' for 
me, in general terms to begin with? I would also like to get any 
written definition his officials can provide me with, if at all 
possible.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Chairman:</B> Do we have unanimous consent to 
return to clause 2?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Tobin:</B> Madam Chairman, I will refer to what is meant by 
section 5.2. Essentially the bill gives the government the 
enabling power, by amending the current Coastal Fisheries 
Protection Act, to act outside 200 miles in a manner consistent 
with how we act inside 200 miles.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	Generally when this kind of enabling legislation is proposed 
and passed by Parliament it gives legislation legal effect. 
Regulations will be published exactly as occurs with respect to 
any other piece of legislation. When those regulations are 
published they will be made public and will be available for the 
scrutiny of the member and all members of the fisheries 
standing committee.
<P>
	With respect to the specific question as to what is meant by 
vessels of a prescribed class, it is simply a reference that allows 
the government to prescribe or designate a class, a type or kind 
of vessel we have determined is fishing in a manner inconsistent 
with conservation rules and therefore against which 
conservation measures could be taken.
<P>
	For example, we could prescribe stateless vessels. Another 
example is that we could prescribe flags of convenience. That is 
all that is meant. Those regulations will be available to the 
member, to his party, and to the fisheries committee.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé):</B> Madam Chairman, I have a slight 
problem with the expression ``prepare to fish''.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	What is the meaning of ``to prepare to fish''? Are we to cross 
the sea with our gear behind us or should our gear be in the 
water? What is the meaning of that?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Tobin:</B> Madam Chairman, if I am wrong, the officials 
will jump up, leap on me and drag me out of the House kicking 
and screaming to be re-educated. The purpose of those words is 
to make clear that in cases where we believe a vessel is fishing in 
a manner contrary to proper conservation rules we do not put 
ourselves in a position where we actually have to get the boat 
when it has its gear in the water.
<P>
	In other words, we know a vessel is fishing an endangered 
species. The vessel becomes aware it is under aerial surveillance 
or through the means of radar it is aware that Canadian 
enforcement vessels are in the vicinity and pulls up its gear. We 
are saying that we should not set a standard whereby we can only 
arrest the vessel when we actually catch it with its gear in the 
water.
<P>
	As the member knows, we are able to do aerial surveillance 
and to record the fishing activities of vessels. We want a clear 
piece of legislation so that the regulations can be published in 
such a way as to allow us, once we have designated a class of 
vessels fishing in a zone where endangered species exist, to 
move those vessels out of that zone and not be caught up in the 
details of whether or not the gear is actually up or down.

	The House resumed from May 10 consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-22, an act respecting certain agreements concerning 
the redevelopment and operation of Terminals 1 and 2 at Lester 
B. Pearson International Airport, be read the second time and 
referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to address this House for the second time on Bill C-22. 
The privatization of Pearson Airport has one important element 
that I think has not yet been addressed in this House, namely 
pilot training.
<P>
	I have the honour to have in my riding Chicoutimi CEGEP, 
which trains pilots. The original idea of establishing a 
French-language public school to train aircraft pilots comes 
from Canon Jean-Paul Laliberté, then director of Chicoutimi 
College, Germain Hallé, then director of educational services, 
and Pierre Rivest, then aviation inspector for the federal 
Department of Transport. The first 36 student pilots registered 
in the fall of 1968. The goal was to give francophones a place in 
the aeronautical community.
<P>
	Some 400 to 450 airline pilots have graduated from the school 
since it was founded. Fifty per cent of students choose this 
career option while the others become bush or helicopter pilots. 
A quarter century later, Chicoutimi CEGEP still offers this 
training through the Quebec aeronautical training centre. This 
centre is the only public school in Quebec that trains pilots. It is 
the only institution in North America that gives this training in 
French. Among its exclusive characteristics is the fact that the 
courses are free.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	So, we have developed in Quebec a public education centre 
which provides adequate training for francophones.
<P>
	The training of a pilot requires about 260 hours of flying and 
900 hours of theory. It costs Quebec taxpayers some $80,000 to 
train a pilot. The school has an annual budget of $3.5 million. 
So, this Quebec centre built a solid reputation for itself. It has 
expertise in a high tech field and it has made a name for itself.
<P>
	We have shown that we can train pilots in French, away from 
major centres and still be successful. We have proven that we 
can do it. We have been able to provide specialized training for 
these students. We have established our structure and we 
provide skilled pilots to the industry. It is only normal to have a 
return on our investment.
<P>
	Let us not forget that Montreal has played a predominant role 
in the development of the air carrier industry. Indeed, in the 
early seventies, Montreal was the hub of air transportation in 
Canada. Today, it comes in third place, behind Toronto and 
Vancouver.
<P>
	The globalization of aeronautics has triggered a streamlining 
exercise, as well as a transfer of operations from Montreal to 
Toronto. Between 1976 and 1984, increases in passenger traffic 
occurred mostly in Toronto, which registered gains of close to 
45 per cent, compared to a mere two per cent for Montreal over 
the last nine years.
<P>
	In 1981, 7.5 million passengers were processed at Dorval and 
Mirabel airports, compared to 14.5 million in Toronto. In 1991, 
passenger traffic at Dorval and Mirabel airports was 8 million, 
whereas it was 18.5 million in Toronto. This results in a loss of 
jobs for Quebec, while elsewhere in Canada there was growth 
until 1989.
<P>
	A study by the École des hautes études commerciales in 
Montreal, done in the late 1980s, estimates the contribution of 
the Montreal airports to the gross domestic product in terms of 
value added for the year 1992 at $1.3 billion, taking only the 
direct impact into account, and at $2.2 billion, if indirect effects 
are taken into account. According to the same study, the 
contribution of the Montreal airports to the employment sector 
is also very significant. In 1992, 24,000 jobs are related to the 
total direct production of the Montreal airports. Adding indirect 
and induced jobs results in a total of 48,500 jobs. This indicates 
the economic importance of airport activity.
<P>
	In Toronto, the addition of a runway would increase the 
region's income over the next 15 years by $3.5 billion and would 
enrich the province by over $9 billion. The impact on 
employment would also be very large. Locally, adding runways 
would create 3,300 jobs annually, and 3,700 additional jobs 
elsewhere in Ontario. This would mean, for the entire province, 
an increase of more than 7,000 jobs. For comparison purposes, 
in 1969, Air Canada had 461 pilots in Montreal and 451 in 
Toronto. In 1992, there were 301 pilots in Montreal and 781 in 
Toronto, a negative balance of 480 pilots for Quebec. This is not 
a narrow gap, but rather an abyss.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	In 1988, Air Canada transferred all its pilot training 
operations from Montreal to Toronto, which was extremely 
significant. As of April 1, 1993, the status of the pilot training 
graduates from the 1992 program was as follows: 62.5 per cent 
of the graduates had jobs in their field, whereas 18 per cent did 
not. Their annual salary was only $24,600.
<P>
	Young pilots who enter the workforce start in small regional 
companies known as third-level carriers and build up their 
flying time. We are therefore training in Quebec, and especially 
in my constituency, workers whom we would like to see advance 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4224"> 4224 </A></B>
<P>
here, since they have the opportunity to pursue their careers with 
all types of  carriers. The concentration of operations at Pearson 
to the detriment of the airports in Montreal results in pilots 
leaving. After investing in training, our pilots will go elsewhere 
and pay taxes.
<P>
	In conclusion, we want Quebec pilots to have a future. The 
airports in Montreal, as we have seen, are regressing compared 
to Toronto. We have invested collectively in the training of our 
pilots, and we have fashioned a development tool. We should 
also invest in Montreal.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis):</B> Madam Speaker, I welcome this 
opportunity to speak again to Bill C-22, which concerns the 
privatization of the airport in Toronto. Pearson Airport is the 
largest in Canada. It employs 15,000 people and is used by 20 
million passengers annually. It adds an estimated $4 billion to 
the economy of the province of Ontario each year.
<P>
	The government was right to cancel the contract signed by the 
previous Conservative government during the last election 
campaign. However, the real question we must ask about Bill 
C-22 is this: Why does the Liberal government want to pay 
compensation to parties who feel their rights have been violated 
as a result of the present government's decision to cancel the 
contract awarded by the previous Conservative government to 
privatize Pearson Airport?
<P>
	In my opinion, a government has no right to consider paying 
compensation to individuals who took the risk of signing a 
controversial contract in the middle of an election campaign and 
who are all in good financial shape, at a time when this 
government is cutting or intends to cut social programs. Or else 
it should apply the same principle to the cancellation of the 
helicopter contract or to any business or individual penalized by 
the coming into effect of new legislation.
<P>
	For instance, there is a small business in my riding to which 
the government might consider paying compensation. This 
particular business packaged cigarettes.
<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
	Bill C-11, which was recently tabled and debated in the 
House, will prohibit the sale of cigarettes in packages 
containing fewer than 20 cigarettes. This particular business, 
whose headquarters are in my riding, was the only one in Quebec 
that manufactured packages containing five cigarettes. It will 
have to close down as soon as this legislation comes into effect, 
since it is strictly engaged in the manufacture and sales of 
packages of five cigarettes.
<P>
	I am not saying that I am against legislation to limit tobacco 
sales to young people. That is not what I am saying. My point is 
just that all of a sudden, a business operating legally and in good 
faith sees its existence jeopardized by the implementation of a 
new act. Yet, no compensation is provided for in this case.
<P>
	This start-up company cannot afford lobbyists. Does this 
mean that there is a double standard with regard to financial 
compensation granted by the government?
<P>
	Many more examples could be provided; in fact, my 
colleagues have mentioned several already in this debate.
<P>
	It seems clear and obvious that the affluent members of this 
society stand to gain more from their dealings with the 
government than the rest of the population. While the Pearson 
Airport contract appeared to favour mainly Conservative Party 
backers, many of these also contributed to the Liberal Party of 
Canada fund.
<P>
	The most influential lobbyists are often former high-ranking 
officials in the federal system. They have established excellent 
relationships with officials in various departments, senior 
officials in particular. This means they have easy access to 
government policy makers and can thus position themselves 
faster and have an advantage over other firms. Lobbyists work 
for the most affluent members of our society. They care very 
little for ordinary people and even less for the unemployed and 
welfare recipients. They would rather reap the benefits at the 
expense of the less fortunate segment of our society.
<P>
	People who attend the $1,000-a-plate dinners still organized 
by the old parties are often lobbyists. Who else would pay 
$1,000 without hoping to gain some favour in the short term? 
Ordinary citizens cannot afford to attend such meetings.
<P>
	Despite the change in government, it appears that nothing has 
really changed. Today's government seems as much in the pay of 
big corporations and their lobbyists as the former government.
<P>
	Will they have the courage to prove otherwise by refusing to 
pay any compensation to those who hoped to get richer in the 
Pearson Airport privatization project?
<P>
	The best way to change this would be to pass a law to prohibit 
financing of political parties by businesses or interest groups. 
This government should draw inspiration from the provisions of 
the Quebec electoral law that deal with political party financing. 
The hon. member for Richelieu's motion to restrict political 
party financing in Canada should move this government to pass 
a new law. The hon. member for Richelieu moved that the 
government legislate to give only private citizens the right to 
finance political parties and to limit contributions to $5,000 a 
year. The main objective of this motion is to ban corporate 
financing, which puts political parties at the mercy of lobbyists 
for powerful companies that donate several thousands of dollars 
and expect favours in return.
<P>
	The same principle applies to individuals.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4225"> 4225 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1700) </B>
<P>
	Wealthy individuals give a lot to some political parties, 
always for the purpose of getting something in return. The 
reason for such a motion as this is to make the relations between 
individuals and political parties more fair and equitable, 
because someone earning less than $30,000 a year cannot afford 
to contribute $10,000 to a political party, whereas someone else 
whose annual income is over $100,000 can of course give more.
<P>
	Besides, big companies which can afford to give thousands 
and thousands of dollars to political parties also can afford to 
hire lobbyists who work to get something for the money which 
their bosses invested in the political parties.
<P>
	Values like honesty, integrity and openness should guide 
political and democratic life. Well, in the Pearson Airport affair, 
there is a glaring lack of openness. We are faced with a shady 
deal that is a disgrace to the democratic spirit which should 
guide politics in this country.
<P>
	The citizens and voters who sent us here to sit in this House 
must wonder whose interests we really serve when they see how 
our governments act. Men and women vote, not banks, unions or 
companies. Therefore, it is time that political parties stop being 
at the mercy of their financial backers.
<P>
	Let me give you the example of the Bloc Quebecois, which 
won 75 per cent of the seats in Quebec, yet only accepted 
contributions from individuals. The Bloc has shown to other 
federal political parties that the important thing is not to get 
corporate financing but to defend legitimate ideas. The other 
parties will not go bankrupt if the motion tabled by the hon. 
member for Richelieu is passed. In fact, it will give them an 
opportunity to get closer to their constituents.
<P>
	One thing is certain: The House must implement measures to 
avoid a repeat of the Pearson Airport scandal.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Is the House ready for 
the question?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Question!
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Is it the pleasure of the

	<B>Mr. Guy H. Arseneault (Restigouche-Chaleur)</B> moved 
that Bill C-216, an act to amend the Unemployment Insurance 
Act (jury service), be read the second time and referred to a 
committee.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order. The hon. member should just wait a 
second. I will recognize him on a point of order and I will hear 
him.
<P>
<B>(1750 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Guy H. Arseneault (Restigouche-Chaleur):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will not take much of the time because I would like to 
enter into debate if possible later, if that is the ruling. I would 
like to raise a very important point of order. Not being well 
versed on how to do it, I may stray from the procedure. I would 
appreciate your indulgence.
<P>
	What I would like to point out is this. I would like to invoke 
Standing Order 73(1). That standing order gives a minister of 
the crown the opportunity to refer a bill to a committee before 
second reading. What I am saying to you, Mr. Speaker, is that it 
would not be right for a minister to be able to do that for a public 
bill presented by a private member.
<P>
	I would point out that there is a parallel in the book. It may be 
an oversight. I would refer members to page 35, Standing Order 
68(4)(a) and (b). It points out that ministers have certain 
authorities, according to the standing orders, and there are 
parallels for private members.
<P>
	It says: ``for a motion by a minister to prepare and bring in a 
bill''. In the following section, it says: ``motion by a member to 
prepare and bring in a bill''. I repeat, ``private member''. I say to 
members that in Standing Order 73 that by extension of 73(1) 
and the parallels that I just mentioned, as a member I should 
have the authority, as sponsor, also to refer my bill. A minister 
has the authority to refer a bill to a committee that the 
government sponsors, a government bill.
<P>
	I would say to you, Mr. Speaker, that as the sponsor of a 
private member's bill I would have that authority. If not, then I 
do not think it is right for a minister to have that authority over 
my bill. It is very important that we get a clarification on that.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="SPEAKER'SRULING">SPEAKER'S RULING</A></H4>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Restigouche-Chaleur 
has raised a point for invoking Standing 73 in relation to Bill 
C-216, the item standing in his name on the Order Paper for 
today's Private Member's Business.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4227"> 4227 </A></B>
<P>
	Standing Order 73 states in part: ``Immediately after the 
reading of the order of the day for the second reading of any 
public bill, a minister of the crown may propose a motion that 
the said bill be forthwith referred to a standing, special or 
legislative committee. The Speaker shall immediately propose 
the question to the House and proceedings thereon shall be 
subject to various conditions''.
<P>
	The terms of the standing order in my view are very clear. The 
prerogatives under Standing Order 73 are given to ministers of 
the crown. As such, they cannot be invoked by private members 
and the Chair cannot therefore accept the hon. member's 
argument at this time.
<P>
	I would however point out to the hon. member that he does 
raise a very interesting point for the Chair. I would like to take at 
least some time to go through the precedents on this matter and 
come back to the House. In the meantime, I would suggest that 
the hon. member proceed with his private member's bill for 
today and I will get back to the House after further deliberation.

<B>(1755) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Arseneault:</B> Madam Speaker, I have the honour and the 
pleasure to rise to present my bill to amend the Unemployment 
Insurance Act.
<P>
	As you may know, section 14 of this Act prevents persons who 
are obliged to exercise their civic duty as jurors from receiving 
unemployment insurance benefits when they are without work.
<P>
	You will no doubt agree that this is clearly unfair and that 
many persons find themselves between a rock and a hard place 
when they are obliged to perform their duty as citizens. In 
addition, I feel that this section runs counter to the spirit of the 
Unemployment Insurance Act. This Act was passed more than 
50 years ago to provide all Canadians with income security and 
not to punish them when they are obliged to perform their duty 
as citizens.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The purpose of the bill is to amend the Unemployment 
Insurance Act to ensure that persons in temporary service as 
jurors are not regarded as disqualified from a benefit merely 
because of their participation in such an activity.
<P>
	At present anyone performing their civic duty while 
collecting unemployment insurance benefits is penalized by the 
federal government for no valid or obvious reason. Anyone 
performing jury duty for more than two days is no longer 
considered eligible for benefits since the law considers that he 
or she is not available for work. Although jurors are usually 
granted a stipend for expenses incurred while performing their 
duties, anyone submitting unemployment insurance claim cards 
to receive the difference in UI benefits will receive nothing.
<P>
	As some of the hon. members may be aware, I originally 
introduced a bill similar to this one in the last Parliament. While 
similar in some respects, Bill C-216 includes a number of 
improvements over the earlier bill. I would like to take this 
opportunity to explain to the House how I was made aware of 
this flaw in the Unemployment Insurance Act.
<P>
	When I was originally referred to this case I thought the 
situation was the result of a simple misunderstanding and so did 
the person in question. To our surprise, we both came to find out 
that such a regulation was in fact on the books. The best way of 
explaining it is to read this letter which I received a couple of 
years ago now from one of my constituents. It was a letter to the 
editor and as it happened before it was published the editor 
phoned me up for a comment and I thought it was a 
misunderstanding. But I will read parts of it.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>	To the Editor:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In September I experienced the luck of having been laid off after paying 
maximum unemployment insurance premiums for the past 25 years. In 
November I experienced the luck again of having been selected as a juror for the 
murder trial recently held in Campbellton. I clenched my teeth and resigned 
myself to the fact that I had a dirty job to do and might as well do it to the best of my 
ability.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Having never followed trial proceedings previously, I found the whole 
process rather interesting. The mental stress of trying to absorb nine days of 
testimony and summations was emotionally draining.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>At the conclusion of the trial I requested and was given a letter which stated 
the days I had been present in court and the amount of money that I would 
receive from the court. I mailed this letter along with my UI card on November 
27.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Needless to say, this woman was refused unemployment 
benefits. She goes on to say:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I am outraged to say the least. We are taxed to death by every level of 
government known to man. My tax money helped pay the salaries of the 
participants in this case, including the RCMP, the prosecution staff, the public 
defender, the sheriff's department, the court staff, not to mention the room and 
board of the prisoner. In retrospect I could have ignored the summons to appear 
for jury selection and I would have been fined $50 like the dozen or so other 
good citizens who failed to show up. I could have requested a letter be sent to the 
court by a sympathetic doctor exempting me. I could have lied and said I knew 
someone connected with the case. I could have lied on my UI claim. Someone 
suggested that anyone showing up for jury selection with a rope thrown over a 
shoulder would probably be rejected by the defence team. However, I did none 
of these things. I tried to be a good citizen. But I have come to the conclusion 
that when dealing with big brother honesty is really not the best policy.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1800) </B>
<P>
	That puts it in its context. To go on:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>After receiving notice of this letter another problem came to my attention in 
other provinces whereby members of the justice system, honourable judges, 
recognized that there was indeed a problem with the system.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4228"> 4228 </A></B>
<P>
	Here I want to quote from an article that appeared in the 
<I>Moncton Times</I>, a New Brunswick paper, referring to something 
that happened in Nova Scotia. The headline says: ``Calls UI rule 
Stupid-Judge excuses potential jurors''. I will read it. It is 
short: ``A Nova Scotia Supreme Court judge'-that is not a 
regular judge, not just a lawyer, not just an MP walking down the 
street making these comments. Remember it is a Nova Scotia 
Supreme Court Justice-``excused nine people from jury duty 
Tuesday because they would not be able to collect 
unemployment benefits if the trial took more than two days. 
Canada Employment states that people must be available for 
work to qualify for payments''.
<P>
	Justice Nathanson said: ``I think it is a stupid ruling. But who 
am I?''. He is a Supreme Court Justice from Nova Scotia. ``Who 
am I?''. Here we have a Supreme Court Justice for Nova Scotia 
telling us that there is a regulation that is stupid. It is very 
obvious it is stupid. Someone is forced to do something. They 
are not available for work, they are forced to do it. It is not their 
own doing if they are not available for work. They are forced to 
do it as a good, honest citizen. It goes further than that because it 
goes to the root of the justice system.
<P>
	I am not a legal mind. I do not have a background in the legal 
profession but I do know that every accused person has a right to 
be judged by their peers. Judges, and they have been across 
Canada in various provinces, have been excusing jurors who are 
receiving UI because they would lose their UI. They have been 
excusing them from their jury duty.
<P>
	If an accused who is receiving UI goes to court and wants to be 
judged by his or her peers, odds are that there will be no one in 
the jury box that would be considered his or her peer. So it goes 
to the root of the justice system. We have to correct that. There is 
only one way to correct it and that is by simple amendment here.
<P>
	I would ask members to throw away their prejudices if they 
have any. We have been told that Parliament has to be more 
responsive to the people. This is not Guy Arseneault's private 
members' bill, this is Canada's private members' bill. This is a 
problem with the system. I am just someone here who is trying 
to correct it along the way. This is part of the process.
<P>
	I ask my colleagues today to look at it on an individual basis. 
Go back to your constituents. It has more than likely happened 
in every constituency in Canada. If you look hard enough that 
problem will be there.
<P>
	Is it a cost to the system? No, because the juror who is excused 
is getting UI anyway. They are going to get their UI. They just do 
not go on jury duty anymore. I ask members to look at that.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I would also like to point out that some members might claim 
today that the justice system is a provincial responsibility.
<P>
<B>(1805) </B>
<P>
	I say again to all the members of this Chamber that the justice 
system is the responsibility of every one of us. It is a personal 
responsibility.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	If they are against this, some members are going to tell us 
today that the justice system is a provincial responsibility. It is 
not. It is everyone's responsibility. We cannot wait for another 
jurisdiction to correct a problem if we are aware of a problem. 
That is what we are here for. This is a law and a regulation here 
that we can change to make the system better.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I say to you as well that the injustices that mar the system and 
can be put right should be rectified by all the levels of 
government. In the matter at hand, it seems to me that an 
injustice was done and that another will be committed by our 
group if we do not agree with this bill. I will try not to be too 
biased, because I feel in all honesty that it is a good bill. 
Moreover, when you are biased, you risk losing people's support 
sometimes. I am compelled to say that if others claim it is a 
matter for the provinces, they are trying to shirk their own 
responsibilities. I think they are trying to pass their 
responsibilities off on others.
<P>
	I would like to go back to what concerns us today and correct 
an injustice in the system.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I would like to inform hon. members that at this point in time I 
have the support of the majority of members of Parliament. I 
have the support of the human resources minister. I have the 
undertaking from the chairman of the human resources 
committee that it would take the bill and look at it quickly. I am 
not saying it would pass it. He did not say that, but it would be 
ready to study it.
<P>
	I would ask members today to take a second look at the bill 
and consider sending it to committee. I leave that with the 
House. It is a request made by a constituent. We are here 
representing constituents. We have heard a lot about the justice 
system in the last couple of weeks from all parties.
<P>
	Everyone has a concern. I have heard about the Young 
Offenders Act. I have concerns about that too. At the same time 
here is an item that can improve the system. I am waiting to see 
how my colleagues respond. I hope it is in a positive way.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier):</B> Madam Speaker, I would 
like to reassure my colleague from Restigouche-Chaleur right 
away that the official opposition will support the amendment he 
is proposing to the Unemployment Insurance Act. I will also 
support his efforts to have the Minister of Human Resources 
Development move as quickly as possible on an amendment of 
this nature.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4229"> 4229 </A></B>
<P>
	After listening to your argument, I would like to call to mind 
the difference between a jury and a juror. A jury is a group of 
citizens legally appointed to hand down a verdict in a case 
brought before a court. The jury has an important responsibility, 
namely to settle differences in personal, delicate and often 
emotional cases. A jury may be called upon to hand down a 
verdict in a criminal case and in cases of summary offences and 
minor crimes such as thefts. In society, juries are considered to 
be the underpinnings of our judicial institutions and most of the 
studies carried out have confirmed that they do indeed serve a 
valid function.
<P>
	Jurors, on the other hand, are selected at random from voter 
registration lists. They cannot be excused from jury duty unless 
they work for the National Assembly, a provincial legislature or 
the House of Commons or unless they suffer from a physical 
handicap or sensory impairment. The fact of being unemployed 
is not a valid reason to be excused.
<P>
<B>(1810) </B>
<P>
	Jurors are entitled to only $25 a day in compensation, 
including a midday meal, two snacks and two bus tickets. So 
they only get $25 a day to perform what we admit is not only a 
task but also an important social and collective responsibility.
<P>
	The law already forbids an employer to dismiss or penalize an 
employee for jury duty. However, the law does not require the 
employer to pay that employee-this is a matter in provincial 
jurisdiction. Nevertheless, unionized employees in big 
companies are usually paid by their employer, but employees of 
small companies are not, except in unusual circumstances.
<P>
	What happens with the Unemployment Insurance Act, which 
concerns the hon. member? This Act does not exempt someone 
for being a juror. So if I understand Bill C-216 correctly, an 
unemployed person who is entitled to unemployment insurance 
and not available for work because of jury duty will be 
disqualified from collecting UI.
<P>
	This is a flagrant injustice which is not in provincial 
jurisdiction since it is simply a matter of applying the 
Unemployment Insurance Act which applies to everyone.
<P>
	I would add-and I think that this is the most important point, 
basically-that most of the time, jurors are ordinary people. 
They are just regular folks and these days, with so much 
unemployment, they are indeed likely to be without work when 
they are chosen.
<P>
	Although this House cannot vote on your bill, I think that it 
should find a way through some ordinary process or institution 
or the minister's ability to amend his law to do justice to people 
who are already penalized by being unemployed. Accordingly 
this amendment should be approved without hesitation and 
without delay. I commend the hon. member for his initiative.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Harvard (Winnipeg St. James):</B> Madam Speaker, 
first I want to say how pleased I am to take part in this debate and 
to give my wholehearted support to this private member's bill, 
C-216. I congratulate its sponsor, the hon. member for 
Restigouche-Chaleur, for bringing in the bill because I believe 
it to be an important one. I also congratulate him on his tenacity. 
He brought in a bill in the 34th Parliament on this subject and he 
is back at it again. It is encouraging to see a member stick to a 
principle and stick to a cause.
<P>
	The sponsor of the bill indicated in his remarks earlier that he 
does not have a legal background. Nor do I, but I think I have 
been around long enough and have enough experience to 
evaluate what is justice and fairness.
<P>
<B>(1815) </B>
<P>
	I truly believe this bill is about fairness and justice. It is about 
stopping government hypocrisy and all of us know government 
can be quite famous for hypocrisy. The bill is about attempting 
to stop at least some of this hypocrisy. The bill is about 
encouraging people to tell the truth. It is about asking and 
encouraging the citizens of this country to participate in the 
public process and to take their civic responsibilities seriously.
<P>
	On the matter of fairness and justice, these people who are 
required under the law of the land to serve as jurors do not have a 
choice. They are required by law to meet their obligations. They 
are not unavailable for work as a result of their own choosing. 
This is not a matter of sloth. This is not a matter of indifference. 
They are required by the law of the land to serve on a jury when 
summoned.
<P>
	However when they meet their legal obligations and serve on 
a jury for more than two days another government department 
comes along and says: ``You are not available for work and as a 
result of that you are not going to get your UI benefits''. If that is 
not a denial of fairness and justice, I do not know what is.
<P>
	On the matter of government hypocrisy, government should 
not be allowed to speak out of both sides of its mouth. The 
government cannot say: ``It is your responsibility and we are 
going to make it mandatory under the law. It is mandatory for 
you to serve on a jury, but by golly if you do serve on a jury for 
more than two days you are not going to get your UI benefits''. 
That is a classic example of hypocrisy. It is a classic example of 
government speaking out of both sides of its mouth. 
Government cannot be allowed to do that. It cannot have it both 
ways.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4230"> 4230 </A></B>
<P>
	The matter of encouraging people to tell the truth, my Lord, 
have we not all been encouraged from the cradle to tell the truth? 
Yet the situation here is that if you tell the truth it is going to cost 
you. It is going to cost the loss of UI benefits.
<P>
	Therefore it does not surprise me that the hon. member for 
Restigouche-Chaleur tells a story about a woman who is 
tempted to come up with little white lies so she can avoid this 
unemployment insurance ruling and receive her benefits. In that 
particular letter cited by the hon. member the woman talked 
about faking illness or coming up with some other trumped up 
story, some cock and bull story so she would not miss her 
benefits.
<P>
	I do not think we want that. We want laws of the land, policies 
and regulations of government that promote telling the truth. 
Certainly we do not want policies promoting lies, even little 
white lies.
<P>
	It is the same thing about encouraging people to take their 
civic responsibilities seriously. We want that. We want people to 
get involved in democracy and in their communities. We should 
not be putting blocks and impediments in their way. We should 
be making it easier for them to take part, but this silly regulation 
does exactly the opposite.
<P>
<B>(1820 ) </B>
<P>
	A constituent in my riding of Winnipeg St. James by the name 
of Jamie Murray has gone through this. Last February she found 
herself summoned to jury duty. She served only three days. She 
was not in the situation of some jurors in which they have had to 
serve not days, but weeks and perhaps months.
<P>
	I was speaking to a colleague of mine from the London, 
Ontario area today. She told me about one of her constituents 
who was on UI and got involved in a trial that lasted not eight 
days and not eight weeks, but eight months. That is a pretty 
extreme case but it can happen as well.
<P>
	Getting back to Jamie Murray, she served on a jury for three 
days. She told the truth and the unemployment insurance people 
said: ``Sorry, you are not going to get your benefits for those 
three days''. She pointed out: ``If I had served only two days I 
would not have been denied my benefits. So why not strike a 
deal? Give me the benefits for two days''-she is a very 
reasonable woman-``Give me the benefits for the first two days 
because that is what you would have done if the trial had lasted 
only two days and I will absorb the expenses for the third day''. 
The civil service being what it is and how it is charged in its 
duties could not do that and she was denied all three days of 
benefits.
<P>
	This regulation is wrong. We as parliamentarians and 
politicians simply have to show Canadians more understanding. 
It is not just a case of compassion. It is a matter of showing some 
understanding of the situation they find themselves in. They are 
following their obligations by serving on juries and then they are  
smacked, not because of their choosing but because of their 
unavailability for work.
<P>
	I understand that ministers, especially the Minister for 
Human Resources Development, are in favour of this. I hope this 
goes to committee. When unanimous consent is asked for I hope 
members on both sides of the House will find it in their hearts to 
at least allow this bill to go to committee so that more questions 
can be asked and more information can be garnered. Surely this 
issue is compelling enough that we should allow it to be 
examined in detail in committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> Madam 
Speaker, the purpose of this private member's bill is to change 
the rules of the unemployment insurance program to allow 
claimants to collect UI benefits while they are on jury duty. That 
is the intent.
<P>
	The guidelines used by claims adjudicators in unemployment 
insurance state: ``As a general rule a UI claimant who is on jury 
duty is not considered to be available for work during a trial. The 
unemployment insurance plan was not designed to provide 
compensation for lost wages in such circumstances''.
<P>
	The guidelines also state that a person serving as a juror may 
not be disqualified from receiving benefits if the jury duty is 
only for one or two days. Rare exceptions have also been made 
for those jurors or claimants who can prove that they would be 
released from their obligations and report for work within 24 
hours.
<P>
	The policy experts at unemployment insurance comment that 
the problem is not with the UI rules on availability but rather the 
poor compensation provided for jurors. That is what the people 
at UI are saying and the Reform Party agrees. It is not a problem 
with the UI rules, it is a problem with compensation for jurors. 
That is the problem that needs to be addressed in this.
<P>
<B>(1825) </B>
<P>
	The Reform Party supports the return of unemployment 
insurance to its original function: an employer-employee 
funded and administered program to provide temporary income 
in the event of unexpected job loss. This has been our policy 
since 1988.
<P>
	If the employers and the employees who pay for the UI 
program had a say in how their money was spent, I do not think 
they would agree to provide benefits to claimants while they are 
serving on a jury.
<P>
	It does not seem reasonable to compromise fundamental 
insurance principles regarding availability for work in order to 
provide additional compensation to UI claimants who serve as 
jurors.
<P>
	The law is simple. If UI claimants are serving on a jury they 
are not available for work. If they are not available for work they 
are not entitled to unemployment insurance. For years now 
fundamental insurance principles have been compromised so 
that unemployment insurance is now seen more like a form of 
welfare than a form of insurance.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="4231"> 4231 </A></B>
<P>
	Unemployment insurance is not a right. It is an insurable 
program that workers are entitled to, provided they qualify and 
meet certain obligations. One of the obligations they must meet 
is that they are ready, able and willing to work immediately.
<P>
	If we can compromise our principles of availability to allow 
jurors to collect, then who is the next group deserving of special 
treatment and special status? Who next would claim that right?
<P>
	The UI program has to be returned to a true insurance 
program. We have to keep our focus in this regard. In order to do 
this all of the special programs, exemptions and exceptions 
including the discriminatory elements such as variable entrance 
requirements and regionally extended benefits, have to be 
eliminated.
<P>
	This private member's bill would take us in the opposite 
direction to where the Reform Party wants to take 
unemployment insurance. This is the main reason why we 
cannot support the bill.
<P>
	While this is our main reason it is not the only reason. If this 
bill were to be adopted, even the principle of equality is 
jeopardized. Let me explain. An employed person is expected to 
take time off work for jury duty and often they are not 
compensated for their lost pay if they have a job. How would a 
worker feel sitting with a person on a jury knowing that he was 
losing money to do his public duty and a UI claimant that was 
sitting next to him was getting paid by the government to do the 
same job? He would not regard that as being fair.
<P>
	The hon. member raises the point that often employers pay 
their employees while they are serving on a jury and that it is 
unfair to the UI claimant to have his benefits cut off. If this 
change were allowed to pass and employers found out that their 
employees could get UI benefits for serving on a jury, how long 
would it take before employers started laying off workers who 
have to serve on juries? It opens up the system to abuse. This 
would undoubtedly lead to an increase in UI claims for people 
serving of juries and therefore an increase in costs to the UI 
program which is already $6 billion in debt. It is something to 
consider.
<P>
	While there may be a problem of fair compensation to all 
persons who serve on a jury regardless of their employment 
status, we do not believe that tinkering with the Unemployment 
Insurance Act will solve it. We propose a simpler solution. 
Judges should use their discretion to excuse UI claimants from 
jury duty as has been done in the past.
<P>
	The hon. member for Restigouche-Chaleur even provided 
me with a copy of an article from the Moncton <I>Times-Transcript</I> 
which reported on a judge in Sydney, Nova Scotia who did just 
that. Maybe that is what has to be done in this circumstance.
<P>
	In February 1991 a Supreme Court justice excused nine UI 
claimants from jury duty. I appreciate very much the 
information that the hon. member has given me in regard to this. 
It has provided valuable background information.
<P>
	This leads me to my final point. It is obvious that jurors are 
not fairly compensated. On this point my hon. friend and I agree. 
Everyone else involved in the trial is fairly compensated: the 
judge, the lawyers, the court workers, the police and the janitor 
who cleans the courtroom floor. It is inexcusable that jurors are 
asked to work for days, weeks and in some cases even months 
for $15 or $20 a day.
<P>
<B>(1830) </B>
<P>
	The Reform Party was founded on the principles of equality, 
fairness and common sense and we find that this is an area that 
needs to be addressed. To this end I pledge to my hon. friend that 
I will start work immediately to research the issue of fair 
compensation for jurors whether they be employed, 
unemployed, on unemployment insurance or not. If the 
appropriate action can be taken at the federal level I will ensure 
that a private member's bill is introduced.
<P>
	I hope my hon. friend will agree to work co-operatively with 
me and my staff in this initiative.
<P>
	In summary, the intent of this bill may be very good but the 
justice system needs fixing. We do not need to tinker with the 
unemployment insurance system. We need to fix it where it is 
broke. That is why I feel this is the approach we need to follow. I 
offer that I will work together with the rest of my colleagues on 
this. I feel that if we can work together on this maybe we can get 
somewhere.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough-Rouge River):</B> Madam 
Speaker, in the time that remains, I think members on both sides 
of the House have fairly addressed the main principles here. I 
want to touch on just two.
<P>
	First is the reference to jury service as a mode of employment. 
I do not see jury service as being a job, as being an employment. 
It is the fulfilment of a civic duty. People who go into jury 
service do not do it to earn income. There is not much income 
there. As was said by the last speaker, $10 or $20 per day in some 
places might pay for the parking tab.
<P>
	In addition the remarks pertaining to compensation for jurors 
relate to areas of provincial jurisdiction. These amounts are 
settled by the governments in each province. It is a tenfold 
problem if you want to look at it that way.
<P>
	The mover of this bill has referred to the remarks of a judge, I 
think it was in Nova Scotia, who referred to the ruling at the 
Unemployment Insurance Commission as a stupid ruling. I 
think, as the previous speaker has pointed out, that the ruling 
was correct. However, I feel that the rule is stupid.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="4232"> 4232 </A></B>
<P>
	I think the rule in the Unemployment Insurance Act interferes 
with the ability of the citizen who happens to be unemployed at 
the time in fulfilling their civic obligation. That is an important 
civic obligation. It is such a civic obligation that governments 
do not even bother paying very much for the fulfilment of that 
obligation. It is basically come and get in here and serve as a 
juror because you are obligated to do it as a citizen.
<P>
	As has been pointed out by the mover of the bill, that 
circumstance with the unemployment insurance rules causes the 
person called to do jury duty to perhaps lie or refuse to serve 
when they should be ready, able and willing to serve. I think that 
is a misfit in the UI rules.
<P>
	As the previous speaker has pointed out you can fix it on 
either end. The mover of the bill believes, and I agree with him, 
that the quickest route to a solution is to amend the 
Unemployment Insurance Act as suggested.
<P>
	The mover of this bill has had success in this House 
previously in relation to the same bill. If I am not mistaken the 
matter was referred to the committee by the House after an 
hour's debate in private members' hour at some point in the last 
Parliament. As he said, the minister, the parliamentary 
secretary, the chair of the House human resources committee 
and others all on the government side and other members on 
both sides of the House have agreed it is an issue that should be 
addressed and can be rectified.
<P>
	I chair the Subcommittee on Private Members' Business. 
When the matter came before the committee all of the members 
conceded that it was an area that could and should be addressed. 
For other reasons the bill was not included in the votable bills.
<P>
	I want to indicate that I have always been and I continue to be 
supportive of this legislative amendment. Perhaps it is too small 
an amendment for the minister who is working on huge projects 
now involving UI and the social safety net to include as a single 
legislative item. But it is acknowledged by virtually everyone to 
be an issue which should be rectified.
<P>
	As a result, it would be a shame if as an item of private 
members' business this matter could not be dealt with at the 
standing committee. It would be easy to get it there, but as you 
know, Madam Speaker, and as all members know, at this point in 
the process it would require unanimous consent of the House. It 
would be second reading and adoption in principle. I intend to 
ask the House for that now. I think all members have heard the 
arguments lying behind the bill and I hope they will accept it.
<P>
	I am torn between moving adoption of the bill at second 
reading and referral to a committee or simply asking members to 
agree unanimously that the subject matter be referred to the 
human resources committee.
<P>
	Since I am still standing, maybe I will move the former and 
perhaps, Madam Speaker, there might be a disposition in the 
House to adopt the bill at second reading and refer it to the 
human resources committee. If that were not the case, perhaps I 
might be allowed to continue with my remarks for another 20 or 
30 seconds to wrap up.
<P>
	I would put the motion now. I would ask that the motion as 
now placed before the House be moved and ask Madam Speaker 
to ascertain whether or not there is unanimous consent to do 
that.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> The House has heard the 
terms of the motion. Is there unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Is it the pleasure of the 
House to adopt the motion?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	(Motion agreed to, bill read the second time and referred to a 
committee.)
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> It being 6.38 p.m. the 
House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m. pursuant to 
Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 6.38 p.m.)
