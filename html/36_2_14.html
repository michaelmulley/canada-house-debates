<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CIVIL INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION 
ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK3">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK4"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (for the Minister of Industry)</B> moved 
that Bill C-4, an act to implement the agreement among the 
Government of Canada, Governments of Member States of the 
European Space Agency, the Government of Japan, the Government of 
the Russian Federation, and the Government of the United States 
of America concerning co-operation on the civil international 
space station and to make related amendments to other acts, be 
read the second time and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK5"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cannis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, today I have the honour to 
speak at second reading of Bill C-4, the legislation governing 
Canada's participation in the greatest science and technology 
project in the history of humanity, namely the international 
space station. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will begin my remarks by quoting one of Canada's foremost 
pioneers, John H. Chapman, who once said:  “In the second 
century of Confederation the fabric of Canadian society will be 
held together by strands in space, just as strongly as the 
railway and telegraph held together the scattered provinces in 
the last century”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These inspiring words were initially pronounced by John H. 
Chapman in the late 1950s, at the early stage of space 
exploration. With his vision, Mr. Chapman is now considered the 
father of the Canadian space program.  Chapman went on to state: 
“The technological advances which are the outcome of space spill 
over into the more normal activities of our world”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what Bill C-4 is all about.  We are talking about space 
exploration for the benefit of all Canadians and humanity.  Bill 
C-4 enables Canada to become a full partner in the greatest 
endeavour, the construction and the operation of the 
international space station.  It formalizes our participation as 
a nation.  Without it Canada can no longer be considered a 
partner.  Without it this nation would lose a tremendous 
opportunity for the development of Canadian space research in 
science.  Without it Canada would also jeopardize hundreds, even 
thousands of jobs all ready created in this high tech 
environment.

<A HREF="#LINKT1"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our investment in international space science and technology 
projects, like the international space station, positions 
Canadian scientists, engineers and entrepreneurs on the world 
market.  It allows this nation to continue contributing to 
scientific discovery and our understanding of the entire 
universe.  That is what Bill C-4 is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The international space station is a symbol of international 
co-operation and the joint effort of the world's leading 
industrial nations, including Canada as a key partner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its final form the station will cover an area as large as a 
football field and will accommodate a permanent international 
crew of seven astronauts, including Canadian astronauts dedicated 
to advancements in the areas of biotechnology, engineering, Earth 
observation and telecommunications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before us relates to the implementation of Canada's 
obligation under the agreement concerning co-operation on the 
international space station and extends the application of the 
Canadian criminal code to Canadians on board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All parties to the agreement have undertaken to establish a 
framework for mutual international co-operation in relation to 
the detailed design, development, operation and use of a 
permanently inhabited space station for peaceful purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before us brings Canadian law in line with the 
international obligations negotiated in the agreement and thereby 
reaffirms Canada's strong commitment to participate in this most 
historic project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The history of Canada's participation in the international space 
station project dates back to the year when Canada's first 
astronaut, Marc Garneau, travelled in space.  It was in 1984 when 
President Reagan invited friends and allies to join the United 
States in the building, operation and use of a space station 
within the Earth's orbit for peaceful purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In March 1985 Canada accepted the invitation and notified NASA 
that Canada's contribution was to be based on the concept of the 
mobile servicing system.  The system is nothing less than the 
next generation of the Canadarm, which would help assemble and 
maintain the space station once in orbit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1988 Canada, the U.S., Europe and Japan formalized a 
partnership with the signature of an international 
intergovernmental agreement on the space station.  This set out 
the broad principles and legal basis for co-operation in the 
space station program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following the redesign of the space station in 1993, the 
partners finally invited Russia to join the partnership in what 
became a truly international space station. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On April 8, 1997, during a press conference with President 
Clinton, the Prime Minister of Canada reaffirmed Canada's 
participation in the international space station program with an 
announcement that Canada would provide the special purpose 
dexterous manipulator.  This appendage-like robotic technology, 
often referred to as a robotic hand, is designed to operate with 
a new robotic arm for delicate assembly and repair operations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following three years of negotiations, all parties signed the 
revised international agreement on the space station on January 
29, 1998, officially bringing Russia into the partnership.  This 
agreement stipulates a two year ratification period to January 
29, 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-4 allows Canada to ratify this international agreement 
and legally endorse our commitment to this partnership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over and over again in international discussions about this 
country's many accomplishments in space, Canada's role with 
respect to the Canadarm is often mentioned.  Clearly, our space 
robotics and automation technologies have become symbols of 
Canada's great success in the field of high tech and a source of 
price for all Canadians.  Moreover, for the global high tech 
community our robotic technologies have become a showcase of what 
this nation is capable of doing here on Earth and out in space. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most importantly, the success of the Canadarm has given Canada 
the credibility to venture even further, with the full confidence 
of the world's space-faring nations, to undertake the next step 
in advanced space robotic systems. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1015"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the outset, Canada's involvement has capitalized on its 
expertise in space robotics.  Canada maintains its position as a 
world leader in this specific field.  It also provides Canada's 
scientific communities privileged access to the unique 
microgravity environment and creates new technology spinoffs for 
the entire country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today Canada is already reaping the benefits of its 
participation in the project in terms of contracts to Canada's 
space industry and the prestige of being part of one of the 
greatest engineering feats in our history.  Overall, Canada 
expects returns of three or four times the original investment, 
along with many high tech positions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's participation in the assembly of the international 
space station began with flying colours.  Last December, we 
watched how the Canadarm and the Canadian artificial vision 
system were brought together to assemble the first two modules of 
the space station, the American module “Unity” and the Russian 
module “Zarya”.  Canada's knowhow was instrumental in getting 
this incredible project started. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes without saying that the very act of Canada playing a 
role unifying these two modules is quite symbolic.  In May of 
this year, we watched with great pride as Julie Payette became 
the first Canadian to board the first two modules of the station. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Next year, Marc Garneau will participate in his third mission as 
a crew member of the STS-97.  The mission will be devoted mainly 
to installing the international space station's solar panels and 
will require two space walks, co-ordinated by Mr. Garneau. Among 
his other duties, Mr. Garneau will operate the Canadarm for 
assembly purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following Marc Garneau will be Chris Hadfield on his second 
mission.  Canadians will be watching Chris Hadfield make history 
by becoming the first Canadian to perform a space walk to install 
Canada's new robotic arm on the international space station. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once the arm is installed, Canadians and the rest of the world 
will watch with pride as the Canadarm and the new arm of the 
space station working in concert to build the largest space 
structure and microgravity laboratory ever built. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once the entire mobile servicing system is operational, with the 
installation of the helping robotic hand functioning on the end 
of the arm, astronauts will be able to perform complex on-orbit 
tasks quickly, safely and cost efficiently from the relative 
comfort of the space station modules.  Simply put, without the 
use of the Canadian robotic technologies the station could not be 
built nor maintained efficiently and effectively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In March of this year, the Government of Canada provided the 
Canadian Space Agency with stable ongoing funding for the 
Canadian space program.  The funds demonstrate the government's 
strong commitment to promoting advanced sciences and technologies 
that are driving the global knowledge based economy and helping 
Canadians remain leaders in the field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our investments in space support our international commitments 
to the environment as in the case of the Montreal protocol and 
agreements signed in Kyoto.  Canada, the creator of the RADARSAT, 
the remarkable satellite that has given this nation world 
leadership in managing the Earth from space.  Today, RADARSAT is 
being used to manage floods as it did in the Manitoba Red River 
floods, support disaster management operations as it did in Kobe, 
Japan and provide a greater understanding of the effects of war 
on local populations and environments as it did in Vietnam. 
Our investments in space advance science discovery.  Through 
experiments being performed by the world's space science 
community, in which Canadian scientists are recognized for their 
decisive role, we are learning more about the universe, the 
effects of the sun on the Earth and how to exploit the unique 
microgravity environment to obtain invaluable insight into the 
cardiovascular system, bones, brain and effects of radiation on 
human organisms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian space science experiments, for example, are addressing 
human disorders including cancer and bone diseases such as 
osteoporosis, an ailment that affects over one million Canadians.

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our investment advances innovation and spinoffs in our everyday 
lives.  Today, we seem unaware of the fact that each time we turn 
on the television, listen to the weather forecast, visit the 
doctor, turn to our portable computers, pick up our car phone or 
lace up our shock absorbing running shoes, we access products and 
services that space has helped to advance. The list of products 
and services is long and the positive contribution to the quality 
of our lives is indeed real. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our investment therefore also promotes a space industry which 
employs thousands of Canadians and registers revenues of well 
over $1.4 billion, of which, let me point out, 45% is in the form 
of exports and is the largest among our space-faring nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of Canada's industrial strategy whereby space 
robotics and automation has become a strategic niche, our 
industry has responded with innovative technologies that are 
making their mark on the world all over.  For example, a 
Newfoundland company has developed a sensitive skin originally 
developed for space robotic manipulators and is applying the 
technology to prosthetics and the bumpers of cars to control the 
deployment of air bags.  All this is thanks to Canadian 
innovation and the Canadian space program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other leading industrialized nations are turning to Canadian 
expertise to help make their contribution to the space station 
project a reality.  EMS Technologies of Ottawa recently won a 
$9.5 million contract from Mitsubishi of Japan to supply 
electronics to Japan's contribution to the international space 
station.  Additional orders could bring the total contract up to 
$24 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Above all, our commitment to the vibrant space sector is a 
commitment to the nation's youth, our future scientists, 
engineers and even our future astronauts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ratification of Bill C-4 is an important step to what has 
been a long and beneficial international engagement for our 
country.  The third nation in the world, Canada was the first 
non-super power to have a satellite in orbit.  That was 35 years 
ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada was the first nation in the world to have its own 
domestic satellite telecommunications system linking Canadians in 
every corner of our vast land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada was the creator of the RADARSAT, the remarkable satellite 
that has given Canada world leadership in managing Earth from 
space. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is home to an astronaut team whose expertise in space 
exploration is recognized throughout the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada was the architect of the world famous Canadarm, a 
technological marvel which has become a worldwide trademark for 
Canada's excellence in high technology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legacy of Canadian achievements goes on and on, a legacy of 
which all Canadians can feel justifiably very proud. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What of the future?  In many ways, space is the national 
railroad of the next century, linking all Canadians from sea to 
sea, uniting Canadians throughout space. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we usher in Bill C-4, we direct attention to Canada's 
remarkable history of achievements in space and future of 
boundless opportunities.  The Canadian space program and Canada's 
active participation to the international space station will 
continue to be an essential building block and indeed a highlight 
for the future of our country's social and economic well-being. 
<P><A NAME="LINK6"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, it 
is indeed my pleasure to speak on Bill C-4 which implements an 
agreement that Canada signed last year with the United States, 
Japan, Russia and 11 countries of the European Union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agreement formulates Canada's participation in the 
international space station.  The space station is a bold and 
exciting project which has nations around the world working 
together in a spirit of co-operation rather than rivalry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the largest science and technology project in the history 
of humanity and Canadians should be proud of the role we are 
playing and that we will continue to play a key role in its 
development.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In its final form, the space station will cover an area as large 
as a football field.  My colleague was just asking whether it was 
an American or Canadian football field size.  I do not know the 
answer to that question, but I know that it will weigh over 450 
tonnes and orbit the Earth at an average altitude of 400 
kilometres. It will be clearly visible in the night sky as it 
orbits the Earth.  I am not sure whether Canadians will be able 
to see the new generation space arm and hand that is going to be 
there, but they will certainly see it assemble the space station 
as it is being constructed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The habitation models and laboratories will accommodate a 
permanent international crew of seven astronauts dedicated to 
advancements in areas of biotechnology, engineering, Earth 
observation and telecommunications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to say today that the Reform Party will be 
supporting the speedy passage of the bill.  I recognize there is 
some urgency in getting the bill passed quickly to meet the 
commitments that we have already made to our partners on the 
project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The leader of the Reform Party is a keen follower of space 
technology. He expresses keen interest in the project and I know 
he wants it to go ahead.  Many of my colleagues have the same 
kind of keen interest in this area.  I have had the opportunity 
of touring the Houston Space Science Centre two years ago.  I 
really enjoyed that experience and marvelled at the technology 
that we have achieved in the world in just some 30 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will go back to a comment made by the parliamentary secretary 
when he talked about national railways.  A distant relative of 
mine, George Stephenson in England in the early 1800s, was the 
man who invented the first steam locomotive and the railway that 
opened up the world.  The innovation that happened as a result of 
the railway is what we are seeing today in a new forum, the new 
forum being space technology and a very exciting one at that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I get into a bit of the background, I just want to say 
that if the bill were to come to all stages today we would be 
very much in favour of it passing quickly.  Reform will be 
supporting the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will provide listeners with a bit of background as to when and 
how the space station got its start. Back in January of 1984, the 
President of the United States directed NASA to develop and place 
in orbit a permanently manned space station.  At the time, 
President Ronald Reagan invited friends and allies to participate 
in its development and share the benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the Quebec Summit in March 1985, Canada accepted this 
invitation and confirmed Canada's interest in co-operating at the 
summit meeting in Washington the following year.  At the same 
time, various other countries expressed interest in the project 
and over the years signed memorandums of understanding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was recognized that Russia could greatly enhance the 
capabilities of the space station because it had a long list of 
accomplishments in the area of human space flight and long 
duration missions.  On December 6, 1993, Russia was invited to 
take part in the project.  Arrangements were then made for 
co-operation on human space flight activities, including the 
Russian-U.S. Mir shuttle program, to prepare for the the building 
of the space station. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On January 29, 1998, these countries got together and signed the 
Civil International Space Station Agreement which established a 
framework for the design, development, operation and utilization 
of the space station. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we have Bill C-4 at second reading which seeks to 
implement the agreement that we signed last year to make this 
possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will speak for a moment about the agreement itself and the 
bill that implements it.  The international agreement was signed 
by Canada, the United States, Japan, Russia and 11 European 
countries.  It contains 28 articles and an annex which summarizes 
the tasks of the various countries that they have committed 
themselves to.  In Canada's case, the Canadian Space Agency will 
provide three elements: a mobile servicing centre, a special 
purposes dexterous manipulator, the hand, the new generation 
Canadarm and space station-unique ground elements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The articles lay out the objectives and scope of the agreement, 
international rights and obligations, ownership of the elements 
of the equipment and the management of the space station itself. 
As well, aspects of the design and development are covered:  the 
right to provide qualified crew, transportation, the right of 
access to the space station and the provision of a communications 
network. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each partner will bear the cost of fulfilling its respective 
responsibilities under the agreement, including sharing, on an 
equitable basis, the common systems operation costs, the 
activities attributed to the operation of the space station as a 
whole. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1030"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>An important article in my view is article 19 which deals with 
the exchange of data and goods.  Each partner to the agreement 
agrees to transfer all technical data and goods considered 
necessary for the fulfilment of the partners' responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-4 contains provisions in clause 7 that give the 
government the power to force companies, individuals and third 
parties who are not in direct contractual relationship to the 
crown to release information related to the space agency.  This 
power is necessary in the event that a company working under 
contract to the government on the project gets bought out by 
another company and is unwilling to honour the company's 
contractual obligations. This would severely affect its ability 
to operate. Therefore there is a need for clause 7. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 8 provides safeguards to ensure the documents that are so 
produced are not unduly communicated to other parties.  While the 
exchange of information and scientific data is crucial to the 
success and successful development of the entire project, the 
protection of intellectual property rights is also important. To 
ensure that intellectual property rights are protected, the 
agreement contains article 21 which states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the purposes of intellectual property law, an activity 
occurring in or on a space station flight element shall be deemed 
to have occurred only in the territory of the partner state of 
that element's registry. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This gives some protection to those countries that are 
conducting research and development there with new products. They 
will have some legal parameters around the product they produce 
in space.  It will belong to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Normal patent procedures will apply.  That means that a person 
or entity first filing a patent is the owner of that intellectual 
property.  That is a very important point.  With so many partners 
working on this space station, it is important that there is 
protection for those partners in regard to their research and 
development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also contains amendments to the criminal code.  These 
amendments ensure that any criminal act which is committed in 
space by a Canadian crew member falls under Canadian law.  That 
Canadian would not be tried under the law of the United States or 
Russia for example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That brings me to Canada's involvement in this station. Recently 
Julie Payette became the first Canadian to board the space 
station but that will not be the end by any means.  In 2000 Marc 
Garneau will participate in his third space mission as a crew 
member of a shuttle mission.  He will be followed by Chris 
Hadfield who will install Canada's space station robotic 
manipulator system, the next generation Canadarm and the main 
element of the mobile servicing system called MSS for short. This 
goes to the building of the space station itself and enables the 
space station and its partners to construct the space station 
once the new robotics is in place with the new Canadarm and hand. 
That will provide the necessary infrastructure to do the work to 
put the space station together.  Once installed, the MSS will 
move around the space station doing assembly and repair work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is also contributing to a vision system for the operators 
of the remote manipulator who must operate the robotic arm from 
inside the windowless space station, no small task I would 
suggest.  On the ground, the MSS operations complex at the 
Canadian Space Agency in Saint Hubert, Quebec will plan missions, 
monitor the condition of the remote manipulator and train space 
station crew in its use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cost of designing, developing, operating and launching the 
MSS into orbit is approximately $1.4 billion over 20 years.  That 
covers the period of 1984 to 2004.  It costs approximately $3 per 
Canadian taxpayer per year.  Canada's contribution is relatively 
small at just 2.5% but it is important nonetheless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1999 federal budget provided the Canadian Space Agency with 
$430 million in new funds over three years which stabilized the 
agency's budget at $300 million per year starting in the year 
2002-03. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That brings me to the present and future benefits the Canadian 
Space Station and our involvement might bring Canadians.  The 
scientific benefit for Canadians from the space station will be 
our ability to monitor Earth, to study our environment including 
agricultural crop monitoring, that is, if there are any Canadian 
farmers and farm crops left to monitor in the future. However, it 
is an important aspect and I think it will deliver important 
benefits. 
It will have the ability to monitor the Canadian Arctic ice pack 
so that there will be aid to Canadian ships navigating in Arctic 
waters.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Close to 90% of Canada's investment is going out in contracts to 
Canadian firms.  The rest is going to universities.  Since 1987 
over 150 contracts have been let for automation and robotics 
technology development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the space station's estimated 10 year lifespan, Canada 
will be able to expand its research in microgravity with 
applications to human disorders such as osteoporosis and cancer. 
Canada will also continue its research into protein 
crystallization in space which will be a big aid to medical 
research in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The technologies that already resulted from our space 
involvement include the first robotic refuelling station.  This 
was developed by a firm in British Columbia in partnership with 
Shell.  As well, a Quebec firm has applied space expertise to 
develop a digital imaging system for X-rays which eliminates the 
need for photographic films.  In addition, a company in 
Newfoundland has developed a sensitive skin which was originally 
developed for space robotic manipulators and is now being applied 
to artificial limbs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many Canadian firms have successfully entered international 
markets by landing contracts based on the expertise they gained 
on the various aspects of the space project.  Other firms are 
helping partners in other countries with their own contribution 
to the space project.  For example, EMS Technologies of Ottawa 
recently won a $9.5 million contract from Mitsubishi to supply 
electronics to Japan's contribution to the space station.  There 
is an ongoing benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that Canada's involvement in space is producing 
tremendous returns.  On our own we would not be able to develop 
or fund a project of this magnitude, but in co-operation with our 
peace-loving partners the potential for a meaningful contribution 
and rewarding spinoffs is great. I suggest it will be no less 
important than technologies in the industrial revolution such as 
the innovations which led to the discovery of the steam 
locomotive and the railway itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps most important of all is that Canada's young people will 
follow Canada's achievements in space, thereby sparking their 
interest in the fields of science and technology.  We do not need 
to be reminded that our future prosperity lies in our ability to 
encourage pursuit of knowledge for those that follow behind us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On that note, I will end my speech.  I want to inform the House 
that the Reform Party is supporting this bill in all stages.  We 
do not want to delay its speedy passage in any way. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK7"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, it is my 
turn to speak to Bill C-4, an act to implement the Agreement 
among the Government of Canada, Governments of Member States of 
the European Space Agency, the Government of Japan, the 
Government of the Russian Federation and the Government of the 
United States of America concerning Co-operation on the Civil 
International Space Station and to make related amendments to 
other acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we are at the end of a millennium, and when we stop to 
think about it, the rate of progress of space research and the 
discovery of space has been phenomenal, especially in recent 
years. From the moment man first started to go into space, it 
was only a matter of decades before a space station was built, 
as well as an orbiting station, permitting astronauts to go into 
space for months at a time to conduct tests and experiments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously that advances our research considerably and provides 
opportunities for important discoveries.  It also raises—we 
have to be honest about it—questions by people about the cost 
of these projects and results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It remains very difficult to measure, but it is clear that the 
effects are very significant. 
The potential for discoveries there remains infinite. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1040"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The research done on the orbiting station will be carried out in 
a specific climate of research in which the law of gravity does 
not apply in the same way and where the work will be done in a 
context other than that on Earth.  Therefore, it is very clear 
that this opens windows of opportunity for incredible research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, all of the technology needed to build a station, to 
do this work, to go into space, is clearly becoming 
transmittable and reusable for other purposes, I would say in a 
more down to Earth fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to put into perspective the progress that has been made 
possible by this use and discovery of space, let us look at the 
whole field of communications.  It would be hard to imagine how 
information could be moved rapidly without all those satellites 
we now have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A great deal of money had to be invested in the technology for 
launching these satellites, putting them in service, recovering 
them if necessary, ensuring they are operating properly, 
determining their lifespans, and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, a new window has opened with the international space 
station, the lifespan of which is predicted at ten years or so, 
although according to some sources, it could be much longer than 
that. 
It must be remembered that the MIR station was expected to last 
about five years, but was in service for over ten.  It is fairly 
obvious therefore that the space station will last longer than 
the predicted ten years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The involvement of the Government of Canada has been 
considerable, compared to our country's financial capacity. 
Clearly, the main contribution comes essentially from the U.S., 
which plays the lead role in this project.  Russia also is 
heavily involved, which raises questions about the future, 
knowing the very hard times Russia is going through financially. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, the initial participation required of them was much 
greater than it will be in the future, but there are still some 
grey areas, particularly because of Russia's role and its 
financial difficulties, which are raising some questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Assembly has now started and we are very, very proud that a 
fellow Quebecer went on the mission and played a part—I am 
referring to Julie Payette—and we want to congratulate her on her 
amazing career.  We are very proud of everything she has done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nor would we wish to forget another Quebec astronaut, Marc 
Garneau, who also went into space, as well as the Canadian 
astronauts, including those who will soon help to install the 
orbital station's Canadarm, which will play a key role in 
assembly operations. 
A Canadian system will also play a pivotal role in the repair 
and maintenance of the orbital station. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, even though our participation is modest and scaled to what 
we can do as Quebecers and Canadians, we can take pride in 
contributing to a project such as this one, which is furthering 
the development of technology.  No one knows yet how significant 
the discoveries made at the station will be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With all these partnerships, the next step is to adopt some very 
down to Earth legislation, such as this bill stipulating which 
criminal law will apply in the case of an incident, or offence 
as it would become, inside the orbital station. This brings us 
to the question of which legislation will apply in space. 
This is one of the issues addressed by Bill C-4. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also wish to point out that Bill C-4 flows from an agreement 
signed by several countries that appears as a schedule to the 
bill.  In this connection, however, I have one criticism to make 
of the government.  Even though we are in favour of the bill, it 
is still a bit regrettable that these agreements were not 
approved by parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since we support the bill, we therefore cannot say that the 
agreement should not have been debated in this place.  It should 
have been approved by the House of Commons and not simply 
signed.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal tendency in this area since they have been in 
government is somewhat deplorable.  Moreover, my colleague from 
Beauharnois—Salaberry has introduced a private member's bill, 
C-214, the purpose of which is to ensure that treaties are passed 
and ratified by parliament. Clearly we would have liked this to 
have been the case for Bill C-4. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To describe the contents of the treaty appended to this bill as 
its schedule, I could list the signatory states. 
schedule 
Obviously, there is the Government of Canada, and the 
governments of the Federal Republic of Germany, Belgium, 
Denmark, Spain, the French Republic, the Italian Republic, the 
Kingdom of Norway, the Kingdom of the Netherlands, the United 
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Sweden, 
Switzerland, all of these being member states of the European 
Space Agency, the Government of Japan, the Russian Federation 
and the United States of America. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In all, there are about 
fifteen signatories.  The agreement was signed nearly two years 
ago, and calls for its terms to be implemented within two years 
of initial signature, and for the necessary legislative measures 
to be passed within two years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the present time, not all countries have initiated the 
process. 
Russia is one of these, which is why I referred just now to 
questions and concerns being raised about its future role in the 
space station.  There are already very specific agreements with 
Russia; the partnership is not the same as with the other member 
states.  Russia has its own space in the space station. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, Canada's laboratory time will be a percentage of 
the non-Russian space.  The Russians have their own space, their 
own module, laboratory and equipment.  There is, however, an 
agreement on co-operation between the Russians and the other 
partners, but Russia still represents a potential cause of delay 
because of its participation and the related funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The articles of this agreement—I will not read all of it, as 
members will find it appended to the bill—first define the 
purpose and scope of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Subsequently, they set out the international rights and 
obligations. Definitions are given. The following are also 
mentioned: cooperating agencies, registration, jurisdiction, 
controls, ownership of elements and equipment—which must be 
defined in such a partnership—management, detailed design and 
project development, station utilization, as well as operation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also references to rules governing the crews, 
transportation, telecommunications relating to the orbiting 
station, project evolution, funding, which in all projects, is a 
key element, a cross-waiver of liability—the countries have 
agreed to sign such a waiver—and so on. Then we move on to the 
sections on customs, a convention on responsibility, data and 
goods and exchange and the conditions for withdrawing from the 
agreement, should a member ever decided to withdraw. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other sections on intellectual property, since this is 
very important where research is concerned.  In space, there is 
a notion of intellectual property which may be debated and 
become the subject of litigation on occasion. However, many 
applications of research done in space will be used in 
additional research on Earth.  Discoveries will be made there 
for basic research too, which will find application in other 
research projects that will be carried out here, back on Earth. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1050"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT9"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must also be understood that, even though the astronauts will 
be there for periods of between three and six months, this is a 
short time, since research is being carried out over the longer 
term.  Some research will be done there, tested and carried out, 
but it will be developed much further back on Earth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also provisions on criminal justice.  This is what I 
was talking about earlier and they are to be found in the bill 
as well.  The measures on criminal justice pertain to any 
incidents that might occur on board the orbiting station. 
It is fairly straightforward.  If ever a Canadian astronaut were 
to commit an offence, he would be subject to Canadian law, 
except in the case of homicide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of a sponsored astronaut, such as a Brazilian 
sponsored by the United States, American law would apply.  That 
is our understanding of the bill, anyway.  There are also 
sections on the entry into force, amendments, and operative 
effect between the parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That about sums up what is in the agreement signed almost two 
years ago.  As 1999 draws to a close, its adoption is near. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since some time has passed, the signed agreement probably could 
have been introduced here first and formally adopted, after 
which Bill C-4, which establishes the related measures, could 
have been passed. 
Parliamentarians could thus have commented on the obligations 
with which they agreed and those with which they did not agree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not challenging the obligations.  We are saying that we 
do not like the precedent, which has denied the House an 
opportunity to comment.  It is true that we are having our say 
now with respect to the agreement included in the schedule to 
the bill, but the bill per se has to do with its own clauses. 
The agreement as such is contained in the schedule. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier, I mentioned costs and the involvement of the federal 
government in the orbital station.  The space agency itself has 
an annual budget of about $300 million.  This is the funding the 
agency receives from the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here, we are talking about a forecast of $1.4 billion. 
One could always argue about the spinoffs, but it is believed 
that they could reach $6 billion and include some 70,000 jobs, 
on a yearly basis, for the duration of the project. That is a 
lot of money and a lot of jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even if the spinoffs are not as great as anticipated, we are 
still talking about significant amounts of money that would help 
businesses, in Quebec and in Canada, achieve some degree of 
success. Quebec is doing rather well in the aerospace industry. 
The space agency, which is located in Saint-Hubert, is a very 
good thing for the aerospace industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The work done by companies in these sectors and the contracts 
that they can get with regard to orbiting station projects allow 
them to develop a critical mass of researchers and people to do 
the work. It also allows these companies to use their products 
for civilian applications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some members alluded to numerous technological, medical or 
scientific achievements and discoveries resulting from 
initiatives that were originally funded through aerospace 
projects, whether past ones or the one that we are discussing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Very clearly, we will support this bill. I know that discussions 
took place to proceed quickly. We certainly have no intention of 
delaying the adoption of Bill C-4. However, it would be good to 
still have the legislation go through the normal process, in 
other words, to have it referred to a committee after second 
reading, so that members can get answers to their questions.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of us here took part in Space Agency and departmental 
training sessions on the bill. The Standing Committee on 
Industry committee will be able to go into the matter further, 
examining everything related to it, such as timeframes and 
budgets.  It is normal after all to take the time needed in 
order to ensure that it is passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is therefore normal for the bill to go through the regular 
stages.  If the government had wanted the bill passed more 
quickly, it ought to have convened the House earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude now by telling hon. members that we will be 
voting in favour of Bill C-4 on second reading.  We also intend 
to support it on third reading.  There are a few questions we 
will want to go into in committee, including the meeting of 
deadlines.  We will have the opportunity to discuss matters with 
those who appear before the committee, particularly Space Agency 
and departmental officials.  This bill will eventually come back 
to us for the third reading stage.  I believe the committee will 
ultimately move to accept it and return it to the House.  It is 
our intention to again support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My congratulations to all those who work on projects relating to 
the development of the space station, whether Quebecers, 
Canadians, Americans or others.  Who knows, one day one of us, 
or a friend or family member, or one of our constituents, may 
benefit from the discoveries resulting from these research 
projects. 
Science will show us all the potential future effects of this 
undertaking, and I must say that the possibilities are endless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I wish to again indicate our intention to vote in 
favour of Bill C-4.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the inconsistent and lenient treatment of the provision

direction from parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This week a 42 year old individual pleaded guilty to conspiracy 
in trafficking cocaine.  Mr. Justice Norman Douglas called 
cocaine an insidious drug which ruins people's lives and results 
in more spinoff crime.  But did he remove the individual from the 
community to protect the citizens?  No, he imposed an eight month 
sentence at home.  The individual must obey a 9 p.m. curfew, 
unless working, and report to police every Saturday morning. That 
sort of punishment does nothing to discourage individuals from 
trafficking in serious drugs.  I even wonder if that individual 
can avoid the curfew by arguing that the selling of cocaine is a 
form of work.

in the House and demanded that the government cut taxes.  Its

been raising taxes for Canadians every year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Toronto-Dominion Bank is only the latest to agree with us, 
that the government has been gouging Canadian taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the government continue to take more and more and more

it do it? 
<P><A NAME="LINK50"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, why do Reform Party members engage in their questions in 
acts of wilful blindness? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Their blindness prevents them from seeing that in the last two 
budgets we have legislated tax cuts for each and every Canadian 
worth billions and billions of dollars, and we will continue to 
do so. 
<P><A NAME="LINK51"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard M. Harris (Prince George—Bulkley Valley,

the government takes more taxes from Canadians, up $40 billion 
since 1993.  Canadians are suffering.  They cannot make ends meet 
under this burdensome government tax burden. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thirty-eight per cent of all income in the country is gobbled up 
by the government.  How can the government stand there and 
continue to say that it is cutting taxes when all the time it is 
raising taxes?  All the evidence is there.  What is wrong with 
the government?  Does it not get it? 
<P><A NAME="LINK52"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr.

</I></B></P><P align=left>He cannot do that when it comes to individual Canadians because

under the Liberal government.  Their answer will be yes, they 
are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals are ripping off $40 billion more in taxes from

<I>The Great Pretender</I>.   They are pretending to be concerned 
about ordinary Canadians.  In their election platform they say 
they want to cut health care and they want to cut services to 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are maintaining services to Canadians while at the same time 
we are in fact, in our legislation, implementing our budgets, 
cutting taxes for each and every Canadian.  We are not pretending

They are saying that we should thank them for taking $21 billion 
instead of the $25 billion they could have taken.  That is like 
me thanking the robber who stole $21 from my wallet because he 
did not take $25. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of thousands of Canadians, small business owners and

a cumulative deficit of $14 billion.  Guess who paid for this 
deficit?  All Canadian taxpayers did.  Look at who is benefiting 
today from the surplus we see there.  It is all Canadian 
taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We eliminated the $42 billion deficit.  We gave $16.5 billion in

yesterday, we were convinced that it was in June that the 
Minister of Transport had set up the conditions that would allow 
Onex to take over the Canadian airline industry by making an 
illegal bid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning, we learned that Onex was already 
worried on May 10 about the stir its bid might cause and 
suggested that the announcement be made during the parliamentary

<P><A NAME="LINK62"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
very simple.  We began a process to encourage private sector 
solutions to the problem of our airlines.  This process has 
already resulted in at least two bids, which are now being 
considered by the airlines' shareholders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once they have made their decision, we will do our job of

would have favoured one other proposition.  I certainly would 
have been biased in that case”.

Speaker, yesterday the Prime Minister of Canada ambushed the

that showed the farm crisis was not as bad as thought on the 
prairies.  Yet he would not reveal those numbers publicly to the 
premiers or anybody else in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want the Prime Minister to make a commitment to table those 
numbers in the House or, better yet, to come out to Saskatchewan 
and Manitoba and give the numbers to the people.  If he does not 
do that, is he saying that these are phantom numbers which do not 
exist?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Natural Resources and

language the NDP likes to use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As part of the normal activity of Agriculture and Agri-food 
Canada working in co-operation with provincial agricultural 
officials in the various provinces, there is a regular updating 
of all farm income numbers.  That work is ongoing as it normally 
would be, not just every year but particularly in a year like 
this one where there is a farm income problem of very serious 
proportions.  The work on those numbers, as I understand it, is 
not fully complete.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B> Mr.

numbers are complete it will table them in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to know why, at the same time the Prime 
Minister says the numbers are improving, the situation is getting 
better.  The Canadian Wheat Board revised its predictions for 
prices this year and dropped those predictions by 4% or 5%, which 
means the situation is getting worse, not better? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How could the government be so out of touch when the Prime

an adjustment payment on the 1999-2000 year.

bank shareholders have seen $7.2 billion less in shareholder

richer and Canadians are getting poorer.

</I></B></P><P align=left>For years the House has travelled across the country to listen

in previous years, the government and most parties in the House 
have wanted to repeat this exercise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have wanted to consult Canadians.  We have wanted, and we 
still want, them to contribute toward the budgetary process.  I 
for one happen to think that what Canadians have to say about our

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the official opposition has decided, because it could 
not get its way in stalling Nisga'a, that it would not allow the 
finance committee to travel.  It wants to punish Canadians.  It 
wants to prevent Canadians from contributing to the budgetary 
process because it cannot get its way on another bill, namely 
Nisga'a. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Next Tuesday the committee is scheduled to be in London, 
Ontario.  Unless the motion to have the committee travel can pass 
the House, it will cost over $200,000 to cancel the previously 
organized meeting in London, Ontario, let alone the cost of 
cancelling the other meeting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee has asked the House to go to London, Ontario, on 
November 2, as I said previously; to visit Toronto on November 8 
and 9; and to go to Halifax, Quebec City, Calgary, Vancouver, 
Regina and perhaps elsewhere to consult Canadians on the budget. 
I agree that Canadians have something to say about the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our government promised in the red book in 1993 that we would 
consult Canadians on the budget.  Later Canadians told us that 
they appreciated this process.  The House has voted time and time 
again to allow the committee to consult Canadians on the budget. 
The House has voted unanimously on several occasions to consult 
Canadians on the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This year, should this motion not pass, Canadians will be 
punished not by the House, not by the government, but by one 
party which is choosing for its own narrow interest to punish not 
us as MPs but to punish Canadians by stopping them from 
contributing to the budgetary process, a process instituted years 
ago by the House.  That is not right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge all hon. members to allow Canadians to contribute to the 
budgetary process, to allow the committee to travel to British 
Columbia, to Vancouver and elsewhere, so that Canadians can say 
what they think of budgetary policy and can contribute in a 
meaningful way.  I do not think Canadians will tolerate being 
dictated to by the narrow interests of the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe all others in the House want this process to proceed. 
What Reformers are doing is wrong again.  What they are doing in 
Nisga'a is equally wrong, but at least on Nisga'a they have the 
right to vote against what they want to vote against.  They have 
a right to be wrong, but they do not have a right to punish 
Canadians the way they are doing now.  That is taking this 
institution as a hostage.  I for one do not want our parliament, 
this Chamber, which is representative of all Canadians, to be 
taken as a hostage by the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us vote on this motion.  Let us vote in favour of it.  Let 
us allow Canadians to contribute toward the budgetary process as 
they have in the past. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what must happen, because it is the right thing to do, 
because Canadians have said so, and because the House has said 
so on more than one occasion in the past. We are now at the 
moment of truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will see in a few minutes whether the Reform Party wants to 
make hostages not just of members of all political parties in 
this House, who want to consult Canadians about the budget, but 
of Canadians themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will find out whether the Reform Party will take the Canadian 
people hostage and punish them because the motion it introduced 
to stop the work of the House was not approved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No.  I am sure that, this weekend, Canadians will tell members 
of the Reform Party that they have no right to do what they are 
doing, because they are in the wrong, and that they are 
punishing Canadians and causing taxpayers unnecessary expense. 
That is what Canadians will tell Reformers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is still time.  There is still time for the members of the 
party opposite to say “Yes, we are entitled to our views 
regarding the Nisga'a treaty; we are entitled to our views on 
any subject at all, but we will not take this parliament and

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard M. Harris (Prince George—Bulkley Valley, 
Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, that was an absolutely astounding, 
unbelievable presentation by the member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we want to talk about narrow agendas and taking hostages, the 
narrow agenda of the Liberal government is to ram through the 
Nisga'a agreement having no regard for the voices of British 
Columbians.  The Liberals do not want to go to B.C.  They do not 
want to hear the voices of British Columbians talking of their 
concerns about the Nisga'a agreement.  That is why they are 
taking this position on the Reform Party's request that the 
Indian affairs committee travel to British Columbia so it can 
hear the voice of British Columbians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government is not interested in that.  It accuses us of 
holding parliament hostage.  It is holding the people of British 
Columbia hostage in its constant refusal to listen to their 
concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be realistic about the wants and the desires of the 
government to have the finance committee go to London to hear the 
economic report of the finance minister.  It is almost laughable 
that the member can stand and say that the government is out 
there to listen to Canadians.  We all know that it is only a dog 
and pony show, an agenda so that the finance minister can go out 
and tell Canadians what his— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  That is a statement, surely.  If the hon. 
government House leader wishes to respond to the statement he may 
do so briefly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to respond to 
the hon. member.  I know he was listening attentively to what I 
was saying, otherwise he surely would not have asked the question 
or raised the point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We brought the Nisga'a bill to the House and it has now been 
debated on at least two separate occasions, if not three.  Let us 
consider what the Reform Party did.  It amended the motion by 
asking the House to withdraw the bill, and then it amended that 
motion to allow members to filibuster another time. This was an 
effort by the Reform Party to filibuster the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I proposed on the floor of the House two days ago to extend 
the hours of sitting to listen to more Reform members' excellent 
speeches on the Nisga'a agreement, members of the Reform Party 
turned it down.  They did not want more debate on Nisga'a.  They 
turned it down.  It is not that they want more debate; it is that 
they want the bill delayed and they want to punish Canadians.

the hon. member brings up, it is expressly stated in the rules. 
However, for at least the past five years since I have been 
Speaker, all members have been allowed to split their time at one 
time or another.  It has become the practice of the House, and I 
would hope that the committee on procedures would look at it and 
correct it.  Our practice is now, as all hon. members will agree 
and know, to allow all hon. members to split their time at any 
time.  I see no reason to digress from that at this point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, for clarification, you said 
that you wished the procedure and House affairs committee would 
take this up, yet you have already ruled and made it a rule. 
Therefore, is it necessary for the procedure and House affairs 
committee to actually deal with it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  In clarification of that, I would hope that 
the wording would reflect our practices.  That is all I am saying 
to the House.  Although I have ruled on this now, because we have 
been doing this for at least five years, I would hope that the 
committee would change the wording to reflect the practices of 
the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill:</B>  Mr. Speaker, are we now to assume that 
whatever is the customary practice, even though it is not written 
into our standing orders or Beauchesne's, will be the rules of 
the House? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  We are to assume that whatever we have 
accepted as practice, as a House, for the last five years, is 
what we have been doing.  I think that all hon. members who are 
here today would agree that this has been our practice and that 
this particular point has not been raised before.  If we have a 
practice which is working for us in the House, then I think we 
should follow our practices.  I would never change a rule 
unilaterally, but surely I must interpret what our practices are 
in the House.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have a short preamble to the question I have for the 
minister.  I agree in some ways with Reform that closure and time 
allocation are used too often.  I think we all agree with that. I 
also do not think it is necessary to have the finance minister go 
to London to make a financial statement.  However, my 
understanding is that his motion before the House is not just 
about London, it is about allowing the finance committee to do 
what it traditionally does, which is to go around the country to 
consult the people.  Unless I am mistaken, I think I have heard 
the leader of the Reform Party talk about grassroots and 
consultation with the ordinary folks of this country.  I know in 
my case that people in Saskatchewan are quite anxious for the 
committee to visit Regina.  It will be going to Regina to talk 
about the farm crisis.  I spoke with the president of the 
Saskatchewan wheat pool yesterday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ask the minister across the way whether he can confirm 
that his motion indeed does say that it is not just London, but 
that this committee will go around the country to sell people in 
five or six different— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The hon. government House leader. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Mr. Speaker, yes, the motion is for the 
entire cross-Canada hearings. 
The proposed itinerary, as scheduled now and as recommended by 
the Standing Committee on Finance, is that the committee—and 
this is not exhaustive, but it is the list established thus 
far—attend to London on November 2, Toronto on November 8 and 9, 
Halifax and Quebec City on November 15 and 16, Calgary, Vancouver 
and Regina on November 22, 23 and 24.  Those are the seven 
locations that have already been planned by the finance 
committee.  Of course, Calgary, Regina and Vancouver, those very 
important western communities, are included in the list which I 
have just given.

Just for greater clarification, could I ask that I be given a 
copy of the motion that is now before the House?  I would 
appreciate that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  My colleague, it has been on the order 
paper, as it is now.  Would you like a copy of the order paper

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to 
participate in this debate.  I believe since 1994 the finance 
committee has had the opportunity to go across the country to 
listen to Canadians in preparation of the budget so that 
Canadians could participate in the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For years members have asked for this process and now we have 
implemented it.  Therefore, I support everything that my House 
leader said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I move: 
<A NAME="LINK180">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the question by the chief government whip be now put. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The motion is in order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
It seems like a rather interesting afternoon for a Friday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like some clarification.  My understanding, according to 
the standing orders, is that a member cannot second the amendment 
if he or she has already been the primary mover of the same 
motion.  Is that not true? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  That is correct.  I do not know what the 
problem is.  Mr. Lee seconded the first motion.  Mr. Kilger 
seconded the second one. 
<P><A NAME="LINK181"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>   Mr. Speaker, I am deeply 
concerned about this as a member of the finance committee.  I 
have also had the privilege of travelling with the committee to 
different parts of the country during last fall's hearings.  I 
think it has both merits and demerits.  There are a lot of good 
presentations made by different people who represent different 
points of view which are very valuable to the finance committee. 
However, I seriously question whether they are useful in the 
sense of actually affecting the budget, since over and over again 
the message that we have heard from Canadians in those hearings 
has been systematically ignored. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been many times when we had a convergence of opinion 
in a certain direction and it was not done.  I think probably the 
biggest example is the tremendous message we had last year of 
calling for tax cuts.  The government has chosen instead, in every 
budget that we have had since this Liberal government took power, 
to increase tax revenues.  Therefore, I think going around and 
listening is largely a public relations measure on the part of 
the government because it gives the appearance that it is 
listening, when in fact it is not.

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However I still like to say that as a member of the committee I 
found the input to the committee valuable.  It is really what 
happens after it comes to the committee that is not acceptable. 
After having funded at great public expense to the taxpayers 
these trips around the country, most of the time the government 
ignores what happens in those hearings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a much greater issue. In fact there are several issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion that has been brought forward asks for, among other 
things, approval of the finance minister to make a big splash in 
London next week.  I really object to that.  I would object to it 
even if it were not for the Nisga'a deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is just a fact of life.  I think the taxpayers out there 
should know that when the committee travels, it is a very costly 
effort.  It costs a great deal of money.  Not only are there the 
travel and hotel expenses for the members of the parliamentary 
committee, we also have the support staff.  In many instances 
their number exceeds the number of members on the committee.  We 
have to have translators since our Official Languages Act 
requires that translators from English to French and French to 
English be available.  I have no objection to that but it is a 
cost which is greatly increased when we move the committee away 
from Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here in Ottawa the facilities are all in place.  The translation 
booths are in the committee rooms. We can use the committee 
rooms.  We have the staff who are on salary come in and do the 
translating and everything else.  It is much more economical to 
do it here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to be misunderstood.  I think Canadians should be 
heard.  When I say this it sounds as if I do not want to listen 
to Canadians and that is opposite to what I believe. However, I 
think there is a much more efficient method. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to see the procedure changed so that each member of 
parliament is given perhaps a week to go to his or her riding to 
conduct meetings in every little community hall and listen to the 
people directly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance committee most of the time hears only from groups, 
which is a matter of efficiency.  It is quite efficient to listen 
to people who represent perhaps 1,000 or 10,000 people, or even 
more if they are from other groups that have a large 
constituency.  It is good to hear from them but we fail to hear 
from the ordinary taxpayers, the people at home trying to make 
ends meet who do not belong to this or that organization but are 
taxed to death.  We do not listen to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to see the role of the member of parliament greatly 
enhanced.  Members of parliament should spend a week or two 
specifically on prebudget hearings.  A composite report should be 
made by all 301 members of parliament based on what they heard in 
their ridings so that the voice of the people is heard in this 
place instead of simply the dictatorship of the Liberal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the vote takes place I would like it to be a free vote.  As 
it is now, members are punished by their respective parties, by 
the Liberal Party, the Conservative Party, the NDP, or the Bloc, 
if they do not vote the way they are told to vote.  The Reform 
Party stands alone in saying that the first obligation of members 
of parliament is to represent the people who sent them here. 
That is paramount. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member of the finance committee, I do not mind and in fact 
I like going to other parts of the country. It broadens my 
perspective, but I want to get a real perspective. For example 
last year when we were in Saskatoon everybody went for some fancy 
lunch somewhere. Everyone can tell from looking at me sideways 
that I could skip the odd lunch without any permanent damage, so 
instead of going to a taxpayer paid lunch, I went for a walk on 
the streets of Saskatoon.  I talked to different individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During my walk I met a guy on Second Street.  He had an old 1959 
Meteor like the one I had.  I struck up a conversation with him. 
We talked about his car. 
I talked to him about taxes.  I talked to him about the finances 
of the country.  He was a senior.  He was very concerned about 
the state of affairs.  He was adamant that we should cut taxes. 
Was he heard?  Did the NDP member of parliament who represents 
him bring that message to cut taxes forward?  No, I do not think 
so.  That is what we should be doing.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to address the London trip issue.  I hate to say 
this, but the trip is really not to hear from Canadians; it is a 
photo-op for the finance minister.  Think of what is involved 
here.  It has almost the same logistics as running a war.  We 
have to move all of the people who are involved from the House of 
Commons to London. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of the media has to set up in London. They are already set 
up here.  It would be so easy to make this financial statement, 
this update here, but no, it has to be done in London.  The media 
have to move their trucks, satellite dishes and everything there. 
I am sure they are willing to do it because it is big news when 
the finance minister speaks. It touches the pocketbook of every 
Canadian. The media will be there but at tremendous expense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It costs the taxpayers money not only to send the 
representatives and staff from the House of Commons, but there is 
all of the equipment and the rental of the rooms, all of which 
are incremental costs.  Besides that, taxpayers will pay through 
the funding to CBC to have its representatives there.  It could 
be done here.  The message is the same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do the Liberals want to go to London?  I am guessing here 
but I think it is probably because they have done some polling 
and that is an area that needs a little bit of propping up with a 
little bit of activity.  So the taxpayer is being asked to fund 
this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether the finance minister goes there or not is one question. 
Another question is whether the finance committee travels to 
other parts of the country.  But the big overriding question in 
this whole issue is one which is even more important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House leader of the Liberal Party called this all sorts of 
bad names with respect to Reform. I resent that.  The people of 
Elk Island sent me here to represent them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have in front of us, and this has to do directly with 
finances as well, is the government's unwillingness to debate the 
Nisga'a agreement with the Canadian public.  It has been so 
one-sided until this stage that it is absolutely shameful. 
Absolutely we have to come to some resolution on these issues. It 
cannot be done satisfactorily in a democracy, it cannot be done 
satisfactorily within the finances that we have available to us, 
unless we have the consensus of the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every time I have entered into an agreement it has been with 
someone else.  For example, I recently hired a new staff 
assistant.  He is an excellent young man and I think he would 
want me to say that.  He will probably send this part of 
<I>Hansard</I> to his mom and dad.  He is a great guy.  Before he 
came to work for me, we sat down and agreed on what he would do 
for me and what I would do for him. There are two parties to the 
agreement.  We have all sorts of agreements with respect to 
salary, hours of work, travel conditions, all of those things. 
Some of them are ruled by the Board of Internal Economy.  But we 
made an agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the Nisga'a agreement, the Liberal government is 
failing to recognize that it is an agreement between the two 
parties to the agreement, not just one.  Too much of that 
agreement was hammered out in secrecy behind closed doors.  Even 
certain members of the government of the province of British 
Columbia were unable to receive information with respect to the 
details of it.  It was hidden from them. 
When it was all done, a fait accompli, it was brought to the 
government by the NDP in British Columbia and it was rammed 
through.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  Madam Speaker, I apologize to the 
member from the Reform Party for raising a point of order at this 
time, but I want to raise a question of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of parliament are watching television in the lobby. They 
are watching the Minister of Human Resources Development make an 
announcement on employment equity worth about $3 billion to $3.5 
billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My point of order is that historically major announcements have 
been made in the House of Commons where the opposition parties 
can respond.  It has been an almost iron-clad practice for many, 
many years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Madam Speaker, I hate to put you on the spot, but perhaps you 
could consult with the table to see whether or not an 
announcement of this magnitude should have been made here in the 
House where the people's representatives can respond. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  In answer to the hon. 
member's point of order, there is an ongoing debate about whether 
that type of announcement should be made in the House or 
somewhere else, but it is not a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Madam Speaker, it is not often that I thank 
members from the New Democratic Party for interrupting me while I 
am making a speech, but this time I would certainly concur with 
what the member is saying.  Again it is an atrocious example of 
the dictatorial nature of this Liberal government that it will do 
things outside of the House which should be done in here and 
which should be done in consultation with members of parliament 
who represent their constituents and are accountable to them. 
Instead, the government does this when there is no 
accountability. Even the members present in the Liberal Party do 
not have anything to say on this.  It is atrocious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a agreement is a deal with two groups of people.  We 
are not trying to obstruct the government.  Probably the members 
over there will fail to understand this because of their 
inability to understand common sense, but we are actually trying 
to help them.  If this deal is rammed through this parliament 
like it was in the legislature in British Columbia, the Liberals 
will put at risk the very future of our children, our 
grandchildren, our whole society, our country, the unity of the 
country and the fiscal accountability of the country.  Everything 
will be at risk unless they reach an agreement between both 
parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are taking this action today of blocking the travel of the 
finance committee.  The Liberals are quite right in that it is a 
move to force them to listen to the people of British Columbia. 
We are absolutely fed up with the fact that Alberta, 
Saskatchewan, Manitoba and British Columbia are continually 
ignored by this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The country has a unity problem. People right across the country 
from coast to coast are asking “What is wrong with Ottawa?  Can 
we not fix it?”  The fact is that they can fix it, and we want 
to help them do that by engaging in a debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an affront to every member of parliament to bring in a 
Nisga'a agreement with a prior condition that not one dot or 
tittle in it can be amended.  That is the condition.  It is all 
or nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We find a number of elements in that agreement to be quite 
offensive to Canadians.  The Liberals are wrong.  We are not 
permitted to amend it.  Therefore we have no choice but to oppose 
it.  The only way we can achieve this is by getting the people 
informed and involved.  Contrary to what the minister said the 
other day, the more people find out about the facts of this 
agreement, the more they will say that it is going in the right 
direction but there are immense problems with it which must be 
fixed or else we are in trouble. 
Of course it is a ploy.  It is a tactic we are using.  The 
Liberals may not like it but it is in direct response to what 
they are doing, not to us.  I have a pretty thick skin and it is 
padded beneath.  I am not worried about that.  I am worried about 
the fact that they are insulting and ignoring the voters and the 
taxpayers of British Columbia.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They can fix this. If they want to do their travel, all we are 
asking is that on an issue as important as this we should also 
have a committee travel, that committee being the committee on 
Indian affairs.  Let it go to British Columbia and hear directly 
from British Columbians what their genuine concerns are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is of great importance.  I do not know how to emphasize it. 
I know I could be dramatic.  I could get on the news tonight if I 
stood on the table and maybe took off my shoe and banged it on 
the desk like Khrushchev did.  However, I will not do that 
because I believe in the dignity of this place and that dignity 
is destroyed when ordinary principles of democracy are so trodden 
on by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that in order to solve the problem we must have both 
committees travelling.  That is all we are asking for. We will 
absolutely not obstruct parliament, but we will not permit them 
to obstruct parliament either.  If they do so, they can expect 
from a responsible official opposition that there will be a 
little bit of a tactic in return.  They ought not to be surprised 
when they have been this blatant in their abuse of the democratic 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of the importance of this, I will move an amendment.  I 
move: 
<A NAME="LINK182">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the motion be amended by deleting the words “be permitted 
in 1999 to—” 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  The motion we are 
debating at this time cannot be amended.  We are on the previous 
question and it cannot be amended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Madam Speaker, I am just trying desperately 
to do something that will force the government to act 
democratically.  I want to do what is right for Canada and 
Canadian citizens.  I want to do what is right for the voters of 
the country.  I want to make sure the country stays together.  I 
want to make sure that the people of British Columbia are heard 
on this matter.  I want to make sure that the natives of our 
country are heard.  I want to make that there is an agreement 
between both parties that is amicable to both sides, instead of 
doing this behind closed doors and making an agreement that is 
partially acceptable to some of the people on one side while some 
40% of natives are saying no to the Nisga'a agreement.  We are 
not being fair to them if we do not make these changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to make sure that the Canadians who are footing the 
bill for this and who have to live with the consequences of this, 
whether they be citizens of British Columbia or citizens anywhere 
in the country, have the right to be heard and that their genuine 
needs will be addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I stand by what I said earlier.  I wish we did not have to do 
this.  I really wish we could say “Sure, let the finance 
committee travel”.  I still would not let it go to London for 
this photo op, but let it travel and listen to Canadians. I would 
not mind that but the photo op thing is absolutely ridiculous. 
It is a waste of taxpayers' money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I certainly want to urge the government to change its mind for 
once and admit that maybe it made a mistake.  Why does it not for 
once exercise a little humility and say that it should go to 
British Columbia to hear the genuine concerns of Canadian 
citizens over there.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Vaughan—King—Aurora, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I rise to participate in the debate because I 
think it is necessary for Canadians to understand that we at the 
committee level actually approved this plan to travel and the 
hon. member who just spoke agreed to travel with the finance 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a couple of points that the member raised in his 
comments which I find quite suspicious.  First, he feels that 
members of parliament ought to go out in their communities and 
seek input during the prebudget consultation period.  That is 
precisely what our committee has been asking for since 1993. 
Members of parliament should go into their communities, report to 
the finance committee and their findings would be incorporated in 
the finance committee report to the Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, I do not understand how the member can say that the 
recommendations made by the finance committee are not acted upon 
by the Minister of Finance.   For the interest of Canadians, I 
want to raise just a few of the recommendations that have been 
adopted by the Minister of Finance and the Government of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These recommendations deal with prudent economic assumptions in 
the formulation of the budget and the issue relating to the 
contingency reserve and how it should not be used to fund either 
program spending or tax cuts.  The committee recommended:  that 
the federal government establish a long term target for 
sustainable debt to GDP ratio; that the temporary 3% surtax be 
completely eliminated; that the basic personal amount be 
increased; that employment insurance premiums be lowered;  that 
the government increase funding to the provinces for health care; 
and that the government increase funding for health research 
because we all understand the importance of that particular 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is interesting is that all of these recommendations came 
from the people of Canada.  They had input in two ways.  They had 
input through the finance committee and also at the community 
level through those members of parliament who cared enough to do 
a prebudget consultation through town hall meetings, 
questionnaires or whatever method they liked to use to consult 
with Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is something I personally take great pride in, it is 
the fact that Canadians' input has been seen in every single 
budget delivered by the Minister of Finance.  When Canadians see 
that the $16.5 billion tax cut has been implemented, they know it 
comes from the input from the various town hall meetings and from 
their presentations to the House of Commons finance committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Canadians see that we understand what it takes to build a 
productive economy and make wise investment in young people and 
education and health care, they know that is their word being 
reflected in the budget.  That has happened every single year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the government inherited the $42 billion deficit and 
Canadians said that we should make eliminating the deficit a 
priority, that is exactly what happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to make these points because I fundamentally believe in 
the consultation process.  I fundamentally believe in the 
consultation process that was started by the government.  It 
speaks to what is the essential fibre of democracy; that 
Canadians are given an opportunity to express themselves clearly, 
to clearly state their points of view and to clearly state 
priorities. 
This essentially is what is being denied to the people of Canada 
who must have an opportunity to express their points of view on a 
very important issue.  The budget is very important and must 
reflect Canadians' priorities but in order to do that we must be 
able to seek their input.

<A HREF="#LINKT34"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The prebudget consultation process, above and beyond the OECD, 
has also been applauded by Canadians from coast to coast to coast 
as an innovative method of seeking public input.  Therefore, the 
Reform Party had better be careful because it is infringing on 
the fundamental rights people have to express themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member who just spoke is a very active member of the 
finance committee and that is why perhaps I am very surprised by 
his attitude.  The members opposite had better think twice about 
doing what they are doing because Canadians recognize how 
effective the prebudget consultation process has been and how 
effective their voices have been in making sure the government 
acts on those priorities which are essential to building a better 
life, a stronger economy and a more just society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question for the member is quite simple:  Why the flip flop? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Madam Speaker, since the member used seven 
minutes of the ten, I assume I will have seven minutes to 
respond. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member has misinterpreted my motivation here.  He seems to 
be implying that I do not want to listen to the people.  That is 
false.  The accusation he is making is factually incorrect.  I do 
not only want to hear from special interest groups, I also want 
to hear from ordinary Canadians.  That is why I said what I said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member indicated that members of parliament are invited to 
go to their ridings and have consultation meetings.  I take my 
job very seriously and, Madam Speaker, I do not know if you have 
noticed, but when the House is in session I am essentially always 
here, pretty well 99.9% of the time.  It is very seldom that I 
allow functions in my riding to take precedence over my job here 
because I am here to represent them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the weekends and on the weeks out, I go back to my riding to 
listen to the people.  What did the government do when it 
prorogued the House?  It chose the week that we were scheduled to 
be out where we would have normally scheduled our town hall 
meetings.  We did not have enough time to schedule, advertise and 
book them before those two weeks of break.  The week we would 
have had in order to give advance notice was taken away from us 
by the opening of the House and the throne speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has the finance committee done about November 11? That is a 
so-called week out, when members of parliament go back to their 
ridings to listen to the concerns of their people. It has 
scheduled a finance committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member for Elk Island, I am a faithful member of the 
finance committee.  When it is sitting and listening to witnesses 
I am there every minute of the time.  When those people are there 
because they have taken the time to prepare a presentation, I 
will be there to hear them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has the finance committee done?  It has taken me out of my 
riding during that week and scheduled meetings in Toronto, just 
totally ignoring the fact that for those of us in the west, 
travel time is necessary.  We have duties in our ridings on 
November 11 for Remembrance Day.  The member just says “That 
does not matter, we can get back to our riding in one hour, let 
us not worry about the west”.  That is the whole point. He also 
said that Canadians should be heard on an issue as important as 
the budget, and I agree.  However, there is another important 
issue, the issue British Columbians have with the Nisga'a deal? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will reflect his words right back.  He said “they had better 
be very careful”.  I am telling them that they had better be 
very careful because if they do not listen to British Columbians 
they will be in much worse trouble than if we do not go around 
with our prebudget hearings.  I have a very simple conclusion.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I want the budget to be representative of what the people want. 
I want the finance committee to travel, but I want the Indian 
affairs committee to travel too.  If they deny that, what else 
can we do?  They have pushed us into a corner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do I not have seven minutes, Madam Speaker?  I wish in the 
future that you would stop those members halfway, because I think 
we should have at least as much time as they have to make their 
points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  With the flow of the debate back and forth and the very 
long question that was asked, I know there were a number of 
points my colleague did not have a chance to deal with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if we could seek consent of the House to have the time 
extended another four minutes so my colleague could answer those 
questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Is there consent of 
the House to extend the question period? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No. 
<P><A NAME="LINK184"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I want to split a few minutes with my colleague from 
Kamloops to say a few words in support of the motion before the 
House today which states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the question be now put. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think we need a lengthy debate on whether or not we put 
a question allowing for a vote on whether the finance committee 
should travel to hear from the Canadian people.  I think we 
should do that as soon as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said before that I sympathize with some things the Reform 
Party is saying in terms of proper hearings on the Nisga'a 
agreement and treaties across the country; perhaps not just B.C. 
but other places as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sympathize, having been here many years and as I have said 
many times myself, that time allocation is now used too often. 
Actually if we want to get historical about it, the current 
government House leader used to get up in row three over here and 
complain about the Mulroney government using time allocation time 
and time again.  He did it with great eloquence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even the member from Pembroke is hanging his head in shame. Look 
at him back there.  The cameras could not record that he was 
standing on chair.  I hope his feet were clean when he did that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government House leader often used to say that when they 
were in government some day they would not do the same thing and 
would allow free and full debates, with all eloquence and so on. 
However the Liberals do not necessarily do the same thing in 
government as they do in opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also appeal to the Reform Party that despite the fact there 
should be a full debate on any issue in the House or in the 
committees, I do not think it should hold people involved in 
issues in other parts of the country hostage for its particular 
issue.  This is really what is happening by denying the finance 
committee the right to travel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will use the example of Saskatchewan.  We all know about the 
farm crisis and the two premiers who came here.  Farm incomes are 
now at the lowest level since the 1930s.  The wheat board just 
announced yesterday that the price would drop another 4% or 5% in 
terms of the forecast for this crop year.  That is a serious 
issue.  I think we all agree with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we do not pass the motion before the House the finance 
committee will not go to Regina.  It will not allow Mr. Larson, 
president of the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool, different farm 
organizations, different individuals, the chambers of commerce, 
the cities of Regina and Saskatoon or other prairie people, a 
chance to address the finance committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is like a fight in a schoolyard.  The Reform Party is saying 
that it is not getting its way, so it will punch other people 
back and not let them get their way as well.  At least Reform 
Party members are being honest that they are using one of the few 
tools they have, but they are denying the rights and privileges 
of other Canadians because they feel their rights and privileges 
on a certain issue are not being met. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think that is the way to achieve justice: “If I do not 
get my way then by damn you are not getting your way either”.  I 
do not think that is the way we should operate.  There are ways 
of making a point; there are ways of advocating a position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have seen opposition parties over the years stop a majority 
government dead in its tracks.  I remember in 1985 the Mulroney 
government tried to partially deindex old age pensions.  Within a 
week or two, despite the fact that it had the biggest majority in 
the history of the country at that time, riding at over 50% in 
the polls, between the pensioners and the opposition parties the 
government was forced to withdraw the proposal to partially 
deindex old age pensions.  There are ways of doing it, but it is 
not done by denying the rights of other people, and this is what 
will happen today.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As an aside, is the Reform Party saying that the democratically 
elected members that form the House of Commons Standing Committee 
on Finance cannot travel to hear the opinions of people?  What 
does it want to do?  Does it want to send the Senate banking 
committee around the country to hear people's opinions, that 
undemocratic, unaccountable, unelected chamber?  Is that what it 
wants to do? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should stop playing games.  We should vote on the motion as 
soon as possible to make sure that the finance committee can 
travel around the country to hear the views of the people on the 
fishery, the farm crisis, health care problems, or the problems 
of the homeless.  There are many problems.  The Reform cannot 
hold us hostage because it is unhappy with one particular issue. 
If we all start doing that this place will collapse in shear 
chaos. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appeal to the Reform Party to come to its senses.  The Reform 
Party used to talk about the grassroots.  It wanted to hear from 
the grassroots.  It wanted to hear from ordinary people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where are these members now?  Where is the member from Nanaimo. 
I am sure he is embarrassed by his party's position that would 
deny ordinary people to speak about the farm crisis.  That is 
exactly what he is doing by not allowing the finance committee to 
travel around the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  The member from Saskatoon just made reference to the 
member from Nanaimo.  There are two of us so he may not have 
possibly been talking to me, but since I am in present in the 
House I ought to take the opportunity to clarify that I indeed 
support my party's principles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I am afraid we are 
getting into debate. 
<P><A NAME="LINK185"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, there are a lot of financial implications in the Nisga'a 
treaty.  The federal official opposition represents 24 of the 34 
seats in British Columbia.  The provincial government put the 
Nisga'a agreement we are talking about through the provincial 
legislature using closure.  There is a clause in the agreement 
that hobbles the official opposition federally and provincially. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Both the Liberal official opposition provincially and the Reform 
Party official opposition federally have some difficulties with 
the Nisga'a agreement.  That is clear to everyone.  There is a 
clause in the agreement whereby no party to the agreement may 
challenge it once it is ratified.  That is a very important 
clause because it completely hobbles the governments in waiting 
once they become government.  Simply, many of those issues have 
not been addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot comprehend why the member for Regina—Qu'Appelle would 
suggest we should roll over and allow the government to ram that 
agreement through this place without proper debate and without 
hearing from the people in British Columbia who very much want 
that opportunity but have been denied it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  Madam Speaker, I do not know if the 
Reform Party member was in the House when I started to speak.  I 
am not saying that at all.  I started by saying that there should 
be a full debate and that the committee should travel and should 
hear from people.  That is exactly what I am saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also saying that I do not want the Reform Party to hold the 
people of Saskatchewan hostage and deny the finance committee the 
right to travel to Saskatchewan, or anywhere else in the country, 
to hear about the important issues that are facing farmers, 
fishermen or people concerned about the health care system and so 
on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reformers are a bit mistaken.  We are not saying that there 
should not be a full and fair debate.  We are not saying that 
they should not have an opportunity to express themselves.  There 
have been many times when opposition parties have had a great 
deal of impact on government policy and have forced governments 
to back down.  They have the opportunity in terms of the Nisga'a 
debate to express themselves, to mobilize public opinion and to 
make their point of view known.  We have not said that there 
should not be a committee travelling on the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This debate is about whether or not the finance committee should 
travel across the country to hear from the ordinary citizens of 
Canada.  We believe it should.  We believe the Reform Party is 
wrong in trying to stop the finance committee from hearing from 
the good people of Saskatchewan and the people from other parts 
of the country on issues that concern them.  We do not want the 
Reform Party to hold the people of the country hostage because of 
its concern over one issue.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, 
NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, this is probably one of the saddest days 
in terms of our parliamentary system and the state of democracy 
in our country.  If we listened carefully we could actually hear 
jackboots slamming around this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will set aside the government for the moment.  I want to talk 
to my friends in the Reform Party and beg them to come to their 
parliamentary and democratic senses this afternoon.  I know my 
friend has spent a lot of time as a schoolteacher.  He has seen 
many kids who get angry because they do not get their way.  They 
say “I am going to pick up my marbles and go home.  I am not 
going to play”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reformers are saying that because they do not like what the 
government is doing in terms of its willingness to take a 
committee out to British Columbia.  They will shut down the 
democratic process in this place for the finance committee and 
perhaps all others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are people who say they believe in the democratic process. 
They believe in grassroots democracy.  They believe in a 
situation where British Columbians and other Canadians should 
have a fair shot at policy and legislation that are being 
developed.  They are thwarting or stopping the finance committee 
from travelling across the country and hearing men and women from 
one coast to another.  That is what the Reform Party is doing. My 
friends in the Reform Party astonish me because it goes against 
everything I have ever heard every one of them speak about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be fair.  When Reformers say they believe in grassroots 
democracy we laud them.  Of course it is what we all want to see. 
I have been on the finance committee for many years.  The best 
times I have spent as a parliamentarian is when we go to St. 
John's, Newfoundland, Halifax, Saint John, Fredericton, Regina, 
Saskatoon, Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver and Victoria to listen to 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the government always follow their advice?  I would say it 
does not always but it listens to Canadians.  Canadians have a 
chance to make their views known.  People from my community in 
Kamloops venture down to talk and express their views.  They want 
to see some action on one front and some changes on another. They 
want the government to acknowledge these problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues in the Reform Party, for some stupid, idiotic and 
undemocratic reason today are saying that because they are mad at 
the government they will not let the finance committee travel. 
That is a travesty of democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Let's go to Kamloops. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  The hon. member can yell.  He makes a 
big threat that he will go to Kamloops.  If we listen carefully 
we can hear jackboots pounding in this place, and they are being 
worn by the members of the Reform Party today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  The phones are already ringing from B.C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  The phones are ringing from British 
Columbia because the Reform Party is refusing permission to 
travel to British Columbia to hear input on the finance 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I know my NDP colleague is excited about this topic.  He 
is demonstrating that and I think he is verging on using 
unparliamentary language when he makes those comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I am sure that the 
hon. member will carry on with his speech in a very reasonable 
manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  A very reasonable manner, Madam Speaker.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a dark day in this House for a number of reasons.  I will 
set aside the concerns with the government and the others dealing 
with the Nisga'a treaty.  I am referring to my friends in the 
Reform Party, and I use that term advisedly.  They are my friends 
and they are going against everything I have ever understood 
Reform members to espouse in this House, and that is the ability 
of Canadians to have access to the levers of power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the Reform Party are refusing the finance committee 
to travel to British Columbia. They will refuse permission to 
travel to any part of this country and I suspect we are talking 
about agriculture, forestry, mining and foreign affairs.  In 
other words, it will shut down the ability of members of 
parliament to get out of this bloody place and into other parts 
of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  It is not a bloody place.  It is an 
honourable place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  Madam Speaker, I know Reformers love 
this place because they do not want to leave.  They do not want 
to go out to talk to the people in Saskatchewan, Manitoba, 
Alberta or British Columbia.  In terms of how they are behaving, 
I would not want to travel out there either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think I have made my point.  Members of the Reform Party 
should stop acting like a bunch of children, like immature 
children.  That is a negative comment against children, because 
if most children do not get their way, they do not pick up their 
marbles and run away.  The members of the Reform Party should 
grow up and start acting like decent parliamentarians and allow 
this place to function as it is intended to function. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Madam Speaker, there is 
nothing I can say. 
<P><A NAME="LINK187"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I think the member for Elk Island has summed it up. 
There is nothing more he can say and it is such a shameful thing 
for the Reform Party to try to warp basic democracy and the 
grassroots especially. I agree there is nothing more he should 
say.  No wonder he hangs his head in shame in this House of 
Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember when the Leader of the Opposition went around here 
saying that we should consult people more often, that we should 
listen to the people more often and have more input from the 
so-called grassroots. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People should be aware that the motion before the House is to 
allow the finance committee to go around the country to hear from 
Canadians.  The Reform Party is saying no.  It is saying no to 
people in my riding who are suffering from the worst farm crisis 
since 1933 and 1935.  It is saying no to those people having a 
say to the finance committee which is made up of all five parties 
in this House of Commons.  People should note that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is one thing to pick a fight with the Government of Canada, 
but it is another thing to hold other people hostage because of 
an ideological point of view.  That is what is happening here in 
the House of Commons today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to know whether or not the member for Kamloops agrees 
with those statements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  Madam Speaker, not only do I agree with 
the statements, but I want to take it a little bit further. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People from all parts of Canada want to have input into how the 
next budget will look.  There is a surplus between $15 billion 
and $20 billion. The people of Canada want to have a say in how 
that money is to be allocated.  They want to go beyond what we 
say in the House.  They want to have input.  Students, farmers, 
small business representatives, women's groups and environmental 
groups all want to have a chance to say in their estimation how 
this surplus should be invested for future generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have never spoken like this in the House.  I have never felt 
like this. My friends in the Reform Party are saying to the 
people of Canada “We are going to do whatever we can so that you 
cannot tell the finance committee how to invest your tax dollars. 
We will not even allow a hearing to be held in Kamloops, 
Vancouver or Victoria”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  When is the last time a hearing was held 
in Kamloops? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  Madam Speaker, Reform members joke about 
it.  They are laughing.  This is not a laughing matter. I take 
offence when people laugh at me. I am saying that I want the 
people of Canada to be heard in this budget process. They should 
not be laughing at a member of parliament for advocating such a 
thing. I am ashamed of them all.

Speaker, I would like to split my time with the member for 
Dewdney—Alouette. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals have been revising history on the Nisga'a agreement 
since 1994.  Now they are revising history in terms of what is 
going on with this committee travel business from as recently as 
yesterday and the day before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion we are debating is on the finance committee 
travelling across the country.  It is an all-party committee. 
Committee travel is not a one-way street.  The government wants 
everything its own way.  The official opposition has some needs 
and wants as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition obviously would like to travel, in 
particular to British Columbia.  The Nisga'a agreement happens 
once.  The budget happens every year. British Columbians have 
never had a say on the Nisga'a agreement.  They have never had 
undiluted access to consultation on the Nisga'a agreement.  Those 
are things we are asking for.  We think they are pretty 
important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are major financial implications to the Nisga'a agreement. 
It is just as important in many respects.  This week the public 
accounts revealed that there is a $200 billion liability put 
forward so far on aboriginal claims.  The cost to the province of 
British Columbia, never mind on the federal side, is in the order 
of at least $10 billion.  There are much higher estimates.  If 
anything this is a conservative estimate.  Everyone admits it is 
only a partial estimate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I spoke on the Nisga'a bill on Wednesday, the time had 
expired which determined whether I had time to speak for 20 
minutes or 10 minutes.  I asked the indulgence of the House to 
extend my time from 10 minutes to 20 minutes.  The government 
once again denied me and the official opposition the ability to 
say the things we needed to say on that agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a clause that not many people have recognized in the 
Nisga'a agreement which binds the parties, British Columbia, 
Canada and the Nisga'a, to all of the provisions of the agreement 
and requires consent of all three parties for any change.  In 
other words, none of the parties to the agreement may challenge 
the agreement, which is a veto. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This hobbles what is currently the official opposition 
federally, and the official opposition provincially, the Liberals 
in British Columbia.  There has been no opportunity for a 
referendum in the province on the Nisga'a. The public in British 
Columbia have basically been told to take a hike by the federal 
Liberals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been talking about the Nisga'a deal since 1995. I did a 
complete analysis.  The 1998 final agreement is a very 
comprehensive document as we all know.  It is 252 pages long with 
an appendix of 462 pages.  Despite all of that, more than 50 
areas have yet to be negotiated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a firm believer that the public has been manipulated.  The 
facts have been manipulated.  There has been misrepresentation 
that is not in the public interest by both senior levels of 
government.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government is imposing a deal in British Columbia 
that it would not impose on itself. There is a track record and a 
history of federal negotiations completed in the Yukon and in the 
territories.  Unlike the Nisga'a deal, self-government is not 
constitutionally entrenched in the northern agreements. The tax 
exemption for aboriginals enabled by section 87 of the Indian Act 
was deleted in the Yukon without new tax exemptions being 
created. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a memorandum of understanding on land claims in British 
Columbia.  The province has been co-opted by the federal 
government.  A federal responsibility is being off-loaded on the 
province to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars.  That is 
something that many people in British Columbia recognize and they 
want an opportunity to get at the federal government in terms of 
telling it how that is all happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The public was not consulted prior to the signing of the Nisga'a 
agreement in principle on February 16, 1996 in any meaningful 
way.  After the initialling the forestry representative and 
member of the treaty negotiation advisory committee said this 
publicly: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can't say we worked on this document, because we never saw it 
until February 15, just hours before it was initialled.  Not one 
page, not one paragraph of this 150 page document was shared with 
TNAC, the government's Treaty Negotiation Advisory Committee, or 
any of the local advisory committees, or any of the people with 
legal interests in the crown land that this agreement would give 
to the Nisga'a. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what the forestry representative said.  If the very 
people who were paid to know the contents of the negotiations 
were kept in the dark, where was the average British Columbian? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not easy to be a critic of the federal native agenda.  In 
1996 for example I was threatened with court action for saying 
that it was a conflict of interest for a provincial land claims 
negotiator to be lobbying the provincial cabinet on behalf of the 
Squamish band regarding their Lion's Gate Bridge proposal. One 
can make an excellent living if one is willing to swallow the 
federal native agenda, and I am talking about lawyers, 
consultants, negotiators, contract services and the academic 
community.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  The hon. member for 
Vancouver Island North on a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan:</B>  Madam Speaker, when I moved the motion I 
was in debate.  I had not completed my time on debate.  There 
have been no questions and comments.  As well, when I was 
speaking I asked to split my time with the member for 
Dewdney—Alouette.  None of that has occurred yet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Madam Speaker, I am sure that all 
members of the House will know that when what just occurred takes 
place, the time that the member had, whether for himself or to 
split with another person, does not change anything.  Once the 
motion is disposed of that particular time slot is disposed of as 
well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then I believe we would recognize the next speaker and that 
would be an hon. member from this side of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise further to this 
point of order.  I think what is at issue here is whether or not 
a divided speech is in fact one speech or two separate ones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a well established practice that these two speeches are 
two distinct speeches— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:  </B>No, they are not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally:</B>  Yes, they are.  It happened earlier 
today.  The second speaker can move an amendment.  It is done all 
the time.  It was done on a motion before us today and it is done 
on most supply day motions as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Gouk:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise further to the points 
of order that have already been raised.  I believe that if 
splitting time meant two members making a single speech, they 
would continue unbroken and then questions and comments would be 
delivered to either one of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House recognizes one speaker and then breaks up even the 
question and answer period, not to an unlimited amount of time 
but to a specific half, and then goes to the next hon. member. 
That is prima facie proof that the Chair recognizes each as 
separate and distinct speakers.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Is it the same point 
of order? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill:</B>  Yes, Madam Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I have already given

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Are you talking about 
more information? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill:</B>  Yes, Madam Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I recognize the hon. 
member for Prince George—Peace River, but make it pertinent, 
please. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill:</B>  Madam Speaker, earlier today I raised a 
point of order because according to Standing Order 74(2), 
ironically enough the same standing order you 
just read, the whip of the party has to be present at which time 
members are given the right to divide their time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speaker ruled that standard convention was that this be 
allowed to happen regardless of the fact that it goes contrary to 
the standing orders, which clearly state that the whip must be 
present.  The Speaker ruled at the time that standing convention 
was that the speech was divided into two, and that was accepted 
practice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I contend that the accepted practice of the House is that they 
are two distinct speeches, as outlined by my colleagues.  If it 
is standard practice— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I have already ruled 
on that point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard M. Harris:</B>  Madam Speaker, I have a different 
point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  If it is a different 
point of order I will recognize the member for Prince 
George—Bulkley Valley. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard M. Harris:</B>  Madam Speaker, I move, seconded 
by the member for Prince George—Peace River, that the member— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Since I have not 
recognized anybody on debate at this point, the motion is 
premature.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday, either a point of order or a point of privilege was 
raised with regard to a comment that was made.  Albeit 
innocently, it was interpreted, because of racial background, 
that it was a racial slur.  That was dealt with in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, I heard a comment directed at the Reform Party members 
present, of which I was one.  In my hereditary background is 
German ancestry.  In the speech today by the hon. member for 
Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, there was a definite 
reference made to the members of the Reform Party, myself 
included, using the term jackboot.  That is a very specific and 
derogatory term used during World War II toward people of German 
descent.

saying anything.  The government House leader stands up ranting 
and raving about procedures and standing orders and whatnot. It 
is unbelievable he would do that. We are following the standing 
orders and the procedures.  He put a motion forward on this whole 
topic which is clearly in the standing orders.  That is the 
procedure we are following here today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He talked about the finance committee travelling and how 
important that is.  Members of the NDP said the same thing.  We 
know it is important, but we also know that it is mainly an 
exercise for the Minister of Finance to have a photo opportunity. 
I guess the member for Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys 
is also in the photo-op. Perhaps that is why he was so upset 
earlier today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is obvious what is happening here today.  There has been some 
procedural wrangling about this, that and the other thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition wants the aboriginal affairs committee 
to travel to British Columbia.  We want the standing committee to 
go to British Columbia.  Sure, we want the finance committee to 
have hearings as well. But fundamental to this— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  I hesitate 
to interrupt my friend's presentation, but he mentioned Indian 
affairs which would deal with this legislation and it has not 
even got the legislation yet.  The committee will decide whether 
it wants to travel or not.  It is still at second reading stage. 
It is not even before the committee, so how can we pre-judge what 
the committee will do in the future? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  That is debate, not a 
point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally:</B>  Madam Speaker, I guess the hon. member 
did not get enough air time earlier, so he is doing a little 
venting right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point is that members of the official opposition are 
fulfilling their duty as members of the opposition to hold the 
government accountable.  We will stand in this place today.  We 
will stand in this place tomorrow. 
We will stand wherever we need to stand to hold members of the 
government accountable.  It is very clear that they do not want 
to travel to British Columbia.  They do not want the aboriginal 
affairs committee to go there to hear the people of British 
Columbia on Nisga'a.  They do not want to do that.  It is those 
people over there in the Government of Canada, the Liberal Party 
of Canada.
