</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Wood (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Veterans 
Affairs, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am delighted to be here 
today to speak to the improvements to veterans' legislation which 
are contained in Bill C-61. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because we will be debating the specifics in committee in the 
days to come, today I would like to focus my comments on the 
general reasoning behind the bill and, in so doing, show that 
these amendments are in keeping with our longstanding tradition 
of providing the best service possible to Canada's veterans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A bit of background is in order.  To understand the history of 
our country we need only to know the sacrifices of those who 
served in peacetime and in war throughout this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the very early days of our nationhood, Canadians served 
their country with distinction, often in places far from home, 
and veterans' benefits were few and far between.  The first world 
war changed all that.  We lost 66,000 of our young, which was 
catastrophic for a nation of just eight million.  The utter 
devastation on the lives of those who survived that terrible 
carnage demanded action on the home front.  Military hospitals, 
vocational training, re-establishment and job placement were the 
orders of the day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another 45,000 Canadians were lost in the second world war and, 
with the anticipated return of one million service men and women, 
the government at the time recognized that a single department 
devoted exclusively to veterans was needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1944 the Department of Veterans Affairs was born.  In the 
early years it was the repairing of broken bodies and shattered 
spirits that took precedence, putting interrupted lives back on 
track and bringing them back to the country where these heroic 
men and women longed to be.  For all those suffering permanent 
injury, disability pensions were guaranteed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further, for the first time these pensions were given to members 
of the women's auxiliary forces, the merchant seamen, commercial 
fishermen, Canadian overseas firefighters and other civilian 
groups which contributed to winning the war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When body and soul were patched up as well as possible, it then 
became a matter of making sure these valued citizens got a chance 
to live the Canadian dream.  For some it was assisting in the 
buying of a small piece of property and for others it was 
education and training. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have come a long way since the veterans' charter that 
codified these programs for veterans, from rehabilitation to 
re-establishment, from land settlement to home construction, from 
pensions to allowances and beyond.  Canada provided then and 
provides now a package of benefits that rivals any in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Department of Veterans Affairs remains committed to 
providing the very best care and comfort to veterans whose 
average age is now moving from the old to the very old.  The 
mandate continues to be quite simple:  to take care of those who 
took care of us; to take care of those who answered this 
country's call in a time of desperate need.  Although our 
commitment to veterans has never wavered, the ways in which we 
meet that commitment as we approach the millennium have changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In all that we do we try to look at our programs from a 
veteran's perspective and ask the question:  What do they want 
and need at this stage of their lives?  We have talked to 
veterans and veterans organizations and they have responded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They want to see a continuation of current programs, those with 
which they have become familiar and often which they have come to 
count on.  So we continue to provide war service allowances to 
those whose life circumstances have left them at the lower end of 
the income scale as they live out their senior years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We continue to provide an innovative veterans' independence 
program which allows veterans to remain in their homes as long as 
possible.  VIP provides a cross-section of services to ease some 
of the heavier burdens associated with living and taking care of 
a home.  With Meals on Wheels, housekeeping, grounds maintenance, 
transportation and personal care, our at-home vets are able to 
enjoy the comfort and dignity of independent living. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We continue to provide disability pensions and as a result of 
new technology and internal improvements, and a lot of hard work 
by a team of very dedicated staff, we have reduced the processing 
time for pension applications by more than 50%.

<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the way, applications for disability pensions are not limited 
to wartime veterans.  Regular force members are also eligible and 
their numbers are up, which is not surprising given Canada's 
significant contribution to keeping peace around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Disability pensions for the forces now make up almost 50% of new 
applications in some of our district offices.  Of course we 
continue to provide for eligible veterans a broad spectrum of 
other services, including comprehensive health care, targeting 
the needs that the frailties of old age bring to us all.  These 
include the provision of prescription drugs, dental care and 
access to long term care community beds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Veterans want to be treated with kindness, dignity and respect, 
as we all do.  To this end, we work very hard to be sure that we 
become their path of least resistance, not only when it comes to 
getting information about our programs but, if need be, about 
other government programs as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our front line staff make sure that from the minute veterans 
walk in the door, whatever the problem or question may be, from 
veterans' benefits to income tax forms, from CPP to old age 
security problems, we steer them in the right direction from the 
start, and that is exactly how it should be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the millennium the average age of our remaining war service 
clients will approach the 80 year mark.  Their medical needs are 
changing.  Frankly, this is unchartered territory.  We are 
entering an era of health care never before known to governments, 
taking on the needs of a substantial and very elderly population. 
It is in this context of change that we are constantly examining 
our legislation to make sure it keeps up with the times and 
continues to be fair, timely and responsive, all of which brings 
me to the bill before us today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Its measures are consistent with our past practices and look to 
the future needs of our treasured veterans and their dependants. 
This is an omnibus bill, covering a cross-section of current 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me turn first to the prisoner of war recommendations.  As 
hon. members know, many of our veterans receive disability 
pensions arising from an illness or injury they incurred as a 
result of their service in peacetime or wartime, and if their 
disability is sufficiently serious or disabling they may be 
eligible for special benefits such as an attendance allowance 
that assists those veterans in need of day to day personal care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly, exceptional incapacity allowances are awarded to 
pensioners who are extremely incapacitated by their disabilities. 
The dollar amount is based on the extent of the helplessness, 
pain and loss of enjoyment of life and the shortened life 
expectancy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the present time veterans who receive prisoner of war 
compensation are not entitled to receive these special allowances 
unless they are also in receipt of a disability pension.  The 
amendments to this bill will remove this bar.  Former prisoners 
of war will now be allowed to receive the special allowances if 
they meet the eligibility criteria.  These provisions recognize 
the very particular needs of POWs, all of whom suffered greatly 
by their incarceration, some for periods lasting throughout the 
war years.  In passing these changes the House will respond 
positively to a key priority of the National Council of Veterans 
Associations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another major provision of this legislation will result in more 
Canadian survivors, more often than not widows of veterans, 
becoming eligible for increases in their pension payments.  This 
change will potentially affect over 35,000 survivors where the 
disabilities had been assessed at less than 48%.  The Pension Act 
will be amended to permit an application for increased pensions 
for these survivors if they believe that their spouse's 
disability should have been assessed at a higher level at the 
time of their passing.  In passing these changes the House will 
respond positively to the number one veteran's priority of the 
Royal Canadian Legion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-61 also brings merchant navy veterans under the very same 
legislation that applies to armed forces veterans, namely the 
Pension Act and the War Veterans Allowance Act. 
This is by its nature largely a symbolic change.  I say this 
because merchant navy veterans have been receiving identical 
benefits to their armed forces counterparts since 1992.  Symbols 
are important and this change of status is one that this group of 
veterans has been requesting for quite some time.

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>By using the same acts to respond to the needs of both merchant 
navy and armed forces veterans we send a powerful signal that we 
value the service and sacrifice performed by the merchant navy 
during the wars.  There are other actions which have been taken 
in recent years to underscore the value placed on the 
contributions made by merchant navy veterans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993 merchant navy veterans joined armed forces veterans in a 
pilgrimage to Liverpool to commemorate the battle of the 
Atlantic.  They also accompanied the delegation that went to the 
pilgrimage last year to commemorate the battle and have 
participated in pilgrimages marking the 50th and 55th 
anniversaries of the second world war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Merchant mariners are also recognized in other veterans affairs 
commemorative initiatives, including a teacher's kit, a CD-ROM on 
the second world war and a recently released publication entitled 
“Valour at Sea”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps among the most significant symbolic gesture was the 
instalment in 1994 of the merchant navy book of remembrance in 
the memorial chamber.  It lists the names of Canadian merchant 
mariners who gave their lives during the first and second world 
wars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to assure members that merchant navy veterans are 
veterans in every sense of the word and this bill underscores 
that fact.  There are other provisions in Bill C-61 dealing with 
allied veterans residing outside Canada, changes to the 
administration of the funeral and burial program, continuing 
assistance to certain survivors of the Halifax explosion of 1917, 
and amendments to the Veterans Review and Appeal Board Act. 
Although important in the scheme of things, they are perhaps 
better left to committee debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have always felt that of all our citizens who made 
sacrifices for their country, it was those who defended our 
freedom in war we should honour above all others. Of those 
veterans who returned from the two world wars and Korea, over 
400,000 are still with us today.  A good number of them receive 
benefits in one form or another from veterans affairs. Over the 
years we have been called upon to implement a substantial body of 
legislation designed to meet their changing needs.  One of our 
strengths has been our ability to anticipate challenges and as a 
result our programs in Canada have been ahead of the times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So today we are called on once again to make changes to meet 
these challenges.  It is to the credit of successive governments 
and parliaments that whatever their political make-up they have 
continued in the tradition of providing Canadian veterans with 
benefits that remain second to none.  Let us continue in that 
tradition by giving this legislation speedy consideration and 
passage. 
<P><A NAME="LINK6"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I am pleased to rise today to speak to Bill C-61, an act to amend 
the War Veterans Allowance Act and related legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an omnibus bill that, when coupled with separate 
assumed undertakings by the government to right past wrongs, caused 
elderly merchant navy veterans to end their hunger strike on the 
steps of Parliament Hill last fall. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As with much omnibus legislation, there are several separate 
legislative initiatives, so that voting against the legislation 
means that one could be seen to be voting against certain 
provisions that actually improve matters for veterans, including 
merchant navy veterans.  In the alternative, one could vote 
against the legislation based on what is not included in it. 
There is much in this legislation that does little to improve the 
the circumstances of merchant navy veterans in terms of their 
well known grievances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Voting against legislation based on what is not there is not 
particularly constructive in my view.  Voting against legislation 
because all the provisions are not as one might wish is also not 
particularly constructive.  On the other hand, the parliamentary 
practice of introducing omnibus legislation is not a particularly 
fair or honest way of addressing primary grievances.

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want the record to show that while I favour specifics of the 
bill I do not believe that its format allows for a debate on this 
substantial issue at hand, that of compensation to our merchant 
navy veterans for past government wrongs, for past avoidance of 
responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To correct this I will propose at committee that a special 
subcommittee be formed to examine compensation claims for years 
of denial of equality from the war to this date.  I am expecting 
our government's wholehearted co-operation and participation in 
this special subcommittee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this bill there are two provisions that should meet with 
general approval in the House.  Both relate to the lifetime 
effects of war, effects along with memories that are rarely 
erased.  By way of amendment to the Pension Act former prisoners 
of war may now apply for special allowances even though they are 
not in receipt of a disability pension.  An allowance of this 
nature could be used to provide for an attendant.  This amendment 
would be welcomed in such cases where a prisoner of war never 
claimed a disability pension but now finds there is need for 
assistance.  By this amendment there appears to be a general 
recognition that experiences as a prisoner of war will always 
have an effect on the enjoyment of later life even if no specific 
disability can be traced to the prisoner of war experiences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In similar fashion spouses of deceased veterans classified as 
partially disabled at the time of death will now be able to seek 
a re-evaluation of the disability status of the departed veteran 
in order to receive increased survivor benefits.  By this 
amendment it is recognized that any war related disability may 
become progressively more incapacitating even though the veteran 
chooses not to inform veterans affairs as to his deteriorated 
state. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Veterans have demonstrated time and time again that they are 
proud people, proud of their service to the country and proud of 
their independence.  Veterans do not readily stand in the queue 
for a government cheque.  By this amendment it is recognized that 
such independence of the veteran, while admirable, should not 
result in financial prejudice to a veteran's spouse whose 
post-war life was also affected by war related disabilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, a veteran may have suffered permanent hearing loss 
as a result of bombing missions over Europe.  The veteran was 
assessed as partially disabled.  However, his balance became 
progressively worse due to the effects of diminished hearing.  At 
some point the veteran ceased to work due to difficulties with 
walking and balance.  What this amendment does is recognize that 
once again a war related injury may have lasting and 
progressively more serious effects on the well-being of any 
veteran.  The effects of war are again recognized as lifelong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many arguments have been made to deny merchant navy veterans the 
benefits they have claimed.  I will canvass the principal claims. 
It has not been easy to obtain agreement as to these four points 
given the various factions within the merchant navy veterans 
organizations, although I did succeed in obtaining agreements 
from all parties.  There are four main demands of all groups 
representing the various factions: to be recognized as war 
veterans, to receive prisoner of war benefits, to receive 
compensation for years of denial of equality, and to receive 
recognition on ceremonial days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-61 addresses recognition of war veterans status. 
Merchant navy veterans are war veterans for all purposes and in 
all respects. Therefore formal recognition of merchant navy 
veterans on ceremonial days, in particular on Remembrance Day, 
should now occur as a matter of course.  Equivalency of prisoner 
of war benefits is also implicitly addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The key issues not addressed in Bill C-61 is compensation to our 
merchant navy veterans for years of denial of equality.  As with 
prisoner of war benefits, general benefits available to all 
veterans have been available to merchant navy veterans since 
legislative amendments in 1992.  The fact that they may or may 
not be treated equally now is not the issue.  The issue not 
addressed in this legislation and also not addressed in the 1992 
legislation is retroactive compensation, to acknowledge that 
merchant navy veterans despite their crucial and valorous service 
in war were not placed on the same benefit footing as other 
returning veterans after the war.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>An inequality of post-war opportunity leads to an inequality of 
post-war outcomes.  In short, the post-war lives of our merchant 
navy veterans were short changed by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The valour and sacrifice of our merchant navy veterans are well 
known.  They faced death more than any other Canadian fighting 
force with one in seven merchant mariners being killed in World 
War II.  This horrendous statistic is evidenced by the fact that, 
until corrected recently by veterans affairs, the commonly held 
wisdom was that the death rate was one in eight, which is equally 
horrendous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of our Canadian merchant navy were vital suppliers to 
the war effort.  It is true that merchant mariners were not 
subject to the same military discipline as those in the armed 
forces.  It is also true they were paid marginally more than 
those in the armed forces.  However, their service to Canada's 
war effort was very different from those who contributed to the 
war effort in factories and offices but who did not face death 
daily. Their service to Canada's war effort was also very 
different from those currently in receipt of veterans pensions 
who were members of the armed forces but who never went overseas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason we view members of the merchant navy as war veterans 
is that the nature and dangers of their service were clearly no 
different from anyone else on the front lines.  Given the paltry 
difference in salary between those in the armed forces and those 
in the merchant navy, it cannot be said that merchant navy 
veterans risked their lives for the money.  Like others actively 
serving in the war, they risked their lives for their country and 
to preserve its freedoms.  At minimum, they could be viewed as 
resistance fighters for Canada and certainly should be treated no 
differently from allied resistance fighters in other countries 
who our political leaders have been so quick to compensate with 
Canadian taxpayer resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Compensating our merchant navy veterans for years of wrongful 
denial of equality is both a symbolic and tangible means by which 
we can thank fellow Canadians for their efforts in preserving the 
freedoms we enjoy today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consider that 12,000 men and women served in the merchant navy 
in World War II.  Many were older than the average age of 
Canadians in the armed forces since many of these merchant 
mariners had also served Canada during World War I.  Members of 
our merchant navy, in addition to playing a vital role in the 
transportation of supplies in support of the war effort in 
Europe, also defended Canada's shores during the battle of the 
Atlantic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my capacity as opposition critic for veterans affairs, I 
participated last year in ceremonies commemorating the 55th 
anniversary of the battle of the Atlantic.  The battle of the 
Atlantic was the only battle of World War II that was waged close 
to Canada's shores.  German submarines reached as far as the 
shores of Halifax and the Gulf of the St. Lawrence.  Armed 
merchant navy carriers contributed significantly to turning the 
tide as the battle of the Atlantic was being won by the allies in 
1943. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps politicians have chosen to ignore the plight of merchant 
navy veterans due to the comparative smallness of their numbers. 
The merchant navy was comprised of no more than 12,000 seafarers. 
Of the 12,000 who served in the merchant navy, 1,629 lost their 
lives in World War II, 8 of whom were women.  This represents 
over 13% of the service or approximately 1 in 7. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the merchant navy were not a world apart from those 
in the armed forces.  It should be remembered that at the 
outbreak of World War II, the Royal Canadian Navy took control of 
all shipping.  It should also be remembered that all who served 
in the merchant navy were volunteers.  None were compelled to 
sail but most did.  Once signed on, merchant navy seamen were 
subject to sail or jail orders just as the navy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What was denied to the merchant navy veterans at war's end, such 
that they did not have the equality of post-war opportunity 
available to other veterans?  The benefits denied are not minor 
and clearly their absence would have lifetime impacts.  Merchant 
navy veterans received no financial assistance to attend 
university as did other war veterans.  Many of the leaders in 
professions during the 1960s to the present are or were veterans 
who received such assistance.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Merchant navy veterans were not accorded priority in public 
service employment as were other returning veterans.  After the 
war the employment of the public service offered the benefit of 
economic stability and the opportunity to re-establish one's life 
in an orderly fashion.  It was a particularly important benefit 
remembered by those whose youth occurred during the great 
depression when employment in the public service was also often 
the only gainful employment available.  The denial of this 
benefit to the merchant navy veterans had lifetime effects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third benefit denied to the merchant navy veterans was land 
or its cash equivalent.  Returning veterans were provided with an 
opportunity to acquire housing under the Veterans Land Act as 
well as income support.  The opportunity to acquire housing 
coupled with financial assistance to attend university, income 
support and priority in public service employment meant that many 
veterans could overcome the scars of war and look forward to 
stable family lives and careers.  None of this was available to 
merchant navy veterans except in limited circumstances where such 
veterans were disabled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this wrong has not been addressed for nearly 55 years after 
the end of World War II is a national disgrace which will 
hopefully not continue.  It is true that as of 1992 merchant navy 
veterans have essentially been “on equal footing” with other 
veterans in terms of benefits.  Now with Bill C-61 they will be 
on equal footing under the same legislation and are therefore no 
longer symbolically separate but equal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This still does not address the issue that the lives and 
families of every one of our merchant navy veterans have been 
scarred by a government imposed inequality of post-war 
opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are several reasons given for this discriminatory 
treatment at war's end.  Some argue that it was because there 
were many socialists in the merchant navy and it was believed by 
the government of the day that any support accorded merchant navy 
veterans would strengthen socialistic and pro-union sentiments. 
That these beliefs continued into the cold war of the fifties is 
understandable given the tenor of the times, though it does not 
make them right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To this day I can advise the House that organizations 
representing merchant navy veterans represent a broad political 
spectrum that results from time to time in a degree of fractious 
discord.  The fact that to this day merchant navy veterans have 
difficulty speaking consistently with one voice should not be a 
matter to be taken advantage of politically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On occasion and quite recently I have been asked to detail my 
goals with respect to my current role as official opposition 
critic of veterans affairs.  As has been publicly reported, I 
stated that one dimension of this portfolio, the same portfolio 
addressed by the Minister of Veterans Affairs, is that many of 
the files are not new.  Many of these issues are not new.  Some 
of these issues have been going on for 50 or 55 years, far too 
long. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For reasons best left to historians many of these issues that 
could have been addressed by governments 20 and 30 years ago were 
not addressed, let alone resolved.  I support the bill as one 
small step toward resolving the merchant navy concerns and I 
encourage the government to do more.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The government passed legislation providing numerous benefits 
for armed forces veterans returning to Canada at the end of 
World War II, but refused to help merchant navy veterans who 
were trying to resume their lives, which had been interrupted 
when they volunteered to serve their country, particularly 
during the two world wars in the heavily torpedoed convoy lanes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For over 50 years, the Canadian merchant navy veterans, the 
fourth arm of the fighting services as they were called during 
World War II, have been discriminated against by the government 
because they were paramilitaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill will correct certain anomalies and has the support of 
the Bloc Quebecois.  But unless these individuals receive 
retroactive compensation and the same treatment as their 
military comrades, the injustice inflicted on them by our 
government will never be erased. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to give some background when talking about the 
merchant marine.  On November 16, 1939, two weeks after Great 
Britain declared war on Germany, the first merchant marine 
convoy left the Port of Halifax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This convoy opened the war-time route to England and the Soviet 
Union, carrying vital supplies to overseas allied forces, and 
many of the crew members on these ships lost their lives.  Their 
losses were proportionately higher than those of all the other 
military forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The merchant navy was the backbone of the supply system in the 
North Atlantic that helped preserve the freedom of the British 
and of their allies. At the beginning of the war, Canada's 
merchant navy, which was governed by the very strict measures in 
the Canada Shipping Act, had a total of 37 ocean going ships and 
about 1,400 seamen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government played an active role in the evolution of the 
situation. A Canadian interdepartmental merchant navy commission 
was established. A crown corporation, Wartime Merchant Shipping 
Limited, was set up in 1941 to look after the merchant navy and, 
the following year, the Park Steamship Company was created to 
supervise merchant seamen and ships under construction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recruiting offices were set up to send people where demand was 
strongest. 
Merchant seamen were under the authority of DND's naval section. 
Ships left in convoys or alone, with sealed orders from the 
British admiralty that were handed out locally by the commander 
of the naval forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In spite of the casualties, by the end of the war, Canada had 
157 ships and some 12,000 seamen, or an additional 120 ships and 
10,600 seamen. We had the third largest merchant navy in the 
world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On February 8, 1944, C.D. Howe, the Minister of Munitions and 
Supplies, said on CBC radio that “without our merchant seamen, 
our combat forces would have been immobilized and the brilliant 
campaign in North Africa would not have been possible. We would 
not have succeeded in landing on the coasts of Sicily and 
Italy”. Without our seamen, thousands of soldiers would not have 
been transported to the battlefields of Europe or the Pacific, 
as members of inter-allied operations clearly remembered. 
They were also responsible for delivering Malta. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Their precious cargoes made them immediate targets for the Axis 
powers.  The German strategy was to follow the merchant marine 
to cut the supply lines to Canadian ships.  German submarines 
and planes knew their itineraries and unmercilessly attacked the 
merchant ships.  In addition, the German submarines hunted them 
up and down the Atlantic coast in an effort to find them, 
monitor them and catch them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, in 1942, they penetrated deep into the Gulf of St. 
Lawrence where they attacked a convoy and sunk six merchant 
ships, including two Canadian ships and two of their Canadian 
escorts.

</I></B></P><P align=left>British Prime Minister Winston Churchill admitted, and I quote: 
“I was much more concerned over this battle than I had been over 
the glorious air battle known as the Battle of Britain”.  He 
acknowledged that all would have been lost had the merchant 
marine failed.  However, it succeeded and kept the British and 
their allies in the war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before the start of the second world war, the German navy had 
planned a campaign to attack allied merchant marine ships en 
route from North America. 
The destruction of the merchant marine ships, which were neither 
well armed nor well armoured, became the prime objective of the 
Nazi warships, planes and submarines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Packs of 10 or 12 German submarines roamed the Atlantic to hit 
and sink the supply ships.  German aircraft bombarded them as 
they approached the coast of Europe.  German warships disguised 
as cargo ships used their hidden deck guns to attack the 
merchant marine fleet at sea.  Alone or in convoy, these ships 
faced the risk of attack at any point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the orders of the German high command indicate, the merchant 
seamen were at the heart of the Battle of the Atlantic.  As the 
merchant ships were constant targets for enemy ships, the allied 
warships were unable to detect or combat German submarines. 
Until 1942, the mere sight of a submarine periscope was enough 
to put convoys to flight. Slower replenishment vessels trailed 
behind and were torpedoed. Merchant ships were not equipped for 
serious fighting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While they were required to carry anti-aircraft guns as well as 
gas and fire protection equipment, merchant ships were seldom 
able to defend themselves against torpedoes, bombs and shells 
launched by heavily armed enemy ships. This was what the 
merchant marine was up against during the war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other cases, the most valuable cargo was placed in the middle 
of the convoy, the surrounding ships acting as buffers. The 
ships on the outside were the easiest targets. When under attack 
and heavily damaged, they were left to their own devices. 
If the ship sank, seamen then faced the perils of freezing 
water, icy gusts of wind and 10-foot waves. They knew they were 
likely to die.  The German submarine commanders had received the 
order to take no prisoners. Fortunately, some did anyway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was not until 47 years after the second world war that 
legislation was finally introduced in this respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1992, the government passed a bill to correct these 
anomalies, namely the Merchant Navy Veteran and Civilian 
War-related Benefits Act. This act provided wartime merchant 
seamen with the same rights to all the benefits that were 
currently available to the armed forces, but not retroactively, 
and without recognizing the merchant navy as a paramilitary 
force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-61 introduces some technical changes by which merchant 
navy veterans will be covered by the major pieces of legislation 
that apply to veterans, but once again without retroactivity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the present time, benefits to merchant mariners fall under 
the legislation applicable to civilians.  This denigrates the 
efforts of these veterans, yet they plied the same waters as the 
navy, faced the same enemy aircraft as the airforce, had to 
dodge the same bullets as the army.  Canada did not, however, 
consider them veterans.  In all other allied countries, they 
would have been entitled to the same benefits and the same war 
service status as other veterans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, this omnibus bill makes it possible to amend a number 
of acts at one time with a very specific objective in mind. 
Primarily, these changes will make it possible for the programs 
available to veterans to be extended to merchant navy veterans.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I repeat, the Bloc Quebecois is in agreement with these 
principles of equality, of recognition, of equity, and of 
support for all those who risked their lives, or lost their 
lives, in the cause of peace.  Our greatest regret, moreover, is 
that this government was so long in acknowledging the role 
played by the merchant mariners in the two world wars and in 
Korea, and most especially the fact that it refuses to grant 
retroactivity for benefits merchant mariners did not receive, 
while army, air force and navy veterans did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The major features of this bill are as follows:  inclusion in 
the definition “member of the forces”; payment of a veterans 
allowance under the provisions of the War Veterans Allowance 
Act; a prisoner of war allowance; assessment increases for 
survivors of disability pensioners; deadline extension for 
termination of war veterans allowance payments; regulations 
assigning funeral and burial programs to a non-government body, 
such as the Last Post Fund; continuation of pension payments for 
those blinded during the 1917 Halifax explosion and provision 
for the board to review earlier decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently, three former members of the merchant marine staged a 
hunger strike on the steps of the Parliament Buildings in order 
to obtain compensation for something that should have been 
sorted out right after the war ended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Bloc Quebecois critic, I recognize that merchant mariners 
have suffered for too long at the hands of government 
bureaucracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Former members of Canada's merchant marine have been fighting 
for a very long time for recognition of their courageous actions 
before, during and after World War II.  Members of the merchant 
marine were the first to enter the war and the last to come back 
to peace.  They transported our troops and supplies to Europe 
throughout the war, and brought them back afterwards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that merchant mariners working on board the Park 
Steamship Company's vessels formed a union in 1944 in order to 
improve their working conditions, obtain mattresses, drinking 
water, food, blankets and better wages, and that they were 
reluctantly recognized by the government, although they had 
promised not to strike. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nonetheless, a special V-Day commemorative ceremony was organized 
in February 1944 in Montreal to honour merchant marine veterans 
and their contribution to the war effort.  Newspapers ran 
headlines reading “Merchant marine veterans demand soldier 
status”.  And throughout the war, they were constantly referred 
to as Canada's “fourth armed force” by many of the politicians 
of the day, including Prime Minister Mackenzie King, C.D. Howe, 
the Hon. J.T. Michaud, Minister of Transport, and many others. 
The idea was taken up by the media and the House of Commons, but 
dropped when the war ended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After the war, merchant seamen were no longer needed. The fleet 
was privatized. It was estimated that less than 4,000 jobs would 
be available to the 12,000 seamen, who were very badly treated, 
even though they asked to be considered as veterans in order to 
get the related benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we ask the minister why he will not retroactively give 
merchant navy seamen what soldiers got, he says that merchant 
seamen are entitled to the same benefits as other veterans. What 
he does not say, however, is that they do not get equal 
treatment when it comes to retroactivity. In my opinion, without 
equal access to retroactivity, there can be no equal treatment 
in terms of the benefits involved. This is why Bill C-61 is not 
complete. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After World War II, merchant navy veterans were deprived of all 
the benefits that other veterans enjoyed. These seamen were 
paramilitaries. 
Yet, they were ignored by the government for several decades and 
this is why I plan to move an amendment to the bill, so that 
they can be entitled to tax-free retroactive compensation. 
This retroactivity would compensate merchant seamen for lost 
opportunities, while also ending the discrimination practiced by 
previous governments.

fleet was privatized? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give you some examples of discrimination. The governments 
denied that merchant seamen were the “fourth arm of the fighting 
services” or the “fourth arm of the armed forces” as they were 
called during the war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They denied that merchant seamen were bound by their enlistment 
contracts. 
They could not leave at any time they wished; they were assigned 
to their post by order in council and by ship's articles.  They 
were thrown in prison, if they were absent without permission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The authorities denied that they had suffered the highest losses 
of all the services, even though this fact was admitted during 
the war.  They were easy prey in the submarine war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The authorities denied that they had criss-crossed dangerous 
waters for the six long years of the war.  The war went on in 
their theatre longer than was the case for any other service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The authorities denied that they had sailed under admiralty 
orders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They denied that the merchant mariners were badly paid.  They 
were not as well paid as their counterparts in the navy, 
although government files indicate otherwise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The authorities denied that they were subject to disciplinary 
measures, although they reported to the judge advocate general 
of the navy,  and were part of the structure of the military 
operations groups and could be incarcerated by the military 
police and the RCMP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The authorities denied they paid income tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After the war, they could build houses for their military 
comrades if they worked in construction, but they could not get 
one of their own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were not given the employment preference reserved for the 
military in the public service.  The Canadian Corps of 
Commissionaires was not open to the merchant marine until 1989. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They had no say in the drafting of Bill C-84 in 1992. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1946, briefs were submitted to the special veterans affairs 
committee of the House of Commons calling for their inclusion in 
the veterans rehabilitation programs.  Most of the demands made 
at that time have never been dealt with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They were denied representation at official Remembrance Day 
ceremonies, although they had been represented during the second 
world war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And then there is the whole miserable history of the Hal Banks 
period.  In 1963, after nearly a year of investigation, the 
industrial inquiry commission on the disruption of shipping, 
under British Columbia Justice Norris, brought down a report 
that strongly denounced Banks, his methods and his associates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In it, Banks was compared to Hitler, Stalin and Mussolini 
because of his dictatorial tendencies.  Justice Norris described 
the outcome of his acts as “industrial death”. 
Sailors were deprived of the opportunity to work at sea and 
labelled as communists and thus unemployable on land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They were subjected to brutal treatment.  One of the most 
favoured means of dissuasion was to put a sailor's legs up over 
the curb of a sidewalk and then to jump on them in order to 
break them.  These acts of brutality were not reserved for 
sailors alone; even captains were attacked for something as 
minor as delaying a sailing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the merchant mariners' average age is 77, and that of the 
prisoners 87, the following retroactive benefits are being 
demanded: a public apology by the federal government; 
reimbursement of income tax with compound interest; 
reimbursement of forced savings and unclaimed wages; 
compensation and benefits retroactive to the date of death or 
injury for medicare and the veterans independence program, 
benefits under this having been refused since its inception; a 
tax-exempt lump sum payment for merchant mariners with wartime 
service, with an additional amount for merchant mariners who 
were POWs for more than 36 months; exemption from income tax for 
the rest of their lives; and inclusion of unionized merchant 
mariners in the programs available to their comrades.

sometimes judges make questionable rulings and sometimes they 
make inappropriate comments.  Occasionally we hear from a judge 
with a finger on the pulse of the community.  This week a B.C. 
judge imposed a 14-year sentence on a parasite for his part in a 
home invasion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Home invasions have become epidemic in British Columbia. Primary 
targets are the elderly but entire families have also been 
terrorized.  At least one murder has resulted.  Charities are 
suffering because people are afraid to open their doors. 
Community crime prevention meetings are packed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This judge has delivered a clear message by using what in his 
words is “the only remedy the law now provides a trial judge”. 
He also said “courts can do their part to preserve a citizen's 
right to live in security by imposing progressively severer 
sentences on those offenders who commit this type of crime”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can only hope that his colleagues at the appeal court level 
will show the same commitment to their communities.

yet the federal government has not increased the level of funding 
for the AIDS strategy in eight years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The AIDS strategy funding does not take into account the 
increased need for services or the money needed to support new 
programs, prevention, support services and new clients.  The 
result is that many existing programs are actually receiving less 
money than they have in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Windsor, Ontario, the Aids Committee of Windsor had its 
funding cut by $100,000 this year even though Windsor has the 
fourth highest HIV rate in the province.  That means people

information and support they need.  Despite the rising HIV rate 
in Ontario only 20 out of 36 agencies that needed funding 
actually received it.

since 1993 Canadians have been paying more in taxes and getting 
less back in services.  The employment insurance program is a 
good example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the claims that the Liberals have been cutting taxes, 
payroll taxes have gone up steadily since 1993.  The surplus in 
the EI program is still running about $6 billion per year with a 
total surplus of about $19 billion.  That means that the 
government has taken $19 billion more from the workers and the 
employers than it gave back in benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This situation is absolutely intolerable.  In Newfoundland and 
Labrador the EI changes have directly contributed to our massive 
out-migration.  Over 30,000 individuals in the last three years 
have left Newfoundland.  Throughout St. John's West from Bay 
Bulls to Placentia our rural communities are being devastated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This year in Newfoundland with an unemployment rate of 18% many 
individuals cannot receive EI benefits, even though 
Newfoundlanders this year paid $32 million in premiums more than 
they received in benefits.  It is time to use the EI fund for the 
benefit of those who need it most, the unemployed.

Speaker, if the government's intention was to cut taxes, it 
missed its target.  The government's tax policy is like Zeller's 
in reverse:  pay more, get less.  Pay more taxes, get less health 
care and other services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This year the Liberals are squeezing $1,800 more in taxes from 
each taxpayer than they did five years ago.  But during the same 
period they cut social program spending by $1,150 per person. 
When tax revenue is at an all time high, why is health care 
funding at an all time low? 
<P><A NAME="LINK52"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as we faced 
these difficult circumstances, one of our first priorities was to 
reinvest in health care.  That is why our first major expenditure 
was to put $1.5 billion into the CHST for health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That shows what our priority is.  I ask the hon. member to wait

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the truth is that this government decided long ago that 
health care was not its number one priority.  Total government 
taxes are at an all time high and, of course, it continues to 
steamroll $1,800 more in income tax out of each and every one of 
us.  Despite this record breaking tax collection, it has gutted 
hospital spending by $1,150 per person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With taxes at a record high and health care funding at a record 
low, why does the government continue its pay more, get less 
policy? 
<P><A NAME="LINK54"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International

is a much more fundamental question, one which goes right to the 
heart of the credibility of the Reform Party itself.  The Reform 
budget calls for $54 billion in new fiscal goodies, but at the 
same time it is assuming growth rates for the next three years of 
5.5%.  That is a Bre-X budget:  full of hype, but bankrupt.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder what the justice minister's position is on child porn

Today we have three to five families living in homes half that 
size.  Indian affairs has for years built houses at barely 
acceptable standards, houses that could not withstand everyday 
living.  Conditions are so bad that the United Nations has

I thank the member on this side of the House for that question. I 
only regret it did not come from the Reform Party, the official 
opposition, to ask that kind of a question about the plight of 
aboriginal people in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can tell the hon. member, as I said earlier in my first 
response, we are working closely with the communities to ensure 
that they are looked after.  It goes beyond the question of 
providing housing for aboriginal people.  We need to settle land 
claims with the aboriginal people of Canada to give them an 
opportunity to participate fully in Canada and enter the 21st 
century.

prosecuting defenceless poor farmers for exporting their own 
grain while wealthy ones were being ignored. Her answer was that 
the prosecutions taking place were on the basis of due process of

these same poor, defenceless farmers while for three years it has 
refused to prosecute a wealthy farmer who can afford to defend

uphold the law, not in a selective manner but broadly and even 
handedly across the board.  That is in fact what we do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of individual prosecutions, of course the hon.

question is again for the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned earlier, many of the regulations of the

Newfoundland fishery has changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the minister appoint an independent commissioner to review 
the present regulations with the intention of replacing or

this study is completed?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans,

the hon. member's question, this study was undertaken and the 
results were reported in 1997, some 18 months ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We did look into the issue of vessel size.  It is a complex 
problem.  On the one hand there are safety considerations with 
respect to larger vessels being safer vessels, which is a brief 
way of putting it, but at the same time larger vessels mean that 
fishermen will stay out longer in the face of adverse weather and 
they will go farther.  So the safety issue tends to equalize. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand we have the major problem of increasing 
capacity in the fleet, which this government is spending some 
$250 million in the Atlantic region to reduce.  It is a complex 
issue.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>WAR VETERANS ALLOWANCE ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK173">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-61, an 
act to amend the War Veterans Allowance Act, the Pension Act, the 
Merchant Navy Veteran and Civilian War-related Benefits Act, the 
Department of Veterans Affairs Act, the Veterans Review and 
Appeal Board Act and the Halifax Relief Commission Pension 
Continuation Act and to amend certain other acts in consequence 
thereof, be read the second time and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK174"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very 
proud to have the opportunity today to speak to Bill C-61. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I rise in support of Bill C-61 on behalf of the federal New 
Democratic Party caucus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While this bill does have some shortcomings, and a very serious 
one which I will get to a bit later, the legislation does 
represent a step forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill, as has been mentioned, is an omnibus bill which 
touches upon many aspects of veterans affairs.  It touches upon 
benefits for prisoners of war and benefits for widows of 
pensioners.  It touches upon the Veterans Review and Appeal 
Board, the Halifax Relief Commission and so forth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One very important aspect of this bill is that it seeks to put 
merchant marine veterans on an equal footing with regular forces 
veterans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was quite interested in hearing the hon. member opposite 
referring to that aspect of the bill as being symbolic only.  It 
is a very important aspect of this bill.  Perhaps because of the 
omission concerning compensation for past grievances it does 
become symbolic within the framework of this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I want to commend the merchant marine veterans, their 
organizations, families, activists and supporters for bringing 
this bill into being.  It is only through their efforts and hard 
work that we are able to discuss this bill today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the outset, let me make it very clear that my comments and 
this bill in itself do not in any way take away from regular 
forces veterans, but seek to bring the merchant marine veterans 
up to an equal footing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The monster Adolph Hitler issued a directive in 1941 which 
included the following:  “Attack shipping, especially when 
homeward bound, by all methods.  The sinking of merchantmen is 
more important than attacking enemy warships”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These brave Canadians who sailed the corridors of hell played a 
central role in our war effort, as central a role as the regular 
forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Halifax-Dartmouth branch of the Merchant Navy Veterans 
Association for my region put it in a submission to the 
provincial legislature in July 1998, “The ships carried 
explosives, fuel, food, oil, gasoline, tanks, airplanes, iron ore 
for the hungry British smelters, butter and flour, bacon and 
beans”.  Yet they were fitted with often obsolete breech guns, 
castoffs, antiquities better suited for military museums than 
defending the lives of Canadians at sea.  In short, these 
Canadians risked their lives and often gave their lives to 
support our war efforts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tragedy of the matter is that when I say they often gave 
their lives, the figures speak for themselves.  It has been 
estimated that a full 13% of merchant mariners who played an 
active role in our war effort were killed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last fall I went on a pilgrimage of remembrance to honour our 
war dead in Belgium and France.  I was struck deeply and 
irrevocably by what I saw and what I learned.  To have had the 
opportunity to see the trenches and the remnants of artillery and 
war equipment, and having felt the cold and damp biting winds 
blowing across the fields of Flanders, eating into one's very 
bones, certainly gave me an appreciation in part of what our 
Canadian young men who fought and died experienced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having stood in cemeteries where there were tombstones, row upon 
row, as far as the eye could see and knowing that thousands of 
bodies lay in those graves and many more lay unaccounted for in 
the surrounding farms and fields left me with the haunting image 
of man's inhumanity to man.  The question still rings in my mind 
as to how we can do this to one another.  Even worse is the 
knowledge that we are still doing it today throughout various 
parts of our world.  As human beings, all of us must do our part 
to bring an end to the senseless slaughter of war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a start we must remember those who fought and died for 
freedom, those who sacrificed themselves so that succeeding 
generations might live in peace and harmony, free from oppression 
and tyranny. 
While many of those who we remember and honour today are those 
who served in the regular military, we must not forget the many 
others who served their country in an unique yet important way as 
special construction battalions or merchant marines.  That is why 
the Liberal government's apparent unwillingness to negotiate a 
fair compensation package for Canadian merchant marine veterans 
is so unacceptable.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current treatment of merchant mariner veterans is one that I 
personally and as the federal NDP spokesperson for veterans 
affairs find deeply disheartening.  When it came time to serve 
their country Canada's merchant marines did so with dedication 
and courage equal to their military comrades.  Why then are the 
merchant marines not receiving equal treatment in terms of 
compensation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the bill seeks to establish current equality, which my 
caucus colleagues and I support, it does nothing to compensate 
for all the lost opportunities suffered as a result this 
discrimination.  There is no reason to continue to deny merchant 
marines the full compensation due them.  I urge the government to 
let the second reading of Bill C-61, which in words grants full 
equality, be a springboard to action, negotiation, compensation 
and hence real reparation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government has a choice.  The government has the 
capacity to choose to set matters right and get negotiations for 
just compensation back on track.  While the federal government 
was finally prodded into introducing the bill, others acted 
sooner, in some cases much sooner.  Britain accorded full veteran 
status to merchant mariners in 1940.  In the United States these 
veterans were realized as having the same status as regular 
forces veterans in 1988.  Australia recognized full equality in 
1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How many merchant mariners have passed away in Canada who would 
have appreciated this gesture from the government at an earlier 
stage? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a letter I received from George Conway-Brown in January of 
this year he quotes Canada's Rear Admiral Leonard W. Murray, who 
served as commander in chief, northwest Atlantic, from 1943 to 
1945: “The battle of the Atlantic was not won by any navy or air 
force. It was won by the courage, fortitude and determination of 
the British and allied merchant navy”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These mariners often encountered the Nazi Donitz U-boats, the 
grey wolves that deprived so many Canadian families of their 
loved ones.  Closer to Europe merchant mariners were attacked by 
Germany's FW-200 Condor air force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But what happened to Canadian merchant mariners upon their 
return to Canada?  In Britain they returned as full and equal 
veterans with equal access to post-war programs, services and 
benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada they returned to virtually no support.  They were 
denied upgrading courses at technical, vocational and high 
schools offered to regular force veterans.  There were denied 
health support and employment opportunities available to army, 
navy and air force personnel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This discrimination weighed heavily on so many merchant marine 
veterans.  I mentioned earlier that I am glad to see the bill 
being brought forward, even though it is too late for many 
deceased merchant marine veterans.  That is what makes the 
actions of this government concerning compensation for these 
brave Canadians all the more odious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government saw fit to provide an ex gratia payment to Hong 
Kong veterans who were Japanese prisoners of war of $23,950 each. 
This payment was promised just this past December. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unconscionable and meanspirited that this government has 
betrayed Canada's merchant marines by refusing to compensate them 
for the discrimination they faced upon their return home from 
serving in Canada's war effort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been estimated that merchant mariners are dying at the 
rate of about 12 per month.  A St. Albert veteran said in an 
interview earlier this month in the Edmonton <I>Sun</I>: “The 
whole thing is a run around.  We figure [the federal government] 
is waiting for us to die of old age”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On November 24, 1998 in response to a question I put to him, the 
minister said concerning compensation negotiations for merchant 
mariners: “I am there to listen”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Debating Bill C-61 before the House surely signals the time to 
act, not just listen.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Justice delayed is justice denied, particularly when the death 
rate among these veterans who served Canada so nobly is so high. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As merchant navy Captain Hill Wilson wrote in a letter in 
January of this year, other countries have made reparations for 
these veterans.  He refers to a veteran living on Vancouver 
Island who sailed on Norwegian ships during World War II and 
receives a pension of over $2,000 a month from Norway for his 
merchant navy service.  He also cites examples from the French 
government and the United States government for Vietnam war 
merchant navy veterans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While on the issues implied in Bill C-61, it is essential to 
refer to another atrocious act of negligence and outright scandal 
perpetrated by this Liberal government on Canadian veterans who 
were sent to concentration camps by the Nazi government.  These 
men, survivors of the horrors of Buchenwald, were recently sent 
cheques in the amount of $1,098 to supposedly compensate them for 
the horrors faced in Buchenwald. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My constituent, William Gibson, returned the cheque, a comment 
on this government's sad failure to successfully negotiate 
reparations from the German government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The U.S.A. has recently negotiated an enviable settlement from 
the German government.  This Liberal government has failed so 
miserably where others have succeeded and may be trying to hide 
its shame by offering these paltry sums to Canadian forces 
survivors of the Buchenwald concentration camp. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude my comments on the second reading of Bill C-61 
with an anonymous poem which pays homage to Canadian merchant 
navy veterans: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>All hail to our soldiers, our airmen, our tars,<BR> 
Who in these dark days are the victims of War,<BR> 
All hail to these heroes who flash on the screen,<BR>

</I></B></P><P align=left>No halo, no glimmer, just duty that's all,<BR> 
Day in and day out through the heat or a squall<BR> 
Grit, courage, endurance and bearing serene,<BR> 
These are the men of the Merchant Marine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How much do we need them, these sons of the sea,<BR> 
Without their devotion, how could we be free?<BR> 
For one vital cog in the great machine<BR> 
Is filled by the men of the Merchant Marine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And so if the cares of these days dark and clear,<BR>

Remember the hardships and dangers unseen,<BR> 
And pray for the men of the Merchant Marine.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to speak in support of Bill C-61, but I feel there is 
something left out with regard to Bill C-61 and I wish to address 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-61 will allow more veterans to qualify for benefits and 
it will place them under the War Veterans Allowance Act.  We all 
know that in 1992 the PC party put the merchant navy men under 
the Civilian War Veterans Allowance Act.  However, many things 
were left out for them over the years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Look at what the men and women of our army, navy and air force 
received when they came home from the war, and rightfully so. 
They received a clothing allowance, rehabilitation grants, 
transportation to place of enlistment, war service gratuities, 
re-establishment credit, reinstatement or preference in civilian 
employment estimate, out of work allowance, education assistance, 
treatment for pension disability including appliances, Veterans 
Land Act or housing assistance, business or professional loans 
and waiting returns allowance.  All that at that time would total 
$30,590. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, veterans were entitled to a number of other 
benefits, including veterans independence program, prisoner of 
war benefits, education assistance for children of the war dead, 
legal assistance for preparation of pension claims and 
counselling and referrals, and rightfully so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The above figures are based on the fact that a former member of 
the merchant navy would be in receipt of either a war disability 
pension or a war veterans allowance if he did not receive both. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have met regularly in my riding office with the merchant navy 
veterans.  As members know, many of them were here on the Hill on 
a hunger strike. 
I have never seen that happen in Canada with any veterans who 
felt they had to go to that degree to get the attention of the 
Department of Veterans Affairs.

</I></B></P><P align=left>After World War II the Canadian government had the task of 
demobilizing over one million troops.  Some of these troops were 
offered positions within the military, but not the merchant navy 
men.  Others were offered many advantageous opportunities that 
were not offered to the merchant navy men. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Merchant seaman Ossie MacLean informed me of how he went to the 
local veterans office to inquire about a business start-up loan 
after World War II when he was no longer with the merchant navy. 
He thought he could receive a loan to start his business like the 
loans being offered to other veterans.  When he arrived he was 
asked for his service number.  He gave them his merchant marine 
number and he was told that he did not qualify for any of the 
programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. MacLean was there when this country needed him yet we failed 
him when he needed us.  Mr. MacLean was one of the merchant navy 
veterans who stood outside this House on two separate occasions 
last year on that hunger strike.  He was joined by other fine 
gentlemen, Randy Hope, Ward Duke, Willis Marsolais and Doug 
McMartin.  Together these five brave men drew more attention to 
their cause in a few weeks than ever before. Now we are at a 
second reading and these men feel along with their 2,300 
surviving shipmates that they deserve a payment from the 
government once again.  Is is possible to do this?  Yes, it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the minister says that we cannot deal with retroactivity. 
We are saying he does not have to deal with retroactivity but he 
can deal with these men in manner in which he can give them a 
grant.  With the formula in the Cliff Chadderton report some 
would get $5,000 for putting their lives on the line and taking 
over all the goods, ammunition and equipment needed by our men. 
If they only went on one trip the report said give them $5,000 
but some were in the merchant navy during the whole war.  All of 
us know the number of lives lost. One in eight of our merchant 
navy men lost their lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I was putting my notes together I was thinking about what it 
must have been like to be on one of those boats.  The Germans 
knew exactly what they were carrying so the Germans were steadily 
looking for them.  Those were the boats the Germans wanted to 
torpedo.  Those were the boats the Germans wanted to get.  They 
knew if we did not get the ammunition and materials over to our 
forces our forces could not do anything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time for us to take the necessary steps to completely make 
them equal.  Bill C-61 puts them under the War Veterans Allowance 
Act but this is 1999.  What about in 1945?  What about in 1939? 
They were not equal in those days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1992 when the PC government of the day brought in omnibus 
Bill C-84, it allocated $100 million to be used for benefits to 
serve our merchant navy veterans.  That total was later reduced 
to $88 million which would still be ample money to cover and 
offer sufficient benefits to these veterans.  But when this 
government took office for some reason it put that money in 
general revenue.  It was never set aside for what it was intended 
to do for our merchant navy men.  After being put into general 
revenues the money could never be allocated specifically for the 
merchant navy. When the minister was at one of the meetings I 
asked if they could please tell me where the $88 million went. 
Nobody seems to know.

</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the Department of Veterans Affairs has had surpluses 
every year between 1992 and 1997.  These surpluses have ranged 
anywhere from $20 million to $154 million.  We received this 
information from the Public Accounts of Canada. The money was 
there and it is still there today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently the Minister of Veterans Affairs himself has recognized 
the role of the merchant navy in World War II.  Each merchant 
navy veteran has been forwarded a copy of <I>Valour at Sea</I>. 
This is a book that was commissioned by veterans affairs to 
recognize the role of Canada's merchant navy in both world wars 
and in Korea. The letter that accompanies the book states “It 
describes the role of Canada's merchant navy in the defence of 
freedom and democracy”. It also states “The armed forces and 
the merchant navy helped secure supply routes that sustained 
Canada's allies in their darkest hours and made possible the 
liberation of Europe”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine. The minister has put out a book called <I>Valour at 
Sea</I> which is beautiful.  It really is.  And he is stating to 
our merchant navy men that they helped secure the supply routes 
that sustained Canada's allies in their darkest hours and made 
possible the liberation of Europe.  Our merchant navy men did 
that.  This letter, as I have stated, was sent by our Minister of 
Veterans Affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian merchant navy was considered to be the fourth arm 
of the armed forces.  The odds of dying in the second world war 
was greater for the merchant navy than for any of our other 
troops. These men were some of the bravest.  They kept our troops 
supplied on the front lines and they braved the intolerable 
elements of nature to do so. How many of us today would know what 
it was like to stand on the bow of a boat loaded with explosives 
in the middle of winter on the North Atlantic pushing back the 
ice and the mines and wondering if a German U-boat had us in its 
sights? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These men know what it was like.  They lived it.  Mr. Speaker, 
they lived it for you and for me.  We would not be in this House 
of Commons today, not one of us, not one of the 301 members of 
parliament and not any of the others that are here, if it was not 
for those men. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When this bill is referred back to committee for further study, 
there will be a motion that I put before the committee on 
November 26 last year.  It deals with the issue of a one-time 
grant payment for the men and women of the merchant navy in lieu 
of benefits not received after duty to their country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I put forward the motion, as I stated, on November 26 asking 
“that the Standing Committee on National Defence and Veterans 
Affairs recommend that the merchant navy veterans be recognized 
as war veterans,”—and they are being recognized under Bill 
C-61—“that they receive prisoner of war benefits”—and that 
will happen under Bill C-61—“that they receive a one-time 
payment in lieu of benefits afforded to other veterans of World 
War II and that they be recognized as veterans on ceremonial 
days”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When this bill is referred back, we will once again be dealing 
with my suspended motion.  I trust that all of my colleagues on 
both sides of the House will agree with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time to act on behalf of our veterans.  Bill C-61 is a 
piece of legislation that should be passed and we will support 
it.  I know many of our veterans and their widows want to see it 
passed.  Many of these veterans are in their mid to late 70s and 
approximately 13 die each month in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want this House to know that this bill and the motion that I 
have before the committee should not be deemed as partisan and 
should not be considered along partisan lines.  We should not be 
partisan when it comes to our veterans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I join many of my colleagues in congratulating the government in 
its recent decision to compensate the Hong Kong war veterans for 
their service to their country.  I felt that we should have 
pressed harder to have the Japanese government recognize these 
veterans and the unacceptable merciless treatment they endured. 
But the bottom line is when it came to doing the right thing for 
the Hong Kong veterans, it was done and I am pleased.  The 
government and the House did the right thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one other thing I would like to bring to the attention 
of the House with regard to our veterans.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lady came to see me.  Her husband, a veteran, had died.  She 
thought that we would be paying to bury him.  It was not until 
after the burial that she found out the means test used to be 
$24,000 just for the veteran but then in 1996 it was reduced to 
$12,000.  That was $12,000 for husband and wife; it used to be 
$24,000 just for the veteran.  They thought that she had too much 
money.  She had $6,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I looked at all of her expenses again.  I went over to the 
Department of Veterans Affairs and asked “Do you not take into 
consideration the expense of the coffin and the funeral and take 
that from what she had and then tell me she still has $6,000?” 
In the end the department said that it was wrong and it would pay 
for his funeral. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel very strongly about this.  There are so few of them left. 
For us to lower the means test to $12,000 is an insult to our 
veterans. We are forgetting the role they played.  I sometimes 
wonder if it has anything to do with the fact that some of the 
younger people on the Hill do not understand the role the 
veterans played to save Canada and bring it to what it is today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to the minister that yes my party and I will be supporting 
Bill C-61.  But I am also telling him, and I want it on the 
record, that I will not go away until the merchant navy men 
receive some form of recognition through a grant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on 
a point of order.  Based on previous discussions I think you will 
find that there is unanimous consent to see the clock as 1.30 
p.m. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Are there any questions or comments 
on the member's speech?  I think there are.  I assume that if we

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have 
both a question and a comment on the speech of the hon. member 
for Saint John. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sometimes I think Canadian citizens and members of the House 
forget the lesson that was taught to all of us by World War II. 
Quite simply, we were taught in the history books that this war 
was fought on European soil and in European waters, in Asian 
waters and in Japanese waters when as a matter of fact much of 
that war was fought in our waters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During World War II we captured prisoners of war.  We captured 
German spies in Halifax with theatre tickets in their pockets. 
They knew what boats were going out in convoy.  There was a 
submarine net across Halifax harbour which had to be raised in 
order for our troops, soldiers and supplies to get to Europe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A comment I remember well was from my father who was a veteran 
of World War II.  He never saw action.  He was a military 
policeman stationed in St. John's, Newfoundland.  There were 
dozens and dozens of dead merchant marine sailors floating in the 
waters from torpedoed ships off Newfoundland, in Canadian water, 
black with coal oil.  This was the very essence of war and the 
part of war none of us wants to think about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the hon. member, is that a lesson which we should all 
remember, that the war was not fought all on European soil and in 
European water, that the war started on our doorstep when we had 
a 12 mile limit in Canadian waters? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member from Nova 
Scotia is absolutely correct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to tell him that one in eight of all merchant navy men 
were killed during the war.  He was commenting about his father 
in Newfoundland.  In Saint John, New Brunswick on Partridge 
Island we are the most Irish city there is in Canada and there 
were bunkers there. 
Our men were in those bunkers because those German ships were 
right outside Saint John, New Brunswick.  They were looking for 
the merchant navy men and were ordered to get them before they 
could get overseas to Europe with the supplies that were needed.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been estimated that a Canadian merchant ship with 10,000 
tonnes could carry enough foodstuff to feed 225,000 people for a 
week.  Cargo could also include clothing, fuel, steel, aluminum, 
lumber, aircraft, tanks, jeeps, trucks, guns, munitions and 
whatever else was required for the war effort.  Not surprisingly 
they became the prize targets for enemy surface raiders and 
U-boats.  That is exactly what they were.  That is the reason for

</UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That a humble Address 
be presented to His Excellency praying that he will cause to be 
laid before this House a copy of the Prime Minister's ethics code 
for ministers. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, I am very happy to see so many of the 
government members in the House today.  I know they are here 
because they want to have a bit of enlightenment about what it 
means to run an ethical government.  Members from all parts of 
Canada are here today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am really pleased to speak today during Private Members' Hour 
on a votable motion which I put before the House. This motion 
goes to the very heart of what an open and transparent government 
should be and the way it should operate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We remember in 1993 and 1997 in the famous failed red books of 
the Liberal Party how the Liberals talked continually about 
openness, transparency, integrity, honesty, straightforwardness 
and being in touch with the people.  In general, they promised 
the people that they would operate in an ethical and responsible 
manner. Canadians across the country heard that promise in 1993 
and they heard it again in 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is that Canadians first have not seen much openness, 
transparency, ethics and honesty from this government.  But the 
most important thing is that no one seems to know exactly what 
kind of an ethics code this government wants us to believe it 
operates by.  We have never seen the so-called ethics code which 
is parked away somewhere in some forgotten drawer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One would think that in this great country of Canada, where the 
people embrace such values and such integrity in their lives, 
that any government that is looked upon for leadership would want 
to pride itself in being open and accountable to the people that 
it has sworn to serve.

<A HREF="#LINKT33"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>But this concept, this incredible thought, has never focused 
with the Liberal government of Canada.  Liberals are very 
familiar with expressions such as secrecy, behind closed doors, 
under the table, cooking the books, cutting corners and pulling 
the wool over the voters' eyes.  These are all words and phrases 
that are very familiar and near and dear to the hearts and minds 
of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is these words and phrases that sort of highlight the Liberal 
way of governing which can be roughly translated as do not let 
anyone know what the government is up to or there will be a 
revolution, or it may have to be explained.  That is what 
compelled me to prepare today's motion, that a humble address be 
made to his excellency praying that he will cause to be laid 
before this House a copy of the Prime Minister's ethics code for 
his ministers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is that such an unreasonable request to come from me, the 
members of my party and members of the opposition parties, from 
the people of Canada?  Is that such an unreasonable request to 
ask the Prime Minister to put before the country the code of 
ethics that he expects his ministers to be bound by?  I do not 
think so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am getting at is quite simple and I will try to say it in 
language the Liberals can understand and that you can understand, 
Mr. Speaker.  I know you are a very learned gentleman so I could 
probably talk lawyer talk and you would understand it but for the 
sake of the Liberals who have been having a hard time getting 
their heads around this ethics code, we will try to keep it 
simple. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The private sector, banks, businesses, major industries, 
charitable organizations, associations and service clubs all hold 
dear to their hearts some sort of a code that their members, 
employees, managers and volunteers should be operating under for 
day to day activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They believe in that.  They believe that if they cannot be 
accountable to some code of conduct then they can be accountable 
to nothing.  The Liberals do not see it quite that way.  They 
have not allowed their ethics code to see the light of day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will take a moment to explain to the Liberals just what an 
ethics code is.  I will explain it at a level that these members 
here today, and there are lots of them from across the country, 
can understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An ethics code is a system that sets out proper conduct and 
behaviour, just like at home.  In our own homes we try to set out 
a code of conduct and behaviour for our family, for our kids, so 
that they can have role models to look up to and that they can 
understand the right and wrong way of doing things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Government of Canada cannot have a code of ethics that is 
clearly demonstrated, that is clearly visible to the Canadian 
people, what kind of leadership is that?  What kind of message 
are the Canadian people to take from that?  Is it that the 
supreme governing body of this country refuses or maybe does not 
even have some sort of code that directs and gives it sort of a 
guideline for proper behaviour and conduct? 
What is more important about this so-called code of ethics that 
we have not seen yet is that the average Canadians would think 
that the person administering the ethics code of Canada, and I 
find this absolutely disparaging, would think that he or she 
would be required to report to the Parliament of Canada so that 
we all know what is going on, so we all know how the ministers 
are conducting their jobs and to ensure their jobs are not 
interfering with or conflicting with or enhancing their private 
lives in some way, their private well-being.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One would think that would be just the natural thing to do, that 
this ethics counsellor would report to all MPs and therefore to 
all Canadians.  But no, the ethics commissioner reports to only 
one person, the Prime Minister of Canada.  He tells him whether 
his ministers are, we expect, doing their jobs in an upright and 
honest manner and with great integrity. If they are not, how is 
anyone else to know if the Prime Minister will not tell us? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For this Liberal government, when it comes to a taxpayer funded 
institution, zero accountability is simply the order of the day. 
Why does one have to tell Canadians what one's ministers are 
doing, how they are spending their money, how they are using 
their budgets or how they are using their government credit 
cards? Is there any reason? I can think of only one.  Maybe they 
would like to know. Maybe they would like to be in a position to 
judge how the cabinet ministers of this highest government in the 
land are operating. Maybe they would simply like to know so that 
they could form some opinion.  Maybe they would like to hold them 
accountable. Is that not a strange concept? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The longer Canadians are in the dark about what this Liberal 
government is doing the better the government likes it.  That is 
just the order of the day.  I bet if they thought they could get 
away with it, the Liberals would pass a bill to make Canadians 
wear blindfolds and put in earplugs so that in addition to not 
knowing what the code of ethics was they could neither see nor 
hear what the government is doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the kind of thing we simply have to change in the House. 
This is what Reformers came to Ottawa to do.  This is why the 
Liberal Party of Canada and the Conservative Party of Canada and 
the New Democratic Party of Canada do not like Reformers, because 
we came here to break up the very comfortable country club they 
had here where they hear no evil, see no evil and speak no evil. 
Any of the evil going on is all within the country club members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We told them we did not want a membership to that country club 
and that is why they just despise our being here.  The more they 
despise us the better we like it because we know that we are 
getting to them.  We know that we are bringing things out in the 
public sector that people are beginning to get upset about and 
that really upsets the government, the Tories and the NDP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what we are trying to do once again with this motion, to 
force the Liberals to show us their ethics code.  Put it before 
the House for not only us to see but for all Canadians.  If they 
are so proud of it and if there really is one, let us have a look 
at it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So far the Liberals have been unwilling to fulfil this very 
basic and straightforward request.  We have asked them in the 
House. We have asked them in committees.  We have asked them at 
every possible opportunity.  The answer has always been no.  It 
is absolutely unbelievable and appalling for a supposedly 
democratic country having a supposedly democratic government 
within a supposedly democratic parliament that time and time 
again the government, which is the keeper of this code of ethics, 
has been asked to put it forward so we can see it and has simply 
said no. 
The Liberals never told us whether there really is one or not but 
they certainly have not been able to let us see if there is one. 
If there is one we could not see it anyway.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals have been demanding and we will continue to demand 
that the Prime Minister cough up the key to the drawer and show 
us and Canadians this so-called ethics code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, my colleagues and I have been calling in committee 
and in the House in question period for this ethics code.  It has 
not come.  Every time we have made a motion in the House it has 
been ruled out of order.  But not today, because this is a 
votable motion.  It is clearly written.  Even the Liberals can 
understand it and they are going to be forced to vote on it.  If 
they say no they will have to back to their ridings and tell 
their constituents why they voted against making public the code 
of ethics that the government is supposed to be operating by. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not envy Liberals in that task.  We are certainly treading 
on taboo ground when we request a code of ethics.  That is the 
ground we came here to Ottawa to shake up.  Now Reformers are 
demanding in parliament that the code be released at long last. 
What is different this time is we are all going to have a chance 
to vote on it.  Let us see them show their colours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government does not want taxpayers to know what is going 
on.  It does not want taxpayers to know all the dealings it does 
on a daily basis.  It does not want taxpayers to know what the 
ministers are doing and how the contracts are let and how hotels 
are sold in this country, how grants are handed out, how loans 
are given from government crown corporations. The Liberals do not 
want taxpayers to know that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want to know.  Whether it is the current government or 
our party after the next election, they want to know the 
guidelines the government operates on. If the government is not 
prepared to bring it forward we can bet after the election the 
Reform government will be prepared to bring it forward.  Is that 
not what democracy is all about? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know we all know about democracy and is that not what 
democracy is all about, being open and accountable to the 
citizens of your country?  Canadians are tired of being held in 
the dark.  They want and deserve to know what the government of 
the day is doing, especially considering some of the things that 
have gone on recently such as the APEC issue, the golf club, the 
hotel and the list goes on and on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the Liberal version of ethics? Why are Canadians not 
allowed to see the ethics code?  If Canadians know this much 
about what is going on with the government in APEC, the tainted 
blood, the anthrax vaccinations, the hotel sales, the golf course 
stuff, they must ask what else is going on that they do not know 
about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How are government members and especially cabinet ministers 
supposed to operating?  Are they not supposed to be telling us 
all this stuff?  Canadians are asking is this Liberal secrecy a 
sign of more funny business going on and is there more to come. 
How are Canadians to know?

<A HREF="#LINKT36"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real question is, how are Canadians to know they can trust 
this government if they do not know the guidelines and the proper 
conduct they are supposed to be operating under?  How are they 
ever to know?  We just have to look in the newspapers.  When it 
comes to ethics, it is most likely about Bill Clinton and the 
Olympic committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is this the kind of image that we as Canadians and 
parliamentarians want to show to the rest of the world?  I say 
not.  I say let us put a code of ethics front and centre so that 
when Canadians look at parliament, at this House of Commons, at 
the government and at the ministers, they can say they are proud 
because this country's politicians have a standard by which they 
operate and they like that standard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will they ever get that chance?  Never.  Not as long as this 
government is in power.  That is why we have to get rid of this 
government, which would be the most ethical thing the Reform 
Party could ever do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion is all about ethics, openness and transparency. 
This motion is simply asking the Liberals to present their ethics 
code.  That ethics code has to be backed up with an independent 
ethics commissioner who is answerable to parliament, not just the 
Prime Minister.  That is what is known as open government.  It is 
a basic political concept that the Liberals are going to have to 
learn because today Canadians expect and deserve open government. 
That is what they want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I challenge the Liberals, when it is time to vote on this 
motion, to stand and vote on behalf of their constituents.  If 
they do they will have no other choice than to vote yes for this 
motion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK181"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gar Knutson (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime Minister, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, let me say a few things in response to my 
hon. colleague, the member for Prince George—Bulkley Valley. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the hon. member said that we Liberals despise Reformers. 
I actually have a great deal of respect for this motion.  I think 
it is quite legitimate for the opposition to put the government's 
feet to the fire, as was said, about the whole issue of ethics, 
accountability and openness.  I commend the member for bringing 
this motion forward.  However, I do not agree with it. I will be 
quite happy to vote against it and I will be quite happy to 
explain to my constituents why I am going to vote against it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me make another point about Liberals generally despising the 
Reform Party.  We do not despise the Reform Party because we know 
that as long as the Reform Party exists we can look forward to 
governing for a long time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  You wait. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gar Knutson:</B>  Yes, I look forward to the next election 
and the election after that.  I say that in all humility and with 
the greatest amount of respect for the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud to be a member of a government which has made 
integrity a top priority.  All that my laughing colleagues in the 
opposition need to do is look at how this government is viewed by 
Canadians today and compare it with previous governments.  How 
many cabinet ministers have we had resign because of conflict of 
interest violations or ethical implications?  Zero.  We have a 
great record and that is why Canadians will re-elect us again and 
again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our promise about integrity goes back to the 1993 red book 
commitment to restore honesty and public trust to our political 
institutions and regain the confidence of Canadians in their 
government.  Canadians wanted a fundamentally different approach 
to politics than they had experienced in the nine years before 
this government took office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once elected, this government acted decisively to deliver on its 
commitment.  We have put in place many initiatives.  First, we 
introduced amendments to strengthen the Lobbyist Registration Act 
by increasing the transparency of lobbying activities and by 
giving the ethics counsellor the power to investigate complaints 
about lobbying.  All lobbyists now have to reveal more about 
their projects.  Not only must they disclose their fees, but they 
are prohibited from including contingency fees in their 
contracts.  There are also stiff penalties for lobbyists who do 
not adhere to the rules, up to and including prison sentences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the Prime Minister tabled a new conflict of interest 
code for public officeholders in the House on June 16, 1994. 
Perhaps hon. members opposite might take the time to read this 
very public document. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1305"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT38"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT38"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1305
<A HREF="#LINKT39"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT37"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The code is a public document and is available to the public. 
The code demonstrates that this government recognizes that 
restoring public trust involves strengthening the system from 
both the public office and lobbying side.  Cabinet ministers are 
bound by it.  All public officeholders are bound by it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The code sets out key principles that apply to all public 
officeholders:  ministers, secretaries of state, parliamentary 
secretaries, ministerial staff and full time governor in council 
appointees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians would be pleased to see that this code of conduct 
clarified old obligations and added new guidelines for government 
decision making.  It also requires that ministers, secretaries of 
state and parliamentary secretaries disclose the assets and the 
activities of their spouses and dependants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new code has clear rules and the government is committed to 
upholding them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure that all members would agree that we have a 
responsibility for maintaining the trust of Canadians in their 
political institutions.  As the Prime Minister said in the House 
in 1994, “Trust in the institutions of government is not a 
partisan issue, but something all of us elected to public office 
have an obligation to restore”.  We all have a responsibility to 
serve Canadians with integrity and to be accountable to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, a new ethics counsellor was appointed with 
responsibilities in two related areas, conflict of interest and 
lobbying.  This office administers the code of public 
officeholders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ethics counsellor investigates allegations against ministers 
and senior officials and reports his findings to the prime 
minister.  The ethics counsellor also provides guidance to 
lobbyists on their dealings with government and may investigate 
complaints about lobbying activities.  As hon. members will know, 
the ethics counsellor provides an annual report to parliament on 
matters related to lobbying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we promised in the red book, we have worked to restore trust 
and relevance to the House of Commons.  For example, members of 
parliament now have greater influence in the legislative process. 
This government has supported increasing the opportunity for 
policy debates in the House on issues such as peacekeeping, and 
MPs are engaged in the budget planning process before the budget 
is presented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also promised to change the pension plan for members of 
parliament to end double dipping, establish a minimum age for 
entitlement to benefits and cut the cost of the plan by 
one-third.  With all-party support, including my hon. friends in 
the Reform Party, changes were made last June to maintain the 
plan's fairness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have just mentioned that the government has already made the 
conflict of interest code public, and I would be happy to send 
hon. members a copy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The prime minister also provides personal advice, and just as 
cabinet deliberations are confidential, just as the advice that 
bureaucrats give to their ministers and the advice that 
bureaucrats give to the prime minister and the advice that 
ministers give to the prime minister is confidential, so too is 
the personal advice that the prime minister gives to his 
ministers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The prime minister provides personal advice on a wide range of 
government issues.  As such, this advice is protected from 
release under section 69 of the Access to Information Act as a 
cabinet confidence.  Some things in government need to be kept 
secret.  Those that do not should be made public, but some things 
need to be kept secret. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this regard, I would note that section 69 states that the 
Access to Information Act “does not apply to confidences of the 
Queen's Privy Council for Canada, including records used for 
reflecting communications or discussions between ministers of the 
crown on matters relating to the making of government decisions 
or the formulation of government policy”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand why the workings of cabinet would be foreign to 
members of the opposition as they have never been in cabinet and 
are not likely to be in cabinet for a very long time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in passing the Access to Information Act parliament 
decided that documents which constitute advice from the prime 
minister to his ministers would be protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take a moment to discuss the important principle 
of cabinet confidences with my hon. colleagues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The heart of the Canadian system of government centres around 
collective responsibility.  This means that the government is 
responsible to parliament and the government must maintain the 
confidence of the House in order to govern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But for ministers to fulfill their collective responsibility to 
parliament and Canadians they must be able to discuss their views 
frankly and fully. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1310"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT38"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Cabinet confidentiality allows ministers to debate issues openly 
among themselves and to concentrate on the objective of our 
system of government which is taking good policy decisions for 
the benefit of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I note that Canada shares with a number of other foreign 
jurisdictions, for example the United Kingdom, Australia and New 
Zealand, provisions similar to those in the Access to Information 
Act which protect cabinet confidences.  That is why the 
government has responded to Motion No. P-31 by stating “The 
information sought by the hon. member is considered a confidence 
of the Queen's Privy Council, and in keeping with Beauchesne's 
446(2)(i) and section 69 of the Access to Information Act, I 
would ask the hon. member to withdraw the motion”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, we are proud of our record on integrity in the 
government.  We have acted to deliver on our promises on 
integrity and ethics, just like we have acted to deliver on our 
promises on economic and social issues and national unity.  We 
have made integrity a cornerstone of our government.  That is one 
reason why Canadians chose to re-elect our government in 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister has already tabled a comprehensive conflict 
of interest code that applies to public office holders, including 
ministers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore call on all hon. members to oppose this motion. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK182"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, as the motion of my 
hon. colleague from Prince George—Bulkley Valley was read, I 
noted the potential for confusion, as he is calling upon the 
Governor General to cause the Government to lay before the House 
a copy of the Prime Minister's ethics code for ministers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to the conflict of interest and post-employment code 
for public officer holders, federal government ministers are 
subject to a code of ethics adopted in June 1994.  In addition 
to this code, federal government ministers are also governed by 
ministerial guidelines.  These guidelines are only partially 
known, because the Prime Minister has always refused to disclose 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of what the two previous speakers have had to say, we 
now understand that the motion refers to the Prime Minister's 
guidelines for his ministers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the wording of their motion which is being debated here in 
the House today, the Reform Party is calling for a copy of this 
ethics code to be tabled in the House. 
Given that the conflict of interest and post-employment code for 
public officer holders is already known, we understand, and I 
repeat, that they are referring instead to the guidelines for 
ministers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Reform members had been referring to the code I have just 
mentioned, their motion would, of course, have been pointless, 
since that document already exists.  Now we know this point has 
been settled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The guidelines for ministers set out a framework for ministerial 
conduct to ensure that they not only conduct themselves properly 
but are perceived to conduct themselves properly.  It is not 
enough for them to act correctly, but they must also appear to 
be acting correctly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two of these guidelines are now known to the public. 
One of these guidelines deals with conflicts of interest, while 
the other concerns relations with quasi-judicial tribunals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to conflicts of interest, the rule is simply that a 
minister who believes he may be in a conflict of interest or may 
find himself in one in the future must phone the ethics 
counsellor to let him know. That is what we know about this 
first guideline given by the Prime Minister to his ministers. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1315"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT40"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT40"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1315

<A HREF="#LINKT39"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the second guideline, it concerns relations with 
quasi-judicial tribunals. Here is what the <I>Globe and Mail</I> of 
October 10, 1996, had to say on this issue: 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“Basic Principle.  Ministers shall not intervene or appear to 
intervene on behalf of any person or entity with federal 
quasi-judicial tribunals or any matter before them that requires 
a decision in their quasi-judicial capacity unless otherwise 
authorized by law”. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We realize that ministers must not interfere in any way in 
proceedings or with the quasi-judicial tribunals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This guideline extends to ministerial staff as well. It is also 
a practice that ministers and their political staff must go 
through the appropriate ministerial office rather than deal 
directly with the officials of another department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, many criticisms and comments may be made about these 
guidelines for the ministers. Here are a few. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the guidelines should be made public immediately, because 
it is a matter of public interest. The government must be 
transparent. 
And if guidelines on the ministers' integrity are in effect, 
hiding them totally defeats the purpose of such guidelines, 
which is to establish a trust relationship between the 
government and the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These guidelines are seriously flawed from a democratic point of 
view, given that they were established in 1994 by the Prime 
Minister and that no one, not even the duly elected 
representatives in this House, has yet been able to discuss them 
in a fully informed manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, the trust relationship between the government and the 
public is further weakened because we know that, in the case of 
a conflict of interest, the only known directive is, for a 
minister, to report to the ethics commissioner, Howard Wilson. 
Does this mean that a minister could report to the commissioner 
and the conflict of interest be settled without the public 
knowing about it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly, given the lack of transparency concerning these 
guidelines, are we to understand that a minister who is at fault 
for whatever reason is ultimately judged only by the Prime 
Minister, who then becomes both judge and jury? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister is not prepared to release these guidelines. 
It is as though he is telling himself “I will decide whether I 
should demand that my guidelines be complied with, or whether I 
will tolerate that a minister does not comply with them. And 
since no one else will know what happened, it will be easier for 
me to decide if it is appropriate or not to implement my 
guidelines, to be more or less tolerant, to cover a mistake made 
by a minister or a senior public servant that could be 
embarrassing for the government, or to say nothing about it”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister retains this prerogative, whereas if the 
guidelines were known, public, any member of the House of 
Commons could say “Prime Minister, here is a case where a 
minister did not follow your guidelines.  What are you going to 
do?  Will you explain these rules?  What are the consequences?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this point, the Prime Minister would be obliged to provide an 
accounting. He would be obliged to tell the House why he did not 
apply his own directives.  Transparency in such cases is vital. 
It is like the first principle, which states “It is not enough 
not to be in conflict of interest, there must also appear to be 
no conflict of interest”.

<A HREF="#LINKT40"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This same reasoning works with the application of the Prime 
Minister's directives with his ministers.  It is not enough for 
the Prime Minister to apply these directives and have them 
followed by his ministers, there must be the appearance that 
these directives are being followed.  The only way for these 
guidelines to appear to be applied fairly is for them to be made 
public and the other members to be able to judge, discuss and 
see how the Prime Minister uses this instrument of justice and 
fairness for all members of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois will support this motion, because it is an 
instrument of democracy. As we are in favour of transparency and 
of furthering democracy, we will support this motion with 
pleasure. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK183"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
very pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this motion. 
Like some of my colleagues, I was a bit confused with the motion 
when I read it because it reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That a humble address be presented to His Excellency praying that 
he will cause to be laid before this House a copy of the Prime 
Minister's ethics code for ministers. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The code I have seen is a conflict of interest and 
post-employment code for public office holders.  This was 
produced in June 1994.  This document is available. If we are 
talking about that, I do not see a need to have it laid before 
the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I gather from the discussion and from the comments being made 
that one is looking for more than this document.  One is looking 
for perhaps guidelines or directives that may have been issued by 
the Prime Minister specifically and apart from this document. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will address my remarks to the document since I do not have 
anything else before me in terms of any other document. This 
document has some good points in it but there is a serious 
problem with it.  The preamble talks about ethical standards, 
public scrutiny, decision making and a lot of very important 
issues for our democratic society. For example, under ethical 
standards it talks about how public office holders shall act with 
honesty and uphold the highest ethical standards so that public 
confidence and trust in the integrity of the activity and 
impartiality of government are conserved and enhanced.  No one 
would disagree with that.  It is a very important principle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The difficulty with this document is the manner by which it goes 
about to enforce this code and to try to follow up on the 
principles stated in this code.  It appoints an ethics 
counsellor.  There is nothing wrong with appointing an ethics 
counsellor, but the difficulty is that when we real about the 
ethics counsellor it states that under the general direction of 
the clerk of the privy council the ethics counsellor is charged 
with the administration of this code and the application of the 
conflict of interest compliance measures set out in this part as 
they apply to public office holders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not put the ethics counsellor in an independent 
position.  The ethics counsellor in essence ends up reporting to 
the Prime Minister in secret, and that is wrong for our 
democratic system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things that is very important is openness and 
accountability to the public if we are to carry on the functions 
we are elected to on behalf of the public.  It is very important 
that if there is any code of ethics set up or any kind of code of 
conduct that there be an independent ethics counsellor, someone 
who is accountable to parliament, to the elected representatives 
of the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is very important. If we read further in this code we see 
where it talks about compliance arrangements. It states 
arrangements being made by public office holders to comply with 
the conflict of interest compliance measures set out in this 
part. They shall be approved in the case of ministers of the 
crown by the Prime Minister and in the case of all other public 
office holders by the ethics counsellor.  We see that the 
ministers of the crown are above this scrutiny by the ethics 
counsellor.   In terms of this kind of accountability, they 
account only to their boss, the Prime Minister.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is something that is really deplorable when talking about 
openness and integrity for government.  There was a release on 
June 16, 1994 by the Prime Minister, announcing the appointment 
of the first ethics counsellor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It sounds quite admirable when listening to the words: “The 
Prime Minister today appointed Howard Wilson as Canada's first 
ethics counsellor.  The Prime Minister also announced a 
comprehensive package of measures to help promote public trust in 
national institutions including tough new restrictions on 
lobbying”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet we see a lot of the lobbying that takes place and we see a 
lot of things happening that cause us to wonder exactly what kind 
of accountability there is in the government structure and who 
can scrutinize when things go wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We look at the APEC affair and what happened there.  We see that 
the Prime Minister does not want to be held accountable for any 
role he may have played in that incident.  We have seen various 
other incidents of things happening right across the country 
where people have called out for accountability and always it 
comes right back to the Prime Minister, but there is no 
independent body looking at the activities of what is taking 
place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One very important principle of being an internal or external 
investigator, or external complaint handler, is independence.  As 
a former ombudsman this is a principle that we as ombudsmen held 
very dearly, the idea that we must be independent of the system 
and must be able to report independently.  The findings should be 
objective, clear and when the report is made it should be made in 
a manner that people know they have had a fair hearing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly if someone has a complaint against a minister and 
feels the minister is not operating in accordance with proper 
ethics that person will not be comforted by the Prime Minister 
saying it's okay.  They might have more confidence if an 
independent ethics counsellor were to review the matter and 
report independently to parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that independence be there in a very real and 
meaningful way.  Another section of the code talks about various 
permissible activities under the code. Where the Prime Minister 
or a person designated by the Prime Minister is of the opinion 
that it is in the public interest, full time governor in council 
appointees to crown corporations, as defined in the Financial 
Administration Act, may retain or accept directorships or offices 
in a financial or commercial operation and accept remuneration 
therefore in accordance with the compensation policies for 
governor in council appointees as determined from time to time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, the Prime Minister can decide that his friends or whoever 
can have directorships in these corporations while they are still 
carrying on public duties which may or may not conflict. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a need to really go through this code, to see what it 
says and to see where the ultimate responsibility lies. The 
biggest problem with this code is that there is no real 
independent method to enforce it or to ensure that the noble 
values outlined in it are properly protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another example of the same sort of thing comes from the 
military.  We recently saw a military ombudsman appointed, but 
who is that person accountable to? The ombudsman is certainly not 
independent. That person is accountable to the minister.  How can 
someone objectively review and make recommendations if that 
person is accountable to the minister responsible for the exact 
organization that is being investigated? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government is serious about accountability it would know 
that if something is being done right there is nothing wrong with 
scrutinizing it.  Far too often we do our public servants a 
disservice by hiding things, by saying we cannot give this 
information, that it is secret and confidential.  Far too often 
we do a disservice because if the information is given quite 
often it clarifies what is being done, why it is being done and a 
reasonable person will accept and understand that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is one of the biggest things we found in the ombudsman 
business.  A lot of the complaints from the public were because 
people did not know what was being done.  When an impartial 
investigation revealed what was being done quite often members of 
the public were willing to accept that the government had done 
right once it was clarified. 
It is this fear of the unknown that people are concerned about. 
Because there is not openness and accountability it leads to 
problems.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not dwell much longer on this code because it is in need 
of severe fixing.  I see I only have one minute remaining and I 
cannot fix it in one minute.  The biggest point is that there 
must be an independent ethics counsellor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate the spirit of the motion and would certainly 
support it because it intends to get at the secrecy of the 
government and the fact that it will not hold itself accountable 
in a very real and meaningful way.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique—Mactaquac, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to speak in favour of the motion for the production 
of papers, sponsored by the member for Prince George—Bulkley 
Valley. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As has been mentioned previously, the Motion No. P-31 reads as 
follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That a humble Address be presented to His Excellency praying that 
he will cause to be laid before this House a copy of the Prime 
Minister's ethics code for ministers. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be remiss in commenting on the motion without quoting 
from a great work of fiction called <I>Creating Opportunity: The 
Liberal Plan For Canada</I>.  The Liberal's red book in the 1993 
election stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A Liberal government will appoint an ethics counsellor to advise 
both public officials and lobbyists in the day-to-day application 
of the code of conduct for public officials.  The ethics 
counsellor will be appointed after consultation with the leaders 
of all parties in the House of Commons and will report directly 
to Parliament. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government in fact appointed an ethics counsellor 
back in June 1994.  Howard Wilson was assigned to take the job 
but his office was not independent.  It was not developed in 
consultation with the other political parties.  It was not 
legislated as accountable to parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the ethics counsellor reports to parliament on matters 
related to lobbying, he reports to one and only one person on 
matters related to ethics, the Prime Minister of Canada.  The 
Prime Minister makes the decisions about the enforcement of 
ethics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question then arises, if the Prime Minister is the final 
judge of the ethics of his cabinet ministers, who judges the 
Prime Minister's ethics?  That is why we need to have full 
transparency with respect to government ethics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. P-31 is extremely timely in light of the efforts put 
forward by my caucus colleague from Markham to get answers from 
the Prime Minister in the Yvon Duhaime affair.  I would like to 
review the troubling revelations that have recently come to 
light. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In April 1993 Les Entreprises Yvon Duhaime purchased the 
inventory, furnishings and ongoing business of the Auberge 
Grand-Mère located in the Prime Minister's riding of 
Saint-Maurice from 161341 Canada Inc.  At the time the opposition 
leader of the day, now the Prime Minister, held a 25% stake in 
the numbered company. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In September 1997 Duhaime's company received a $615,000 loan 
from the Business Development Bank of Canada Tourism Investment 
Fund.  At the same time he also received a $50,000 loan from the 
Canada Economic Development Fund for the Quebec regions.  These 
loans were to be applied to a 24 room addition to the hotel.  The 
expansion plans were expected to total $1.2 million.  Duhaime 
said he discussed the proposed expansion with Chrétien's special 
riding representative and was told where to apply— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  The hon. member knows 
that he must not refer to other members of the House by name; 
only by title or by the name of the member's constituency.  I 
know he will want to follow the rules in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Bernier:</B>  I am sorry, Mr. Speaker.  Duhaime 
added that the location of the inn in the Prime Minister's 
Saint-Maurice riding undoubtedly helped him to get the loans for 
the expansion and get them fast.  He further claimed that he 
applied for federal loans after his local caisse populaire credit 
union even declined to finance the expansion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Duhaime's company already had a heavy debtload from building a 
previous addition to the hotel that included a large banquet 
hall.

<A HREF="#LINKT43"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The money flow from the Prime Minister's former property did not 
stop with Industry Canada or Canada Economic Development. 
According to internal Human Resources Development documents 
Duhaime also received $188,799 from five grant programs during 
the 1997-98 fiscal year.  These grants included $164,000 from the 
transitional jobs fund program, $10,350 from local labour market 
partnerships, $9,293 from youth internships, $4,356 from the 
targeted wage subsidies program and $800 from summer career 
placements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who is Yvon Duhaime and what qualified his company to obtain so 
much cash?  He failed to follow the Business Development Bank 
rules by not disclosing some of his personal records on the BDC's 
application form which clearly states that applicants list 
information about those same personal records on which his 
application could have been denied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not saying that we should not forgive those who have made 
mistakes in the past.  I am not saying that they should be 
excluded from government programs to which they are legitimately 
entitled.  However Duhaime's past problems certainly point to 
someone less than credible in seeking financial support.  Duhaime 
has since claimed the expansion to be a profitable success. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From my own professional experience I know how useful it is to 
check with contractors to determine a project's success.  One 
local contractor on the Auberge Grand-Mere expansion filed a 
business lien against the property in July 1998, claiming that he 
was owed $172,000 by Duhaime's company for work completed in the 
spring of 1998.  While Duhaime has since reduced the debt to 
$47,953, according to recent land registry documents the 
contractor filed legal notice on January 7, 1999.  The contractor 
states that if he is not paid within 60 days he will ask the 
sheriff to seize the Auberge Grand-Mere property and to sell it 
at an auction to recover his own debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Duhaime, a man who does not follow application requirements, 
is assisted by the Prime Minister's riding office and then gets 
over $840,000 in loans and grants.  Will the Prime Minister 
answer questions on this matter?  No, he will not.  Can the 
ethics counsellor investigate?  Yes, he can but he reports in 
secret to the very person he potentially investigates.  This must 
change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thankfully my colleague from Markham was successful yesterday in 
getting the industry committee to summon the ethics counsellor 
for questioning.  He did so after much difficulty from the 
government members and indifference from Reform, NDP and Bloc 
members.  We should not have to fight tooth and nail to get 
information from the ethics counsellor.  He should be an 
independent officer of parliament, accountable to all.  He should 
have a public code of ethics for the Prime Minister and all 
cabinet ministers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the Progressive Conservative caucus I support 
Motion No. P-31 and I urge all hon. member to do likewise. 
<P><A NAME="LINK185"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I was alarmed to note that the first speaker on the 
government side deliberately tried to mislead the House and 
confuse the issue in that he claimed that they had a code of 
ethics.  We were not talking about the general code of ethics and 
government members know that.  We are talking about a public code 
of ethics and we are asking for a copy of the ethics code which 
the Prime Minister has for his ministers.  It is two different 
things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me put it this way.  Every speaker on this side of the House 
knows full well the difference.  They have stated so.  When 
ethics counsellor Howard Wilson reports, he reports only to the 
Prime Minister. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1340"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT44"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That reporting is in secret.  That is exactly the thing the 
Reform Party is trying to clear up before not only this House but 
this nation.  Canadians deserve an independent ethics counsellor 
accountable to parliament and who will operate under the 
authority of a public ethics code.  That is what my hon. friend 
from Prince George has in his motion.  That is what Canadians 
want.  That is what we will be voting on.  I fail to see how the 
party opposite can continue to confuse a very simple issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a copy of the Ottawa <I>Sun</I> which states that the 
auditor general says that the defence department is blocking his 
bid to investigate buying practices.  It goes on to say that 
almost a year after tabling detailed department questionable 
equipment purchasing practices the auditor general told the 
Commons defence committee that he is still being stonewalled.  By 
whom?  None other than the defence minister, a member of cabinet. 
That is the real guts of this motion. This is what Canadians 
want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The private sector, the banks, the businesses, the major 
industries all pride themselves on having ethics codes.  But not 
this government.  When it comes to taxpayer funded institutions 
such as the House of Commons, what do we get?  Stonewalling. This 
is zero accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the life of this parliament we have seen what is happening. 
Look at the APEC inquiry to judge the actions of the RCMP.  What 
does the government do?  It orders in a whole troop of lawyers. 
The government is not being investigated. When the students want 
lawyers, no way. That in itself is a real conflict.  Canadians 
are seeing it as a conflict. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a growing trend.  The last survey that I saw on the 
accountability of government listed professions that are 
respected the least. Who topped the list?  Members of parliament. 
Who came a close second?  Lawyers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked a group of grade 11 students to write down what was the 
most common thing they had heard or what they thought about the 
House of Commons.  The leading comment was that they were a bunch 
of crooks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I know the member can go on and he 
will have that opportunity.  The next time this matter comes up 
for debate he will five minutes remaining in the time for his 
remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The time provided for the consideration of Private Members' 
Business has now expired and the order is dropped to the bottom 
of the order of precedence on the order paper. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It being 1.45 p.m., this House stands adjourned until next 
Monday at 11 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24(1). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(The House adjourned at 1.43 p.m.)
