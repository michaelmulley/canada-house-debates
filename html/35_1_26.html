	<B>The Speaker:</B> Today, as I speak, over a million of our fellow 
Canadian citizens are watching these proceedings. In that we 
have been attempting since 1920 to change the format of our 
prayer a bit, I thought perhaps today we could agree to share in 
public with our fellow Canadian citizens what we do in private.
<P>
	With your permission, colleagues, I am going to read the 
prayers in both English and French. Then I would ask you to 
observe a moment of quiet meditation, to pray in your own 
personal way or simply to think of what you will. Is there 
agreement?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Almighty God, we give thanks for the great 
blessings which have been bestowed on Canada and its citizens, 
including the gifts of freedom, opportunity and peace that we 
enjoy. We pray for our Sovereign, Queen Elizabeth, and the 
Governor General. Guide us in our deliberations as members of 
Parliament, and strengthen us in our awareness of our duties and 
responsibilities as members. Grant us wisdom, knowledge, and 
understanding to preserve the blessings of this country for the 
benefit of all and to make good laws and wise decisions.

grâces que tu as accordées au Canada et à ses citoyens, dont la 
liberté, les possibilités d'épanouissement et la paix. Nous te 
prions pour notre Souveraine, la Reine Élizabeth, et le 
Gouverneur général. Guide-nous dans nos délibérations à titre 
de députés et aide-nous à bien prendre conscience de nos 
devoirs et responsabilités. Accordons-nous la sagesse, les 
connaissances et la compréhension qui nous permettrons de 
préserver les faveurs dont jouit notre pays afin que tous puissent 
en profiter, ainsi que de faire de bonnes lois et prendre de sages 
décisions.

	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest) moved</B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should consider the 
advisability of amending the Standing Orders to put in place a procedure 
whereby, at least once during a session, petitions presented during that session are 
considered by the elected representatives of Canadians, and may be the subject 
matter of debate and brought to a vote at the end of the debate, such as for 
example:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a) the subject matter of the petition prohibiting the importation, distribution, 
sale and manufacture of ``serial killer cards'',</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(b) the subject matter of the petition requesting changes to the Young Offenders Act 
to make it more difficult for dangerous young offenders to be released, such as the 
petition presented in memory of the late Rosalynn Dupuis, and</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(c) a petition which will be presented requesting the government to bring forward a 
bill which would make recall of members of the House of Commons a part of the law.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, it is with a great deal of pleasure that I 
rise on this very historic day. As the viewers have seen and as we 
in the House have experienced, this is the first change to our 
prayers in almost 120 years. This would indicate to all of us that 
while things may change slowly they can and they do indeed 
change.
<P>
<B>D (1110 ) </B>
<P>
	I am very pleased to speak to the motion. As I speak today and 
as we consider the motion we should think of the underlying 
philosophy upon which it is based. It is part of a greater ideal of 
ensuring Canadians a continuing role or place in the debates of 
the nation through the use of working toward more direct 
democracy and the participation of citizens in the national 
political life of our nation.
<P>
	The right of citizens to be heard and the right of citizens to be 
recognized and to receive action are fundamental to any nation 
or any parliament that wishes to strengthen its democratic 
conditions.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<><B><A NAME="1582"><A HREF="DOCNAME#1582">1582</A></A></B>
<P>
	Petitions are an effective means of providing Canadians a 
greater role in setting the national agenda. The use of petitions is 
one of the oldest forms of allowing citizens a form of redress, 
dating back to the days of King Edward in the 13th century. It is 
through the presentation of petitions that the introduction of 
legislation by bills came about. Petitions are the planted seed 
from which our parliamentary traditions sprouted. Therefore 
their significance should not be ignored.
<P>
	I am not the first person to stand in the House in recent years 
to speak to the veracity of petitions. I will quote from <I>Hansard</I>, 
June 1, 1983. Stan Schellenberger, the member for Wetaskiwin 
at the time, presented a private member's bill. In support of that 
bill he said the following:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The practice of putting petitions to a legislative body is not new. It has been 
happening for hundreds of years. We have brought from the mother Parliament in 
Great Britain to this institution the practice of presenting petitions to Parliament. 
From the beginning, the presentation of petitions was allowed by Parliament as a 
means for ordinary citizens to bring their grievance to the attention of the House 
of Commons.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It is a method by which ordinary citizens can bring their 
grievances, concerns and issues to the House of Commons, to 
the Parliament of Canada. It is not just a safety valve that we can 
accept petitions, many with thousands of signatures and many 
with hundreds of thousands of signatures, reject them and then 
forget them. It is not just a means of allowing the citizens to let 
off steam so they do not explode. It is a means whereby the 
citizens of the country are able to establish a direct link with 
members of Parliament on an issue by issue, day to day basis.
<P>
	I have a further quote from Mr. Schellenberger as reported in 
the same 1983 edition of <I>Hansard</I>:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-it is only in recent years that nothing has happened to petitions. Petitions 
are brought to the House by a Member of Parliament, are read to the Speaker and 
the Clerk who then deal with those petitions, and the next day they are either 
found to be in order or not. They then disappear in a room somewhere in the 
House of Commons.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	They are never to be seen again. He continued:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That is not entirely the case, but it is pretty close.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This was 10 years ago when another member of the House was 
speaking to petitions. This matter has come and gone and come 
and gone. The reason we are addressing it today is that we hope 
Parliament, with a new and fresh face, will pay much more 
attention to the fact that petitions are a meaningful exercise by 
which citizens participate in the democratic traditions of the 
country. He continued:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>For example, on the issue of capital punishment, many citizens of our nation 
believe this institution is not representing the wishes of the majority of the 
nation-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Regardless of whether we believe in capital punishment 
individually, do our laws represent the will of the nation? He 
went on:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-and their only means of bringing that to the attention of the House is through 
the presentation of petitions or Private Members' Bills. Neither of these two 
methods has been very successful in bringing about a change in the past, but at 
least the opportunity is there to bring a grievance forward.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I draw the attention of members to the fact that in 1981 Stan 
Schellenberger brought forward a private member's bill on 
petitions. We do have a fair amount of the groundwork already 
done.
<P>
<B>D (1115) </B>
<P>
	In petitions we are talking about a much broader issue, of 
whether democracy is chained to tradition or whether it is 
anchored securely to the past or whether it is a living, breathing 
ideal that adapts to the changing times.
<P>
	Very often whenever the concept of recall or a citizen's 
initiative or a referendum passes anyone's lips the retort that is 
heard is always Edmund Burke and his famous letter to the 
voters of Bristol. It is always said that members are elected to 
serve their constituents and if they do not like the way the 
member serves them, they can turf him or her out at the end of 
the session. In fact after Edmund Burke wrote that famous letter 
to the voters of Bristol in 1779, in the subsequent general 
election he was turfed.
<P>
	His letter was in response to his constituents because they 
believed that the captured American revolutionary sailors were 
pirates. They would be brought to England and after about three 
years or so given a fair trial and hanged. He did not think this 
was right. Edmund Burke's position was that the American 
sailors should be treated as prisoners of war, tried by their peers 
and given a swift and fair trial under British tradition.
<P>
	His compatriot at the time, Thomas Payne, broke with 
Edmund Burke on the basic philosophy that Edmund Burke was 
chained to tradition and to the past and he had made a virtue out 
of the fact that he was pledging himself in perpetuity in fidelity 
to the crown, to the Magna Carta, and that because the crown had 
given rights to the people, and in turn had pledged certain 
requirements to the crown, that these would follow through 
forever. Therefore Edmund Burke's understanding of 
democracy is built purely on tradition.
<P>
	Thomas Payne was a contemporary of Thomas Jefferson and 
advised him in drafting the American declarations. His 
contention was that democracy lives and breathes in changes. In 
his book <I>The Rights of Man</I>, he wrote words to this effect: Every 
generation has the right and the responsibility to govern for its 
time and should not chain future generations to decisions of 
<P>
<HR>
<><B><A NAME="1583"><A HREF="DOCNAME#1583">1583</A></A></B>
<P>
today than past generations have the right to chain today's 
generation to their decisions.
<P>
	It is a very important consideration. He also wrote the phrase 
that many people will recognize: ``The greatest tyranny of all is 
the presumption of ruling beyond the grave''. When we talk 
about how we should change or should we change the way our 
Parliament works, the way we as a Parliament relate to the 
citizens of Canada, and whether empowering citizens is a good 
thing or a bad thing, it depends whether we have confidence in 
the choice that our voters made in getting us here in the first 
place.
<P>
	We have to understand that we are not in 16th century or 12th 
century Britain. We live in a completely different world. We can 
focus the attention of every single person in this country on a 
single instance. Everybody understands now. Everybody can 
remember what they were doing at great moments in our history.
<P>
	The example that always comes up is Ben Johnson. Everyone 
remembers when he won the hundred yard dash. Everybody in 
the country knew about it and was aware of it. If this were 16th 
century Europe it might take 30 years for the information to get 
around, but we knew it all around the world at the same instant in 
time.
<P>
	We have to allow our democratic traditions to evolve and to 
change so they reflect the way communication works. We have a 
citizenry that is far more aware of what is going on and far more 
capable of being a part in providing a valid role in the daily 
organization and governance of our country. That is why 
petitions should be given the honour and diligence they deserve. 
Petitions are a constitutional right of Canadians and are an 
effective means, in principle, of putting forward concerns, 
opinions and perceived problems.
<P>
<B>D (1120) </B>
<P>
	Although Canadians may use petitions as a means of putting 
their thoughts forward to Parliament, the use of petitions by 
citizens is in decline. The reasons should be examined. If the use 
of petitions is in decline, why do members suppose that is? It has 
to be because people do not believe it makes any difference. If a 
group circulates a petition until it gets a million signatures on it, 
if they work day and night, spend untold hours at it, it comes in 
here, is read to the House and then disappears, does that not feed 
the cynicism that all parliamentarians feel the citizens in 
common hold toward the institution of government?
<P>
	If we are to build this bridge, this strength and this tie between 
the people who must go through some pretty difficult times 
because we are eventually going to have to live within our 
means, then the leadership to do so has to come from this House. 
It has to come from the fact that we as members of Parliament 
honour, respect and pay attention to the citizens of Canada 
whether we agree with what they say or not.
<P>
	The voters whom we represent expect us to use our wisdom 
and our intelligence but they do not expect it to be a one way 
street. They expect it to be a two way street. They do not expect 
every single issue that comes before  the people to be referred to 
referendum or to petition but they do expect us to listen and to 
pay attention to whatever they have to say and not just at 
election time.
<P>
	Not everything we do or say can be envisioned ahead of time. 
However, we must give members credit, a lot of it is in the red 
book. But there are a lot of things that the government did not 
envision. It had no way of knowing they would have happened, 
could not have prepared for it so it could not be part of the 
mandate that gets any of us elected into the House. Therefore we 
have to be prepared between elections to listen and respond to 
what our citizens have to say.
<P>
	The decline or the apathy in the use of petitions by Canadians 
is a symptom of a much bigger problem. It is the neglect of 
petitions by elected representatives. It is a microcosm of the 
alienation electors feel toward the political system.
<P>
	At times between elections issues arise that were not dealt 
with during the campaign, as I said a little earlier. It is during 
these periods that citizens need the ability to put forward their 
opinions to the government. Democracy needs to be a two way 
street and petitions allow this exchange to take place with great 
effect.
<P>
	Although in principle petitions seem a valuable way for 
Canadians to address their government and an effective means 
for government to gauge the mood of the nation, petitions have 
been pushed aside in recent years, their value left untapped. 
Therefore we cannot blame Canadians for becoming cynical 
with government when every time, time after time, they see their 
protests ignored. The neglect of petitions by legislatures leaves 
a bitter taste in the mouths of all those who demand a bigger 
stake in the democratic process. The formulation of a petition is 
guided by many rules and procedures and it is a painstaking 
process for organizers.
<P>
	We have received a petition with well over a million 
signatures. Imagine the amount of effort that has to go into it and 
it should not be taken lightly. The fact that the government is 
able to dismiss a petition regardless of the number of signatures 
or the importance of the issue with a blanket response is really a 
slap in the face for both the signators and for democracy.
<P>
	Governments must recognize what a great tool a petition can 
be as a means of putting forward effective legislation. By the use 
of some very simple procedural reform pertaining to petitions, 
governments will be able to effectively gauge the thoughts of 
citizens as well as allowing them a way to become involved in 
national issues.
<P>
	For instance, issues such as abortion, capital punishment, et 
cetera have all been addressed by one petition or another. If the 
government were not so quick to dismiss the thoughts of 
citizens, it could use these petitions as a springboard from which 
to develop policy. If Canadians are to go to all the trouble of 
<P>
<HR>
<><B><A NAME="1584"><A HREF="DOCNAME#1584">1584</A></A></B>
<P>
formulating a petition it is most likely a reflection of an attitude 
present in the nation on a particular issue. For instance, in 1975  
a petition on abortion was presented to the House. This petition 
had over a million signatures. Recently we received a petition 
concerning the Young Offenders Act, most likely the largest 
petition ever brought to the House. It does not matter how big it 
was or how many people got involved in putting it together, it 
was dismissed with little or no effect, even though it perhaps 
recognized the attitude of the great majority of Canadians.
<P>
<B>D (1125) </B>
<P>
	Petitions therefore could be and should be used as a tool of 
democracy. Petitions would tie the government closer to 
national attitudes and bring individual members, all of us, closer 
to our constituents. More important, it would allow Canadians 
as individuals back into the decision making process of their 
nation.
<P>
	I stand here today confident that these small, simple 
procedural reforms to the use of petitions could become that 
very tool. There are many means by which the petition could be 
made more relevant. We would have to consider which petitions 
carry a particular weight because obviously not all petitions 
have the same substance. Petitions that do carry significant 
weight either because the same issue is presented over and over 
again or because one petition has an overwhelming number of 
signatures, must be considered and recognized in deciding what 
happens to them.
<P>
	We can make a couple of procedural changes. I would draw 
the attention of members to the private members' bill that was 
introduced, Bill C-642 in 1980-81, for more definite attitudes 
and things that could be changed. One thing we might do is move 
that petitions, after being read in the House, be given to the 
pertinent committee for discussion and its merits reported back 
to Parliament. I recognize that the House procedures committee 
will be looking at petitions as part of a greater analysis.
<P>
	Another possibility would be to allow petitions to be debated 
in the House. The government and each opposition party could 
then use a supply day to debate the petition. We know that if a 
petition came to the House we could use a supply day and could 
debate the petition. That is what we are doing right now where 
we have the opportunity to bring forward what is on our mind.
<P>
	Unless we have the vehicle in place to ensure that the 
government does something about petitions then nothing is 
going to happen. We have to bring this forward in a fashion that 
brings all members of Parliament on side, recognizing the need 
to evolve our Parliament into a situation where it is not just the 
opposition saying we should pay attention to this. It has to be all 
of us, opposition and government together asking how we can 
make this institution work better?''
<P>
	I understand at present the government is required to respond 
to a petition within 45 days. However, nothing states that the 
response has to be anything more than just a blanket statement 
with perhaps little relevance to the petition. It is in essence 
merely an acknowledgement that the petition was received.
<P>
	At the very least there should be some mechanism in place to 
keep track of petitions that have been presented in the House in 
each session, the number of signatures and the topic of the 
petition. This clearing house would provide an effective way for 
legislators to keep abreast of the mood of the nation as well as 
providing a filing system to ensure that records are kept so that 
we can see if one particular issue comes up day after day after 
day.
<P>
	Some people worry that petitions may be a way of allowing 
special interest groups easy access to the political process. 
However, I would argue that special interests have already 
kidnapped the national agenda and that some use of direct 
democracy is necessary to offset that and bring the majority of 
Canadians back into the game by allowing the majority of 
citizens a means of expressing their grievances and the 
knowledge that they will be addressed. I am encouraged that the 
Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs is 
considering discussion of direct democracy issues, including 
petitions.
<P>
<B>D (1130) </B>
<P>
	It is imperative that Parliament listens to citizens and that all 
citizens know Parliament cares about what they have to say.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have a brief comment and question for the hon. member. He 
mentioned toward the end of his speech that special interest 
groups had kidnapped the national agenda. The word kidnapped 
of course is pejorative and connotes a very negative meaning.
<P>
	I would like to ask the member who these special interest 
groups are that he had in mind, that have kidnapped the national 
agenda in a negative way.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Mr. Speaker, I take the comments of the 
hon. member under advisement. I had some difficulty with that 
word. I thought I should not use it because perhaps it was 
pejorative and did reflect something I did not wish to bring into 
this debate.
<P>
	The fact that special interest groups have had a tremendous 
impact on the affairs of the nation goes without saying, but not 
in this Parliament thus far. However, we know in the past 10 
years there has been a tremendous amount of special interest 
group politics in our land. Everyone who has a grievance or an 
ox to be gored is up front and centre. As members of Parliament 
<P>
<HR>
<><B><A NAME="1585"><A HREF="DOCNAME#1585">1585</A></A></B>
<P>
when we open our mail we open a big stack of special interest 
group information every single day.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Petitions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> An hon. member said they are petitions. He 
is right. They are petitions of a kind but they are not the kind of 
petitions we are talking about.
<P>
	They are organized people who have the resources to be able 
to influence the decision making process of this House. It is 
either because they can hire some Ottawa lobbyist or because 
they have that ability within their own organization and they 
know how to turn the wheel, or put a little grease on it.
<P>
	The vast majority of Canadians do not have access to these 
organized means of representation. The vast majority of 
Canadians are individuals who may be sitting around having a 
cup of coffee saying: ``I am really choked about this. I have had 
it up to here. What can I do about it?'' A decision is then made to 
start a petition.
<P>
	What happens? They start a petition which might be big or 
small. Their idea might be fantastic but it is not treated with the 
dignity it should have when it gets to this House. That is what we 
are talking about.
<P>
	I accept the member's position with regard to the use of the 
word kidnapping. It was a word I probably should not have used.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the member on the 
initiative of discussing the whole process of petitions.
<P>
	The idea of creating more awareness about the process of 
petitions is useful but I would have to challenge him when he 
states that these petitions are presented in Parliament and are not 
seen after that. The fact is that all of these petitions are answered 
individually and there is further opportunity for those petitions 
to have greater impact even beyond their presentation in this 
House.
<P>
	If members of Parliament are seized with a particular idea 
they could present it in a private member's bill. The hon. 
member mentioned the Young Offenders Act. Last Friday the 
hon. member for York South-Weston on the government side 
put forward amendments to the Young Offenders Act. Therefore 
I think the hon. member is short changing the process.
<P>
	The hon. member also mentioned that not all petitions carried 
the same weight. If we want to continue on the hon. member's 
theme of direct democracy I suggest to him that all petitions 
should carry the same weight. We should not discriminate. If 
someone is committed about an issue to the point of forming a 
petition and requesting a member of Parliament to present it, 
then we should not separate petitions. It is our responsibility to 
place all of them on the floor of this House and members can 
react as they choose.
<P>
<B>D (1135) </B>
<P>
	I am a little more optimistic about the petition process. I have 
seen many things occur through this process although I was 
sceptical during my first year as a member of Parliament. For 
example one issue I pursued vigorously in the last Parliament 
concerned violence against women and children. Because a 
number of petitions were presented other members became 
interested and, therefore, the issue became a front burner one.
<P>
	I do not want to leave the impression in the general public's 
mind that once a petition is placed on the floor of this House that 
is the end of it. That in fact is not the case.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Mr. Speaker, I too would like to make sure 
the Canadian public understands that petitions which have come 
forward thus far have not just been thrown away. Many have had 
a profound effect on this Parliament.
<P>
	In general terms if many of us believe as the hon. member 
initially thought that petitions do not have all that much 
significance, then the perception already exists in the land that 
petitions do not really mean much.
<P>
	Having seen the effect petitions have had either through 
repeated presentations or in some other way, if hon. members 
believe that petitions are meaningful but the people in the land 
think they are a waste of time, then we have a problem. We need 
to address that because the citizens of Canada have to know their 
representations carry weight. If we can get that connection and 
that link together we will go a long way in building a bond 
between the elected and the electors.
<P>
	The member's position on whether all petitions would carry 
the same weight is well made. A petition in the public's interest 
with 100 signatures is extremely important. We have to be 
careful though that we do not petition ourselves out of business. 
At its height in one year 33,000 petitions went to the British 
Parliament. Obviously that did not work.
<P>
	Suppose there is a petition on the issue of capital punishment 
for example that this House is offside with the vast majority of 
Canadians. Let us say we are going to have a petition the people 
want and we are working toward a citizens' initiative, some 
measures would have to be in place to allow citizens access to 
the parliamentary process. Of course it could not be used 
frivolously. In something we have put together we have 
suggested that it might take 3 per cent of Canadians in order to 
initiate something.
<P>
	However petitions of another nature that just come to the 
House do have weight, whether they are from 10, 1,000 or one 
million people. However, one million people getting together to 
sign a petition is not the same as 20 people getting together to 
sign a petition.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<><B><A NAME="1586"><A HREF="DOCNAME#1586">1586</A></A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Finlay (Oxford):</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the 
comments and ideas behind the speech, however inherent in 
what the hon. member has said lies the danger. He has said 
petitions must not be frivolous. He said that the British House 
had 33,000 in one year and obviously things got out of hand.
<P>
	Unfortunately most petitions are generated by special interest 
groups. I put one example to my hon. friend for his comment. He 
mentioned a petition of 1,000 signatures concerning abortion 
which took a great deal of effort. I trust the hon. member knows 
the latest poll with respect to abortion shows that 70 per cent to 
80 per cent of Canadians do not want abortion made illegal. In 
other words in the vernacular they are pro choice. Therefore if 
we paid too much attention to a special interest petition of one 
million signatures we would be getting ourselves into a great 
deal of trouble.
<P>
<B>D (1140) </B>
<P>
	All members in this House represent people in their ridings. If 
we are doing our jobs we know largely what most of them think. 
We should be in touch with the silent majority and we should not 
be swayed too rapidly by special interest groups.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> I appreciate the point of view the hon. 
member has brought to this House. We were elected. We have to 
use our minds. We have to use our intelligence and we have to 
use the collective wisdom we brought with us to this House. I am 
not suggesting for one moment that we operate our country by 
referendum or by citizens' initiative, however these vehicles 
should be in place and should be available to citizens.
<P>
	Today we are talking about how our House accepts and deals 
with petitions, what we do with them and whether or not citizens 
think their involvement and work in putting forward a petition 
really matters.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Fernand Robichaud (Secretary of State 
(Parliamentary Affairs)): </B>Mr. Speaker, first of all, I would like 
to inform hon. members that the principle of the motion before 
the House today has already been the subject of debate and was 
referred on February 7 to the Standing Committee on Procedure 
and House Affairs for consideration and a subsequent report by 
the committee.
<P>
	The text reads as follows: ``That the Standing Committee on 
Procedure and House Affairs examine procedures regarding 
members statements, special debates, the taking of divisions of 
the House by electronic means, the conduct of Private Members' 
Business, especially with regard to private bills and to Senate 
public bills, any anomalies or technical inconsistencies in the 
Standing Orders, the reform of question period, measures to 
achieve more direct participation by citizens, including 
citizens' initiative, the right of constituents to recall their 
MP-binding referenda, free votes in the House of Commons, 
debates on petitions and fixed election dates.''
<P>
	Although this exercise is redundant, having already been 
initiated by a standing committee of this House, I certainly do 
not question the right of the opposition party to debate the 
subject today, on an allotted day.
<P>
	Before starting the actual debate, I think it is important to 
realize there are two kinds of petitions: first, petitions arising 
from the fundamental right of citizens to present grievances to 
Parliament, and second, petitions to seek presentation of a 
private bill, which are signed by the person or persons seeking to 
be exempted from the application of certain legislation. Of 
course, today's debate concerns the first kind which presents 
grievances expressed by citizens.
<P>
	For the benefit of Canadians who are listening, I will take a 
few minutes to give a short history of the petitions presented in 
the House of Commons and explain how they are presented and 
how the government is expected to respond. I will then give 
some examples to illustrate that our Standing Orders give the 
members of this House the means to discuss matters presented 
by petitioners. Finally, I will provide a summary of what is 
being done by this government to bring about a thorough reform 
of the operations of the House of Commons, which will 
substantially expand the role of members in developing fiscal 
policy and in the legislative process as a whole.
<P>
<B>D (1145) </B>
<P>
	Petitions as we know them today were developed during the 
17th century at a time when the British Parliament was 
beginning to be perceived more as a political and legislative 
institution than as the highest court of law in the land. The rights 
of petitioners and the powers of the House to act on the petitions 
were defined in two resolutions passed by the House of 
Commons in 1669. The resolutions were worded as follows:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``That it is the inherent right of every commoner in England to 
prepare and present petitions to the House of Commons in case 
of grievance and the House of Commons to receive the same; 
that it is an undoubted right and privilege of the Commons to 
judge and determine, touching the nature and matter of such 
petitions, how far they are fit and unfit to be received''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Until the adoption in 1842 of several standing orders aimed at 
defining the format for presenting petitions and at making any 
kind of immediate debate on their content virtually impossible, 
the House of Commons imposed very few restrictions on the 
debates arising from the presentation of petitions. Petitions had 
become a way to introduce a subject into the House for debate 
<P>
<HR>
<><B><A NAME="1587"><A HREF="DOCNAME#1587">1587</A></A></B>
<P>
and they were sometimes used to obstruct the planned work of 
the Commons.
<P>
	Moreover, since the composition of the House was becoming 
at the time increasingly representative of the different trends of 
thought, the need to use petitions as a means of conveying to 
Parliament the pressing demands of the public decreased and as 
a result, the number of petitions presented declined 
considerably.
<P>
	The Constitution of Canada recognizes that the right to 
petition the crown or Parliament to remedy a grievance is a 
fundamental principle, one that has been invoked frequently 
since 1867. While the House of Commons is an institution that is 
representative of the voters, only their elected representatives 
are allowed to bring issues before the House. Ordinary citizens 
cannot petition Parliament personally. Therefore, it is important 
that Canadians have a mechanism for bringing grievances 
deemed relevant to the attention of Parliament.
<P>
	Contrary to the situation in Great Britain, the number of 
petitions addressed to the Canadian Parliament decreased 
dramatically owing to the establishment of courts of law, to the 
lack of clarity in the standing orders of the time and to the 
manner in which petitions were handled. The process in no way 
reflected the importance that petitions should have been 
assigned, considering the fundamental right of the people to 
petition Parliament.
<P>
	Therefore, in 1984, the Special Committee on Reform of the 
House of Commons examined the question of petitions and 
recommended numerous amendments to the standing orders to 
correct the problems associated with the procedure governing 
petitions.
<P>
	Here is what the chairman of the McGrath committee had to 
say in his report tabled in June 1985:
<P>
	``Public petitions addressed to the House of Commons 
constitute one of the most direct means of communication 
between the people and Parliament. It is by this means that 
people can voice their concerns to the House on matters of 
public interest. However, despite the considerable effort spent 
preparing and circulating petitions to gather signatures, once 
they have been presented in the House and received, it is rare 
that further action is taken.
<P>
	We agree that the right to petition Parliament is a fundamental 
right of the citizen and that petitions are an integral part of the 
process whereby the people of Canada speak to their elected 
representatives. However, the use that is made of this right gives 
us some concern. The procedure governing petitions should be 
defined more clearly to generate respect for the process and 
make it more meaningful. There is a definite need to clarify the 
rules relating to petitions, to promote increased uniformity in 
their presentation and to ensure that they are acceptable by the 
House in terms of content. In addition, we should issue 
guidelines on the drafting and signing of petitions. We also think 
that petitioners are entitled to a response''.
<P>
<B>D (1150) </B>
<P>
	In order to achieve these objectives, the committee 
recommended eight amendments to the Standing Orders on 
petitions.
<P>
	Here are the rules to follow in presenting a petition in the 
House of Commons-I am sure that all members already know 
them, but I am repeating them for the benefit of the people 
listening to us-as prescribed under Standing Order 36 and 
summarily described in the third edition of the ``Précis of 
Procedure'' prepared by the Table Research Branch.
<P>
	Members wishing to present petitions in the House do so 
during Routine Proceedings after ``Motions'' and before 
``Questions on Order Paper'' are called. A petition may also be 
presented simply by filing it with the Clerk at any time during a 
sitting.
<P>
	Before being presented, a petition must be certified and 
examined as to form and content by the Clerk of Petitions.
<P>
	If the petition meets the requirements specified in the 
Standing Orders, the member presenting the petition, after being 
recognized by the Chair, can make a brief statement to inform 
the House of the content of the petition; debate on the petition 
itself is not allowed.
<P>
	The government is obliged to respond within 45 days to all 
petitions referred to it. Various conditions apply to the 
presentation of petitions. Aliens, not resident in Canada, have 
no right to petition Parliament; nor may ordinary citizens of 
Canada address the House directly-their petitions must be 
dated, presented and endorsed by a member. A member cannot 
be compelled to present a petition and no action may be taken 
against a member for refusing to do so.
<P>
	It is interesting to note that Standing Order 36 includes the 
eight recommendations in the McGrath report except for one 
element. The committee recommended that the government be 
obliged to respond within two weeks of receiving a petition, 
while Standing Order 36 prescribes a 45-day time limit.
<P>
	The Standing Orders of the House of Commons offer several 
alternatives for a debate on a grievance expressed in a petition 
presented in the House. A member can make it the subject of a 
motion or a bill to be included in the ``Order Paper'' of the 
House for debate. The grievance can be the subject of a 
government motion, like the motion we put forward on cruise 
missile testing on Canadian territory, which enabled 
parliamentarians to debate this issue often raised in many 
petitions presented in this House. Speaker.
<P>
	The grievance can also be reviewed by a committee of 
parliamentarians, or take the form of an oral question during 
question period or of a question in the ``Order Paper''. Of 
course, the government can decide that it needs to legislate to 
<P>
<HR>
<><B><A NAME="1588"><A HREF="DOCNAME#1588">1588</A></A></B>
<P>
redress the grievance submitted to it through the House of 
Commons.
<P>
	Then there are the general debates on the business of supply, 
better known as Opposition days like today, when the 
Opposition can decide on the motions to be debated on 
designated days of a given supply period. We are currently in the 
period ending March 26, which includes nine allotted days. The 
next period, which will end June 30, will include 10 allotted 
days. The period ending December 10 will also include six 
Opposition days.
<P>
<B>D (1155) </B>
<P>
	So if they wish, the opposition parties normally have 20 days 
a year during which the grievances presented by Canadians in 
petitions tabled in the House could be debated.
<P>
	On February 7, the House of Commons passed the motion 
presented by the government House leader, the Hon. Herb Gray, 
which changes the rules of Parliament. The purpose of this 
reform is to make the House more effective by giving every 
member more influence over policy development.
<P>
	These changes which give members a greater role in drafting 
legislation and setting the government's spending priorities 
were the first initiatives arising from the Liberal election 
program for job creation and economic recovery, as mentioned 
in Creating Opportunity, our famous red book. These initiatives 
were adopted by the House of Commons.
<P>
	During the debate, Mr. Gray said, ``Today, we are providing a 
framework for renewal. It will be up to all members, both 
government and opposition, to make these procedures 
effective''.
<P>
	The main changes to the Standing Orders are as follows. Two 
new processes, in addition to those that now exist, are being 
established so that members can review bills. Thus members 
will participate directly in the preparation of laws and have 
greater autonomy in amending government legislation, through 
the committee system.
<P>
	The Standing Committee on Finance will hold pre-budget 
consultations and make recommendations to the Minister of 
Finance.
<P>
	The standing committees will be authorized to examine the 
government's future defence priorities and to report on them at 
the same time as they deal with the Main Estimates for the 
current year.
<P>
	These measures were preceded by a review of the structure of 
standing committees to reflect the reorganization of the 
government. These reforms are only the first stage.
<P>
	A petition is an excellent way for the public to express its 
opinions directly on the floor of the House of Commons or the 
Senate, through a parliamentarian. The government is forced to 
respond and in many ways will take the petitions into 
consideration in future decisions.
<P>
	For instance, and this is a very good example, last week, my 
colleague, the minister responsible for Canada Post, announced 
a moratorium on the closure of post offices. There is no doubt in 
my mind that the many petitions presented in this House by hon. 
members on this subject definitely had an impact not only on the 
decision to review this policy but also on the decision to impose 
the moratorium.
<P>
	Another case is also a good example: the GST. In the election 
campaign, we promised to replace the GST and to ask the 
Standing Committee on Finance to study alternatives. This 
decision was not made in a vacuum. Obviously, Canadians were 
heard by our government and their thousands of petitions 
presented in this House, submitted to the House, bore fruit.
<P>
	Of course, the members of the opposition party who presented 
the motion are eager to bring up cases where the opinions 
expressed by Canadians in petitions were not reflected in 
decisions made by the government and they neglect to mention 
all the other cases.
<P>
	The main subject of debate today is petitions, but I believe 
that the real issue of this debate and of all the questions raised by 
members of the Reform Party on the subject of parliamentary 
reform is the loyalty of members to their constituents, to their 
party, to their country or to their conscience.
<P>
<B>D (1200) </B>
<P>
	We, Liberals, believe that members of Parliament must strike 
a balance between these positions which can sometimes be 
reconciled in making a decision, but can also be highly 
conflicting.
<P>
	Canada is a country greater than the sum of its parts. So, for 
the sake of national cohesiveness, the decisions made by 
Parliament must be greater than the sum of individual decisions 
made by its members.
<P>
	We, Liberals, feel that the credibility of parliamentarians is 
enhanced when they contribute directly, and can make an 
important contribution, to the development and implementation 
of programs and goals that the federal government must 
achieve, and not, as some members would have it, by repeating 
the public opinion parrot fashion and serving as mere voting 
machines.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In conclusion, and I know my time is running out, as for the 
other examples cited in the opposition motion, I wish to bring to 
the attention of the members the fact that the Minister of Justice 
has already answered in Question Period to some of these 
subjects and is looking into those matters.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<><B><A NAME="1589"><A HREF="DOCNAME#1589">1589</A></A></B>
<P>
	As for the third and last example, that of recall, I do not need 
to repeat what has been said in this House about the experience 
in Alberta.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In closing, I sincerely feel that our Standing Ordes already 
provide many procedures to deal with grievances presented in 
the petitions we table in this House. On the other hand, if the 
Procedure and House Affairs Committee were to conclude that 
changes were called for with regard to petitions, I am sure that 
all the hon. members would consider their recommendations 
very carefully.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to thank the hon. member for his comments.
<P>
	We are talking about reform and the government is talking 
about opening up the process. The member referred early in his 
comments to the fact that petitions will be studied by 
committees. As far as I was concerned, he almost said that our 
whole motion today was not out of order but certainly 
questionable because it seemed that this was already dealt with 
by going to committee.
<P>
	Members know that people get a chance to watch this place on 
television. When they see things disappear from the floor or the 
Chamber they wonder where they go after that. When something 
is referred to committee, for instance, or as we received 
information from our orientation session for all the new MPs 
this term, it was mentioned by one of our clerks that these 
petitions kind of disappear into warehouses.
<P>
	I appreciate the member's comments about the closure of 
rural post offices. This government has just brought in a 
moratorium on that. Maybe it is due in some small part to the 
petitions. I think that is good. Maybe the government is listening 
to a point on that.
<P>
	To just say that we really do not need this debate today on the 
floor of the House and write the whole thing off and say that it is 
being dealt with in committee is unnecessary .Canadians do not 
know exactly what goes on in committee. I suspect they will not 
wait with bated breath until somebody stands up to give a report 
from the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs 
about a particular petition.
<P>
	We are asking on this side of the House that we have this 
opened up so that people can watch it being debated on the floor 
of the House of Commons.
<P>
	I would like to ask the hon. member if he thinks there is virtue 
and merit in the fact that people can be tuned into their 
televisions right now watching it. With regard to his comments 
about the anti-GST petition, which many of his colleagues in the 
last Parliament presented, I dare say hundreds of thousands of 
those, what will happen when this government brings in a new, 
improved GST? How will this government react to whatever 
kinds of petitions are brought forward on the floor of the House 
of Commons on behalf of Canadians?
<P>
<B>D (1205) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robichaud:</B> Mr. Speaker,<B> </B>I want to reassure the hon. 
member who just spoke. I have no doubt that her party acted out 
of a sense of duty in presenting this motion here today. I simply 
said that we had already dealt with this issue and that a 
committee would be looking into it, but I think there may be 
some merit to debating it further in this House.
<P>
	She referred to the example I had given: the moratorium on 
post office closures announced by the minister. I was a member 
of Parliament from 1984 to 1990, and we were already receiving 
petitions back then. I had received petitions from my 
constituents because the government had decided to axe some 
post offices, especially in rural areas.
<P>
	I think that these petitions did play a major role in calling the 
government's attention to the fact that, for the people living in 
rural areas, post offices were really very important.
<P>
	The hon. member also referred to the GST. When we were in 
the opposition, we presented many petitions to point out that the 
GST was creating hardship for the business community due to 
the complex procedure involved. We have decided to find an 
alternative to the GST. I sincerely believe that the committee 
presently examining this issue and looking for ways to replace 
the GST with a much simpler system and one much more 
compatible with business management practices will take into 
account the demands of Canadians, demands brought before this 
House by members of all parties on behalf of their constituents.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Jordan (Leeds-Grenville):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not 
think anyone is questioning the merit of this idea of exhausting 
whatever is on the minds of Canadians at every opportunity.
<P>
	I have trouble with the mechanics of it. I wonder if we would 
be raising expectations if we would announce that there was a 
possibility that petitions might be open for further discussion 
and debate at some point, once each session as the motion reads.
<P>
	I do not know how we would handle that. I have carried a lot of 
petitions into the House of Commons. I carried in one last year 
with between 4,000 and 5,000 names on it. I am always a little 
disappointed in knowing what happens to them afterward. 
Somebody signs them and one cannot make out the signature 
and then what?
<P>
	I have not let go of that petition. There is a very strong feeling 
in my riding about this issue. I intend to pursue that. As a matter 
of fact, it is almost all consuming with me right now. On the fact 
that it is sort of passed by and filed, the member of Parliament 
would have to be sensitive whether he thought that had enough 
merit. A member may have a petition with 25 names on it. We 
know that if we want to initiate a petition in our  ridings,we 
<P>
<HR>
<><B><A NAME="1590"><A HREF="DOCNAME#1590">1590</A></A></B>
<P>
could get one with thousands of names with the opposite 
viewpoint.
<P>
	I wonder that when somebody's petition gets here if we might 
not be getting their expectations up, thinking that they had a real 
hot issue and it was going to be debated further and then the 
mechanics of the way we operate just would not allow it.
<P>
	As the hon. member was saying, there are many more ways a 
motion can be brought forward based on a petition. One could 
use it as an opposition day, as is being done today. One could 
continue having the issue for an opposition day based on a 
petition one received and thought had a lot of concurrence 
across Canada.
<P>
	I am puzzled with the mechanics of how this thing would 
work. I do not understand it.
<P>
<B>D (1210) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robichaud:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will deal only with the points 
raised by my hon. colleague. There are indeed several ways 
issues raised by Canadians in their petitions can be brought 
before the members of this House, but to create the expectation 
perhaps that every petition could be taken up in this House 
would mean devoting a lot of time to issues which are often of 
very regional in nature.
<P>
	However, I believe at the same time that petitions should be 
tabled and I would certainly be willing to consider proposals 
from the House committee presently reviewing the whole 
petition presentation procedure, if it were to suggest a better 
way to respond to petitions and in fact meet the expectations of 
the petitioners.
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to participate in the debate on the motion tabled by the 
hon. member for Edmonton Southwest, who represents the 
Reform Party.
<P>
	It seems to me that this motion is somewhat premature, 
considering that the Standing Committee on Elections, 
Privileges, Procedure and Private Members' Business, which is 
already looking at one aspect of this issue, has not yet tabled its 
report but will do so in the weeks to come. Be that as is may, the 
Reform Party elected to use its allotted day to raise this issue.
<P>
	This is an important issue since it is directly related to the 
basic principles of Canadian democracy, parliamentary 
democracy, as well as representative democracy. In our written 
constitution, and more specifically the Constitution Act of 
1867, the first whereas in the preamble reads as follows: 
``Whereas the Provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia, and New 
Brunswick have expressed their Desire to be federally united 
into One Dominion under the crown of the United Kingdom of 
Great Britain and Ireland, with a constitution similar in 
principle to that of the United Kingdom''.
<P>
	Thanks to the constituting authority of 1867, namely the 
Parliament of Westminster, we have a written constitution as 
well as institutions, such as the House of Commons, which are, 
in their very essence, based on the same principle as the United 
Kingdom's institutions, which is democracy by representation. 
This means that members are elected for a mandate which, of 
course, is not fixed but lasts from four to five years, depending 
on the political situation. During that period, members are not 
directly accountable to their constituents.
<P>
	This parliamentary representation was in effect for centuries, 
until the end of the last century. I should point out that 
governments and parliaments were so eager to show that their 
members indeed represented the public that they would not step 
down immediately after losing a general election. Instead, they 
would wait until a formal vote in the House of Commons put 
them in a minority position, at which time they would resign. 
Things greatly improved in the twentieth century and the 
process became much speedier, to the point that when 
governments now realize they no longer have the confidence of 
voters, they do not wait for a formal vote in the House of 
Commons to step down. So, there were some adjustments made, 
although the process was slow, of course.
<P>
<B>D (1215) </B>
<P>
	I will come back to the motion put forward by the hon. 
member for Edmonton Southwest, but let me digress for a 
moment to mention that the readjustment of the electoral map is 
being debated in each and every province and is an issue of great 
concern for our voters. Public hearings on this matter are 
expected to be held.
<P>
	As a member whose riding straddles two areas, the region of 
the National Capital, and by that I mean Quebec City, of course, 
and Eastern Quebec, let me point out that in Quebec in 
particular, one region stands to loose an elected representative 
with this bill. In fact, the riding of Matane will be incorporated 
into the constituency of Gaspé and my own riding of Bellechasse 
will see its population grow with the inclusion of nine new 
municipalities.
<P>
	For example, in this map readjustment project, for most of the 
rural ridings, where in the past the number of voters was lowered 
to compensate for the vast territory-as was the case in my own 
riding of Bellechasse-this weight coefficient by which larger 
areas included less voters is not taken into consideration any 
more. This is an example of an issue which we could have 
debated, and on which petitions could easily have been 
presented. All we need to do is ask, and we would get many 
petitions to be tabled. I imagine that we could have a debate, if a 
reform like the one the Reform Party is talking about was 
accepted.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<><B><A NAME="1591"><A HREF="DOCNAME#1591">1591</A></A></B>
<P>
	On the same subject, that is the readjustment of the electoral 
map pursuant to section 51 of the Constitution Act, 1867, why 
did we not use the appropriate constitutional provisions or 
petitions to deal with such important subjects as the 
representation of the Magdalen Islands, for example, which are 
a completely distinct entity under the present system? I think 
that we could have obtained consent pretty quickly for the 
Magdalen Islands to become a riding under section 51 of the 
Constitution Act, 1867, that is a riding in which there is a 
sufficient number of voters without having to include voters 
from the mainland. And that does not apply only to Quebec; it 
could be the same for the riding of Labrador.
<P>
	I wanted to mention this in order to show that we are quite 
willing to comply with the democratic wishes of our fellow 
citizens.
<P>
	As for the wording of the motion of the hon. member for 
Edmonton Southwest, it is obviously extremely vague since it 
gives examples such as serial killer cards, the Young Offenders 
Act, the recall of members of the House and I think I heard the 
mover of the motion talk about capital punishment in his speech.
<P>
	I find it a bit unfortunate that members of this House would 
use a motion to amend the Standing Orders in order to bring back 
the issue of capital punishment, which was abolished in 1963. It 
has been more that 30 years since the last execution took place in 
our country. I find it a bit unfortunate that some people would 
want to introduce such an issue in this debate today when, as 
Quebecers and Canadians, we have shown our tolerance and, as 
a country, we have shown the world that it is not by killing 
people that we will teach Canadians that it is wrong to kill. This 
topic has been widely debated, and it would be a pity if, when 
foul crimes occur, often rousing public condemnation, people 
were rushed into signing petitions which under our rules would 
become votable immediately; this would be somewhat like a 
breathalyser or a heart-rate measuring device that prompts an 
immediate reaction when a peak is registered.
<P>
<B>D (1220) </B>
<P>
	I think the parliamentary system has to handle situations with 
a deeper and more extensive consideration over a longer term, 
because in the heat of the moment, it is always easy to have 
people introduce motions and table petitions which, under terms 
that have not been specified, would become debatable and 
votable in this House. I have to introduce a note of caution, here, 
because I doubt the effectiveness of such a proposition over the 
long and medium term.
<P>
	It should be understood also that the proposition being made 
comes within a certain policy framework. This one is about 
petitions, but it has to be related to other propositions made by 
the Reform Party about the recall of members of Parliament, 
probably about citizens' initiative for bills and of course about 
referenda, on which we generally agree since the great 
referendum in  Quebec is expected soon, Mr. Speaker. You know 
better than anybody else that Quebecers will have the 
opportunity to vote on their national future.
<P>
	Since the Charlottetown accord, it is established that, in 
constitutional matters, major changes will not be decided in a 
vacuum. No more dealings behind closed doors. No more rolling 
of the dice. Citizens will be consulted. What happened in 1992 is 
a clear indication at the federal level, for federal purposes. 
There should be no federal intrusion in provincial jurisdiction. 
The federal government should use public consultations on 
federal matters only. We will never accept consultations on 
matters that are not part of federal jurisdiction.
<P>
	Our position has always been, and it has now been accepted 
that the future of Quebec should be decided by Quebec citizens 
under laws passed by the Quebec National Assembly and not 
under some federal law of this House. This is the fundamental 
right to self-determination. That right was recognized in the San 
Francisco Charter, which is the basis of the United Nations as we 
know them.
<P>
	I would even add, Mr. Speaker, that the motion put before the 
House today has more in common with an election program than 
with a simple routine question, in the sense that during the 
election campaign, which ended on last October 25, the Reform 
Party suggested many of the reforms that are put before the 
House and on which Reform members asked questions to the 
Prime Minister and the government House leader. The answers 
were quite clear and precise. I believe the government said 
clearly that it would not allow free votes systematically, but 
rather on a selective basis.
<P>
	Second, the government House leader clearly indicated that 
he really wanted questions raised by free votes to be examined 
by the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs. We 
must also take that into account. The government has the 
political will to do things that way.
<P>
	What the government has decided after the elections, I feel, is 
that profound changes will not be made during this Parliament.
<P>
<B>D (1225) </B>
<P>
	The Reform Party may be putting forward a nice and 
interesting agenda when it speaks of people initiatives, the 
recall of Members of the House and other such initiatives, like 
petitions that can be debated as well as voted on. Unless the 
Reform Party is preparing for the elections that will precede the 
36th Parliament, I do not see how changing or trying to change 
the Standing Orders will reverse a rather well established 
position by the government with which we can disagree but 
which was spelled loud and clear.
<P>
	Oddly enough and unfortunately, the free vote advocates in 
the House have given us no example of free votes since the 
opening of the session. If I am not mistaken, none of my 
<P>
<HR>
<><B><A NAME="1592"><A HREF="DOCNAME#1592">1592</A></A></B>
<P>
colleagues from the Reform Party stood here to express a 
personal point of view, unless they always have the same 
personal point of view or  those who share the same point of 
view stand at the same time. This is not my problem but the 
problem of the caucus of that party that has to live with its 
decisions. But I look forward to the day when the Reform caucus 
will not really reveal a split in its approach but rather allow 
expression of divergent views, when there will truly be an 
exchange of opinions on the floor of the House. But that is not 
what we see now. Perhaps they could give us a foretaste of this 
by debating freely a given bill. Perhaps they will announce it 
soon, but we have not seen it yet.
<P>
	Of course, and I am happy to mention this to my distinguished 
colleague for Kingston and the Islands, the government has not 
given us either many examples of free votes in this House. We 
were told there would be free votes but none has been announced 
yet.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken: </B>Did you not hear Mr. Gray?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Langlois: </B>That is not in <I>Hansard</I>, but may I quote him as 
saying that it will come soon? So, in the next few weeks, we will 
see if what the hon. member for Kingston and the Islands has 
been saying is true. So, since that will be in <I>Hansard</I>, starting 
February 21-and the hon. member from Kingston and the 
Islands did not deny that-the government will soon have free 
votes in the House. Should the Leader of the Government in the 
House talk to the chairman of the Committee on Procedure and 
House Affairs? Perhaps we will see that soon.
<P>
	It will be another way of going about the business of this 
House, but one where the initiative should come from the 
government side. We could see this in a lighter way by saying 
that the Reform Party has yet to put its program into practice; 
but it is easier for an Opposition party to allow free votes, which 
would be much less significant. On the other hand, it would be 
far more significant for the government to allow its members a 
free vote, a free discussion. When the Prime Minister rises on a 
bill and states that confidence in the government is not on the 
line, we will be able to see how this new procedure will work. 
We will see what transpires.
<P>
	I assume there will be an adjustment period-perhaps a 
difficult one. Indeed, one only needs to look at our neighbour to 
the South to witness the systematic arm twisting that goes on 
within the same party in the case of certain bills, even though 
members are supposedly free to vote according to their 
conscience. Our system, which allows discussions in caucus, 
may not be that bad. This may be the best place to discuss an 
issue so that members can agree on a common position and then 
try and reach a consensus. It may be so. I am asking the question. 
It is not an answer. However, systematic free voting would 
impede the quest for a consensus, so important to our 
parliamentary democracy.
<P>
	In any case, Quebec will have to consider this matter once it 
becomes sovereign. I have no desire whatsoever to reform this 
House. Though a comprehensive reform is necessary, I prefer to 
live by the rules we have accepted and with which we comply 
willingly, namely the rules of British fair play we have come to 
learn and to respect. I feel that, on that score, the Official 
Opposition demonstrated complete respect for the British 
parliamentary system which we inherited along with our very 
first institutions in 1792.
<P>
<B>D (1230) </B>
<P>
	Perhaps this way we feel more comfortable than others 
members who seeked to be elected with the mandate of changing 
many things in this House. As far as we are concerned, we want 
to change many things but elsewhere. We want to change many 
things in Quebec and as a result, Canada will of course benefit 
from all those changes we want to make through Canadian and 
Quebec constitutional reform since there will be an ongoing 
interaction between both.
<P>
	This is what I have in mind when I look at the present debate. 
We have on one side a party which is perpetuating its electoral 
campaign, a party which is gradually tearing to pieces some 
pages or some passages of its red book and finally a party which, 
since it was elected on October 25, says the same thing it was 
saying before, during and after the electoral campaign.
<P>
	We have on the other side the Official Opposition party, the 
Bloc Quebecois, which is dedicated to defend and to promote the 
interests of Quebec and ultimately, not in the years to come but 
in the near future, bring about, not a procedural reform or some 
amendments to Standing Order 36, but a much more exciting 
project which will consist in creating without animosity and 
with an open mind our own country, while living in harmony 
with our most wonderful Canadian neighbours.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, I enjoyed listening to the member for 
Bellechasse. I want to pursue the part of his remarks where he 
talked about the Bloc Quebecois being devoted to the interests 
of Quebec.
<P>
	Does the member feel that when he is talking about the 
interests of Quebec it is appropriate to include all of the things 
that are being done for Quebecers by this institution? For 
example, the Government of Canada provides useful services in 
terms of setting standards in the area of the environment and in 
the area of small business support. In other words, there are a 
whole series of things that are being done not just for citizens of 
Quebec but citizens right across this country.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<><B><A NAME="1593"><A HREF="DOCNAME#1593">1593</A></A></B>
<P>
	Does the member feel it appropriate to only talk about the 
duplications and the problems with Canada, or does he also feel 
that it is part of his responsibility to inform his constituents 
about some of the good things that the federal presence brings to 
the province of Quebec?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Langlois:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my honorable 
colleague for his remarks. Perhaps I have not made myself clear 
or perhaps the member misread what I said. It has to be one way 
or an other. Maybe we could make a compromise and say there is 
a shared responsibility.
<P>
	Throughout my speech, I talked about the legacy of the British 
Parliamentary system and the chance we have had to live in a 
democracy. The idea of granting sovereignty to Quebec simply 
by casting a vote, by counting the ballots and by declaring that 
the majority shall decide is a legacy from the British democratic 
tradition. Without such a legacy, we could not hold this debate 
about the sovereignty and the future of Quebec, and also about 
the future of Canada because our destinies are closely linked. 
We just could not hold such a debate.
<P>
<B>D (1235) </B>
<P>
	If we have a civilized debate, I think it due to the fact that for 
200 years now we have had free and democratic 
elections-some more free and democratic than others-and we 
have been able to capitalize on them.
<P>
	The question asked by the hon. member and my answer 
complete my speech and lead me to a point raised by the main 
motion of the hon. member for Edmonton Southwest. I was 
wondering about petitions, about special interest groups and 
about paying to organize the signing of petitions. Who would 
pay?
<P>
	Court decisions in Saskatchewan confirmed that any citizen, 
whether a natural or artificial person, could invest any amount 
deemed appropriate during an election or referendum campaign, 
and this could apply to petitions. At the present time we have no 
clear benchmarks set by law or recognized by the courts. Some 
day we might have a Supreme Court decision since the Solicitor 
General expressed the desire to refer to the Supreme Court the 
decision of the Appeal Court of Saskatchewan.
<P>
	Personally, considering this lack of benchmarks, I would 
prefer to keep the status quo and its well known guidelines, 
rather than follow a risky road.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened with great interest to the comments made by the hon. 
member. I have heard many comments and statements since 
coming here as a new member, statements such as ``we 
Canadians and Quebecers'', the separation between Canadians 
and Quebecers. I am most disturbed about the final comments in 
the hon. member's speech. I do not know if he wrote them down 
or was just expressing them. However, they were  something to 
the effect that the Bloc be able to achieve two countries, 
independence, without animosity. I am greatly disturbed by that.
<P>
	Certainly there will be animosity. That kind of statement is 
not taken very lightly by a person like me, one who has lived in 
most provinces in Canada and travelled throughout Canada 
extensively. As well, I have lived in Quebec.
<P>
	I would like to ask the member how he feels the Bloc as the 
Official Opposition represents either eastern Canada or western 
Canada when in fact it has an agenda, I would suggest, totally 
alien to either one of those geographical areas in this country.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Langlois:</B> Naturally, Mr. Speaker, the Bloc Quebecois is 
devoted to the defence of Quebec interests, but voters gave us 
the role of Official Opposition and we have, therefore, the 
mandate to speak for all Canadians irrespective of their province 
of residence. We have already demonstrated that fact in this 
House by giving our consent to the passage in one day of the bill 
to end the strike of longshoremen at the port of Vancouver.
<P>
	We have been actively involved in the business of the House, 
we gave our consent, we asked questions on bills and other 
matters of interest to Canadians from the maritimes, the prairies 
or the west. Of course, our basic mandate comes from Quebec, 
the hon. member is right about that, but nobody can accuse us of 
refusing to defend the interests of Canadians when action was 
necessary to protect justice and fairness.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dan McTeague (Ontario):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
make a few comments for my friend and colleague, the member 
for Bellechasse, concerning the value of our responsibility to 
represent our riding. Before October 25, it was recognized that 
the Bloc Quebecois could not act as the Official Opposition.
<P>
<B>D (1240) </B>
<P>
	I would like to put a simple question to the member: Does he 
not agree that it is important for him to represent all Canadians, 
including franco-Ontarians, franco-Quebecers, 
franco-Newfoundlanders and franco-Manitobans?
<P>
	I think it is very important that the Bloc Quebecois deal with 
subjects that concern Canada as a whole.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Langlois:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
Ontario for his question. The fate of French speaking minorities 
has been a concern of mine ever since I was in grade school and 
we were asked to give a silver coin for the survival of French. In 
those days, that silver coin was a nickel or a dime we could have 
used to buy a chocolate bar or a pop, but we brought it to school 
because we knew it was for a good cause. Everybody pitched in. 
<P>
<HR>
<><B><A NAME="1594"><A HREF="DOCNAME#1594">1594</A></A></B>
<P>
Today it is gratifying to see the member express himself in 
perfect French.
<P>
	Think of all the money they collected in Quebec, and not only 
money; think also of all the Quebec clergy who  went to other 
provinces as missionaries in dioceses where sometimes their 
work was far from easy. Let us pay homage to those men and 
women who worked outside Quebec.
<P>
	In conclusion, I would like to remind the House that a few 
days ago, the Bloc Quebecois, elected only by Quebecers, gave 
proof of a great openness and understanding of the problems in 
Eastern Canada and particularly those of the Atlantic when it 
voted in favour of the constitutional resolution allowing for the 
construction of a bridge between Prince Edward Island and the 
mainland whereas our Reform colleagues voted against that 
project. . . .let us ask ourselves: who in the opposition best 
defends the interests of all Canadians from the Atlantic to the 
Pacific, the Bloc Quebecois or the Reform Party?
<P>
	I think if we asked the people of Atlantic Canada today we 
would get a very clear and precise answer to that question.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, allow me to mention also the extremely positive 
comments we received from the press and from distinguished 
personalities from western Canada when we took position on the 
issue of the lockout in Vancouver harbour.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver):</B> Mr. Speaker, on behalf 
of the whip of the Reform Party, I would like to advise the House 
that, pursuant to Standing Order 43(2), our speakers on this 
motion will be dividing their time.
<P>
	This motion brought forward for discussion by the Reform 
Party is another indication of our party's commitment to find 
ways the people of Canada can have a greater input into the 
decision making process of government.
<P>
	We want to encourage ongoing discussions of important 
issues in every community right across Canada. We feel that this 
does not always have to involve the government. It does not 
have to be sponsored or funded by the government.
<P>
	People like to discuss important issues with their friends and 
their neighbours. They like to write letters to the editors of the 
local newspapers and they like to call local talk shows on both 
television and radio.
<P>
	Some start petitions as a way of highlighting the concerns of 
the community. These things happen spontaneously without any 
cost to the government and they certainly do not require 
government input or interference. Government attempts to 
influence the outcome of community discussions on issues can 
easily backfire.
<P>
	Huge sums were spent by the previous government funding 
the yes side of the 1992 referendum but the people of Canada 
made up their own minds on the issue and the majority voted 
against the government position.
<P>
	The politicians at the time refused to apologize for their 
attempts to manipulate the result of the referendum and the will 
of the people. To this day many are unable to accept the result 
and continue to criticize the referendum process.
<P>
<B>D (1245) </B>
<P>
	The Reform Party takes the opposite position entirely. We 
strongly supported the right of voters to express their will 
through the 1992 referendum and we absolutely accepted the 
result. We continue to actively push for a regular set of 
referendum questions to be placed on a separate referendum 
ballot at the time of each federal election. The cost would be 
minimal, whilst the benefits to the people of Canada would be 
enormous. By allowing them to take an active part in important 
decision making we would be showing the people of Canada that 
we the politicians are prepared to listen to their concerns.
<P>
	We believe this type of referendum plays an essential part in 
the new democracy which is finding its way into our 
parliamentary system. Petitions are a form of mini referendum. 
Initiated by citizens they are sometimes very localized in nature 
with just a few thousand signatures. Sometimes they are of 
national importance, carrying as many as a million or more 
signatures.
<P>
	Unfortunately governments, because they are often absorbed 
in their own agenda, tend to ignore petitions or these mini 
referendums. Ministers are photographed accepting this petition 
or that petition, taking the opportunity to be in the news instead 
of taking the opportunity to follow the will of the people.
<P>
	Many petitions specifically seek to change a government 
direction or policy. There is a public perception, perhaps 
accurate, that instead of seeing this as a way of building voter 
confidence and a way of correcting flaws in policy, a 
government will shuffle the petition off into a black hole 
somewhere and will continue on with what it calls its mandate.
<P>
	Governments are failing to recognize the key to re-election in 
the information age is to be responsive to the will of the people. 
Future political stability rather than depending on party unity is 
going to depend on being responsive to voter concerns. Failure 
to introduce at least some basic forms of participatory 
democracy will condemn us to many years of political upheaval 
and uncertainty.
<P>
	One government member has stated that petitions are 
acknowledged and do not disappear. That is not the perception 
of members of the public. Most adults have probably signed a 
<P>
<HR>
<><B><A NAME="1595"><A HREF="DOCNAME#1595">1595</A></A></B>
<P>
petition at one time or another-I know I have-and have 
probably been as disappointed as I have that no matter how 
many signatures are on a petition there is no real way to turn the 
petition into  legislation which addresses the concerns of the 
petitioners.
<P>
	Regular open consideration and debate of major petitions 
presented to the House would go a long way toward showing 
citizens that their concerns are being discussed in Parliament, 
that their signatures on a petition really does count, that a major 
petition will be discussed here, and that the government may 
take notice and act to change or introduce legislation to deal 
with the concerns.
<P>
	If something is worth doing it is worth doing it well. More 
credibility would be added to the process if a free vote could 
take place at the end of the debate. Instead of being partisan we 
would have an opportunity as MPs to work together, to actively 
support or reject the direction suggested by a petition.
<P>
	There is no threat to the government in agreeing to amend the 
standing orders in the way our motion suggests. There simply 
are not any downsides to this suggestion. What harm can 
possibly be done by the occasional debating of petitions?
<P>
	I urge all members to join me in supporting this motion. I hope 
many of them will speak in its favour. I am very disappointed 
government speakers so far seem to be taking a negative 
position simply because this is a Reform motion. The 
opportunity to debate petitions before the House would show 
constituents across Canada that we really care about their 
concerns.
<P>
	I would like to relate the discussion today to the red book. 
Government speakers regularly imply that because people voted 
for a Liberal government every one who voted Liberal supports 
every single policy position in the red book.
<P>
<B>D (1250 ) </B>
<P>
	Either government members are naive-and I do not believe 
that to be true of the majority-or else they are taking an 
unreasonable position that can be seen through by every clearly 
thinking Canadian. Obviously not every person who voted 
Liberal agrees with every policy in the red book. They probably 
voted Liberal after feeling that on balance they were making the 
best choice, even though some of the policies may have been 
unacceptable to them.
<P>
	Even government members will have to admit there are 
probably a few policies in the red book the majority of 
Canadians would like to see changed. That is not because the 
original research was faulty but because times change and 
opinions change. What is wrong with adapting to changing 
times? What is wrong with recognizing that a particular policy 
has outlived its usefulness and is no longer appropriate? What 
better way for voters to indicate this than by starting a major 
petition?
<P>
	If the government acted upon a major petition following an 
open debate in the House, its popularity would be enhanced and 
it would be more likely to win again in the next election. This is 
my free advice to the Liberal Party.
<P>
	This seems like such a simple principle to me that I do not 
understand why governments continue to regularly defy voters. 
Why do they force through their mandate and then wonder why 
they are defeated at the next election? If all of us here value the 
opinions of our families, our neighbours and our friends, by 
extension we must value the opinions of all Canadians.
<P>
	We must work together to give them a greater say in the House 
by allowing the debate of petitions on their behalf. Treating 
petitions more seriously is one way to gain the confidence of the 
Canadian voter, especially on major petitions such as the one 
requesting changes to the Young Offenders Act.
<P>
	The process of debating petitions would be new and would no 
doubt need to be modified in the light of experience after the 
first few sessions. There would have to be a fair way of selecting 
petitions for debate as we could clearly not handle every one that 
was presented to the House.
<P>
	If selection were made on the size of the petition there would 
be an automatic built in judgment as to the importance of the 
subject to be handled in the House. Clearly a petition with a 
million or more signatures will have been well organized and 
will probably deal with a matter of national importance, while 
petitions with a few thousand signatures are probably in 
response to an issue of a localized nature and would be better 
dealt with by municipal or provincial governments. Once those 
governments see that we are debating major issues developed 
from major petitions in the House, they will have much greater 
confidence in us as their representatives.
<P>
	Once again I urge all members of the House to show their 
constituents that they are listening to the opinions of 
constituents and are conducting themselves accordingly. I urge 
them to support the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened to the comments of our colleague across the 
way. Many of the things he is trying to achieve are certainly not 
impossible and are not contrary to some things I believe in.
<P>
	However, we are dealing with a motion today that asks the 
government to amend the standing orders. At last count those 
were the standing orders of the House, not of the government. 
Apart from all other things that are wrong with the motion, Mr. 
Speaker, you would be offended if the government unilaterally 
tried to change the standing orders.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<><B><A NAME="1596"><A HREF="DOCNAME#1596">1596</A></A></B>
<P>
	All of us in Parliament in the last session were objecting 
because the government of that time decided to change the 
standing orders pursuant to a recommendation of the 
parliamentary committee but chose only to amend some of the 
things the parliamentary committee had asked for, thereby 
creating an imbalance in the House which was felt to be 
objectionable to the opposition; in other words, it could not pick 
and choose from the report. I do not know of anything before the 
committee that recommends a change of the standing orders. At 
least nothing has been proposed by the hon. member's party to 
do that which is asked in the motion today.
<P>

<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I think the question is clear enough. 
Would the member wish to reply.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (North Vancouver):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. 
member for his comments, but I cannot help feeling that they 
were directed well away from the topic of the debate and 
certainly the spirit of the debate.
<P>
	I reiterate that the motion before the House today was placed 
there by the Reform Party because we want to help voters of 
Canada have a greater say in the running of their government. 
For them to see that occasionally major petitions actually get 
discussed in the House in front of the television cameras so that 
the whole of Canada can see it would be going a long way toward 
opening up that process for Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. It seems to 
me that if the motion were found in order by the Table certainly 
we should not be disputing whether or not it is a legitimate 
motion. It is as simple as that.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> That is certainly debate.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Is the hon. member for Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup 
rising to make a comment? Very briefly please, there are only 
two minutes left for both of you.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to say to the hon. member for Vancouver 
North that I would probably have preferred to see the Reform 
Party introduce a motion proposing ways to modernize the 
members' representation role rather than strenghtening direct 
democracy. Indeed, I think the implementation of means such as 
electronic vote by telecommunications or teleconferences 
should be considered more urgent than presenting to the House 
petitions immediately after an election during which most of the 
issues at stake, at least for the coming year, were dealt with by 
the population.
<P>
	I would like to ask the hon. member to clarify a point: could he 
explain what criteria would make a petition more acceptable 
than another because we would obviously have to answer 
questions such as how many signatures are required, or must a 
petition be signed by voters in each and every province? Could 
issues such as  constitutional amendments be raised on a regular 
basis? Otherwise we will be discussing everyday matters.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (North Vancouver):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would take the 
hon. member's suggestions under advisement and perhaps 
suggest that his party use its opposition days to introduce topics 
of its choice.
<P>
	On the matter of how we would choose petitions, that was a 
subject of my speech. I mentioned that perhaps selecting 
petitions with the largest number of signatures would 
automatically place them in the realm of being a petition of 
national importance. That would certainly be one suggestion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, there 
is not a lot of difference between Fraser Valley West and Fraser 
Valley East; they are both in the Fraser Valley.
<P>
	It is a little difficult not to duplicate some of the comments 
made here by virtue of the subject in itself. It is not as large a 
subject as the finances of the country and so on. Nevertheless it 
is an important issue. It is quite fundamental to many issues on 
which the Reform Party is looking for change.
<P>
	I am happy to speak to the issue of petitions. It is a petition 
that expresses one of the oldest forms of grass roots populace 
input of citizens to express their aspirations and their 
grievances. Ordinary citizens are provided the opportunity to 
bring these issues directly to the House of Commons. Petitions 
can also become a vehicle for members to strengthen their own 
representations or those of their party on important issues.
<P>
	I also recognize this particular issue has been referred to the 
procedure and House affairs committee. I am a member of that 
committee and it is on the agenda. Nevertheless it is important 
to express our positions at this time.
<P>
	Compared with bills, motions and oral and written questions, 
petitions appear to rank low in importance. Their greatest 
apparent drawback is that after they are presented the House 
takes no prompt visible further action, much like the situation 
we have in the House when members give a speech. Often it is 
not recognized that something happens immediately after the 
speech and it takes some prompting to get things done.
<P>
<B>D (1300) </B>
<P>
	We have over 200 new members in the 35th Parliament. It is 
my belief that the House will see more basic reforms to its 
operation than any of the previous 34 Parliaments. The 
existence of the new prayer this morning is one example of that. 
I am reminded of a saying: ``If we continue to think the things 
we thought we will continue to get the things we've got''. 
Basically it says that if we do not start looking at new issues and 
pressing 
<P>
<HR>
<><B><A NAME="1597"><A HREF="DOCNAME#1597">1597</A></A></B>
<P>
for reforms then we will continue to get those things we have 
had over the last 125 years.
<P>
	With this in mind, the process of petitions is another reform 
that is required as much, as was mentioned here today, as free 
votes, elections every four years, an elected Senate, recall, 
referenda and improved question periods. These are things that 
need to be changed and they all deserve a day when we can 
discuss them.
<P>
	To understand the need for change I wish to provide a history 
of petitions in Parliament and then an opinion of what is wrong 
with the current system. Finally I will provide some 
recommendations for change.
<P>
	We have heard a little bit of that history already this morning 
but it bears repeating in some cases. The right to petition the 
crown for redress of grievances dates back to the reign of King 
Edward I, as my hon. friend from Edmonton Southwest 
mentioned this morning. That was in the 13th century. It was 
from petitions that legislation by bill was gradually derived.
<P>
	The practice of putting petitions before the Canadian House 
of Commons was adopted from the mother Parliament in Great 
Britain. In Great Britain petitions were debated in the House 
until 1842 when the practice was discontinued because the 
debates left no time for other business. That in itself leads us to 
understand that since it was so busy with debates on petitions it 
meant that people actually wanted to have some say. At the time 
of the discontinuance approximately 33,000 petitions each year 
were being submitted for debate. Would it not be nice to have 
that kind of interest in this country?
<P>
	After 1842 in Great Britain, petitions were read and then 
could be referred to a committee of petitions, although debate 
was not generally permitted on them. If petitions related to 
personal grievances they could be designated as urgent and be 
debated immediately.
<P>
	Again in Great Britain, the committee of petitions published a 
report of petitions and had similar powers that standing 
committees have in this House today. On the other hand, the 
committee of petitions in Great Britain had no power to 
investigate or report on the merits of a petition or to call 
witnesses for investigation.
<P>
	In 1974 Great Britain discontinued the practice in favour of its 
current practice which is that the petition goes to a minister of 
the crown who must make a recommendation or an observation 
to the House which is tabled and printed.
<P>
	In the early days of Confederation, public petitions played an 
important role in the proceedings of the House. Petitions were 
frequently referred to special committees. Orders for return 
were made for copies of particularly topical petitions and 
debates and divisions sometimes took place on whether 
petitions should be received.
<P>
	Over the years, the number of petitions has dropped 
significantly. People began to turn to the courts and other 
administrative bodies for redress of grievances. Lobbying took 
place at other levels. MPs became more sensitive to public 
opinion and began to use other procedures such as oral and 
written questions to articulate the needs of their constituents. It 
was and continues to be today the fact that the House does not 
promptly and visibly act on a petition that causes the most 
frustration. From my perspective there is more formality and 
bureaucratic red tape put on the front end of a petition process.
<P>
	We really have to look at the process after the petition is 
received. That is where we get into the meat of it. Standing 
Order 36 is completely dedicated to format with the exception of 
subsection (8), which indicates:
<P>
<B>D (1305) </B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Ministry shall, within forty-five days, respond to every petition referred 
to it.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	If you look at the response given it appears to be merely lip 
service. Is it any wonder why petitions are seen to be an exercise 
in futility when the government's own standing orders do not 
acknowledge their importance?
<P>
	In 1994 just when our citizens most need their voices to be 
heard on issues like our failing criminal justice system, the poor 
quality of fiscal management of government and change is 
desperately needed to the reform of our parliamentary system, 
the members of our Canadian Parliament cannot make a speech 
to a petition, they can merely make a brief statement. They 
cannot present a motion referring to a petition so that action can 
be taken. They cannot be assured that the petition will go any 
further than the Clerk of the House. They cannot provide 
constituents the confidence their concern will be dealt with and 
they cannot refer the petition to a committee of the House of 
Commons.
<P>
	I would propose the following changes to the petition process. 
The first change is that every petition should be presented to an 
all party parliamentary committee which selects a specified 
number of petitions each month for debate.
<P>
	My second recommendation is that each debated petition 
shall be presented as a motion to be decided on by the House.
<P>
	Third, all petitions should be responded to by the minister 
showing that the government is not paying lip service to the 
issue.
<P>
	Fourth, the petition committee should have the same authority 
as any other parliamentary committee, which is another topic in 
itself because they too need to change.
<P>
	Finally, it is necessary to say that citizens do not lightly 
petition government. We are all aware of how difficult it is to 
have citizens take a more continued interest in their own affairs 
and in their own Parliament.
<P>

<P>
<HR>

<P>
	I sincerely hope this has not just been another speech in the 
House of Commons that will be ignored. A note from my 
research indicates that many such speeches regarding the 
petition process have taken place over the years and next to 
nothing has been done to the process.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
thank the member for Fraser Valley-West for his remarks. I have 
listened carefully to the different speakers, and more 
specifically the one who just talked about the subject in front of 
us this morning.
<P>
	The first point I would like to stress-and I am going to pay 
them a compliment, even though they belong to a different 
party-has to do with the fact that the aim of their motion is to 
increase democracy and get Canadians interested in what is 
going on, in other words, in their own fate. For that, hats off to 
them.
<P>
	But, where I have some reservations, as some of my 
colleagues may have, is with the vehicle they want to use. Today, 
we are talking about making greater use of petitions in the 
House. I am not opposed to the idea, in principle, but as any 
theoretician would, I want to know how it is going to work.
<P>
	For example, on our side, different petitions carry more or 
less weight. What I mean is that not everybody has the same 
understanding of how to use petitions. Some clever people, good 
at manipulating public opinion, might see how to make use of 
them for their own purposes and apply financial leverage to that 
end. Therefore, in a spirit of fairness for all, it might be 
important to define clearly the new framework for petitions and 
set limits for financial contributions.
<P>
<B>D (1310 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am not sure 
what the question was but I know the statement I picked up 
refers to the importance of a petition and the weight given to it. 
After campaigning and talking to as many people as all of us 
have in the House, it is surely recognized that people do not feel 
they have enough effect on the role of government. For instance, 
look at the petitions that poured into this place on the GST and it 
went through.
<P>
	There has to be a way to allow people to express themselves 
and the vehicle of a petition is noteworthy. It is the proper way. 
The problem is when the petition gets into the House of 
Commons and what happens to it. What kind of effect can the 
average individual Canadian have on the political agenda of this 
House of Commons?
<P>
	My response to the hon. member's comments is that we 
believe in petitions. We think petitions should come to the 
House of Commons but we think subsequent to it receiving them 
there has to be some teeth in it so that we are made to listen to the 
people.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Will the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans be mindful of the fact that 
there is a minute left for him and the response.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Parliamentary Secretary 
to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
closely to the comments of the hon. member for Fraser Valley 
West. I have a couple of questions which have been asked before 
but they have not been answered in a clear, concise fashion. I 
would like to say that getting greater democracy in the House is 
always important for everyone but in a democracy one must 
always be pragmatic.
<P>
	We want a workable government. We want a government 
which is practical and can work efficiently. We should always 
keep that in mind. I believe the example given earlier where 
33,000 petitions were received makes it unworkable to continue 
debating petitions.
<P>
	My first question concerns special interest groups. Does the 
hon. member feel special interest groups have an advantage in 
that they may have resources, financial and otherwise, to take 
advantage of a situation in determining the agenda of 
Parliament?
<P>
	My other question is in terms of priority-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The member will have to deal with just 
the first question because the time is up. Please be very brief.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member touched on my favourite topic, the funding of special 
interest groups. The fact is that in special interest groups 
everybody has an interest. For those that have an extraordinary 
amount of funding it is normally found that the money comes 
from this very place.
<P>
	Time and time again we see where both Liberal and 
Conservative governments have funded special interest lobby 
groups and quite frankly we are opposed to that. To answer the 
question it is exactly that. The difference comes from 
eliminating the broad funding levels and trying to get all special 
interest groups to act with some relative amount of equality and 
then all petitions could be considered equal.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The time is up. We go back to debate.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am very pleased to take part in a debate on such an important 
issue. As chairman of the Standing Committee on Procedure and 
House Affairs, this matter is of great interest to me, since it has 
already been referred to my committee.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<><B><A NAME="1599"><A HREF="DOCNAME#1599">1599</A></A></B>
<P>
	I know that the previous speaker, the hon. member for Fraser 
Valley West, will want to share his ideas with the committee, as 
well as the hon. member for Bellechasse who spoke earlier.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I welcome their participation in the debate and look forward 
to it continuing in the committee. I think it is important the 
record show that in fact the rules of the House relating to 
petitions are not wholly out of date and are not so 
unrepresentative as are suggested by the hon. member for Fraser 
Valley West and indeed by his colleague, the hon. member for 
Edmonton Southwest, who led off the debate for his party this 
morning.
<P>
<B>D (1315 ) </B>
<P>
	In my view today's debate on petitions is really part of a larger 
debate on the whole parliamentary system that has been 
launched by members of the Reform Party. Their agenda 
includes more than debate on petitions. It includes proposals for 
recall of members of Parliament, referenda among the Canadian 
public, consultation on various legislative proposals, vague 
proposals for direct democracy that I am sure we are going to 
hear more about, and other suggestions they have put forward 
for changing the way this place operates in relation to the 
general public, particularly in respect of free votes.
<P>
	I suggest part of the reason the Reform Party has put this 
forward is its lack of policy alternatives on other issues. We 
have witnessed in the last week or so Reform members dwelling 
on this issue in question period to the exclusion of virtually any 
other question in the national interest. They are pursuing this 
particular agenda for the reform of Parliament as their sole 
policy option at this stage. I find that slightly regrettable, 
interesting though the proposals are and worthy as they are for 
debate.
<P>
	I am happy to be able to participate in that vigorous public 
discussion on each of these issues which is important. However, 
it may mean a vigorous defence of a system which has served 
Canada extremely well for 125 years and more and which has 
served the United Kingdom for hundreds and hundreds of years 
and has worked. The system is flexible and allows for change. 
That may happen but I do not think it is necessary to change all 
the rules of the game in order to make it work that way.
<P>
	Part of the reason for this concerted attack on our 
parliamentary institutions-and I call it that because I think it is 
an effort to diminish Parliament in some ways in a broad 
characterization-is very well founded. I know it is why many 
of the Reform Party members and indeed virtually all members 
were elected to this House.
<P>
	It was because of the strong revulsion to the policies and 
proceedings and manner of dealing that characterized the 
Conservative government which occupied this side of the House 
for the last nine years. I do not need to go into all the reasons for 
that revulsion but the people of Canada clearly spoke. The sad 
witnesses to that fact are the two remaining Tories who sit as 
independents in the back row on the opposite side. Canadians 
were sick and tired of the frankly deceitful practices exhibited 
by the previous government almost daily in its dealings with 
Parliament and with the people  of this country by putting 
forward policies that said one thing but did another.
<P>
	Canadians saw through that and instead of accepting it as a 
fact of a bad government, they took it as a bad Parliament. They 
blamed the failure on the institution and on the way government 
worked, rather than on the particular people who occupied the 
government benches and got it so mucked up.
<P>
	If members of the Reform Party had been here in any number 
in the last Parliament they would have heard me speak 
frequently on the evils of the previous government and pointing 
out its deficiencies. I was not alone. There were 80 of us in this 
party who did the same thing. Some members who were 
obviously less effective were in the New Democratic Party and 
some of them have had to leave. However, the fact is we were 
faced with the situation of very poor government. Canadians felt 
deceived by that government and therefore thought that 
Parliament was at fault somehow in not dealing with this 
deception.
<P>
	The majority was there. The majority held throughout the 
Parliament and we were unable to secure the defeat of the 
government. Had we done so, respect for this institution would 
have gone up immeasurably in the eyes of the public but we 
could not. Therefore it took an election to clear the House and 
get rid of the supporters of that government. We now have them 
replaced with a good number of Liberals on this side and a 
number of Reform members-I will not mention the Bloc in this 
particular context.
<P>
	However, a group of Reform members decided to join in and 
monopolize the public chant that something was wrong with 
Parliament when in fact the problem was with the government. 
There is a difference. The difference was exhibited by the hon. 
member for Fraser Valley West in his speech when he said that 
government's rules do not allow for certain things to happen. 
The rules he was referring to are the rules of Parliament, not the 
government's rules. These are the rules of the House of 
Commons.
<P>
<B>D (1320 ) </B>
<P>
	There is a difference and I cannot stress that too greatly. This 
House is not the government. It may have a large number of 
government members in it. Members of the government sit in it. 
They participate in it. They debate in it and they may control it 
from one day to another. They certainly have to have its 
confidence throughout the time they are in office. However, it is 
a parliamentary House, not a government House.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<><B><A NAME="1600"><A HREF="DOCNAME#1600">1600</A></A></B>
<P>
	It is here for us to debate government policy. Members on the 
other side particularly are given ample opportunity to make 
criticism of government policy. When members on this side feel 
critical they are also given certain opportunities to make 
remarks along that line.
<P>
	The purpose of the Chamber is not to decide government 
policy. It is to debate the wisdom of it and to call the government 
to account. Those are its primary functions. As members of 
Parliament we are given various places where we can exercise 
those rights and responsibilities. I believe if the new 
government shows the responsiveness Canadians demand of it 
Canadians will lose their interest in major sweeping reforms in 
the way our system works.
<P>
	The system worked well for at least 100 years. Only in the last 
few years has it come into disrepute. Part of that has been the 
enormous swings in public opinion which have resulted in huge 
majorities on the parts of government such as we saw in 1984 
and I can think back to one similarly disastrous election in 1958. 
These massive swings in public opinion are becoming more 
pronounced. They were most evidenced in the 1993 election 
when three parties were elected, two on a very regional basis and 
one on a national basis with a very large number of seats in every 
case. It indicates again the electorate's volatility and 
unwillingness to stand by traditional party disciplines or to stay 
with a party in the belief that a party will do the best thing for 
their part of Canada.
<P>
	That volatility has meant that members of Parliament have to 
react differently. However, it does not mean they have to 
abandon the principles and their own feelings about how public 
policy should be shaped and developed. The purpose of political 
parties is to aggregate interests so that members trade off their 
various interests for the good of the whole. What we see in the 
opposition parties quite frankly is a breakdown in that normal 
relationship where the party has become the single policy 
vehicle and members are expected to adhere firmly to that 
policy vehicle.
<P>
	That is particularly so with the Reform Party. I have pointed 
that out before on various occasions. I am not being critical of 
the party in this sense. I am simply stating the obvious that to be 
a member of that party one has to believe in the whole policy 
platform of the party such as it is and if one does not, then that 
person is not in. Naturally, there is a fair bit of unanimity in that 
party which is lacking in this party and may be lacking in the 
Bloc on issues other than Quebec sovereignty or separation, 
whatever it wants to call it.
<P>
	I know I have to speak to the motion and I turn to that. I want 
to deal first with the role of a member of Parliament in a broad 
sense. It is important to look at some of the remarks made by 
famous people on other occasions dealing with the role of a 
member of Parliament.
<P>
	This morning the hon. member for Edmonton Southwest 
referred to Edmund Burke but he did not quote him. I would like 
to do so because what Edmund Burke had to say on this subject is 
of importance. Of course members will recall that he was a 
member of the British House of Commons. In his famous speech 
at Bristol in 1774 he said several items that are significant. 
Unfortunately I cannot find the words leading up to this quote so 
I cannot quote him precisely.
<P>
	He spoke for the need for a member of Parliament once 
elected to speak for the national good and not to be the mere 
delegate or representative of his or her community dealing with 
narrow community interests. He said it was important that a 
member represent a community, but in addition the member 
should have some eye and some ear for the national good and 
seek to represent that in his or her dealings. He said in the 
closing remarks: ``You choose a member indeed, but when you 
have chosen him he is not member of Bristol, but he is a member 
of Parliament''.
<P>
	I cannot stress those words too strongly. With respect we were 
not sent here to represent just Kingston and the Islands in my 
case or just Edmonton Southwest in the case of the member who 
spoke earlier, or the riding of Elgin-Norfolk only. We are 
required to look at the country as a whole, support Canada as a 
whole and look to the national good. Edmund Burke said that. I 
agree with that and we all have that obligation.
<P>
<B>D (1325) </B>
<P>
	Of course these words may be a little out of date today, but in 
the same speech he said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Certainly, Gentlemen, it ought to be the happiness and glory of a 
representative to live in the strictest union, the closest correspondence, and the 
most unreserved communication with his constituents. Their wishes ought to 
have great weight with him; their opinions high respect; their business 
unremitted attention. It is his duty to sacrifice his repose, his pleasure, his 
satisfactions, to theirs,-and above all, ever, and in all cases, to prefer their 
interest to his own.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>But his unbiased opinion, his mature judgment, his enlightened conscience, 
he ought not to sacrifice to you, to any man, or to any set of men living. These he 
does not derive from your pleasure,-no, nor from the law and the Constitution. 
They are a trust from Providence, for the abuse of which he is deeply 
answerable. Your representative owes you, not his industry only, but his 
judgment; and he betrays, instead of serving you, if he sacrifices it to your 
opinion.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The same distinguished gentleman said in the same speech at 
Bristol to the electors:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I did not obey your instructions. No. I conformed to the instructions of truth 
and Nature, and maintained your interest, against your opinions, with a 
constancy that became me. A representative worthy of you ought to be a person 
of stability. I am to look, indeed, to your opinions,-but to such opinions as you 
and I must have five years hence. I was not to look to the flash of the day. I knew 
that you chose me, in my place, along with others, to be a pillar of the state, and 
not a weathercock on the top of the edifice, exalted for my levity and versatility, 
and of no use but to indicate the shiftings of every fashionable gale.</BLOCKQUOTE>

	Those words, said over 200 years ago, still reflect in some 
measure the duties and obligations of a member of Parliament. I 
would venture to suggest they are not obligations that are taken 
lightly by any member of this House. While they may be a little 
strong and we may be more cognizant of public opinion today 
than Edmund Burke was in 1774, partly because we can measure 
it more easily, the fact is members of Parliament do have their 
views. They do make their own opinions and they are required to 
do so.
<P>
	We as members are often forced to make decisions on issues 
that were not current or discussed and debated during an election 
campaign. Issues come up subsequent to a campaign yet we have 
to make decisions on those and are obliged to do so. I do not 
want to shirk my responsibility in that regard.
<P>
	I think back to the last Parliament when there were votes on a 
declaration of war. No one suspected in the 1988 campaign that 
we would be faced with such a decision in that Parliament but we 
were. We faced it and we voted on it. It was a tough decision. 
Members found it very difficult and very disconcerting to be put 
in that position. Yet it was a situation that had to be faced and it 
was faced.
<P>
	The same thing will happen on other issues throughout the 
four or five years we serve in this House. I do not suggest as 
members of the Reform Party do that every time we get cold feet 
on something we should run off and have a referendum or do a 
poll and decide how we should vote based on the results. We 
were elected to exercise our mature judgment. That is what we 
are here for and that is what we will do.
<P>
	There is one other interesting quote. It is more amusing than 
not, but I find it particularly relevant to petitions. In many cases 
petitions are signed by organized groups across the country. 
They decide to get signatures on a series of petitions and present 
them to Parliament to show members of Parliament that their 
point of view is particularly important or correct or one that is 
shared by a tremendous number of people.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nault:</B> Interest groups.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Interest groups certainly arrange these 
petitions, as the hon. member for Kenora-Rainy River 
suggests.
<P>
	Let me read what Mr. Burke had to say in another writing. I 
believe this one is a discourse on the French revolution. It is an 
interesting quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Because half a dozen grasshoppers under a fern make the field ring with their 
importunate chink, whilst thousands of great cattle, reposed beneath the shadow 
of the British oak, chew the cud and are silent, pray do not imagine that those 
who make the noise are the only inhabitants of the field; that of course, they are 
many in number; or that, after all, they are other than the little, shrivelled, 
meagre, hopping, through loud and troublesome insects of the hour.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>D (1330 ) </B>
<P>
	I would not want to suggest that quotation would apply to all 
interest groups, not at all. The fact is it does happen that some 
interest groups reflect that kind of difficulty not just for 
governments but for oppositions as well. They come to members 
of Parliament and demand that members present petitions on 
their behalf. The member may not agree with the petition and yet 
feels duty bound to make the presentation and does so.
<P>
	I can assure hon. members on all sides that occasionally a 
member will be asked to present a petition with which the 
member does not agree and the member will be placed in some 
difficulty. There are two ways. One can do it through the back 
door, filing it with the clerk, or one can stand up and make a 
presentation in the House and have it handed in in the way we 
normally do.
<P>
	That option is there under Standing Order 36. Members can 
choose. They can do it whichever way they want.
<P>
	What happened with petitions in the past? In the last session 
of the last Parliament, 5,282 petitions were presented. In the 
session before that, the second session of the last Parliament, 
14,581 petitions were examined. Of those, 8,631 were presented 
in the House.
<P>
	We had a tremendous number of petitions presented over the 
five years during which that Parliament sat, over almost 14,000 
petitions presented in Parliament during the two sessions. I do 
not think any were presented in the first session. If so, there were 
very few.
<P>
	The bulk of those petitions presented dealt with the goods and 
services tax. Are we going to have a debate on every one of these 
petitions every time the GST comes up? There is ample 
opportunity for debate of petitions. There is room for 
improvement, and as the chair of this committee I will be 
listening very closely as to how this can be improved.
<P>
	Look at the opportunities. First of all, many of the petitions 
deal with government business and the GST was debated in this 
House, although for a very limited time because the government 
was closure hungry and used closure at every turn. There was an 
opportunity for debate.
<P>
	On other subjects members can move motions under Private 
Members' Business and those motions can not only deal with the 
substance of petitions, but the motions can move that the subject 
matter be referred to a committee for detailed study. Those 
motions are debatable in this House in private members' hour, 
admittedly for a limited time but they are debatable and a 
reference could be made to a committee by virtue of that motion.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<><B><A NAME="1602"><A HREF="DOCNAME#1602">1602</A></A></B>
<P>
	There are opportunities for asking questions about petitions. 
There are opportunities after a question has been asked for a 
debate on the late show that can concern the subject matter of 
petitions.
<P>
	Government business generally deals with matters that are 
subjects of petitions and debates will be held. Many of the 
petitions being presented today deal with recall. I think the 
members from the Reform Party have been presenting those 
items.
<P>
	We had a debate on that subject the other day. We referred the 
matter to the committee I have the honour to chair for detailed 
study and we will be looking at it further.
<P>
	These subjects are debated in Parliament. They may not be 
debated the same day the petition is presented but usually if the 
matter is important there are thousands of petitions on the same 
subject presented over an extended period of time and I hope it is 
not being suggested that we have a debate every time one of 
these is presented.
<P>
	In addition, the government is required to respond to 
petitions. The hon. member for Fraser Valley West said these 
were ignored by the government. That is not true. It is required 
to respond within 45 days and I have no doubt that within a few 
days I will be tabling government responses to petitions in the 
House.
<P>
	The member says the minister does not respond. These 
responses are signed by the minister and are made available in 
the House to members who have filed a petition. If others want 
copies, they are available. These are not something that are 
ignored. These petitions are presented and dealt with.
<P>
	I am sorry my time has run out. It is hard to believe that it has 
gone so quickly and I am sorry I cannot continue.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened to my colleague's comments with great 
interest and would like to make a few comments and also ask a 
question.
<P>
	First of all, he commented that my party, the Reform Party, 
seems to have only one agenda which is illustrated by our 
questions in question period. Specifically, we deal quite often 
with matters of more direct democracy.
<P>
<B>D (1335 ) </B>
<P>
	We think that Canadians' priorities are economic issues and 
we have been trying to ask those types of questions but have not 
been able to get answers from the government. It keeps saying it 
cannot answer those questions until the budget is delivered. In 
the meantime we have been asking questions about another issue 
Canadians spoke to us about regarding their lack of involvement 
and input on the decisions that are made in this House.
<P>
	I was glad to hear the hon. member say that he feels there 
could be some improvements and would be willing to have the 
procedure and House affairs committee look at changes to the 
way we handle petitions. I think that is the gist of this motion, 
and the motion only calls for at least once during a session that 
petitions be considered by this House as a whole.
<P>
	My major concern is that this House has lost its concern and 
respect for Canadians as individuals. The member quoted Sir 
Edmund Burke and while he was quoting I almost thought I was 
listening to a Tory politician from days gone by. It was that type 
of attitude that saw them practically eliminated from this House, 
saying if we do not like what they are doing, judge them on their 
record, come back in a few years and kick them out. That is what 
Canadians did.
<P>
	As it turned out, they gave the Tories two mandates because 
they had this lagging memory of what Liberal governments had 
done previous to that and they were not prepared to make a 
change until that memory because so faint that the Conservative 
memory was more direct in their minds and they said we have to 
change this government. They were not yet knowledgeable 
enough about Reform. We will to do some things to correct that 
situation so that the Reform Party could form the government.
<P>
	The problem is that politicians appear to be far too elitist.
<P>
	The hon. member also mentioned interest groups. Interest 
groups play a vital role in what happens in Canada, the issues of 
the day. Would he rather see interest groups use government 
funding to lobby, to use paid advertising, oftentimes with that 
advertising paid for by taxpayers through their grants by 
government?
<P>
	Would the hon. member rather see those interest groups have 
to go out to the public, to individual Canadians, who are really 
important, and see if they could get their support by putting their 
name on a petition that would be brought to this House with the 
potential that it might actually be debated?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think the hon. member for 
Kindersley-Lloydminster in his comments is being perhaps a 
little unfair in judging the previous Liberal government. Those 
of us who ran in the 1988 election had fond memories of the very 
excellent previous Liberal government and we feel that 
Canadians were duped into voting for the Conservative Party in 
1988 because they seemed to believe that free trade would bring 
unbounded prosperity to Canada. We now know that has not 
been the case. That was discovered by Canadians, unfortunately, 
in the period between 1988 and 1993 and the situation has 
therefore been corrected.
<P>
	In 1988, in my view, there was no recollection of any 
disastrous previous Liberal government.
<P>
	The hon. member for Kindersley-Lloydminster, as I say, has 
I think altered history a little in his question. Perhaps when he 
<P>
<HR>
<><B><A NAME="1603"><A HREF="DOCNAME#1603">1603</A></A></B>
<P>
reads my remarks again tomorrow his  memory will be 
refreshed, although I can see it is not sinking in at the moment.
<P>
	With respect to the question he asked, he knows that what he is 
trying to do is get me to denounce government funding to 
interest groups and say that somehow this government funding 
is inherently bad where interest groups use the money to lobby 
government. Obviously, some interest groups become a bit of a 
thorn under the saddle, as it were, for governments, particularly 
so where the government is already funding the group and 
paying for it to be such a thorn under the saddle. I am sure he 
would agree with me that cutting such funding would be very 
worthwhile.
<P>
	On the other hand, it is very important that interest groups 
sometimes be paid, moneyed, in order to represent the interests 
of the groups that they are seeking to espouse or advance 
because sometimes the groups are unable to fund themselves 
and pay for necessary representation. For one reason or another, 
they are under-represented in our system.
<P>
	I can think of examples of that, examples that I will not give to 
the House today because it might exclude some others. I think 
there are reasons for government to be involved in the funding of 
interest groups, even where the interest group is using the 
money to lobby government. Governments sometimes need this 
kind of lobbying, in part to convince others of the benefits to be 
derived from government activity or interest in that particular 
area.
<P>
<B>D (1340 ) </B>
<P>
	There is an educational role for governments to perform that 
governments are aided in by interest groups. While the activity 
may be directed at the government, the effect is to educate the 
general public on the importance of the subject and sometimes 
that happens.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon member 
has made a very eloquent attack upon the reforms of government 
that the Reform Party has put forward through this motion. I find 
that what he had to say is quite different from when he spoke to 
the Reform Party caucus at the time he was presenting himself as 
we approached the election of the Speaker. I see the difference 
between what he indicated to us at that time with regard to the 
reform of this place and some of the reforms that we are 
advocating.
<P>
	Some of the things he said in his speech were very interesting 
to me. He quoted Mr. Burke as stating it was the duty of the 
member to take into consideration all facets and represent the 
national good. During the referendum of 1992 we saw all 
members of this place follow the party line set by their 
leadership. We saw that of most of them, the vast majority of 
them. They were not listening to the people.
<P>
	Therefore, the national good, if it was a national good that was 
decided in that referendum, was not decided by the elected 
members of this country. It was decided by the people through a 
free vote offered by the referendum of that time.
<P>
	The member has indicated that the system has served us well 
for 125 years and that all is going smoothly. He has failed to 
mention the national energy program that was foisted upon the 
west and decimated the oil industry, the energy industry in that 
part of the country, and our focus upon the need to reform the 
Senate, the upper House of Parliament, that could have stopped 
that unfair legislation at the time, unless he supports the national 
energy program.
<P>
	I ask him a general question of whether he sees no merit at all 
in the attempts that the people of Canada have made through the 
election of not only reformers but many new members in this 
House to bring about a more democratic change within this 
place.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Crowfoot 
seems to be under a slight misapprehension. I want to say very 
clearly that I support discussion of some of these proposals and I 
am not adverse to all of the proposals being put forward by the 
Reform Party.
<P>
	However, a fundamental change in our system, such as would 
happen if recall were adopted for example, I am not a supporter 
of. I will hear the arguments on it but I have very grave doubts 
that it will enhance our system. In my view it will damage it.
<P>
	I quoted Mr. Burke because I think it casts an obligation. The 
words he used indicate the obligation that is cast on members of 
Parliament to vote in accordance with their best judgment and it 
did not mean, and I am sure the member knows this, voting as a 
block, voting with your party on all occasions. Your best 
judgment is what is required. That is what Mr. Burke said. He 
did not say one voted with one's party on all occasions and I did 
not read any such quote. That is a significant difference. One of 
the planks that Reform is pushing here is free votes and I did not 
say I disagreed with that.
<P>
	The government House leader in his speech on the throne 
speech debate a few weeks ago indicated that there would be 
freer votes in this Chamber. I urge the hon. member to read the 
government House leader's very clear speech that elucidated 
extensively the government's view on free votes. It was a 
masterpiece of clarity.
<P>
	The hon. member indicated that he thought that in the 
referendum campaign somehow I was ignoring the wishes of my 
electors. I can only say to the hon. member for Crowfoot that the 
electors of Kingston and the Islands voted yes, agreeing with me 
fully in my stand in respect of the national referendum. The yes 
side won by a narrow margin in Kingston and the Islands and I 
was very pleased that it agreed with me in my views on the 
referendum. I suspected it would when I took my position on 
that whole issue. I supported that cause in the House and as we 
<P>
<HR>
<><B><A NAME="1604"><A HREF="DOCNAME#1604">1604</A></A></B>
<P>
went to the people in the referendum  campaign. For him to 
suggest that somehow members on this side ignored the wishes 
of their electors is false. I fully represented the wishes of my 
electors then as now.
<P>
<B>D (1345) </B>
<P>
	Finally I note the member went on about the national energy 
policy. I was not here when that was devised. I can only say I 
think it has been blamed for everything that has gone wrong in 
western Canada since it was implemented, and I do not think that 
is accurate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island):</B> Mr. Speaker, when citizens take 
the initiative of creating, organizing and collecting a petition I 
have observed that they are always highly motivated to do so. A 
trivial matter does not normally elicit that kind of response. A 
matter which the people hold dear, something that is very 
important to them, will result in their coming together, 
organizing a petition, getting it circulated, collecting names and 
doing so because they believe it is very important.
<P>
	It takes a great deal of effort and personal sacrifice on the part 
of organizers of petitions. The people who sign petitions usually 
do so with total sincerity and with a genuine support of the cause 
being promoted. I believe it is very seldom a person will sign a 
petition without asking very seriously the question: ``What am I 
signing?'' I also believe once a petition is started it has another 
very desirable effect: it generates a lot of discussion so the issue 
being brought forward is debated by a great number of people in 
the community. The level of information or the understanding of 
the topic is enhanced because of the debate.
<P>
	Therefore the question should arise of what politicians or 
decision makers do with these petitions. I believe it is the 
perception of a great number of Canadians that the process by 
which a petition is handled is that an MP is given a small amount 
of time in the House to make a supporting speech when the 
petition is presented. It is recorded in <I>Hansard</I> and other 
documents as having been presented. Then it appears that the 
petition is trucked off to a warehouse somewhere. It is very 
seldom we have any action on the petition. In any case it is 
extremely seldom that we have any precipitous action or fast 
action.
<P>
	I think of one example. In the last little while many petitions 
have been presented in the House on killer cards. There appear 
to be a great number of Canadians like me who are more and 
more concerned about the growing element of violence in 
society. They say that this is an area where we need to put our 
finger in the dike, that we need to stop this.
<P>
	The petitions are pouring in here, but what is done with them? 
At this stage apparently nothing. I emphasize the word 
apparently. It is undoubtedly true it has been recognized that the 
government will respond. However the fact is there must be an 
increased level of communication with Canadians so they have 
assurance that when they speak they are heard.
<P>
	We in Parliament are embarking on a new era. This a new 
Parliament. Things are now being done differently. We have 
approximately 200 new members in the House who, like me, are 
eager to make an impact on the way our country is governed.
<P>
	I cannot resist quoting from the now famous red book. Some 
of the ideas in the red book were found earlier in the Reform 
Party's blue book. That ought not to be surprising since the red 
book came out during the election period, at a time when 
politicians seeking re-election had a great interest in finding out 
what people were thinking. They probably conducted polls, 
listened to the people at the doors and heard what they were 
saying, and as a result those things were included in the red 
book.
<P>
<B>D (1350) </B>
<P>
	We were doing the same thing over a number of years. The 
process by which our blue book was derived was really quite 
similar in the sense that we were listening to the people. We 
heard a great number of people say over and over: ``We do not 
have a true democracy; we have an elected dictatorship''. That is 
a bad word, yet that is the word I kept hearing. They were 
saying: ``We elect these people and once they are elected they 
have a free hand and they do whatever they want; they do not 
listen to us on an ongoing basis''.
<P>
	As a result the blue book reflected what the Canadian people 
were thinking. It came up with these wonderful and much 
needed concepts about the way our government works: things 
like petitions, citizens' initiative of which the petition is a form, 
referendums and recall so that not only at election time but also 
between elections the people of the country have a say in how 
they are governed.
<P>
	I quote one very important sentence from the red book that 
accurately expresses the feeling of the Canadian people: ``The 
people are irritated with governments that do not consult them''.
<P>
	We must stop to think about the implications. We have had 
elections anywhere from six months to five years. That is how 
our elections are occurring and when the people are being heard. 
If that is satisfactory why are the people irritated with 
governments that do not consult them? Clearly it is because they 
are not being consulted between elections. That is the crux of the 
matter when we think of an efficient way of dealing with 
petitions, citizens' initiatives, the subjects of recall and of 
referendums.
<P>
	If the people are irritated when we do not consult them, how 
much more irritated they must be when they voluntarily, by 
petition, bring an issue to us in the House and we leave the 
perception that we are not paying attention. How much more 
irritated they are when we ignore the hard work that went into 
<P>
<HR>
<><B><A NAME="1605"><A HREF="DOCNAME#1605">1605</A></A></B>
<P>
the collection of a petition with thousands or tens of thousands 
of names. We must start listening and acting on what they say.
<P>
	There is a very important fundamental question. A member 
opposite made reference not very long ago to the fact that we in 
the Reform Party keep coming up with these reforms to the 
parliamentary system. I contend that is really fundamental to 
everything else. Unless we have a true representative 
democracy, we will probably never be able to solve the other 
problems that come to us from time to time. In particular I am 
thinking of the question of the national debt and the disaster 
being brought on us by its ever increasing size.
<P>
	The people are clearly saying that government spending must 
be brought under control, yet in the context of how the House 
operates there seems to be no real mechanism to say we will 
have a balanced budget. There is not a final authority in the 
House to determine that. The budget is announced to us and we 
have no real input into it other than to debate it and hope to 
influence the outcome.
<P>
	In a true democracy who then holds the final or ultimate 
authority? We seem quite ready to accede that it is the people. I 
find it interesting, being a new member of Parliament and from 
talking to many who have been here before and a great number 
who are here for the first time, that no one in the House would 
question the wisdom of the voters in choosing the person they 
sent here.
<P>
<B>D (1355 ) </B>
<P>
	The Reform Party and all of us who are members of that party 
are thinking the people in the west chose very wisely. I am sure 
members opposite are convinced the voters expressed great 
wisdom in sending them here. If we can trust the voters to make 
a decision on whom to send here, on which party to vote for and 
on which leader to support, should we not also be able to trust 
them with other issues? This touches on the subject of 
referendums as well as on the subject before the House today.
<P>
	There is a large demand out there among the people for a more 
representative government, for representation in a more 
democratic style. The people are beginning to insist that they be 
heard. Their willingness to be governed by legislatures will be 
withdrawn if we act like dictators.
<P>
	Furthermore, if we listen more to our people and the message 
they give through referenda and through petitions, I am 
convinced we will have wiser decisions. There are many 
examples where the people in the broad context make better 
decisions for the country than do those who sit in little islands of 
isolation.
<P>
	I look forward to questions or debate of other members.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Eugène Bellemare (Carleton-Gloucester):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member for Elk Island talked about the motion 
making petitions the subject matter of debate, which I find 
totally ridiculous, especially the part where it says that petitions 
will be brought to a vote at the end of the debate.
<P>
	If Reform members had sat here for the last five years, as I 
have done, they would realize all the problems this would 
create. Reform members keep saying that this government and 
this Parliament spend too much. Does he not recall that the last 
referendum cost more than a quarter of a billion dollars and does 
he not realize that holding referendums on almost everything, 
year in and year out, will cost billions of dollars?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The Reform Party is suggesting that for every petition there 
be a major debate and major vote. That kind of law or rule could 
be absolutely divisive. We have heard the Reform Party contest 
the official languages, for example. It is trying to divide the 
country further? That is the intent of the Reform Party.
<P>
	If any of you have ever sat on municipal council, you would 
probably remember that homeowners on a single street-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I know the hon. member would want to address 
the Chair in his question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellemare:</B> Mr. Speaker, they would experience, sitting 
on a city council or municipal council, that often when 
petitioning a street people are divided on the same topic. They 
could get 100 people signing the petition, signing yes. Yet on the 
same street people would be signing on the no side.
<P>
	How do we verify the correctness of the signature or the age of 
the people? Who does all of that? What kinds of expenses would 
we get involved in trying to make sure that every signature was 
bona fide, that every person signing was of age, that every 
person signing was not half drunk, or that we are not getting a 
bunch of loonies or bigots constantly signing petitions who do 
not believe in the proper process?
<P>
	We have seen in the case of the member from Markham that 
people are banding together like lynch mobs in a village trying 
to hang someone without due process.
<P>
<B>D (1400 ) </B>
<P>
	Maybe lynching was good in the thirties or sixties of the 19th 
century in Alabama. In Canada this is not what we want. We are 
not made up of bigots.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Epp:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would simply comment that if the 
member for Carleton-Gloucester insists on demeaning his 
<P>
<HR>
<><B><A NAME="1606"><A HREF="DOCNAME#1606">1606</A></A></B>
<P>
electors and saying they are bigots when they present their 
petitions or when they vote on a referendum, that is his choice.
<P>
	I would choose rather to listen to my constituents, to take very 
seriously what they say in terms of a referendum or a petition 
which they present. There may be some difficulties 
administratively but they can certainly be overcome in our 
modern technological age and there is great gain to be made by 
listening more and more to the people who sent us here.

	Today this centre kicks off a week-long conference at Acadia 
University for people considering a career in self-employment.
<P>
	The conference, entitled ``Exploring Your Future: Learning 
About Entrepreneurship'', will allow participants to determine 
if self-employment is right for them and if so how they go about 
starting a business.
<P>
	Following this conference, 35 participants will be selected for 
a 14-week employment training program.
<P>
	Not only does such a conference play an important role in 
promoting the local community network but it also provides 
valuable services and information for those wishing to get their 
new ventures off the ground.
<P>
	I fully support the efforts of the Acadia Centre for Small 
Business and Entrepreneurship and ask that the members of this

	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my constituents have overwhelmingly opposed any 
reduction in the RRSP contribution limits. Reducing these 
limits is increasing taxes for those ordinary Canadians such as 
small business owners and employees who use RRSPs as their 
sole means of preparing for retirement.
<P>
	I have also received literally hundreds of letters of support for 
the home buyers plan which is due to expire at the end of this 
month. This plan utilizes the RRSP program to make home 
ownership a viable option for many Canadians and has been that 
rare bird, a successful government program that does not cost 
the treasury a cent.
<P>
	I hope that the finance minister has considered these voices of 
ordinary Canadians as he prepares his upcoming budget.
<P>
	On behalf of my constituents in 
Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, I ask the finance minister 
to stop speaking in code. Broadening the tax base means raising

soon as they arrived here, they started the procedures with the 
department of immigration to straighten out their situation in

themselves to the Quebec community. They never asked for any 
form of government assistance. The academic successes of the 
children illustrate how well integrated they are. This is a model 
family.
<P>
	Yet, the applications made by that family have been rejected 
because authorities feel that there is no proven risk of 
persecution if they return to Romania. So, after three years in

we going to celebrate the International Year of the Family by

	As the House may know, the Europeans had brought forward a

justify cancelling the air strikes.

	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs): </B>Mr. 
Speaker the withdrawal of heavy artillery or its transfer to UN 
control has improved the situation very substantially, and the 
process is definitely producing the results expected by UN and 
NATO members.
<P>
	The demilitarization of Sarajevo will continue, and that is 
why we felt it was important to maintain the threat of air strikes 
for the use in cases where either the Serbs or the Muslims would 
be inclined to bring back and use this heavy artillery.

like to ask the minister whether he could tell us what strategies 
are being considered by Canada and its partners to end the 
fighting in Bosnia and thus prevent the Serbs from taking the 
heavy artillery withdrawn from Sarajevo and using it to fight 
elsewhere in Bosnia?

	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we feel that diplomatic initiatives by the Americans 
and the Russians helped to create a climate that is far more 
promising than has been the case so far. We feel that these 
diplomatic initiatives must continue and should be pursued in 
order to get the three parties involved in this conflict-Serbs, 
croats and Muslims-to agree to a peace process that would

statutory authority to spend on certain programs would cease

year.

her government and the Minister of Finance since January 17.
<P>
	Does the government intend to get the money where it is to be 
found, in other words, from Canada's big corporations which 
have not paid a penny in taxes since 1987, even when their 
profits are sky-high, and from the wealthiest Canadian families 
that use family trusts to avoid paying taxes? That is where the 
billions to cover the shortfall in the government's annual budget 
could be found.
<P>
	Does her government intend to cut in those areas and spare 
middle income Canadians?

	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister

for the Bloc Quebecois would not, for instance, want us to touch 
the tax shelters available to the Fonds de solidarité. I believe 
there are a number of government instruments that are very 
important for economic development.
<P>
	The member says we should review these tax shelters to deal 
with the problem, and of course we all agree that the tax burden 
should be shared. We cannot put the whole burden on only 2 per 
cent of the population because that is not going to solve the 
problem. We must all be prepared to do our share. I would like to 
see the opposition be part of this process, which will not be easy

question is for the Deputy Prime Minister. This matter was 
brought to my attention by members of the Somali community 
and the media.
<P>
	It appears that an alleged human rights abuser from the brutal 
Barre regime of Somalia now resides in the Ottawa area. When 
will the Deputy Prime Minister see to it that this individual is 
investigated and that these allegations of brutality are 
substantiated? If they are substantiated will deportation 
proceedings begin immediately?

	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. 
member for his question and tell him that as we speak 
departmental officials are investigating these allegations.
<P>
	There are provisions in the Immigration Act to remove 
persons who are senior officials of a government engaged in 
gross human rights violations. Should it be confirmed that this 
subject was a senior official of the Barre government, the 
Minister of Citizenship and Immigration will ensure, as he has 
done in the past, that removal action is taken.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, a 
supplemental to the Deputy Prime Minister.
<P>
	Last week I asked the minister of immigration how many 
more examples of abuse Canadians should have to tolerate. 
Stories of criminals and human rights abusers entering Canada 
surface regularly in the media despite the minister's assurances 
to the contrary.
<P>
	When does the Deputy Prime Minister, or the Prime Minister 
for that matter, expect the immigration minister to start doing 
his job rather than leaving it to the media?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration):</B> Mr. Speaker, we can say the 
immigration minister is doing a superb job under due process of 
law.

	This country has long been an open one and one that is 
delighted to receive immigrants and refugees from those 
countries not as fortunate as Canada and this process will 
continue.

	There are laws in place and occasionally those laws are 
broken. When they are broken there is due process to ensure that

question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	On Friday, February 18 last, the minister announced the 
make-up of the expert committee which will have slightly less 
than two months to advise him on the ambitious proposed 
reform of Canada's income security system and labour market.
<P>
	However, the House committee will have only 12 days to hear 
testimony from individuals and groups and to advise the 
minister on the concerns and priorities of Canadians.
<P>
	Considering this unrealistic timetable, my question is will the 
minister concede that in fact, his action plan is already in place, 
that it is the same as the Conservatives and that he prefers to 
consult a committee of experts at $500 per day rather than allow 
enough time for public consultations?

	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources

<P>
<B>D (1435 ) </B>
<P>
	The hon member should not underestimate the capacity of this 
Parliament to provide an open forum for Canadians to be heard, 
making sure there is broad consultation and to perform the 
valuable task of ensuring that a range of opinions from one coast 
to the other is clearly brought forward as the first stage in 
consultation. Then the committee can get on with a longer 
review of an action plan so there can be something specific.
<P>
	The attempt by the hon. member to try to subvert or short 
change the work of this committee does not do much credit to 
her role as opposition critic. It is very important that Parliament 
get down to work and give Canadians an opportunity to be heard 
so that we can come together with the reform all Canadians 
want.

	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, my question today is for the Minister of Indian 
Affairs and Northern Development.
<P>
	Canadian Press yesterday reported that the minister walked 
out of a meeting between the representatives of the Lesser Slave 
Lake band council and the Sawridge Indian band. Apparently the 
minister found the Sawridge band's approach to aboriginal 
self-government unacceptable. As I understand it, the Sawridge 
proposals call for a municipal government approach and an 
opting out of the Indian Act.
<P>
	Could the minister please tell the House today what he finds 
so objectionable about this approach?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Sawridge bill does not address 
the issue of Bill C-31, returnees now before the court.
<P>
	When the Sawridge bill came before the former government, 
probably aided and abetted by the former minister, it was not 
accepted by cabinet. It was not accepted by the Department of 
Justice which said that it did not respect the crown's obligations 
to a band as a whole.
<P>
	This was rejected by me, by my leader and by this 
government. We are looking at Bill C-31, the Cree nation as a 
whole when we say that the inherent right of self-government 
exists and we will work within that framework.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the Sawridge band has put forward a practical 
approach to self-government, one that meets the needs of the 
Sawridge community.
<P>
	Is the minister looking to impose a single model of aboriginal 
self-government on Canada's native people, or is he open to 
negotiating agreements on a band by band basis?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development):</B> Mr. Speaker, we are looking at all the cultural 
aspects of self-government.
<P>
	It is very serious. For instance, further north the elders pick 
the chiefs and sometimes when the chiefs get back to their 
villages they are no longer chiefs. With the Ojibways, the elders 
sit as advisers. With the Mohawks it is a longhouse culture. 
There is no one set model of self-government in this nation.
<P>
	However, I will say that the Sawridge band is probably one of 
the richest bands in this country. It is sitting on tens of millions 
of dollars. That band is saying to its people that it will not share. 
That is not the way this government or Canadians should 
operate.

	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister

exactly at the time of the Oka crisis, but in an article from the 
Saturday edition of <I>Le Soleil</I>, the president of the police

smuggling problem on native reserves started in 1988, when the

question is for the Minister of Natural Resources.
<P>
	During January of this year the National Energy Board held 
lengthy meetings in southern Ontario as a result of an 
application made by Interprovincial Pipeline and Intercoastal 
Pipeline to extend a line from the U.S. to Canada.
<P>
	Hundreds of landowners had legitimate concerns and wanted 
to intervene. The federal energy act has no provision for 
intervener funding. As a result of this line crossing the 
Canada-U.S. border the applicant corporations did not have to 
payintervener funding which amounted to millions of dollars. 
The farmers, school boards and other landowners were required 
to pay this out of their own pockets.
<P>
	What will the minister do to persuade Interprovincial and 
Intercoastal Pipelines to pay reasonable costs of interveners? 
Does the minister have any plans to amend the legislation to 
ensure that this does not occur again?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Natural Resources):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the hon. member from Sarnia for his question. 
As the hon. member has pointed out, under the present National 
Energy Board Act there is no authorization for the National 
Energy Board to provide for reimbursement of expenses to 
interveners in these particular circumstances.
<P>
<B>D (1445) </B>
<P>
	Let me say, however, that the National Energy Board is very 
sensitive to the cost implications of these hearings and attempts 
to hold hearings in affected communities, as it did in this case, to 
ensure that costs are minimized and that we can maximize local 
community participation.
<P>
	Let me also say that it is not possible for me to order the two 
pipeline companies the member has mentioned to pay or 
reimburse intervener expenses as there is no legal requirement 
for them to do so.
<P>
	In conclusion, however, let me reassure the hon. member that 
I am very concerned about the issue he has raised. I have 
instructed my department to consider all feasible 
reimbursement mechanisms that we might look to in the future.

	I assure her a distinction that was not made in some of the

failing to pay their fair share of taxes.

	Would the minister not agree that to offer an opinion as to 
the appropriateness of the deputy minister and the assistant 
deputy minister's conduct goes beyond the terms of reference 
of the audit and beyond the capabilities of the auditor?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would say to the hon. member that it is quite 
extraordinary to have an audit conducted by an outside auditor, 
by a chief forensic auditor, and to have such a straightforward 
conclusion arrived at.
<P>
	It is my view that once the conclusion is arrived at-and we 
are dealing with senior public officials-it is then the 
responsibility of members of Parliament and the responsibility 
of those who made allegations which caused this investigation 
to occur in the first place either to accept the advice of an 
independent auditor or to bring new evidence forward.
<P>
	We ought not to call into question the reputations of long 
serving public servants for our own political advantage at any 
given point in time.

	<B>Mr. Bernard Deshaies (Abitibi):</B> Mr. Speaker, the mining 
sector, one of the most important in terms of jobs and economic 
benefits, is currently in a very serious situation. In 1987 the 
federal government decided to reduce its fiscal effort regarding 
flow-through shares, which were designed to boost mining 
exploration. This unfortunate decision, which was denounced 
among others by the Quebec government, is a major cause of the 
serious problems experienced by this sector.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Natural Resources. Does 
the minister agree that a recovery of the mining exploration 
sector can only occur by increasing flow-through shares to 133 
per cent?

constituencies in Canada, that we have received assurances from 
the European Union, Denmark and Norway, even though they 
abstained on the vote which put in place a moratorium on 3NO 
cod stocks, it is their intention to abide by the decision of NAFO 
not to use the objection procedure. It means that the 
government, as was committed by the Prime Minister, has 
achieved a beginning in the battle against overfishing.

because of the tough and determined new position of this

<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to take part in the debate today on our supply motion. I 
will be speaking specifically to paragraph (c):
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>a petition which will be presented requesting the government to bring 
forward a bill which would make recall of members of the House of Commons a 
part of the law.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Parliamentary reform has been a subject of intense interest in 
the House for many years. Our party, in response to the views of 
the Canadian public, has proposed several measures and several 
reforms designed to restore powers to Parliament and improve 
the state of representative democracy.
<P>
	Representative democracy is improved when citizens are both 
willing and able to express their views to us as their 
representatives. I say willing in the sense that Canadians must 
believe that their views will be received by us, their views will 
be listened to by us, and their views will be seriously considered 
by us.
<P>
	Regrettably many Canadians do not participate in the political 
process. Too many have become disillusioned, alienated and 
cynical about the entire political process. Those who actively 
participate in the political process, who still believed that an 
aroused and informed citizenry can make a difference, should be 
given every encouragement, should be given every reasonable 
means to express their views. That is why we chose this topic 
today.
<P>
	A citizens' petition is an ancient, traditional and sensible way 
for ordinary citizens to put their views before their government. 
We should encourage its use. One form of citizens' petition that 
the House can and should adopt as soon as possible is a citizens' 
petition for recall. It is my firm belief that recall legislation 
would provide voters with a greater sense of control over their 
representatives between elections. Recall would provide a 
means to counter the feelings of cynicism and alienation 
expressed by many Canadian voters about politicians, political 
parties and government.
<P>
	Recall would provide a disillusioned electorate with an 
instrument and a public process for some sort of practical 
action. Recall would enhance the role of constituents between 
elections and hence would improve dialogue between 
constituents and their representatives. Both parliamentarians 
and their constituents would be winners. Recall legislation 
would improve representative democracy.
<P>
	Members of Parliament should have nothing to fear from the 
introduction of recall legislation. Sensible provisions would be 
included in the legislation to prevent superfluous or 
mischievous use of this democratic reform. For example, a 
petition must be signed by a sufficiently high number of electors 
in a constituency to prevent mischief. Second, there would be a 
grace period after the general election before a recall petition 
would kick in. Third, a recall measure could only be used once 
per constituency, per term of an elected Parliament. Fourth, the 
recall process would be subject to strict regulation, verified by 
the Chief Electoral Officer, for example, procedures for 
verifying that all signatures are genuine and obtained through 
legitimate means. If that did not happen, a fairly severe fine 
would be in place.

<P>
	When talking about recall we need to say this is not something 
radical we are just thinking about doing now in Canada's 
Parliament. The citizens of ancient Athens had a democratic 
process to ostracize wayward politicians through banishment 
from Athens for a period of 10 years.
<P>
	Think of the number of members in this place. If our 
constituents were displeased with us they would banish us, or 
shun us to use a cultural term from my area, for 10 years. That 
certainly would make us consider strongly what kind of 
representatives we were.
<P>
	Some writers say this ancient process is the foundation for 
recall legislation we are discussing today. Recall has been a 
facet of the Swiss system of direct democracy for a long period 
of time. Fifteen U.S. states employ recall for elected state 
officials; 36 provide for recall of locally elected officials. No 
American state has ever repealed recall legislation once it was 
established. Recall has only been used successfully nine or ten 
times in that entire history. Obviously the system is not abused.
<P>
	The recall mechanism utilized in Alberta in 1936 was 
incorporated into a public law, but it had its defects. The Alberta 
recall bill was mentioned earlier, but in this case the law was too 
easily open to abuse by opposition parties and interest groups, 
and we have heard lots about them today.
<P>
	For example, the bill contained no provision prohibiting the 
purchase of signatures for a recall petition. Its first use was 
marred by this abuse when a group of Calgary lawyers 
reportedly offered the good citizens of High River up to $5 a 
signature to sign a recall petition against the premier. It is for 
that reason among many others whereby we believe very sound 
safeguards should be in place.
<P>
	When the Alberta recall bill was repealed by the Alberta 
legislature, it was done by a free vote. The premier at the time, 
William Aberhart, voted against that repeal, as did Ernest C. 
Manning, who was a cabinet minister at the time. The repeal was 
carried by a majority of the backbenchers who considered the 
bill to be defective.
<P>
	Some opponents of recall claim that members are elected 
primarily to carry out a mandate as detailed in their party's 
election platform and must often sacrifice the good of their 
constituents for the good of the whole. Recall, they claim, would 
encourage short term or parochial thinking to the detriment of 
the whole.
<P>
	Reformers agree that members must consider factors solely 
beyond the wishes of their constituents, but stress that a 
member's primary duty should not be to the party but to the 
constituents, to represent their concerns, their needs and their 
interests.
<P>
	Thomas E. Cronin, in his discussion of the pros and cons of 
recall in his book entitled <I>Direct Democracy: The Politics of 
Initiative, Referendum and Recall</I>, published by Harvard 
University Press, 1989, states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Today's critics of the recall device continue to view it as an invitation to unruly, 
impatient action and as a potential hazard to representative government. They 
also say it is another media age factor that could weaken the party system. No 
evidence exists to support either contention.</BLOCKQUOTE>
That bears repeating. Thomas Cronin said that no evidence 
exists to support either contention.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Power may not always corrupt, yet it does have this tendency. Recall strikes at 
incumbent arrogance.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	All of us in this place must pay attention to that. We must perk 
up our ears when we hear a sentence like that. It touches all of us 
because we are elected officials. Recall strikes at incumbent 
arrogance.
<P>
	I stand here in this Chamber today talking about MP recall not 
as an outsider, but as someone who has been elected once, in fact 
re-elected once also in the general election of October 1993. I 
am subject to MP recall as is every other member in this House. 
Therefore it cannot be said this is someone who is criticizing the 
process from the outside.
<P>
	In summary, as parliamentarians we should encourage 
citizens to express their views at all times and by all legitimate 
means. The citizens petition remains a valid and legitimate 
means. Its use should be respected and encouraged. The petition 
for recall would enable our citizens to rid themselves of those 
who violate their trust. It would encourage members to be more 
responsive to the views of their constituents and enhance the 
role of ordinary parliamentarians. It would promote 
representative democracy in this nation.
<P>
<B>D (1520) </B>
<P>
	Let me conclude with a couple of comments from the <I>Globe 
and Mail</I>, February 19, 1994. Kenneth Whyte in his article 
entitled ``The West'' says that the real problem with the 
government's response to all the questions we have asked in the 
last several weeks about representative democracy, member of 
Parliament recall, whether the government would allow a 
referendum on the issue of physician assisted suicide, is that it 
demonstrates the government has not a clue about what it is 
dealing with. He says that the issues of referenda and recall are 
of enormous symbolic importance. Nothing could be more true. 
He went on to say: ``The bottom line is that traditional political 
institutions will either open themselves to greater public 
participation or lose still more credibility''.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I lay it before you that MP recall is something we 
will need before the life of this Parliament is out.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, I begin by acknowledging the 
member as someone who has always been a strong advocate of 
<P>
<HR>
<><B><A NAME="1621"><A HREF="DOCNAME#1621">1621</A></A></B>
<P>
reform and works very  aggressively in this House and not just 
during the last Parliament.
<P>
	Let me be specific. Does the hon. member not believe when a 
member of Parliament is accused of something not suitable for 
this House that he or she should be subject to due process? What 
criteria would the hon. member use to put the recall process into 
motion?
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from 
Broadview-Greenwood. We have agreed on many things and I 
suspect on this issue probably we are not totally in 
disagreement.
<P>
	We had a chat earlier about the whole idea of what due process 
is. If we were to look at a particular example-we would be 
naive if we did not address it-there is a situation in front of us 
in which we are looking at a member's credentials.
<P>
	When talking about the due process of law, I am all in favour 
of that. I am sure both sides of this House are. The question 
would be what I asked my hon. friend this morning. I will ask 
him again. I know he cannot respond but I am sure many others 
will talk about this as the day goes on.
<P>
	Why was due process not followed initially in the case of the 
member for Markham-Whitchurch-Stouffville? If this had 
gone through due process we would have seen that. If the issue 
of credentials was the only thing in question perhaps it would 
have been short circuited had the Prime Minister gone through 
due process by looking at the credentials and saying he would 
hold off on a decision until he had reviewed the situation.
<P>
	It is a pretty big step to throw someone out of caucus. We 
witnessed it in the last Parliament. We have witnessed it here 
again.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> He resigned.
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> Let us make sure that due process is followed on 
both sides of the issue and not just from one.
<P>
	In terms of the criteria for the process of recall, we would 
need 50 per cent plus one of the number of voters who cast their 
ballots in the last election and there would be a waiting time, a 
period of grace as mentioned in my Bill C-210. It talks about a 
waiting period of 18 months. I will add an amendment which 
says that unless blatant misrepresentation has happened it could 
be triggered earlier. It would only happen once in the life of a 
Parliament so we would not be able to gang up on people over 
and over again.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to move the debate away from individuals and into 
the theoretical if I may do so. I am a historian by avocation. One 
of the things I have observed in my reading is that dictatorships 
as in the cases of Hitler and Mussolini are always founded in 
support from the people, usually massive support. Once 
dictatorships have captured the imagination of the people that 
tremendous support is used to implement things that are 
contrary to democracy.
<P>
<B>D (1525) </B>
<P>
	When it comes to something like this petition I see a danger 
when there is a very popular government. Would the hon. 
member for Beaver River be afraid that a government could take 
advantage of its popularity, get a petition and get rid of the 
dissenters thereby getting rid of the very people we would want 
to have in a democracy.
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> Mr. Speaker, I must confess I am not a historian. 
It seems to me that my entire speech was theoretical and it was 
only in response to a question from the hon. member for 
Broadview-Greenwood that we got into any specifics.
<P>
	Maybe it is a weakness in this Parliament in always talking 
about things theoretically, who knows. Let us be very clear 
about this danger to which the hon. member refers. If there is 
such a thing as a popular government, certainly maybe in the 
first 100 days it might be popular until it starts making demands 
on the public purse for instance. That is obviously what hurts 
people the most.
<P>
	Let us look at this specifically. The referendum a year ago 
indicated the specific mood of the people. They want power in 
their hands. I was asked if I see a danger in that. No, I do not. I do 
not think there is any danger whatsoever in being able to 
relinquish power, saying that this is what we think is important 
but we turn it over to the common sense of the people right 
across the country. The only thing that would be dangerous 
would be not to do that.
<P>
	I am always asked what the cost would be to check names and 
signatures on recall. I fire back the rhetorical question what is 
the cost if we do not do it? We see what is happening in this 
country from sea to sea. The people think their elected 
representatives are floating away.
<P>
	I do believe there is a real danger and a real cost of not 
instituting these essential parliamentary reforms which should 
be instituted in the life of this Parliament.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dan McTeague (Ontario):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish to 
commend the hon. member for Beaver River on her insights in 
terms of recall, but we do come back to this issue again and 
again.
<P>
	Earlier the hon. member's colleagues made reference to the 
citings of the great parliamentarian Edmund Burke. The 
suggestion was that Edmund Burke lost his election after he 
made the famous statements about judgment versus rubber 
stamp.
<P>
	That is what members are elected to do. In my riding over 
45,000 people elected me. I was a candidate who wished to stand 
on the principle of judgment, that my best principles and my 
<P>

best ideas are put forward and to the extent possible I am able to 
represent majority as well as minority interests.

	Since the hon. member has spent a considerable amount of 
time on this issue, given that Edmund Burke was never defeated, 
given that two members of her caucus have suggested that Mr. 
Burke was defeated, and that he ran consecutively from 1765 
until 1794 for all ridings of Wendover, Bristol, 
Malton-Yorkshire in that period of time would she not agree 
that the system proposed under recall is one that smacks-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Beaver River.
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> Thank you again, Mr. Speaker. To my friend from 
Ontario, I appreciate his comments but I think we are just about 
out of time.
<P>
	Edmund Burke probably has been mentioned more today than, 
who knows, when he was in the House. Maybe he was in for a 
long period of time. We are looking at many years ago in 
England. Certainly with the advent of television if nothing else, 
politics now goes into people's homes and they need to talk 
about it.
<P>
	Although I am sure Edmund Burke was a wonderful fellow, he 
believed firmly in the mandate theory: You have given me a 
mandate; I have come to serve you. We are not just mandated or 
delegated. We need a fine balance saying: ``If in my judgment 
this carries the weight of the people, yes I will give my 
judgment, but if in fact there could be a clear consensus that my 
constituents are instructing me in a particular way I must do that 
or I will go the road of Edmund Burke''.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to participate this afternoon in the debate 
on an opposition motion. The opposition, at least the third party 
in this Parliament, starts off with the premise that Parliament, as 
an institution, is broken. Parliament is not broken.
<P>
	Yes, the previous government lost the trust of the Canadian 
people. Yes, it was defeated because it lost that trust. However, 
that is not to say the institution itself is wrong. I say that to both 
parties across the way. I see that in their speeches, in their 
comments and elsewhere.
<P>
	When I hear from members of the Reform Party that 
Parliament as an institution needs to be turned completely 
upside down and changed because it does not work, I say they 
are wrong. When members of the Bloc Quebecois say that they 
think the country should separate because people disliked the 
previous government, I say they too are wrong. What was wrong 
was not Parliament. What was wrong was not this great 
institution. What was wrong was the public office holders of the 
last Parliament and that is not the same. It is high time we started 
to think on those terms.
<P>
	I read this motion today. Listen to it, Mr. Speaker, you who are 
so knowledgeable in all our rules. It states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should consider the 
advisability of amending the Standing Orders-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Whoever heard of anything so preposterous. The government 
does not have standing orders, the House has standing orders. I 
say to my colleagues across the way, many of whom have not 
been members very long, surely they could learn that the rules of 
the House are the rules of the House and not the rules of the 
government. Changing the rules is not done by the government. 
If the government decided to change the rules arbitrarily they 
would be the first to criticize.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The standing orders of this House are amended by and on the 
advice of a parliamentary committee which usually presents a 
unanimous report to the House. This committee report is tabled 
in the House and adopted by the House and then the rules of 
procedure are changed.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Some members will remember in the last Parliament when the 
then government took a report from a standing committee on 
amending the rules and chose to adopt only some of the rule 
changes. It was condemned by everyone, not because it had 
changed rules unilaterally but because it had not changed all of 
the rules at once as recommended in the unanimous report. It 
had upset the balance which is so vital to ensuring that the 
government can govern and that the opposition can hold the 
government to account. That was seen as wrong.
<P>
	The member across the way and her colleagues are proposing 
that the government on its own change the standing orders of the 
House. With due respect, it is absurd. It is completely absurd 
that a government would try to do that.
<P>
	The member wants the government, in changing the rules 
unilaterally, perhaps even against the wishes of the oppositions, 
to produce some sort of a formula to debate and to vote on 
petitions.
<P>
	I bring members' attention to today's Order Paper of the 
House of Commons. I highly recommend it to members of 
Parliament. It is a very useful document. It tells how this place 
works.
<P>
<B>D (1535) </B>
<P>
	Like many other members, I have Motion M-218 on today's 
Order Paper.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I can see for instance that the hon. member for 
Laurier-Sainte-Marie has one, and so does the hon. member 
for Anjou--
<P>
<HR>
<><B><A NAME="1623"><A HREF="DOCNAME#1623">1623</A></A></B>
<P>
Rivière-des-Prairies. It is unusual that not one member from 
the Reform Party has a motion on the Order Paper of the House. 
None, not one member from the Reform Party.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member: </B>It is impossible.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Yes, yes, it is true. None of them does.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Does the member realize that she and her colleagues can take 
the contents of a petition and put it up for debate through this 
mechanism? It is at page IV of the Order Paper. The process 
already exists. We can put a motion on any subject and ask that it 
be debated in the House, including the subject of a petition.
<P>
	I have put a motion on the Order Paper that reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House affirm its support for Section 241 of the Criminal Code of 
Canada which forbids the counselling, procuring, aiding, or abetting of a person 
to commit suicide-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I do not think we should change that provision. The member 
and I can disagree on that point when we can debate it. We can 
debate whether the point originated in a petition or elsewhere 
and we will vote on it in the House. That provision exists right 
now pursuant to our rules.
<P>
	Why are we offered this suggestion today? We already have 
the means to do it.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The hon. member tells us that she wants the Young Offenders 
Act changed, but did she put a bill on the Order Paper asking for 
such a change? As you know, all the members of this House can 
put forward private members' bills, bills which will then be 
debated and voted on by this House. Is there a need to create 
some new mechanism? Not at all. Mechanisms already exist and 
all these tools are already available to this House.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	No, Mr. Speaker. Perhaps our rules need to be changed and 
modified. I sit on the committee that deals with such matters, 
along with my colleague from Kingston and the Island, our 
colleague across the way and others. Many of them have done 
good work. However, some people are sucking and blowing at 
the same time.
<P>
	On Friday we proposed to change the prayer that we say in this 
House. Who was the first to complain? A member of the Reform 
Party said we should not touch it. It was a unanimous report of 
the committee voted on by the House. Even that was seen as 
being inappropriate even though it had the consent of virtually 
everyone.
<P>
	When members across the way talk about changing our 
institution, we agree. We have made it part of our red book. 
However, we want those changes to occur based on the consent 
of members of the House for the betterment of this institution, 
not just in a way to sell the doctrine to the people back in the 
riding that some have come here to Ottawa to turn this place 
upside down.
<P>
	The right to petition Parliament that has been talked about 
today existed in British parliamentary democracy since 1669. It 
has been a very important tool. I have used it. I have tabled 
petitions in this House. On Thursday I will be tabling 100,000 
signatures on petitions asking for the banning the importation of 
the serial killer board game.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> What did I do? I put a bill on the Order Paper 
asking to do just that, Bill C-203 if members will read their 
Order Paper again. Bill C-203 proposes to ban the importation 
of that product by modifying the Criminal Code. Those 150,000 
signatures I will be tabling plus the 50,000 I have tabled already 
are a testimony to the kind of support that initiative has.
<P>
	Therefore, I can ask my colleagues to vote on this. I will be 
using the mechanisms of petition to demonstrate that which I am 
proposing is worth while.
<P>
<B>D (1540 ) </B>
<P>
	What is the motion we are debating today supposed to do? It is 
supposed to give us an opportunity to vote on such things as the 
Young Offenders Act. That act requires no royal 
recommendation, so any private member can have a bill to 
change it. Any member can introduce a private member's 
motion to deal with a petition. Finally, on the issue of the serial 
killer cards, I have a parallel initiative right now on the Order 
Paper of this House.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	So, as you can see Mr. Speaker, it is not all to present motions 
because someone who perhaps was not too familiar with the 
procedure of this House could be led to believe that Parliament 
presently has none of the tools mentioned in this particular 
motion, while in fact it is quite the contrary. All these tools that 
the hon. member form the Reform Party for Edmonton 
Southwest is requesting are already available to the House. All 
of them without any exception already exist as described in his 
motion.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Today the member for Beaver River introduced something 
new. She said: we should have recall mechanisms. That has 
nothing to do with this motion of course, although I profoundly 
disagree with it.
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> I rise on a point of order, Mr. Speaker. I hate to be 
rude and interrupt, but our motion, first of all if it had been out 
of order, as this member has stated, would have been ruled out of 
order and inappropriate by the Table.
<P>
	Second, the hon. member has now had a few seconds to read 
it, my speech was entirely on paragraph (c) in the motion.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<><B><A NAME="1624"><A HREF="DOCNAME#1624">1624</A></A></B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member has made her point. I 
think we all appreciate that is a matter of debate rather than a 
point of order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rest my case about people 
learning about the rules of this place. When members purport to 
claim a point of order because they disagree with the content of 
the speech of another member it is not a point of order. In most 
cases-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Perhaps the member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, rather than trying to rub it into 
somebody, might get on with debate rather than go back to the 
point of order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, as I was saying before I was so 
rudely interrupted by the member across the way, the motion 
today proposes to give to the House the possibility of voting on 
petitions. All of that too exists now.
<P>
	I say to the hon. member, read Beauchesne, read the standing 
orders, read the Order Paper and then members who propose 
initiatives like this will know that those tools exist already.
<P>
	Finally, it is wrong for us to pretend in a motion or otherwise 
that the standing orders of the House are the standing orders of 
the government. That is wrong. The standing orders of the 
House belong to the House.
<P>
	I sat in opposition for a very long time and defended the 
privileges of this House on numerous occasions. When it was 
the government trying to run roughshod over the rights of MPs 
never in my wildest dreams would I have thought that an 
opposition member would be asking for those things that 
normally government members do not even dare to ask.
<P>
	Members of the House should vote against this motion. They 
should soundly defeat a motion that pretends that the standing 
orders of the House are the orders of the government and not the 
standing orders of Parliament. Members should vote to change 
the rules pursuant to reports from the Standing Committee on 
Procedure and House Affairs. A member of the Reform Party 
sits on that committee.
<P>
	We have just started our work. We have done good work as a 
committee.
<P>
<B>D (1545 ) </B>
<P>
	If a report from such a committee proposes to change the rules 
of the House and the report of the committee is not even 
unanimous, we will see, mark my words, that the same members 
who are now proposing that the government change the standing 
orders would rise in their seats in defiance if the government 
even tried to do that with all members of the committee except 
one who was perhaps dissident on a report.
<P>
	That is the irony of what we see today.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The motion before us today should not be adopted.
<P>
	I conclude by reiterating that it is not the same thing, and all 
the members of this House should be aware of the difference, to 
say that the previous government had lost the confidence of the 
Canadian people as to say that Parliament, as an institution, does 
not work.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This is one of the greatest freedoms that we have, to have an 
institution like this which has evolved from time immemorial, 
from the days prior to the Norman invasion of Britain. As my 
colleague the historian will know, there was even a form of 
representative institution in the days of the Witan, prior to the 
Norman invasion of Britain. This institution has evolved for 
perhaps 1,500 years.
<P>
	Just like when I sat across the way, as I now sit in government 
I want the changes to the rules to be changes that are acceptable 
to the House, to make us respond better to the wishes of our 
constituents, and to make us as well better equipped to make 
wise and sound decisions for those who have sent us here to 
speak on their behalf.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to make this short. We are not demanding that the 
government change the standing orders. If the motion is read 
carefully, I will state that the government should consider the 
advisability; in other words, seek unanimous consent 
throughout the House if this is something wise.
<P>
	Again I say, not on a point of order but as a comment, that if 
this were out of order it would have been ruled out of order by 
the table.
<P>
	Second, my hon. friend said in concluding his remarks that he 
encourages his colleagues to vote against this. Is he aware that 
this is a non-votable motion, as it says so clearly at the bottom 
line?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am perfectly aware of the fact 
that no vote was sought, although the opposition has the right to 
seek votes on any opposition motion. Such a vote would be a 
vote of confidence.
<P>
	Second, it is not a matter of whether the motion itself is out of 
order. Of course it is not out of order. As a matter of fact, placing 
the words ``consider the advisability'' in any motion makes it 
virtually always in order. As one who has proposed a number of 
motions when I sat across the way, whenever in doubt include 
the words ``consider the advisability'' and one will be pretty 
well always safe, as the Speaker will know.
<P>
	By including words like that it is obviously not out of order. 
That does not mean that the motion is worthy of support or that 
its contents are appropriate or that they are those which should 
be adopted by the government or by the House or anyone else.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<><B><A NAME="1625"><A HREF="DOCNAME#1625">1625</A></A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member started his speech by stating that the Reform Party 
thinks Parliament is broken. I would just like to inform him that 
we do not really think it is broken, we just think it needs a little 
refurbishing.
<P>
	We want more openness in this Parliament and we want more 
opportunity to allow the people of Canada in this information 
age to have more input into this House and to be able to see that 
we are actively debating issues that are of importance to them.
<P>
	The hon. member knows that the rules are changed by the 
government, in effect, because it has the voting power in this 
House. The standing order will be changed only with the 
approval of the government. The member also knows that 
motions on the Order Paper are extremely unlikely, by sheer 
volume, to ever come up for debate.
<P>
	The hon. member consistently refuses to agree to a new 
system that would bring better representation for his 
constituents. I would like to ask the member why he is afraid to 
debate petitions in this House in front of television cameras. Is 
he afraid that his constituents might see that he does not 
represent them properly in this House?
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> What was your last majority, Don?
<P>
<B>D (1550 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, my colleague reminds me that the 
electors of Glengarry-Prescott-Russell were kind enough to 
send me here with a substantial majority. We are equal as 
members, whether elected by one vote or two votes or whether 
the majority was larger, as I was fortunate enough to have 
received in the last election. Once we are here we are all equal 
and I recognize that.
<P>
	I made the case to the House and to the member that there 
exists a procedure right now through which the content of any 
petition can become votable through a motion. There is not one 
motion on the Order Paper in the name of any Reform Party MP. 
I have a copy of the Order Paper in front of me. It has six motions 
by the member for Richelieu who is a Bloc Quebecois member, 
one from the member for Winnipeg North, one from your 
humble servant from Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, two from 
the member for Kamloops, one from the member for 
Laurier-Sainte-Marie, one from the member for 
Saskatoon-Clark's Crossing, and one from the member for 
Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies. None of those ridings is 
represented by the Reform Party.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to say 
that I listened with great intent to the member opposite and I 
understand that the Liberals during the last campaign as shown 
in the red book were very eager to turn around this 
misconception or mistrust that the Canadian people have in 
government./
<P>
	They included things which I referred to earlier today 
regarding the fact that people are irritated with governments that 
do not consult them.
<P>
	My question is if the member is so opposed to the proposals 
we are putting forward in terms of referendum, recall, and today 
we are talking about the question of petitions, what does he 
propose as an alternative to open up government to the Canadian 
people as they seem to be demanding and as the red book 
acknowledges?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, I hate to put it this way but I am 
going to repeat this slowly.
<P>
	The motion today asked the government to change the rule of 
the House-this is the first thing that is wrong with it-in order 
for us to have a vote on petitions. There is already such a 
mechanism and many members have availed themselves of the 
privilege of putting motions before the House-everyone except 
Reform Party MPs.
<P>
	If they need any help with drafting those motions I will gladly 
go across and give them a hand.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I think the time has expired. I would 
hope that members would understand that the member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell and I were in the last House and, 
with respect, the kind of comment he just made a moment ago is 
one reason we got into trouble in the last House.
<P>
	I hope that members would avoid that sort of comment in the 
future.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Godin (Châteauguay):</B> Mr. Speaker, the first 
provision of the standing orders of the House of Commons that 
we should deplore is of course the one that allows a political 
party to table around two o'clock on Friday afternoon a motion 
to be debated the following Monday morning.
<P>
	Standing Order 43, which allows such little notice, should be 
the subject of today's debate because it shows the weakness 
when some groups in Parliament are not guided by a sense of fair 
play. But let that pass. This motion gives us an opportunity to 
dwell on our role as members of Parliament. We do not intend to 
deal with specific cases that were presented as examples in 
support of the motion today.
<P>
	What I want to do today is to deal with the nature of a petition, 
its meaning, the origin of such a form of representation to 
Parliament and the attitude we should have toward such means 
of communication which more often than not show that 
considerable effort was made to reach us as elected members.
<P>
	When the parliamentary system began in Canada with the 
Constitution Act, 1791, citizens' groups clearly understood that 
they could express their grievances and demands by appending 
their signatures to a joint declaration. Petitions are an integral 
part of the political system, whereas the actions of members and 
<P>
<HR>
<><B><A NAME="1626"><A HREF="DOCNAME#1626">1626</A></A></B>
<P>
their respective parties are not influenced either by the 
electronic media or by laws governing lobbyists.
<P>
<B>D (1555) </B>
<P>
	In the purest sense, a petition is a mechanism employed by a 
group of citizens who agree on a problem and on how it should 
be resolved. Quite often, sound ideas translate into co-operative 
efforts. In many cases, petitions have reflected a good deal of 
common sense and quite aside from broad expert analyses, they 
have often brought to light alternatives that legislative 
assemblies had not thought of or had not dared contemplate.
<P>
	We must, however, consider the flip side of this issue. We are 
not fools and each one of us has seen petitions supported by 
organizations with significant resources, and capable therefore 
of producing a disproportionate number of petitions, more than 
could be processed.
<P>
	In today's highly technological, computerized and mediatized 
society, it is more important than ever to distinguish public 
interest from personal interest, and actions taken in good faith 
from those taken with a personal goal in mind. The whole issue 
of petitions opens the door to a much broader issue, namely that 
of representations made to those who wield legislative power.
<P>
	Last week, a documentary called ``Les chemins de 
l'influence'' was shown on Radio-Canada's <I>Le Point</I>. This 
program clearly showed how lobbyists are organized and how 
they go about influencing decision-makers. When compared to 
such specialized lobbying techniques, petitions come across as 
the poor relation, to say the least. Yet, lobbyists are never 
directly quoted in the House of Commons, even though we know 
full well what kind of influence they have on those in power. The 
program I just mentioned gave the example of the 
pharmaceutical industry which succeeded in securing 
commitments from the Mulroney government and from the 
Minister of National Health and Welfare, Benoît Bouchard, by 
dangling before their eyes the promise of job spinoffs and major 
investments.
<P>
	Would a petition have been as effective in this instance? 
Would it have produced the hoped-for results? Certainly not! 
Why then do people persist in using petitions to make requests 
of the government? No doubt they do so for two reasons. First, 
for lack of an alternative, because this is the only means 
available to them to get the government's attention. Then, since 
it is probably preferable, from a moral standpoint, to act openly 
through a very public request instead of going through the 
corridors of power.
<P>
	A petition, however visible, remains in current practice 
something that is merely tabled. Since the opening of this 
Parliament, 84 petitions have been presented in this House, but 
there has not been a single response yet. Everything is there. The 
credibility of this provision in the Standing Orders depends in 
large part on the response provided. Standing Order 36(8) now 
gives the government 45 calendar days to examine a petition and 
respond to it. The government should not evade this obligation.
<P>
	Any member has the right to table a petition. This act of 
tabling, which is not currently open to debate on the form or 
content of the petition, enables the member to freely fulfil his or 
her responsibilities as a representative of the people without 
having to endorse the petitioners' claims. It would be against my 
principles to table a petition without endorsing it, but the 
Standing Orders give some flexibility to members whose top 
priority is to speak for the people they represent.
<P>
<B>D (1600) </B>
<P>
	Beyond the tabling as such, the possibility of debating and 
voting on petitions, as suggested by the Reform Party's motion, 
creates many difficulties. First, the main difficulty would be to 
decide whether we should debate all petitions. If yes, it would 
probably be by grouping them, but if some groupings are 
obvious, depending on the form and origin of the petition, others 
are not so obvious.
<P>
	On the other hand, if we wanted to sort or select petitions to be 
debated and disposed of, what criteria should be used? Should 
there be a random draw, as provided for in Standing Order 87 
regarding private members' business? Should the number of 
signatures be a factor? What about the purpose of the petitions? 
Whatever the method favoured, it is clear in my opinion that it 
would be criticized as a form of discrimination.
<P>
	Most important today's motion would open the door to a new 
practice that would put into question our role as defenders of the 
common interests. Many governments have been accused of 
governing by polls. This criticism could be extended to any 
government or Parliament governing by petitions.
<P>
	The members of this House and the political parties to which 
they belong have all campaigned by openly promoting various 
policies and solutions to solve our modern problems. Mr. 
Speaker, these members have been elected and their first 
obligation now is to do everything they can to respect their 
commitments.
<P>
	How would they always be able to reconcile the commitments 
they made to get elected with the petitions giving them 
directions on what to do and even how to vote? If this were 
possible, what would prevail in case of a divergence of views? 
Would it be the party line? Would it be the personal beliefs of the 
member? Would it be the commitments made during the election 
campaign? Would it be the petitions, and if so based on what: 
their content, their volume or their origin?
<P>
	We must make a distinction between our role and that which 
innumerable sources want us to take on. Being the elected 
representative of a constituency, as well as a member of a 
parliamentary group sharing the same political views and a 
member of the first deliberative assembly of the country, each 
<P>
<HR>
<><B><A NAME="1627"><A HREF="DOCNAME#1627">1627</A></A></B>
<P>
member of Parliament must face all kinds of representations and 
limitations.
<P>
	It would be a useless constraint to add to the already existing 
resources in the Standing Orders of the House of Commons and 
allow debates on petitions. There are numerous other 
possibilities to review issues, including those resulting from the 
tabling of petitions. Indeed, petitions are sometimes grouped 
together in a motion, then in a bill which is reviewed by a 
committee before finally being passed by the House. This 
avenue exists, regardless of all its limitations.
<P>
	In conclusion, I would appreciate it if the sponsors of the 
motion could answer our questions and propose some solutions 
to the problems which I underlined.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
congratulate the hon. member for Châteauguay on his very 
thoughtful comments. I share many of them. I want to share 
some of my concerns with him and get his response. One of my 
problems with the petition concept is the thought that the people 
who are signing the petition may be acting on the basis of bad 
information.
<P>
	We are hearing from the Reform Party about a petition being 
used as a means to recall a member. My concern is about a 
situation in wich the information being supplied to the people is 
incomplete and the people who are going to sign the petition are 
reading it in their local media. They may be signing a petition 
that is calling for recall when they do not have the full story.
<P>
<B>D (1605) </B>
<P>
	I will take that analogy further with due respect to Bloc 
members. I hope they will not feel it is partisan when I say as a 
former journalist I have always been concerned the information 
French speaking Quebecers are receiving has been coloured by 
French speaking media.
<P>
	In that context, when a regional group is restricted in the type 
of information it is receiving I would question, if Quebecers 
were undertaking a petition of similar import to recall, whether 
the information they were receiving was based on only one 
viewpoint and whether the petition, no matter how it came out, 
would be valid.
<P>
	I will extend that one step further and suggest that the same 
flaw exists in a referendum. If people who are to vote on a 
subject of great import like sovereignty association, the 
separation of the country or any kind of referendum for that 
matter or a referendum such that the Reform would put forward, 
are receiving information with only one slant, would the hon. 
member for Châteauguay tell me whether he feels a referendum 
or a petition under such circumstances would be legitimate?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Godin:</B> Mr. Speaker, no, but I appreciate the hon. 
member's question. To me, a referendum and a petition are two 
entirely different things. We should realize that a petition more 
often involves a small group of constituents, unlike a 
referendum. For instance, the referendum on Charlottetown 
involved the whole country, not just a small group. At the time, 
millions and millions of dollars were spent, and if these people 
did not get the yes they wanted, it was not because people were 
not informed. It was simply because an attempt was made to 
impose a solution people did not want.
<P>
	To me, there is quite a difference between a petition and a 
referendum, but I am afraid pressure groups are using petitions 
to force the government to consider their real issues, their real 
demands.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bryden:</B> Mr. Speaker, I say to the hon. member for 
Châteauguay that my analogy is a petition and a regional 
referendum such as there might be in Quebec where one group of 
people is being asked to decide on one specific issue.
<P>
	I am not trying to prejudge that vote or what Quebecers should 
do in that instance. The nature of the question is how does the 
hon. member feel if the people coming to that vote, be it a 
regional petition or a regional referendum, have very narrow 
and restricted sources of information and are not getting the full 
story?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Godin:</B> No, Mr. Speaker, I do not think so. I do not think 
people were poorly informed, because there was certainly no 
lack of resources during the referendum. In fact, people were so 
well informed that in places where there was no money, people 
voted no just the same. I think there is a tremendous difference. 
A petition is a request. Constituents ask for something, and a 
petition is a way to get that request to the government. In a 
referendum people make a decision, and the majority decides.
<P>
<B>D (1610) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse):</B> I would like to know 
the position of the hon. member for Châteauguay on Quebec's 
referendum legislation. Would he agree that this legislation, 
which provides for creating umbrella committees during 
referendums, for the yes side and the no side, and gives the same 
amount of money to both and prohibits corporations, unions, 
and other corporate entities from contributing to the campaign 
funds of the yes committee or the no committee, is, in a 
democratic society, the most sensible and practical approach we 
have in Quebec for settling a matter that concerns the entire 
population?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<><B><A NAME="1628"><A HREF="DOCNAME#1628">1628</A></A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Godin:</B> I think the hon. member is absolutely right. And I 
think that once again, Quebec, as it has done in so many other 
areas, has led the way in seeking truly democratic solutions.
<P>
	I remember the last referendum on the Charlottetown accord, 
where money was being spent left, right and centre. If only, and I 
think the hon. member answered the question I was asked 
earlier, if only this policy had existed across Canada instead of 
letting people be inundated with all this advertising, because 
sometimes, getting too much information is just as bad as not 
getting enough. I think this policy ensures that people really get 
the information they need, and I am convinced this will get the 
desired result in Quebec.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Russell MacLellan (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on reading this motion I have some difficulty with it, 
quite frankly. It seems we are trying to structure members of 
Parliament to the extent that they do not have the leeway to do 
the job they must do.
<P>
	Petitions are a very important part of the democratic 
procedure. There is no question about it. They are the voice of 
the people through their members of Parliament. They are 
asking members of Parliament to put a particular point across. 
Through the petition they are stating how they want this 
advocacy in Parliament to take place.
<P>
	That is fine and that is as it should be. There is time allotted in 
the daily procedure of the House of Commons to put forward 
petitions. The petitions are accepted by the House of Commons 
and a reply is sent to the petitioners.
<P>
	If we take that further and say that instead of doing that or in 
addition to doing that we should take the subject matter of each 
petition and debate it in each session, we are in effect structuring 
the actual work of the House of Commons. We are dictating what 
the House of Commons determines as the most important 
subject matter with which it will deal.
<P>
	That is not the actual form of democracy that most people in 
the country want to see in the Chamber. They want to see their 
concerns put forward. They are instructing members of 
Parliament to deal with their concerns. Through petitions they 
are saying they want these matters brought before the House of 
Commons as they are under the proper procedure dealing with 
petitions at the present time.
<P>
	If we start getting into the question of debating each subject 
matter, how do we determine what subject matter we are going 
to debate? If we are debating all subject matters how long do we 
debate each point? How long do we give to each question? If we 
are saying we are going to choose certain areas of subject matter 
to debate which ones do we choose? Certainly we can pick 
private members' bills that are coming before the House, but 
those bills are put forward by individual members of  
Parliament. Here we are talking about the people of Canada 
giving us feedback on their concerns. How can we say that some 
motions or some subject matter will be debated and others will 
not?
<P>
<B>D (1615) </B>
<P>
	I do not think this is going to work. I say to the people of 
Canada, through your petitions your concerns are reaching all 
members of the House of Commons. I also want to say there has 
been very good work on behalf of Canadians in getting these 
petitions together. A tremendous amount of work has been done 
in bringing these concerns to the House of Commons.
<P>
	I want to deal with the point made by the member for 
Edmonton Southwest with respect to serial killer cards. He says 
that the subject matter of the petition prohibiting the 
importation, distribution, sale and manufacture of serial killer 
cards is an example of such petitions.
<P>
	We have heard a good deal on this subject. There have been 
many petitions on this subject. I am certain the Department of 
Justice is studying this area very carefully in the hope of 
bringing forward some legislation to deal with this. However, 
this is not an easy subject because of the charter representation 
section 2 of the charter deals with freedom of speech and this is a 
question here. We must however deal with the concerns with 
respect to the importation, distribution, sale and manufacture of 
such materials and that is being examined now. It is offensive to 
think people are making money from that sort of material.
<P>
	We are aware of petitions such as the ones of Mrs. Debbie 
Mahaffy. She was able to get together 500,000 signatures on a 
petition. Léna Cléroux of Rockland, Ontario presented a petition 
with 14,000 signatures. The hon. member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell who spoke just a few minutes 
ago collected 50,000 signatures on a petition to ban serial killer 
board games. He has introduced a private member's bill on this 
subject.
<P>
	The matter is being dealt with. The petitions have worked. 
The advocacy of the citizens of this country to their members of 
Parliament has worked. If this subject matter is debated again, 
what are we going to achieve? The government knows this is a 
concern. All members of the House of Commons know it is a 
concern. What is needed now is to ask questions from time to 
time during question period and before the Standing Committee 
on Justice as to how this matter is proceeding and how the 
Minister of Justice and the government are dealing with it. That 
is how we must deal with it.
<P>
	Another matter is the Young Offenders Act. There are 
concerns about the Young Offenders Act. The Liberal Party 
recognized that during the election campaign and mentioned it 
in the red book. It was given a prominent place in our position 
paper on justice released on April 22, 1993 which indicated that 
changes are needed to the Young Offenders Act, that there have 
to be tougher sentences for violent crime and that we have to 
recog-
<P>
<HR>
<><B><A NAME="1629"><A HREF="DOCNAME#1629">1629</A></A></B>
<P>
nize that there were violent offences with which we had to  deal 
more strongly. We have to look into that whole question.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice has stated he will be dealing with the 
recommendations of the red book and of the position paper. As a 
second part he has stated that the whole subject of the Young 
Offenders Act will be studied carefully with the full intention of 
bringing forward a more comprehensive bill before the House to 
deal with the concerns.
<P>
<B>D (1620) </B>
<P>
	Once again the concerns of the Canadians through their 
petitions and through their members of Parliament have been 
brought to the attention of the government, regardless of 
whether it is this government or the former one. The subject 
matter is being studied.
<P>
	What remains is the government's determination to act upon 
the information and the concerns brought forward by the people 
of Canada. The government is doing just that. It is doing it very 
quickly and intensively. This is a serious question as are the 
serial killer cards. These two problems must be dealt with and 
the government is dealing with them.
<P>
	There are other concerns which are not mentioned in the 
motion. What do we do with these? Certainly the third one is one 
which the member's party has taken a great interest in. That is 
the recall of members of Parliament. Certainly there are going to 
be petitions on this. There are petitions on a great many subjects, 
but how do we deal with those? How do we deal with a 
government that is mindful of that concern?
<P>
	Members of the Reform Party have stated they want the 
capacity to be able to recall members of Parliament. The 
government has said it does not think that is advisable. Does 
anyone think that if we were to debate this question that the 
answer would be any different because it was the subject matter 
of a petition?
<P>
	What has happened is that through petitions, through the 
advocacy of the Reform Party questions, this matter has been 
transposed to the consideration of the government, just as with 
the other two cases. However, it is different from the cases of 
serial board games and serial killer cards and amendments to the 
Young Offenders Act. The government takes those issues very 
seriously and recognizes the concerns of Canadians. It is going 
to deal with those two issues, but on the third issue the 
government has said no. That is it, no. The fact of the matter is 
that the consideration has been given.
<P>
	This House has to be able to deal with the concerns of 
Canadians who are not sending in petitions. We have to be able 
to look to what we as members of Parliament envision this 
country is going to need and the urgent matters which come up. 
We must also be able to anticipate how we as members of 
Parliament can make this a better country in the days ahead.
<P>
	We have to have the freedom to bring forward bills and 
concerns which this country must have addressed. These 
concerns are brought forward in committees represented by all 
parties of the House giving them due consideration. Certainly 
the government has the majority to be able to finally determine 
what is to be brought forward and this is the way it should be. 
There has to be a mechanism to break a deadlock as far as this is 
concerned. This is why it is the government and why it was 
elected to govern.
<P>
	I want all members to know that the concerns of Canadians are 
being addressed by this House. Three of the concerns which the 
hon. member has mentioned are being dealt with. One has 
already been dealt with and two are being given very important 
consideration.
<P>
	We have a tremendous concern about the country's financial 
situation. With the deficit as it presently stands and the debt as it 
is, are we to debate that issue with equal time along with all the 
other subject matter because it is the subject of a petition? It 
takes away the scope of government and members of this House 
to determine what needs the most attention at any particular 
time.
<P>
	People elect members of Parliament to do the job. If we are 
going to say as some members evidently are that the people do 
not trust their members of Parliament to make the right 
decisions and therefore they are going to shackle them any way 
they possibly can to follow a narrow structured course then we 
are only compounding the problem.
<P>
<B>D (1625 ) </B>
<P>
	The problem may be that members of Parliament and 
politicians are not as highly thought of as we in this House and 
those in other legislative bodies would like. The fact of the 
matter is it is up to us to change that and only through our actions 
can we change that. If we do not the results will be derogatory 
for those who do not convince the electorate that we want to 
change it and that we are actually moving to change it.
<P>
	It really comes down to members of Parliament acting in the 
interests of Canadians, acting as they see fit, as they have heard 
their constituents telling them they should act. Members of 
Parliament are the voice of the people. That voice must remain 
with members of Parliament to do as they see fit.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
congratulate the member on a very fine intervention in this 
debate on the opposition motion. His constituents would be very 
proud of the way he spoke. His speech was presented in a very 
informed and logical fashion. That is part of what Canadians are 
looking for in their members. It has to do with appearance and 
optics.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<><B><A NAME="1630"><A HREF="DOCNAME#1630">1630</A></A></B>
<P>
	One of the last points the member raised really goes to the 
heart of the issue. The hon. member said that members of 
Parliament should be representing the interests of Canadians. 
The member said Canadians. He did not say members of his own 
constituency. This is a very important point because we come 
here as members of Parliament to reflect the best interests of our 
constituents but in the context of Canada as a whole and of all 
Canadians. Some very important regional and local differences 
must be balances.
<P>
	Thinking of the election campaign, there were 30,000 homes 
in my riding to be visited. I could not possibly get to all of them. 
There were over 67,000 voters. How could I possibly presume I 
would get to know them all and get to know exactly what they 
were thinking on every issue and be able to come here and 
represent that interest? I have no mechanism other than using 
my best efforts and presenting and availing myself to use my 
best judgment. That is what the Prime Minister has been saying.
<P>
	I thank the member for raising the issue that we are here to 
represent Canadians. It is an important distinction which the 
opposition motion has not taken into account.
<P>
	<B>Mr. MacLellan:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
comments. It is significant that we as members of Parliament 
represent constituents. We are the voice of the constituents in 
our particular ridings. We cannot assume that anyone else is 
going to speak for them because we are the people they have 
chosen.
<P>
	While there are individual concerns, Canadians from coast to 
coast to coast realize their individual concerns must blend with 
the concerns of all Canadians. The number of constituencies 
really develops and relates to a larger whole which is the country 
itself. The strength of Canada is the people of Canada acting 
together.
<P>
	There are individual concerns and national concerns. By 
looking at each member for whom they have voted in this light, 
the people have chosen the members they feel will represent 
these concerns nationally and locally. The idea, of course, is 
when we get here we should honour the commitment and honour 
the reasons constituents have voted for us. We should do as they 
had assumed we would do and not fall back into a position of 
disinterest or cronyism, and continue to relate as we stated in the 
campaign when we looked for their votes.
<P>
<B>D (1630) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Public Works and Government Services):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I too want to thank my colleague for reminding us all 
that we are here not only for our constituents but for all 
Canadians.
<P>
	In a previous presentation some reference was made to the 
fact that had the party which proposed this particular debate 
known of the mechanisms existing so certain issues could be 
brought forward, that they could represent constituents fairly, 
perhaps it would not have been done. It had crossed my mind as 
well because of the  references to serial killer cards, to the 
Young Offenders Act, to the whole notion of recall, that the 
particular party may be trying to use this to its political 
advantage.
<P>
	We know these are issues that concern Canadians. We have 
heard petitions on each of those issues and many more. I wonder 
if my colleague, who has been in the House for a number of years 
and who has a reputation for fairness, would care to comment on 
what the motivation might have been. I would be very much 
interested in his insights.
<P>
	<B>Mr. MacLellan:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think this is an attempt to 
structure members of Parliament to the extent that there will 
remain a very narrow scope with which we can use our 
objectivity and our determination as to what we should do in this 
House of Commons.
<P>
	What bothers me about this motion is the cynicism, that 
members of Parliament are not capable of determining how they 
should work to govern the people of Canada. The more structure 
in what we do, the less we are going to deviate from what they 
feel the people of Canada want.
<P>
	What the people of Canada want is good representation, 
members of Parliament acting on behalf of Canadians, whether 
it be in their local interests or their national interests, but being 
objective and fair and dealing in a straightforward manner with 
their concerns.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi):</B> Mr. Speaker, I must first 
thank the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice for 
his speech. He dealt in particular with the priority of petitions to 
be debated in the House, but I notice that all the motions, and the 
three examples given by the Reform Party, could become bills or 
motions discussed here in the House.
<P>
	I would like the parliamentary secretary to add a little to what 
the previous speaker said when my colleague was questioned 
about referendums and petitions. I would like to know either his 
view as parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Justice or the 
distinction he makes between referendums and petitions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. MacLellan: </B>Mr. Speaker, this is a good question, because 
those are two ways to obtain information from Canadians. A 
petition is a document provided by Canadians.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is a document we receive from the people of Canada stating 
their concerns. A referendum is a document in which we say we 
are aware of a concern on a particular question and we are going 
to the people of Canada to tell us how they feel. The petition tells 
us that the people are concerned and they want us to know they 
<P>
<HR>
<><B><A NAME="1631"><A HREF="DOCNAME#1631">1631</A></A></B>
<P>
are concerned. The referendum says that they are concerned. We 
know of their concern. Do they think this is going to be suitable?
<P>
<B>D (1635) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island):</B> Mr. Speaker, the member who 
just spoke indicated he feels there is no need to change to the 
way we presently handle petitions.
<P>
	I get that message quite strongly. I wish he would confirm if it 
is correct. Then I would ask simply for his response to this. First 
of all I do not think those of us on this side are doing this for 
political gain. We really do want to provide the people of Canada 
the kind of government they are telling us they want. They want 
a representative, a member of Parliament who listens, hears and 
acts on what it hears.
<P>
	The perception is that these petitions sort of hit a wall. My 
question is this. Should we abandon the ability of citizens to 
give us petitions since we can find out by other means what it is 
they are thinking if we are not going to use the petition method 
directly in making our decisions in this House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. MacLellan:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not feel exactly the way the 
hon. member does.
<P>
	Petitions have a very real purpose. They make an impact in the 
House of Commons on all members of Parliament. We cannot 
help but hear the petitions read without feeling that the subject 
matter in the petitions is of concern to the people of Canada. We 
have to believe that in order to sign a petition.
<P>
	The fact is that we then reply to them and tell them that we are 
concerned. The subject matter of two of the areas brought 
forward in the motion have been dealt with and are being dealt 
with. The serial killer cards and the Young Offenders Act are 
getting a great deal of consideration and work in the Department 
of Justice.
<P>
	As I mentioned regarding the recall of members of 
Parliament, the Prime Minister has said this is not something we 
feel is justified. All three points have been considered or are 
being considered.
<P>
	I am not saying we should not change the way we handle 
petitions. All I am saying is the method put forward in the 
motion is not the way to go. If there are other suggestions, 
certainly they should be considered. I do not think we should be 
rigid and unbending in the way we deal with the business of the 
House.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Margaret Bridgman (Surrey North):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the opportunity to speak in favour of the motion. The 
motion itself is basically an administrative one as it requires a 
change to the standing orders to allow petitions to be debated in 
the House.
<P>
	One member suggested that petitions could be presented to 
the House for debate through a private member's bill. We are 
suggesting that is one mechanism but we would like to see 
petitions also have a mechanism or vehicle of their own and not 
be dependent on a member presenting them as a private bill.
<P>
	As we know, petitions arrive and are either tabled or verbally 
presented to the House in a statement and then tabled for a 
recording procedure. From there they go to a ministry to be 
answered within a set period of time.
<P>
	This brings a couple of general points to mind for reasons for 
putting petitions on the table for debate. Petitions can be seen as 
a symptom of a weakness or a problem in existing legislation or 
petition topics in many cases can involve the mandates of more 
than one ministry. These two points would provide good reason 
to debate the subject matter of petitions.
<P>
	Petition topics in many cases address specific or single issues. 
These issues tend to be an end result or an outcome of a policy or 
law. It is a cause and effect kind of thing. The end result can be 
seen as a problem to the Canadians bringing it to our attention 
but it is not necessarily the main problem or the underlying 
cause. It is an outcome suggesting there is a weakness in the 
process or in the law itself. It can be seen as a symptom or a 
warning of a problem somewhere within the policy or the law. 
This concept, cause and effect, raises a few options to examine 
also. One could be that there is a deficiency in some aspect of the 
content of the legislation; another could be there is an actual 
omission to the content; still another could be that possibly a 
different set of circumstances in some areas of our country are 
causing different outcomes from the policy or law that are not 
necessarily occurring in other areas. Of course there could be a 
combination of the various options already mentioned.
<P>
<B>D (1640) </B>
<P>
	Considering all the possible options available to us if we do 
address petitions as a symptom of an underlying problem, it 
seems a logical step that we would present this subject matter to 
the House for debate in order to identify the cause and the 
possible solutions to resolving these associated problems.
<P>
	We could treat the symptom and not worry about the cause of 
it, but it would eventually return either as a larger or a more 
serious problem or both. At some point we would have to do a 
full investigation and identify the cause and correct it.
<P>
	The second point offering rationale for debating of petition 
subject matter is that of the possible involvement of more than 
one ministry's mandate. This is important possibly for several 
reasons, but the one that comes to mind first is the advancements 
in our knowledge base which may shed new or a different light 
on a policy or law than when it was originally debated.
<P>
	This new information may involve mandates of ministries not 
previously involved in the original decision making process or 
possibly not involved to the degree necessary at the time. The 
classic example of this today would the Department of the 
Environment. Its present day role in the outcome or effect of 
<P>
<HR>
<><B><A NAME="1632"><A HREF="DOCNAME#1632">1632</A></A></B>
<P>
many decisions made in the past by other ministries is quite 
obvious.
<P>
	I submit that health care is in a similar position today. The end 
result or effect of many policies or laws in the past today are 
producing health hazards or concerns to some degree that are 
basically unacceptable to today's standards. The concerns about 
health may not be the main thrust or objective of the petition but 
the health care issues are usually involved to some degree, be it 
direct or indirect.
<P>
	For example, any petition regarding the use of pesticides on 
crops or antibiotic drugs or other drugs used in livestock, could 
be sent perhaps to the ministry of agriculture but it definitely has 
a health care concern and that should be addressed as well.
<P>
	Another example would be a factory dumping contaminated 
waste into a nearby lake or stream. This could be sent to either 
the Ministry of Industry or the Ministry of the Environment for a 
response. Yet again, there are great health concerns and issues 
apparent in this that may not have been addressed at the time of 
the original debate.
<P>
	Also sentencing for assault has an indirect impact on health. If 
the sentence is reduced and that happens to be the complaint of 
the petition, then possibly it is because the assault rate has 
increased, more people are getting injured and consequently 
requiring treatment.
<P>
	Most petitions today have some bearing on health issues. 
These issues need to be addressed and resolved in such a manner 
so that we can continue to promote a healthy environment for us 
to live and grow in.
<P>
	Identifying and resolving health care problems found in the 
subject matter brought to our attention by petitions is essential if 
we want to help reduce our health care costs and promote good 
health through a wellness approach versus an illness approach. 
We must proact and not react to health care issue concerns 
regardless of how they are being brought to our attention. 
Petitions can be an excellent resource, especially if one views 
them from a feedback point of view.

	Specific issues raised in petitions may be described as 
isolated situations, exceptions to the rule or extremely small 
percentages of the whole and may not be seen as being very 
significant in relation to the overall effects of the law or policy. 
However, there are still signs and symptoms of a bigger problem 
if we do not do something about it. It is like a cancer. It starts out 
small and insignificant but slowly grows to consume the whole. 
At some point along the way it must be treated and the sooner it 
is treated the better chance we have to save the whole.
<P>
	In closing, I remind us all that petitions are calling cards. 
They are calling us to re-examine the various past decisions and 
all the ramifications of them both direct and indirect in a more 
in-depth approach than maybe previously or in light of new 
information that has come up over the years.
<P>
	To provide for the review or revision and updating of the 
various laws and policies the opportunity to debate the subject 
matter of petitions in the House should be available.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
will thank the hon. member for Surrey North. Those were very 
well thought out remarks which I enjoyed very much.
<P>
	I wonder if the member could help me with one aspect of this 
which has been touched upon by other speakers but it touches me 
very deeply, I have to say. She was saying that the whole thrust 
of this motion is for petitions to be debated.
<P>
	I will give the member an example. We are talking about 
debating and bringing to a vote a petition, for example, on the 
subject matter involving prohibiting the importation, 
distribution, sale and manufacture of serial killer cards. My 
difficulty is that when one debates a motion like that and it is 
brought to a vote I am afraid that one may be setting the agenda 
of this Parliament on an important issue that is much broader 
than just simply saying yes or no, we agree that killer cards 
should be prohibited.
<P>
	The issue of prohibiting something like killer cards is a 
freedom of speech issue. It is a very large issue. It involves 
wider areas. My fear is that if we do as this motion suggests will 
we not be setting the agenda for legislation that will require a 
much vaster debate?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Bridgman:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his 
question.
<P>
	I think what the member is saying is possibly what I was 
suggesting in my remarks. The actual topic of a petition could be 
seen as an outcome of a process or some such law of policy. To 
debate that specific topic would be a narrow point of view 
because it is a symptom or a sign of something major that is 
happening within the whole process.
<P>
	I am saying that should come back to this House and we 
should look at this whole process and find the cause somewhere 
within this process that is generating that kind of result.
<P>
	I would think that it would require some of our time for an 
extensive debate.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Godin (Châteauguay):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my colleague for her comments. I would like to make some very 
brief remarks on an example just given of a petition to recall 
members. I find this extremely dangerous. I agree with the hon. 
member opposite who just said that it would be possible for a 
<P>
<HR>
<><B><A NAME="1633"><A HREF="DOCNAME#1633">1633</A></A></B>
<P>
party to put  pressure on a member who did not agree on a certain 
subject and force him to resign. That is the first point.
<P>
<B>D (1650) </B>
<P>
	The second point, also extremely important, would be to limit 
a member's foresight. In this House, around 1990, we saw five 
or six Conservative members leave that party to sit as 
independents; later, they formed the Bloc Quebecois. If the 
members had had to be recalled by law, I think that we would 
have simply prevented those people from exercising their 
foresight, because it was not just five or six members who saw 
that things were no longer working; in the last election, all of 
Canada voted that way and eliminated the Conservatives from 
this House.
<P>
	For these two reasons I think that it would be rather dangerous 
to put that position into law.
<P>
[English] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Bridgman:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am not exactly sure what the 
question was. The member is addressing recall and the concerns 
that we as parliamentarians may have, seeing that as being a 
threat over our heads.
<P>
	My response to that is I do not think we should feel limited or 
restricted in our actions. Possibly what we should do is take a 
more positive approach versus the negative and put more faith in 
our constituents and Canadians in assessing our position here in 
the House and realizing that there are times when we cannot 
please all the people all the time on everything. We have to have 
faith in the people to judge and evaluate our performance 
honestly.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North):</B> Mr. Speaker, this is 
a very interesting debate today which is near and dear to the 
hearts of Reformers.
<P>
	During the election campaign just a few months ago the 
candidates' forums that I attended were very interesting. The 
Liberal candidate, a very fine individual, had a line in her speech 
that went over very well with the crowd until I got at it. It was: 
``In a few days time you people will be the boss. For those three 
or four minutes when you are in the ballot booth you are going to 
be the ones who decide what happens for this country for the 
next four years''. That is true.
<P>
	My response to that was Canadians in a democracy should be 
in charge a whole lot more than three or four minutes every four 
or five years.
<P>
	This debate is important because it goes to a very 
fundamental, philosophical definition of democracy. It is, do 
what the people think and want count between elections? I 
would submit, and I think it is borne out by what happens in our 
country that right now it does not count for very much. We have 
heard a number of members argue vehemently that it should not 
either. To me that is fundamentally wrong.
<P>
	I believe that many Canadians would like to sit where we sit, 
would like to have the time and the opportunity to examine the 
issues before our country and to make decisions based on that 
evidence. However, not all of us as Canadians can do that, given 
the time and constraints of our other duties and responsibilities 
and perhaps other factors. Therefore, on the democratic 
principle of one person, one vote we elect our own 
representatives.
<P>
	We should underline the word representative. In the past 
representation has been a minuscule element in what happens 
here in Parliament. In the past it was not what the people we 
represented thought that counted so much as what the party we 
represented thought. If that had worked well we would all be 
happy with it. It really has not worked well.
<P>
<B>D (1655) </B>
<P>
	When we get down to a style of representation that is 
dependent on what the party thinks, then it is the people who 
decide for the party who decide for parliamentarians and decide 
for the whole country. We get to the point at which a very small 
group of people decides everything because what it decides is 
supported by the other people in its party who dominate 
Parliament which decides things for the country.
<P>
	That is really the problem we are trying to fix. If this small 
group of people had consistently made wise decisions, 
respecting our opinions, that carried the judgment of Canadians 
I think we would all be happy with that system. All of us have a 
life. We would be happy to live our lives, to pay attention to our 
business or professional interests or family interests and let this 
wise small group of people run everything, if it was doing it 
well. It has not.
<P>
	The fact of the matter is that this group has buried us in debt. It 
has not listened to what we want. It has not respected our 
viewpoints. This has been shown over and over again in the last 
Parliament in which we had members of Parliament standing up 
and actually saying bare faced to people in public meetings: ``I 
do not care if 90 per cent of my constituents oppose this 
legislation, I am supporting it because it is right for Canada''.
<P>
	With respect to some of our representatives in the past, it is 
our money that is being spent as Canadians, it is our future that 
is being shaped by these people who seem to know so much 
better than we do what is right for our country. I do not feel in a 
democracy it is appropriate or even acceptable for a small group 
of people to say it knows best for everybody.
<P>
	What wisdom is invested in people simply by walking into 
these hallowed halls? We do not know any more than most 
Canadians in spite of our breadth of background and the 
education that most of us have. We are simply here to do a job 
and that job has three elements. It has an element of a mandate 
because we campaigned on certain things. If we campaigned to 
balance a budget then we had better balance the budget. If we 
campaigned 
<P>
<HR>
<><B><A NAME="1634"><A HREF="DOCNAME#1634">1634</A></A></B>
<P>
to listen to people and be open to  people's viewpoints, then we 
had better follow through on that. If we campaigned on 
anything, then people expect us to keep those promises and they 
have given us a mandate to do that.
<P>
	There are many things that come up in Parliament about 
which we have not specifically stood up in a campaign in those 
50 days and said we are going to do this in this circumstance. 
Then we have to follow our own judgment in some cases because 
we cannot go back to our thousands of constituents and take a 
poll asking what they want us to do.
<P>
	There are numerous occasions when the person elected has to 
use their best judgment. In that I agree with members opposite. 
There are also a large number of instances in which the issues 
are so big and so far reaching in consequence and so national in 
scope that it is only right and proper in a democracy that every 
citizen, after having an opportunity to make a full and fair 
examination of that issue, should be able to have input in it.
<P>
	Otherwise we get into a situation we had in the Meech Lake 
debates and the Charlottetown accord in which a few people in 
this House think they know best for the country. It turns out that 
their wisdom, the wisdom of every single party in the House, is 
totally disconnected from what Canadians really want.
<P>
	It is up to us as people who have been given a great deal of 
trust to fix that situation. In my view the way to do it is through 
these democratic reforms that we have been talking about. Other 
democracies use them. They work well. They connect what we 
do in this House as decision makers with the judgment of 
ordinary Canadians.
<P>
	We have ample opportunity to use our wonderful and exalted 
judgment on any number of issues. We need checks and balances 
on that discretion, on that judgment, and that is all we are 
asking.
<P>
	We have picked the issue of petitions to talk about today. 
Thousands and thousands of Canadians spend untold time, effort 
and trouble because they believe so strongly that something 
should be done and they appeal to us in a petition to do 
something. What happens? Things drop into the black hole. 
They are not debated. They are not voted on. They are rarely 
looked at. Many times people do not even know they were 
introduced because they were not introduced when the House 
was full. That is wrong. Canadians need to be able to feel that 
what they say to us counts for something. Nowhere is it more 
evident than in the petition making process.
<P>
<B>D (1700) </B>
<P>
	This is only one aspect of where we as parliamentarians must 
start recognizing that we only represent people. We must be 
connected and accountable to those people whom we represent. 
We must truly respond to their wishes, desires and concerns.
<P>
	I would submit to the House for the consideration of members 
that these changes are coming. I would ask that they be 
supported and that we work together to reconnect Canadians 
with the decision making process on their behalf.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (York-Simcoe):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
once again members across the floor in the Reform Party have 
set up yet another false straw dog concerning the Canadian 
people.
<P>
	It has been suggested that Parliament is not a democratic 
place. I support what the member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell originally said. There exists a 
mechanism to deal with petitions. It is up to individual members 
who bring these petitions forward to ensure they do the work for 
their constituents and on behalf of their constituents. As the hon. 
member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell pointed out, where 
are the Reform Party members in terms of their motions 
regarding petitions?
<P>
	I sit on this side of the House. As a brand new member I am 
learning a lot about the traditions of Parliament. The very first 
day I sat over here on orientation day was most significant. I 
listened to the previous speaker talk about the fine tradition of 
Parliament which has existed and developed over hundreds of 
years.
<P>
	When we take a tradition like Parliament and decide to throw 
it on its head, upside down, we cannot control the kinds of things 
that might happen and the injustices to the democratic process 
that occur out of naivety. It is not without passion on the hon. 
members' part on the other side of the House, but I would 
suggest this is yet again a false straw dog set before the 
Canadian people. There exists in Parliament a mechanism to do 
the very things they are suggesting on the other side of the 
House. If they were serving their constituents well they would 
be doing just that.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ablonczy:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member opposite for 
her comments. With respect, however, it is an insult to 
Canadians to suggest that their thousands of signatures are a 
false straw dog. They should count for something.
<P>
	Yes, members can introduce private members' bills based on 
petitions, but what happens to them? They go into a lottery. 
Quite often they are not even debated or voted on.
<P>
	Yes, we can work for these things in committee. But should 
not petitions signed by thousands of Canadians have more 
significance and not just go into the mill? Should they not be 
treated with some sort of acknowledgement and respect by the 
people they are presented to?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<><B><A NAME="1635"><A HREF="DOCNAME#1635">1635</A></A></B>
<P>
	If we go to someone with a request we expect a response. 
We expect them to say whether they agree or whether they will 
to support us. The petitions come to us as members of the 
House. They deserve more than just to be tucked away and 
perhaps to be the basis of a private member's bill or maybe 
raised in committee some day.
<P>
<B>D (1705) </B>
<P>
	These kinds of initiatives on the part of the citizens deserve a 
better response. That is what I am saying. I think Canadians 
would agree with that. Otherwise why would they bother 
wasting their time with them?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Guelph-Wellington):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am concerned. The hon. member for Calgary North 
said that we do not do what people think and want during 
elections and asked whether what they think and what they want 
count. I take great exception to that. I was elected to do exactly 
that. Most Liberals were elected this time around because we 
offered a balanced perspective.
<P>
	The Reform Party, as popular as it may seem to be in the 
western part of Canada, has not taken a great surge in the rest of 
Canada. As we know it is not a true party of Canada. It truly is a 
regional party.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (North Vancouver):</B> Wait until the next election.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Chamberlain:</B> We will see. The people have spoken 
very loudly and clearly on our platform. It is important for 
members of the Reform Party to recognize that those are the 
wishes of the people.
<P>
	The hon. member for Calgary Southwest the other day spoke 
on this same point. I really feel we are elected to learn and to 
seek out information to which perhaps people at large do not 
have access. When the Reform leader spoke he said that they 
would educate them, that they could institute an educational 
process. I worry about that. I worry about an educational process 
that a certain party would institute to educate Canada in 
referendums.
<P>
	I really feel strongly. The question I want to put to the member 
is: Does she not feel comfortable in making decisions with the 
information she gets from her constituents by phone, by meeting 
with them in public meetings, or by any of the ways that are 
available? Is she is not comfortable with that information-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order, please. I think the question is 
clear.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ablonczy:</B> Mr. Speaker, it concerns me when we are 
talking about a fundamental issue of democratic rights and 
freedoms and it is turned into a sort of partisan attack. It is like 
saying that since a six-year old party did not sweep the country 
it has no legitimacy. That is not helpful.
<P>
	The member says that the wishes of the people are taken into 
account and the fact that a government is elected is sort of a carte 
blanche for whatever it decides to do because, after all, it got the 
mandate. Recent history shows that is not the case. The past 
government was elected and put in place the GST over the 
violent objections of Canadians. This government recognized it 
to the point at which it is prepared to withdraw that tax.
<P>
	The Charlottetown accord was supposedly put forward by the 
past government with a great mandate. That was rejected by the 
people. Just because a government is elected does not mean that 
whatever it does for the next four years somehow has 
legitimacy. There have to be checks and balances on the decision 
making process over the next four years. That is what we are 
saying.
<P>
	Why would anybody worry about an educational process? 
Surely that is exactly what we need to do in the country. We need 
to let people know the issues, to let them know the pros and the 
cons of the issues so they can make judgments themselves 
through us as representatives on the issues of the day.
<P>
	I hope the hon. member is not saying that Canadians are not 
capable of receiving education and making good decisions. 
Surely that would be undemocratic. There must be an 
educational process. That happened again during the 
Charlottetown referendum debate. In fact the educational 
process was very disproportionately weighted on one side of the 
issue, yet people still made a decision based on the evidence 
they had. We should not be afraid.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order, please. Time is up.
<P>
<B>D (1710 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Roger Simmons (Burin-St. George's):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
in another life I used to be a superintendent of education. I 
remember well-and I will document it chapter and verse-the 
town was Springdale on the northeast coast of Newfoundland 
and the issue was whether to amalgamate the school services.
<P>
	As members will realize, under the Constitution, 
Newfoundland has a denominational system of education. At the 
moment in 1994 it has in effect three systems: a Roman Catholic 
system, a Pentecostal system and an integrated system, that 
being the integration of several of the religious denominations 
which formerly had their separate services. I am talking now 
about a point in time just before that integration. We had in a 
given community a number of individual school systems.
<P>
	The proposal was that they be integrated, so somebody had a 
petition. On the petition in that community of 3,000, fully 85 per 
cent of the petitioners-I do not have the numbers but it 
represented the overwhelming adult population of that 
particular community-wanted what we called amalgamation, a 
bringing together of the separate services, an integration. 
However, within two weeks somebody else produced a petition 
with the overwhelming adult population having signed it in 
which about 58 per cent did not want the amalgamation. Clearly  
many of the 
<P>
<HR>
<><B><A NAME="1636"><A HREF="DOCNAME#1636">1636</A></A></B>
<P>
same names showed up on both petitions within a period of 10 or 
12 days.
<P>
	My point is that petitions serve a very worthwhile purpose but 
they can be abused. One of the reasons they can be abused is that 
it is difficult when a neighbour comes to the door to say no to 
him when all he is looking for is a signature.
<P>
	Members of the House will acknowledge that very often 
petitions get signed without due thought. They ought not to be 
taken as gospel. They ought to be taken as an indicator though. If 
someone comes to me with a petition on a subject that states 85 
per cent of the community is of this particular mind, I take that 
to be a very strong message.
<P>
	Do members know what is even better than petitions? A ballot 
box because there they cannot vote both ways. There they vote 
one way or the other and they are obliged to stick with it.
<P>
	Let us understand where I am coming from on petitions. 
Petitions are a very important instrument, a very important 
mechanism. That is why we as legislators or parliamentarians 
have always given petitions-and by we I mean the many people 
who have gone before us in this Parliament and the British 
Parliament-petitions a place of pre-eminence in the Chamber.
<P>
	It is the grievance of the people. It is the people saying 
collectively that they are for something or they are against 
something or are concerned about a particular issue. Members 
of Parliament who make light of that instrument are making 
light of a lot of people. They are making light of an instrument 
that has served Parliament and the people of the country very 
well for a long time.
<P>
	Having said that, the danger is that we make the illogical 
transition from petitions as a means of sending a signal, 
petitions as a means of recording a grievance, to government by 
petition.
<P>
	I believe I illustrated the problem with government by 
petition with my example. Had we followed both petitions back 
then in the community of Springdale several years ago we would 
have had two schools. We would have had the amalgamated one 
because that is what 85 per cent of the people wanted. We also 
would have had all the separate schools because that is what 58 
per cent of the people wanted within the same 10 or 12 day 
period.
<P>
	That is the difficulty.
<P>
<B>D (1715 ) </B>
<P>
	That is the conundrum with petitions. Very often they would 
have you do things which are mutually exclusive. I put it to any 
member of this House that if they go out and get a petition on any 
issue, in the same week I will get a petition with as many names 
on the other side of that issue. The beauty of petitions is that they 
send a signal. The weakness of petitions is that they send mixed 
signals.
<P>
	The weakness is what happens at that door, as I mentioned a 
moment ago. It is difficult unless you have a very well thought 
out position on an issue. If you are publicly known to be, for 
example, against abortion it is easy to say to the individual who 
comes to the door: ``You know my position on that and I cannot 
sign your petition which is for abortion''. However, with the 
exception of three or four conscience issues such as abortion, 
capital punishment and euthanasia, people have to live together 
in small communities and when a neighbour comes to the door 
with that petition, often it is easier. I am not saying it is right. I 
am not justifying it. I am characterizing what happens thousands 
of times with petitions. Thousands of times people sign a 
petition and are known in many cases to have signed petitions on 
opposite sides of the issue.
<P>
	That is why I started with an example, not a generalization, a 
specific example in which I was involved in a situation in which 
people within eight or ten or twelve days had signed opposite 
sides of two mutually exclusive petitions.
<P>
	That is why it is dangerous. It is ill advised to make the jump 
from petitions as a form of grievance, petitions as a way of 
testing the water, petitions as a way of knowing what people 
think on an issue, to government by petitions.
<P>
	Let us look at the essence of this particular motion. It says in 
effect that petitions are an important vehicle. It says in effect 
that petitions ought to have more of a role in this Chamber.
<P>
	I say to my friend from Edmonton Southwest, if that is his real 
motivation here, and I would suspect that it is, there are ways to 
do that. His colleague from Calgary North dismisses the idea of 
private members' bills. A lot of private members bills go down 
the drain, a lot because they should. However, a lot of others 
have gone down the drain because the member did not do his or 
her homework. Very often if a member is seized with an issue, 
seized with the importance of an issue, that member can stick 
handle his or her way through the maze here and get a private 
members' bill passed in this House. I have seen it happen many 
times.
<P>
	Before people start denigrating the private members' bill, 
they ought to check the record in this House and they will find 
that many private members' bills have made it past the post in 
this particular Chamber.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Young:</B> We cannot smoke here because of a private 
members' bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simmons:</B> The old anti-smoking stance on the Hill right 
now, my colleague, the Minister of Transport, reminds us is the 
direct result of a private members' bill, just by way of example. 
There are many others we could mention.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<><B><A NAME="1637"><A HREF="DOCNAME#1637">1637</A></A></B>
<P>
	If petitions bring to the public eye an issue which is 
sufficiently important and if the petitioners have a sufficiently 
energetic and informed member of Parliament, that issue will 
find its way to the floor of this House in a way that will be 
productive. That is my first point.
<P>
	I have already stated my second point a couple of times. Let us 
not rush to have government by mail. If we think this through, 
there is no need to come here at all. We just need little buttons in 
27 million homes-if you are for this, push that button; if you 
are against that, push that button. That is not what government is 
about. That is not what this House is about. This is a forum for 
debate. I have had members of all parties say to me since they 
have come here in one form or another that they did not quite 
realize how it was, the implications of this.
<P>
<B>D (1720) </B>
<P>
	I have had to say to myself and to others many times that is 
why I am here. I have not come here with a closed mind. I have 
not been sent here as a proxy by the people of Burin-St. 
George's. Twenty-five thousand people put their <I>x</I> after my 
name last fall, October 25. Many of them had done it on 
occasions before. They have had nine occasions to cast their 
votes for or against me, as the case may be. There is a method of 
recall. If that is the concern, then I have difficulty.
<P>
	I have written down what the member for Calgary North said: 
``Representation has been a minuscule element here''. I have to 
say to her that she might want to look at those words because she 
might have said them in the heat of debate.
<P>
	What an insult.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simmons:</B> What was I doing when I was out beating my 
gums for the last aeons of years about the fishery problems on 
the south coast of Newfoundland? What was that?
<P>
	How about the times I got up here and talked about the need 
for better student aid programs? How about the times I got up 
here and talked about some fairness, some balance in the way 
that we have transfer payments to the various provinces? How 
about the time I got up here and asked for tougher laws in terms 
of gun control?
<P>
	Was I just pushing my own agenda at those times? Was I 
maybe representing somebody once in a while? Or, in her words, 
was it just a minuscule number of times-I was doing it by 
accident, I came here to push my own agenda. I do not think she 
believes that for a moment. I do not know her well but what I 
know of her tells me that she does not believe that kind of 
nonsense. That is absolute, unadulterated nonsense, I have to 
say to her.
<P>
	She might want to retract it because if she does not retract it 
she has insulted not just me. I have had a few insults. I can take 
them. There are a few other members of Parliament around here. 
Even if we exclude all the members of her party who have just 
come here, let us go  back and put them in a special category that 
they would not dare to do anything but represent. Let us buy that 
line for the moment. It is the same for my friends in the Bloc 
who, with the exception of six or seven of them, are here for the 
first time. It is the same for a number on this side and those who 
would like to be on this side, those over in the Siberian section 
over there. We plan to have those numbers for a long time to 
come.
<P>
	A lot of us have been here before and a lot of members of other 
parties have come here. I just had the feeling, perhaps I was 
completely duped by all this, when I watched them when they 
got up and presented petitions and raised issues that they were 
actually representing people. Now I have to accept that all the 
time they were here they were just flogging their own words, 
just doing their own thing.
<P>
	I do not want to make light of the member's comment because 
she also used an example that I wanted to use so I will use it as 
well. She used the example of the GST in the last Parliament. 
There was a clear case in which despite the petitions, the 
objections of 85 per cent of the Canadian people, the 
government rammed it through. There is a case in which the 
system broke down. It broke down temporarily. People dealt 
with it in spades when the election came. The party that did that 
has only two members in this House right now.
<P>
	The system broke down temporarily but it is basically the 
exception. I can give another example. Around 1983 the 
government of then Prime Minister Trudeau was contemplating 
some changes in old age pensions. Then petitions came in. Then 
the will of the people was heard. We very quickly abandoned any 
plans we had on old age pension reform at that particular time.
<P>
<B>D (1725) </B>
<P>
	We cannot have an election every day. Is four years not 
enough? Let us make it three years. If the time between elections 
is the issue, if we cannot be trusted to come down here for four 
years at a time, let us haul us back as they do in Congress in the 
United States every two years or whatever. Let us change the 
time period.
<P>
	Let us not dupe the people into thinking that all will be happy 
and hunky dory if they can mail in their decision on today's 
problem, push the button today, send in the petition tomorrow 
morning.
<P>
	The problem, as I illustrated in my opening example, with 
petitions and with the will of the people is that it is not always 
black and white. Sometimes 30 per cent want one thing and 35 
per cent want another and the other 35 want something else. 
What do we do, have three policies?
<P>
	We cannot beg the essential question that a government is 
elected to govern. If it does it in accordance with its mandate it 
can face the people squarely next time around. If it betrays that 
<P>
<HR>
<><B><A NAME="1638"><A HREF="DOCNAME#1638">1638</A></A></B>
<P>
mandate, we have a very recent example of what happens to that 
kind of a government.
<P>
	There is a notion that somehow we can undermine the 
electorate all the time. I mentioned 25,000 voted for me, others 
can quote even more impressive figures. My friend from North 
York could tell us, I suppose, that over 100,000 people voted for 
him. Were all those people a bunch of dupes? Were they all 
absolutely stupid? Every member sitting in this House had 
either a majority or a plurality. They came here with the direct 
blessings of many thousands of people in each case.
<P>
	Now I am being told today that these people did not mean that. 
What they would rather do instead of all those <I>x</I>s is have a lot of 
petitions. God bless them. Send us the petitions, lots of them. 
Send us all the petitions they want. If some of the people in 
Burin-St. George's are signing those petitions I have to say to 
them, each one of those 25,000 darlings who voted for me, that I 
will respect their petition, I will hear their grievance but I will 
not let it cancel out my basic mandate here which is to represent 
all the people of Burin-St. George's, not just the people who 
can hustle petitions best. That is my mandate here. That is a 
mandate I intend to serve to the very best of my ability.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot):</B> Mr. Speaker, I certainly do 
not have to ask the hon. member any questions because I know 
where he stands. That is pretty well for the status quo.
<P>
	I would like to make a couple of comments that he might want 
to respond to. He took exception to our member from Calgary 
when she indicated that she felt the representation has been 
minuscule. The member's former leader, Mr. Trudeau, made the 
statement that when backbenchers get 50 feet from the House of 
Commons they are nobodies.
<P>
	Perhaps he could take that into consideration and perhaps he 
could take into consideration what the people think about that 
kind of representation where a small group of people within a 
party and within a government decides the direction that the 
government is going to take on important issues that impact 
upon individuals so severely.
<P>
	I have had people say that those who oppose these populace 
principles of referendum, recall, citizens' initiative, the reform 
of the Senate, a triple-E senate, are afraid of their own people. 
They do not trust them. They are saying to them at election time: 
``Trust us with the authority you will invest in us by way of 
sending us to Ottawa, but we do not want to have to trust you to 
hold us accountable for the way that we conduct your affairs on a 
daily basis''.
<P>
<B>D (1730 ) </B>
<P>
	The hon. member mentioned this whole huge mistake that the 
former government made with regard to the GST. Look at the 
damage that was done and has been done and will continue to be 
done. We are saying that if we had a mechanism in place through 
which the people could have stopped that damage, that 
ill-conceived piece of legislation would not have been passed 
into legislation;  and the enormous economic damage that has 
been done and that has been recognized by the Liberal 
government would not have been done. This is what we are 
saying. The people need these checks and balances. This is to 
what the member for Calgary was alluding.
<P>
	We are not saying we want to run government by push buttons, 
as the hon. member stated. We want to place reasonable checks 
and balances in place whereby when the people are aroused over 
an issue they have some means of stopping ill-conceived 
legislation from coming forward that will have such a 
detrimental impact on their lives and the lives of their children.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simmons:</B> I would like to thank the hon. member for 
Crowfoot. He mentions the status quo. No, I am not very big on 
the status quo, not very big on change either. If something is 
worth changing, let us change it. Let us not change it for the sake 
of changing it.
<P>
	The hon. member might be surprised to hear this, but I liked 
most of what he said. I thought his example of Mr. Trudeau was a 
bit outdated, but that is beside the point. But at the end, the 
member for Crowfoot particularly talks about checks and 
balances.
<P>
	In 1992 in 52 weeks I travelled 49 times from Ottawa to 
Burin-St. George's. Two weekends ago I was absent from this 
Chamber on Friday and Monday and between Friday and 
Monday I flew to Newfoundland and back, which means eight 
hours on the plane, four hours each way. I spent 26 hours in a car, 
and I attended 29 meetings of fishermen's committees, town 
councils, et cetera.
<P>
	I say to my good friend from Crowfoot there is the check and 
balance he is looking for. If the member stays in touch with his 
constituents he cannot really come back here and ignore the 
advice he has heard. I have to say to you, sir, as faithfully as I can 
that I reflect the wishes of my constituents here.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver):</B> Mr. Speaker, our motion 
seems to have been a burr under the saddle of the members 
opposite today.
<P>
	The hon. member decries a government by petition, as if we 
had proposed government by petition. Debating the occasional 
major petition is hardly government by petition. It is certainly 
sad the members opposite are afraid of reforms that would show 
Canadians we really care about their opinions between 
elections.
<P>
	Would the hon. member consider a petition with one million 
signatures on it worth debating. I am asking the hon. member the 
same question I asked earlier of another member: Why is he 
afraid to debate a major petition? Is he afraid that in front of the 
television cameras his constituents will see that he does not 
actually represent them?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<><B><A NAME="1639"><A HREF="DOCNAME#1639">1639</A></A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simmons:</B> The member for North Vancouver, as is the 
case most of the time, is in a fairly feisty mood. But in the 
process he should not attribute motives about people who are 
scared. The degree of scare or fear is not measured by the side of 
the aisle on which you sit. I sat on that side of the aisle a fair 
number of years as well.
<P>
<B>D (1735 ) </B>
<P>
	Actually I will check it out because that is the one my good 
friend from Kindersley-Lloydminster has as a matter of fact. 
His question gets lost in the rhetoric which implies that all the 
people over here somehow are bad guys and bad girls because 
they sit over here and they are all scared of everything.
<P>
	No is the answer to his question. Bring in the petition with the 
million signatures and I will be glad to debate it any day at all. 
The issue I was talking about was a bit more than that. I was 
getting concerned because if I am hearing too much on this 
issue, the member for North Vancouver can correct me. I am 
hearing that if we had all the petitions debated here and we had 
referendums on what to put on our toast every morning, the 
world would be hunky dory. Everything would be happy, happy.
<P>
	I say to him and to other members of the House that until we 
change the system, the government is elected to govern. When it 
governs badly, as the last one did, it reaps its reward during 
elections.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South):</B> Mr. Speaker, let me be 
brief.
<P>
	The question has come up whether a petition with a million 
signatures on it should be debated in the House. Maybe we 
should consider something like that. What if a petition came 
before the House with a million signatures saying that official 
bilingualism should be discontinued in Canada.
<P>
	I believe there are questions the government could deal with 
without having to debate them. It is a matter of policy. Possibly 
the member could comment on this issue. If a petition comes 
forward for debate, if we follow what the Reform Party is 
suggesting, how would other members get prepared to debate 
that petition without themselves going back and somehow doing 
some sort of work to determine the position of their 
constituents? It is totally impractical. Maybe the member for 
Burin-St. George's could comment.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> A colleague wants a quick question as 
well. The shorter his answer the better his chance.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simmons: </B>Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from 
Mississauga South. The fact that it is complicated does not rule 
it out. Most things we do here are confusing and complicated.
<P>
	If members would look at the Order Paper and the motion put 
down by my friend from Edmonton Southwest, the one we are 
now debating, the answer to his question and the question put 
previously by the gentleman from North Vancouver is answered.
<P>
	They are both answered in the convention we are using here 
right now. On opposition days, for example, even if we had a big 
bad government, members can put down for debate whatever 
they want to. I would suspect that if the Reform Party, or any 
other party in this Chamber, received a petition from a million 
people it would be awfully stupid not to make it the subject of an 
opposition day motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Serré (Timiskaming-French River):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I want to make a comment in support of what my 
colleague from Burin-St. George's has been saying for the past 
10 or 15 minutes. Let me relate a little experience I had during 
the campaign.
<P>
	Repeatedly the polls in my riding said that people were in 
favour of capital punishment by 80 or 85 per cent. Throughout 
the campaign I was asked about 50 times whether if I was elected 
to Parliament, would I support my constituents and vote 
according to the majority and for capital punishment. My 
answer was no, that I was against capital punishment on a matter 
of principle and I would not vote for capital punishment. I said 
that if they felt strongly enough about this issue, they had one 
choice, not to vote for me.
<P>
	Lo and behold when the ballot box came in, I had 60 per cent 
of the votes. If my arithmetic is right, even if I had the whole 20 
per cent of the people who are against capital punishment voting 
for me-I doubt that because a lot of them are NDP-I still had 
40 per cent of the people who are for capital punishment.
<P>
	I feel I have a mandate to come in the House and make my own 
decision and vote against capital punishment. This is real 
democracy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simmons:</B> Mr. Speaker, my friend from 
Timiskaming-French River makes the very important point 
that if one governs and makes decisions, and if members are 
elected on the basis of one issue, the conundrum arises when one 
has, for example, a healthy majority for capital punishment in 
the member's riding but on another issue many of that healthy 
majority are on the other side, and on a third issue it is on a 
different side. If he pleases the 65 per cent or 85 per cent on that 
issue, what does he do on the next issue and the next when they 
are in different camps? That is why the member is elected, I 
submit, not so much on the basis of his positions on each of 
1,015 items, but rather on the basis of his ability to make the 
right judgment when the time arrives.
<P>
<B>D (1740) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a privilege to address the House on the motion 
before us today with regard to debate of petitions.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<><B><A NAME="1640"><A HREF="DOCNAME#1640">1640</A></A></B>
<P>
	I must confess I am a bit disappointed in the response we have 
had from the other side. This motion was a request asking the 
government to consider opening up the House for debate on 
major petitions. I am quite surprised that in its response it seems 
to be quite strongly opposed to even considering, debating or 
discussing what we can do to improve this important facet that 
Canadians have of dialoguing with us here.
<P>
	I was a bit disappointed by the hon. member for Kingston and 
the Islands who spoke quite strongly against considering a time 
during the session when we could debate petitions. I was also 
quite saddened by the hon. member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell for his rather vociferous and 
fierce presentation in opposition to even considering our 
motion. He suggested that it was improper for Reform MPs to 
bring this forward for debate. I found it quite interesting that he 
would quote Edmund Burke, the father of Tories. It may mean 
that we will have to change the title of Grits to Tories in the 
future, but perhaps that is who they look up to and thought they 
would try to receive their inspiration from that source in the 
future.
<P>
	Our motion was put forward in good faith to try to open up 
some dialogue on the matter of petitions. As members are no 
doubt aware almost daily petitions are brought to the House, 
certainly often at great effort on the part of Canadians who have 
issues they feel are important enough that they would actually 
petition those of us who are elected representatives to in some 
way deal with them.
<P>
	Perhaps it is because I am new here. I know the hon. member 
for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell said we can introduce 
motions through private members' bills and so on to bring those 
petitions to the floor, but it is a difficult and slow process. I do 
not think it gives proper recognition for the time and effort that 
many Canadians put into trying to bring the issues that are of 
vital importance to them to the floor of the House.
<P>
	I know it is not possible to address every petition brought 
forward by Canadians and our motion does not purport to do 
that. It states that there should be a time when the House would 
deal with serious petitions that are brought to the House, such as 
the one of 2.5 million signatures brought in the other day. We 
have heard several separate petitions concerning serial killer 
cards brought from both sides of the House and there is 
unanimous agreement that this should be stopped. It is 
important that legislation be introduced and that this issue be 
dealt with. These are the types of things that Reform is 
suggesting should be debated.
<P>
	I really believe the hesitance of the other side to want to do 
this is a lack of confidence in rank and file Canadians. Often 
times all rank and file Canadians see of this House is what they 
see on their television, usually during Question Period, which I 
do not think is a totally accurate reflection, at least I hope it is 
not, of what goes on here.
<P>
	I want to talk for just a couple of minutes about why I became 
involved in politics. I believe it relates to the motion before us 
today. As a young adult my government was a Liberal 
government. I felt quite alienated from that government. They 
introduced legislation that in no way, shape or form was 
beneficial to my industry, to my family or to those matters that 
concerned me. However, in my area almost all of the members of 
the House did not sit on the government side. A Liberal was a 
rare species in western Canada in the 1960s and the 1970s. 
During that period the Prime Minister told me, a farmer, that I 
should sell my own wheat, and he said it in rather unflattering 
terms. He gave me no means by which I could actually sell that 
wheat. Then his government introduced the national energy 
program which devastated an industry in my part of Canada. We 
are still suffering some of the results of the national energy 
program which so financially and economically crippled my 
part of the country.
<P>
<B>D (1745) </B>
<P>
	Then the insult to injury was the tax and spend of the last few 
years of the Liberal government before it was replaced by the 
Conservatives which began bringing us down the dangerous 
slope of increased debts by uncontrolled annual federal 
spending. Western Canada kept voting for the members who 
stayed on this side of the Chamber, whether they be Progressive 
Conservatives or New Democrats.
<P>
	Finally, the Liberals had infuriated enough Canadians that 
they lost their support in Ontario and Quebec as well. Then there 
was a government and my member was on the government side 
and there was strong representation in the House from western 
Canada, in fact across all of Canada. There was a massive 
victory for the Progressive Conservative government. There 
were very few Liberals in the House. If ever there was a mandate 
to govern, the Conservatives had it. They had 208 seats if I 
remember correctly. However, they did not maintain any 
accountability to Canadians. We saw no difference in my part of 
Canada in the type of government we had under the new 
administration in comparison to what we had under the old 
administration.
<P>
	The light began to go on in a number of our heads. We thought 
perhaps the people we were sending to Ottawa were not the 
problem. Perhaps it was the system.
<P>
	The new Conservative administration followed on the same 
course as the Trudeau administration had. The Conservatives 
introduced the GST against the wishes of a majority of 
Canadians. They said: ``We have a mandate to do this. If you do 
not think we have done the right thing you can talk to us about it 
at election time''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<><B><A NAME="1641"><A HREF="DOCNAME#1641">1641</A></A></B>
<P>
	Adding insult to injury, the Conservatives introduced the 
Meech Lake accord. I might add they had the support of the 
Liberal and New Democratic members in this House. They said: 
``We speak on behalf of Canadians. You can trust our wisdom. 
We have thought this through very carefully. What we are doing 
is in the best interests of all Canadians''.
<P>
	Thank goodness not only Reformers but a number of 
Canadians have demanded more input in the decisions made in 
this Chamber because it is getting out of control. They have no 
input, no means by which to redirect the politicians, leaders or 
members in the House of Commons if they get going in the 
wrong direction.
<P>
	Fortunately, the Charlottetown accord was the time for testing 
the wisdom of this Chamber. Remember there nearly was 
unanimous agreement in this Chamber in support of the 
Charlottetown accord. Of course the member for Beaver River 
vociferously opposed the accord and a few other members were 
also opposed to it. It turned out that this body had lost total 
contact with what was happening outside of this place. I have 
talked to people who were very much involved in the 
Charlottetown accord who said: ``We had no idea they were 
supporting it. We had no idea that Canadians saw this issue so 
differently from what we did''. They had lost touch.
<P>
	Perhaps we could begin, and I emphasize begin, to turn the 
tables, to bring back accountability, to bring back 
communication between members in this House and their 
constituents. We start by looking at the little things we could do 
to keep us in touch with those who sent us here. We are not sent 
with a mandate to do whatever we pleased. Every time the 
governing party has changed it has been to kick the other guys 
out. When are we going to wake up and realize that? We cannot 
say we have a mandate to govern when Canadians are merely 
replacing one group of members with another because they 
cannot tolerate what the first group has been doing. They have 
lost touch with Canadians. We have to reverse our thinking.
<P>
	I am disappointed that members on the opposite side who 
have been arguing against this motion would be satisfied with a 
substandard form of parliamentary government. They are 
prepared to bury their heads in the sand to maintain our form of 
government exactly as it has been for the last 127 years.
<P>
	We are entering the 21st century and for the most part we are 
still operating in a 19th century mode. It is truly unfortunate that 
we do not elect members to the other place. It is unfortunate that 
we handle petitions merely as a formality and very seldom deal 
with them in the significant way they deserve because of the 
effort Canadians have made in bringing them to our attention.
<P>
<B>D (1750 ) </B>
<P>
	In closing, it all boils down to whether we as members of 
Parliament want to consider the importance of individual 
Canadians or whether we want to be merely attentive to the 
highly efficient lobby groups and special interest groups that are 
able to bend our ears. Those groups can afford to send their 
representatives with their glossy brochures to our offices to try 
to twist our arms to present their views in this Chamber.
<P>
	A petition is a very inexpensive way for hard working 
Canadians who love their country and are concerned about a 
number of issues, some with which we agree and others with 
which we are opposed, to bring their issues before us. To just 
summarily dismiss them is not showing the deserved respect to 
the people who are responsible for our being here. They have 
entrusted us to make wise decisions and to keep the lines of 
communication open with them, so that we will act on their 
behalf and on their stead.
<P>
	Therefore I would hardly speak for reform of this place just 
because it has not totally collapsed in the past. Just because it 
effectively serves us in some areas does not mean the status quo 
is what is good for us in the future.
<P>
	The fact that Canadians are sweeping out one administration 
to replace it by another again speaks to the fact that we have to 
look at reform of this Chamber if we are going to give Canadians 
the type of government and the strength in their leaders they 
expect and deserve.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morris Bodnar (Saskatoon-Dundurn):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member for Kindersley-Lloydminster and other 
members have referred to consultation and discussions with 
their constituents to get their thoughts and the matter of checks 
and balances in determining what to do throughout.
<P>
	Is the hon. member suggesting a consultative process or is it a 
means of trying to avoid responsibility for important decisions 
that have to be made in this House from time to time on 
extremely important matters? Therefore, when the time comes 
they do not have to blame themselves for the decision made.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> I thank the hon. member for his very good 
question which deserves a good answer.
<P>
	The fact that we consult with Canadians and hear their point 
of view is not shirking responsibility. I am not suggesting the 
hon. member is saying that and I trust that he is not saying that. 
The fact of the matter is if we are not prepared to listen and 
consult with constituents we can get so far off base that they will 
remove us from office. In the process we not only lose our 
position here which really is not the important issue, but the 
country is led in the wrong direction and often damaging 
decisions are made.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<><B><A NAME="1642"><A HREF="DOCNAME#1642">1642</A></A></B>
<P>
	For instance, our national debt which is now over $.5 trillion, 
is a heritage we are giving to our children that they have had no 
part in making. Because we have not been listening to parents 
and grandparents concerned about the welfare of future 
generations of Canadians, we may have a very black mark in the 
history of this country.
<P>
	Canadians are responsible. If we include them in the decision 
making process we might be surprised by the wisdom of their 
decisions. It strikes me very odd that hon. members laud their 
electors for their good judgment in sending them to this House. 
Then all of a sudden once they get here their electors have lost 
all that good judgment. They are not capable of making any 
sound decision based on the good of Canada. They are only 
concerned about their own narrow interest.
<P>
	I do not accept that. I believe if Canadians know they would 
actually have some impact on the decisions made in this House 
we would find that the quality of those decisions, if they are 
provided with the necessary information would be equal or 
better than the quality of the decisions made by us.
<P>
<B>D (1755 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Public Works and Government Services):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have two questions.
<P>
	I wonder if my hon. colleague would define what a major 
petition and a serious motion are. Those are two terms he used in 
his comments. Is it numbers? Is it the issue itself? Is it 
something else?
<P>
	I am also wondering whether my hon. colleague is not being 
somewhat, or perhaps quite a lot, mischievous. He has turned it 
around to talk about consultation. Let me say that all of us 
consult and consult a whole lot. It may be some of us have 
selective understanding of what is being said but this is not a 
question about consulting. This is a question about petitions but 
he has cleverly managed to massage it and swing it around.
<P>
	I want people to note the buttons he touched. The 
Constitution. Why? Because he knows full well that it is very 
delicate in the riding he represents. The national energy program 
was part of his remarks. What has that got to do with this 
particular motion?
<P>
	I am wondering whether the hon. member is not being rather 
mischievous.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Before the reply, I think there is an 
understanding in the House that we do not impute motives to 
other members in the House, particularly in a new Parliament.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have no idea what the 
Constitution has to do with the national energy program so I will 
pass on that one.
<P>
	We mentioned three areas where we believe that debate of 
petitions would be relevant in this House. The first one was 
based on the serial killer cards. In my short tenure in this House 
there have been a dozen or perhaps two dozen petitions relating 
to that issue certainly from all across Canada. That is definitely 
an important issue to Canadians because it is coming from both 
sides of the House and a number of fairly large petitions are 
being presented.
<P>
	The other petition we mentioned was the one which I believe 
had 2.5 million signatures and speaks to the importance 
Canadians place on it.
<P>
	The third petition we mentioned was the one tabled in the 
House today on recall. There were 30,000 signatures directly 
dealing with matters in this House and in fact with a member 
who sits in our midst.
<P>
	These are three very good examples I would give to the hon. 
member as the types of petitions that may deserve some special 
consideration by this House at least once during a session or 
once a year.
<P>
	I do not perceive that as being mischievous at all. I believe it 
is in the spirit of reform and goodwill and in consultation in 
respect of Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> Mr. Speaker, this resolution 
before us concerns debating petitions before this House.
<P>
	We should recognize first it is a very basic principle in this 
institution that any means by which the ideas and the influence 
of the general public can enter this assembly should be 
welcomed. We should not try to deter it or stop it in any way, but 
our job as legislators or people who set the rules by which this 
House operates is to make sure those rules are as open and 
functional as possible. I say that in opening to set out a principle 
by which I would like to design the rest of my remarks.
<P>
	Since coming to this House I have noted some very good 
differences from the Alberta legislative assembly in which I 
served.
<P>
	The first is members' statements. This event does not exist in 
that assembly. The 15 minutes just prior to question period is the 
most informative part of this assembly. I hear ideas from all 
across this nation, from the maritimes, Ontario, Quebec, the 
prairies, British Columbia. They are presented in a minute and I 
am able to grasp very quickly a concern or a problem or an 
attitude in a particular region. That is significant and is a good 
change. I certainly commend those who were sitting in this 
assembly when that change to the House rules was made.
<P>
	There is a second difference that I recognize as important. The 
moment after a person has made a presentation in debate we are 
allowed a period of time, either five minutes or ten minutes, 
during which we can question the speaker on a subject. We can 
ferret out more material, more attitude or more information with  

<P>
<HR>
<><B><A NAME="1643"><A HREF="DOCNAME#1643">1643</A></A></B>
<P>
regard to the respective person's presentation. It is an excellent 
innovation.
<P>
<B>D (1800) </B>
<P>
	That was not an innovation in the legislative assembly of 
Alberta. I mention those two items because I have been 
impressed by them. There are others in this assembly I have 
noted that have opened the door so the democratic process can 
work.
<P>
	We can look at the concept of petitions and their presentation. 
I want to say the following about petitions. In my many years in 
the legislative assembly of Alberta numerous petitions came to 
the floor and were tabled. Often a member was committed to the 
petition and believed that something should happen or the 
petition was an added piece of information that could influence 
the legislative assembly. That very same thing happens in the 
House of Commons.
<P>
	Another thing I noted, though, was that many petitions 
presented by members were often presented without 
commitment, without the objective of bringing about change or 
representing a group of people. They were often brought to the 
assembly with political expediency. They were laid upon the 
table. They would table them but they would run away from 
them. They really said to the group: ``I have tabled your 
petition'' and the people felt that maybe members represented 
them or maybe not. There was an expediency about it. There was 
not sincerity at all.
<P>
	The hon. member for Burin-St. George's referenced 
somewhat in his remarks this afternoon that anybody would sign 
a petition. We could go up and down the street and anybody 
would sign it, no matter. We could take it to the pro side or the 
con side and anybody would sign it. The inference was that the 
petition did not have credibility.
<P>
	Why is there no real credibility in petitions? Why do we look 
at them as documents that do not have the credibility they should 
have? Maybe one of the reasons, and it is not the only reason, is 
that we as legislators or parliamentarians have not given them 
the credibility they should have. People often sign a petition 
thinking they will just present it and nothing will happen; that it 
will just gather dust somewhere in the back rooms of the 
parliamentary system; that it will just be there and nothing will 
really happen; that it does not matter, nobody will ever look at 
the names on it anyhow.
<P>
	If we were to give petitions some credibility in the House, if 
there were an item on the agenda so that when they were 
presented and, as the Reform Party is suggesting, were debated 
then they would have some credibility. Certainly they should 
have some substance so that they create a certain action or 
reaction as such. What about a petition, if we were to debate it or 
it some special status on our orders of the day or on our agenda 
before us? What should it have? What are some of those criteria?
<P>
	A petition would be debated. As I see it a member must be 
committed to or responsible for the petition. We could look at it 
or examine it. Maybe a certain number of members could 
indicate by signing some form that they are prepared to bring the 
petition to the floor of the House. That could be one of the 
criteria. It could not be a petition that is a loose cannon on the 
floor for which nobody is really taking responsibility.
<P>
	The group that initiates the petition should have the 
responsibility of convincing some members of either side of the 
Parliament of Canada that it is a good petition and that it should 
be debated. They should be able to give the reasons and in turn 
get those respective members of Parliament to take it forward 
for them. That would be the first criterion.
<P>
<B>D (1805) </B>
<P>
	Second would be the numbers and the regional representation 
of the petition. If it were a petition to keep open the post office in 
a little town in my constituency, it would be a very personal kind 
of petition. The issue to be debated should be of some concern to 
the majority of constituencies across the nation, not just one 
constituency as such.
<P>
	Those are a couple of criteria we could look at in order to 
bring it up on the agenda. Possibly there are others that we could 
design.
<P>
	We have referred to other requests for parliamentary reform 
to come about and to be brought before this assembly. This is 
another item that could be referred to the procedure and House 
affairs committee for consideration as an innovation. It would 
indicate to the people of the nation that we are not just following 
the old rules and saying that is the way it has to be done.
<P>
	We are willing to change as we have done in some excellent 
ways so far. We want to look at and try new things. This idea 
would certainly be new. I do not know of any other house that 
would treat petitions in the way we are suggesting here as the 
Reform Party. It would be very different as such.
<P>
	This is where I was going to note some of my sources. The 
member for Kingston and the Islands informed me informally 
that the House received anywhere from 1,000 to 1,500 petitions 
each session. There is no way we are saying as the Reform Party 
that we should discuss all those petitions. Of course not. Most 
likely there are some of major significance that meet some 
criteria we could establish. They could be brought before us 
under an agenda item called petitions for debate and dealt with 
in that manner. I am sure that would involve more people in 
trying to change the laws for the betterment of our citizens.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<><B><A NAME="1644"><A HREF="DOCNAME#1644">1644</A></A></B>
<P>
	There was some reference made in earlier comments that we 
could use the format of a private member's bill or of a resolution 
in the House. That is most likely true. That would be another 
way by which we as private members could get the issue on the 
table and debated before this assembly. I am sure we will use 
that format in the Parliament of Canada.
<P>
	Those are two items on the agenda. What would it hurt to give 
some prominence on the agenda to petitions? Maybe the 
consequence of that would be to add a little more credibility to 
the concept of a petition. Before they were brought to the House 
they would be signed by people, knowing that they would be 
debated, that their names would be raised in this assembly and 
that change could take place. They would think ahead a little 
more about their responsibility before they signed the petition.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (York-Simcoe):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
really having a great deal of difficulty here. I thought the 
purpose of the motion was to increase democracy in Canada, to 
increase the opportunity for democratic debate and to further the 
goals of populism.
<P>
	During the election I sat with people who were soon to 
become members of my constituency and had different ideas for 
example on the abortion debate. I gave them a very strong 
commitment that even though my feeling was very different 
from theirs I would bring it forward in the House.
<P>
	I have a great deal of difficulty with the suggestion that a 
member of Parliament should decide what petitions are coming 
forward. If there are only 25 people in my riding of 
York-Simcoe who have signed a petition, their petition is 
coming to the House and their issue is coming to the House.
<P>
<B>D (1810 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speaker (Lethbridge)</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for 
York-Simcoe has made a very emotional plea for her 
constituents in terms of making presentations to the House. 
There is no way that the Reform Party is going to interfere with 
the presentation of petitions in the format in which they are now 
presented. We can still received 1,000 to 1,500 petitions and her 
constituents can be heard in this assembly.
<P>
	The point we are trying to make is that some petitions need 
special consideration. All we are saying is let us set up a 
mechanism by which two, three, four, five or even ten out of 
1,000 to 1,500 could find their place in major debate in the 
House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South):</B> Mr. Speaker, I heard 
what the Reform members have been saying. I have been sitting 
here for hours listening to the debate. However when I look at 
the Order Paper I have to ask why these particular examples are 
there.
<P>
	The first is with respect to serial killer cards. We know they 
have been discussed and that there have been petitions and 
members' statements. Members of the Reform Party must 
understand that the Minister of Justice stood in the House and 
said that they are working on it now. They are looking at the 
charter provisions to make sure that legislation can come 
through and be effective. That is being handled as a result of the 
petitioning process. We do not have to debate it any more. It is a 
very bad example.
<P>
	The second is with respect to young offenders. This 
government was elected and one of its main planks was to 
reform the Young Offenders Act. Many people brought in 
petitions in that regard. Is it necessary to debate in the House 
what the government is already committed to doing?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> Mr. Speaker, the intent of the 
government is to make changes in terms of the killer cards and in 
terms of the Young Offenders Act. However, often legislation is 
brought in and it is senior levels of government, the consultants, 
the minister and the caucus of the respective minister that put 
the ideas together. Then they are presented on the floor of the 
House. Often there are major weaknesses in the legislation 
presented here.
<P>
	My hon. colleague from Wild Rose last week made a 
tremendous speech with respect to the deficiencies in one piece 
of criminal justice legislation. A petition to the House could 
have added to that legislation. I think we are missing an 
opportunity.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Unfortunately my friend from 
Waterloo has a stopwatch and he reminds me that the time is up.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Waterloo):</B> Mr. Speaker, let it not be 
said that there are no reformers in this place. In entering the 
debate I noticed the member for Lethbridge said was that we 
should change the way we handle petitions, that we should 
somehow handle them more seriously. If we were to do that the 
people who sign these petitions would take more care and be 
more serious in signing them. I did not totally follow the logic 
but so be it.
<P>
	To some extent I too have been disappointed in the debate 
today. I come from a municipal background in which we actually 
had representatives from all the political parties. I had the good 
fortune to sit beside a Conservative member who was a good 
friend of mine. I notice that in this House they are few and far 
between. As a matter of fact we had more members on my 
municipal council of 11 than we have Conservative members in 
the House.
<P>
	I go back to my riding and talk to them every once in a while 
because in some sense they have a more balanced perspective 
coming from right of centre. I appreciate that.
<P>
	As a municipal councillor I have handled petitions on such 
things as people being opposed to a granny flat.  Virtually 100 
per cent of a neighbourhood said it did not want a granny flat 
<P>
<HR>
<><B><A NAME="1645"><A HREF="DOCNAME#1645">1645</A></A></B>
<P>
because it would start the destruction of the neighbourhood. 
That happened in my community.
<P>
<B>D (1815) </B>
<P>
	I took the petition seriously because the petition said that if 
we were to allow a granny flat, this was the thin edge of the 
wedge. The next thing we would have were high rises in single 
family neighbourhood housing.
<P>
	I took the petition and went around knocking on everybody's 
door. I explained to them what the petition said was not correct. I 
explained to them that the character of their neighbourhood was 
going to remain the same. The fact was that virtually 100 per 
cent of the people in that neighbourhood signed the petition. I 
take every petition that I receive very seriously.
<P>
	We received a petition on medium density housing, group 
homes and extended nursing homes. People opposed that. One 
would have thought the Hell's Angels motorcycle gang was 
going to establish a clubhouse. Instead we were talking about a 
nursing home where many of us, if we are fortunate enough, will 
go if we are around that long. We had petitions on day care, 
development, street pedlars, slowing down growth, reforming 
the Young Offenders Act, you name it, a municipal council gets 
it all.
<P>
	In municipal politics any delegation can come forward and 
make a presentation to council. Therefore petitions are things I 
take very seriously and I believe most members in this House 
do.
<P>
	I believe every member consults with his or her constituents 
on a regular basis. Somehow the suggestion that we are not to be 
trusted is wrong. Everybody who is in this House is concerned 
about serving constituents.
<P>
	Let me put a petition to the House, because this is an issue that 
came up during the election campaign. It relates to pensions and 
double dipping and how I stand on this issue. I had no problem 
saying that I thought there needs to be pension reform. I said I 
would support the age of 60.
<P>
	I disagreed strongly with the concept of double dipping. If I as 
the member wanted to get a petition ready and if I were to ask the 
question of whether the electorate agrees that there should be no 
double dipping, there would be an overwhelming number of 
people who would sign the petition. I would change the petition 
slightly, keeping in mind that we have three different levels of 
government, or actually four because in Ontario we have the 
municipal, regional, provincial and the federal government.
<P>
	One of the things that the leader of the Reform Party has 
always said and I agree with him 100 per cent is that there is only 
one taxpayer. Keeping that in mind if I were to write a petition 
and it asks whether you agree that double dipping should be 
outlawed, the answer would be an overwhelming yes.
<P>
	If I worked the petition a bit differently and ask whether they 
believe that if somebody is collecting a pension for sitting on 
municipal council or in a provincial legislature and they get 
elected as members of Parliament, meaning that is double 
dipping, do they think it should be stopped? I can tell everybody 
just from my talking with people that the answer would again be 
yes. I guess in some ways I really do wish that we could try to 
make this House a little less partisan and try to debate the merits 
of legislation that come up.
<P>
	The speaker from Wild Rose was referred to after speaking in 
this House on Friday. He got into the whole issue of crime, 
justice and lawlessness in this country. I found the discourse 
rather bothersome because the crime issue is an easy one to pick 
on. Interestingly enough that is one of the examples being raised 
here. It talks about the Young Offenders Act. It was not too long 
ago when the Minister of Justice rose in the House and talked 
about a report by a gentleman by the name of Dr. Anthony Dube. 
Dr. Anthony Dube is a criminologist at the University of 
Toronto. He knows more about the public perception of the 
judicial system, he knows more about the public perception as to 
the extent of crime in Canada than probably any other Canadian. 
He is an expert on those issues.
<P>
<B>D (1820) </B>
<P>
	He found that Canadians on the whole believe that they live in 
a much more violent society than they actually do. That is an 
interesting commentary. Where does that come from and what 
kind of implication does it have? I can tell you where it comes 
from. Dr. Dube outlined it. It comes from the fact that the 
popular media insists on feeding us a daily dose of some 
horrendous crime that takes place in Canada, and if nothing goes 
on in Canada, it will go to the United States; if nothing happens 
in the United States it will go to Europe, Africa, Asia, wherever 
it has to go.
<P>
	We have news crews in this country ready to move on a 
second's notice, to go out to some crime scene so they can splash 
it all across the TV screen and the next day in the printed media 
with the sole purpose of somehow driving ratings. It is not hard 
to understand how people perceive our communities to be more 
violent than they really are.
<P>
	When you compare us with the United States of America we 
are a much more peaceful society than it is. Unfortunately we 
are not as fortunate as Europe. This is talking in terms of hard 
statistics. There are places in Europe where they do not report on 
crime hardly at all because they do not see any socially 
redeeming value in it. The suggestion is there that it might be 
encouraging crime.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<><B><A NAME="1646"><A HREF="DOCNAME#1646">1646</A></A></B>
<P>
	The other thing that Dr. Dube talked about was the public 
perception of the sentences that judges hand out. He had two 
groups. To one group he gave the transcripts of the trial. Those 
people went through the hundreds of pages of exactly what went 
on in the courtroom. He gave  the same trial information to 
another group of people but it came from the media.
<P>
	He found that the people who got the information by reading 
what went on in the courtroom would more often find that the 
judges were just in their sentences or maybe even too harsh and 
alternatives to incarceration that might have been imposed 
should have been considered. In the cases of people reading the 
media information what the study found was that the people did 
not believe that the judicial system was working because they 
believed that the judges were much too lenient. That says 
something and it is an important lesson for us here. It means that 
when we take time to study all sides of the issue the solutions 
might not be as simplistic as they look at first blush. That is 
important to note.
<P>
	In terms of the Young Offenders Act, the Liberal Party is 
committed to dealing with it and we want all members of the 
House dealing with it seriously in committee. We should make 
the best possible changes in the legislation that we can make, 
keeping in mind it will never be perfect because we are living in 
an evolving society and the dynamics change.
<P>
	On the issue of killer cards every member of the House wants 
to find a way of getting rid of them. There is no question about 
that.
<P>
	As to the recall of members, I have some difficulty with it. 
There is the underlying premise that when the electorate made a 
decision on October 25, 1993 it was not an informed decision.
<P>
<B>D (1825 ) </B>
<P>
	I think that it was an informed decision. There is a 
responsibility on the part of the electorate when it does make a 
decision that government is going to be governing for a period of 
approximately four years.
<P>
	It is the ultimate insult to say that the electorate, in making its 
decision, made a bad decision and somehow it has to be 
protected from the decision that it made.
<P>
	We discussed petitions and how they are presented. As a new 
member in this House, I came to the orientation and one of the 
people who made a presentation to all members on petitions was 
the member for Beaver River. She told us how to present 
petitions. She is the one who made suggestions on it. I do not 
think she was telling us not to take these presentations seriously. 
I think every one of us takes these presentations seriously.
<P>
	There is a fundamental premise in all of these motions and 
certainly references to the national energy program and going 
back to when the deficit started and the debt started. There is 
definite politics being played there. I wish it were not so but it is 
certainly being done.
<P>
	I will refrain in the next four years in this House from 
referring to the Reform Party from the west as perhaps the party 
of alienation, that feeds on alienation, just like the Social Credit 
Party did. I will refrain from saying, the explanations by the 
member for Beaver River notwithstanding, that it was the 
members of the Social Credit Party involving the father of the 
present leader who got rid of recall.
<P>
	I do believe that issues being raised in this House for debate, 
issues that this Parliament does not work, are a red herring. I say 
that because there has been a crisis of confidence in our 
democratic institutions, I recognize that, but that crisis of 
confidence has been fed by forces within this country. I would 
suggest that what we collectively do in this House over the 
course of the next four years is really going to determine the 
future of Canada.
<P>
	To some extent we are going to be entering some very difficult 
debates. I do not for a minute think that we are going to avoid 
dealing with the issue in Quebec. We will at some point. I think 
every member believes that we are going to be doing that. 
However, it is important that we look at the parts of this country 
that work well. Our democratic institutions have worked for 127 
years. We have one of the best governments in this world and 
every one of us should recognize that. We should not be saying 
that somehow this country does not work or that somehow this 
country has broken down, because it has not.
<P>
	We can certainly all work together to make it better, but one of 
the first things we owe this country is to believe that we can do 
it. That is not by destroying the very institution itself.
<P>
	In terms of being accountable, governing is not easy. Any 
governing party is going to have problems. However, we went to 
the electorate on October 25 and we went with a plan. We were 
elected with a majority of members in this House.
<P>
	As a member, I do not totally feel good about what happened 
to the former government in terms of the number of seats it 
received. Somehow I do not think that was very fair. It certainly 
bothers me and I would like to see if during the course of this 
Parliament that can be redressed. When I look at members who 
are classified as independents I see members who are not really 
full members of this House in terms of what their privileges are. 
If I am to believe that every constituency deserves 
representation, which I do because it made a choice, there is 
fundamental respect that we should extend to that member in 
terms of rights.
<P>
	Mention was made of the Charlottetown accord, but nobody 
mentioned that our Prime Minister when he was Leader of the 
Opposition called for a referendum on the Charlottetown 
accord. The Liberal Party believes that referendums have a 
place. I can say that in my constituency the split was almost 
down the middle. About 55 per cent were for the Charlottetown 
accord 
<P>

<><B><A NAME="1647"><A HREF="DOCNAME#1647">1647</A></A></B>
<P>
and 45  per cent were against it. I know that my colleague from 
Kitchener went the other way.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pickard:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order. My colleague 
can finish his speech and other members may ask questions of 
him.
<P>
	Would it be possible to get unanimous consent to carry on 
until 6.40 p.m.?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Very well. We have no late show 
tonight. Members should be aware of that when deciding 
whether they wish to give unanimous consent to the request by 
the hon. member for Essex-Kent.
<P>
	Is there unanimous consent to go until 6.40 p.m.?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I hear no, so I have to go with that. 
Would the member please conclude.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Telegdi:</B> Mr. Speaker, in conclusion our Prime Minister 
said there should be a referendum and the party supported that. 
There was a referendum because pressure was put on the 
government. That is important to note.
<P>
	In terms of concluding this debate, I can only say as the 
member from Waterloo and as someone who believes he is 
accountable to his constituents, I have absolutely no problem in 
terms of how we have been handling petitions and the way we 
can feed them into committee. Any member in this House has 
the ability to raise that.
<P>
	Let me say that we are all small <I>r</I> reformers and certainly the 
rookies in this House are. The fact that some are big <I>r</I> Reformers 
does not give them the monopoly. I make the plea that over the 
course of the next four years we on all sides of this House try to 
be as non-partisan and unsanctimonious as possible.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It being 6.30 p.m., it is my duty to 
inform the House that pursuant to Standing Order 81(19) the 
proceedings on the motion have expired.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Since there are no members available for the proceedings on 
the adjournment motion, this House stands adjourned until 
tomorrow at 10 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24.
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 6.30 p.m.)
