	The House resumed from December 11 consideration of Bill 
C-110, an act respecting constitutional amendments, as reported 
(without amendment) from the committee; and Motions Nos. 1 and 
2.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andy Scott (Fredericton-York-Sunbury, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak today on the issue of Quebec's veto 
over amendments to the Canadian Constitution and why we in this 
House should finally recognize that reality.
<P>
	During the referendum campaign many Canadians were 
concerned about a possible yes vote but recognized the right of 
Quebecers to determine their own destiny.
<P>
	Unfortunately, some on the yes side in the campaign 
characterized this respect of the Quebecois right to 
self-determination as ambivalence. When the rhetoric about 
indifference on the part of the rest of Canada escalated, Canadians 
were pushed into proving their  commitment to a united Canada, a 
commitment I might add, that I never believed to be in question.
<P>
	This expression is part of a larger package that the Prime 
Minister has put forward in the form of a resolution. It is a 
resolution that will recognize Quebec's distinct society. It offers a 
veto to Quebec as well as to other regions of the country over 
constitutional amendments and clarifies the roles and 
responsibilities with respect to labour force training and to the 
delivery of programs.
<P>
	The Prime Minister is right to make this commitment and it is 
timely because Canada is changing. It was changing before the 
referendum, it was changing during the referendum and it will 
continue to change. This is natural. We all need to realize that there 
cannot always be a sense of finality on every issue. A country lives, 
changes and evolves. This is natural and progressive, if sometimes 
inconvenient.
<P>
	In this case it is not wise to look for a specific date when this 
debate will be resolved. It will not, nor should it be. It is a healthy, 
modern and necessary progression that will continue over time.
<P>
	This perspective is markedly different from those of the official 
opposition and the third party. Their obvious political agenda is to 
continue to raise the stakes and make demands within confining 
time frames to advance their own interests at the expense of our 
country. This disappoints me.
<P>
	We on this side are driven by a genuine concern for Canada. I 
believe that it is testimony to our strength as a nation that we can 
move forward with the determination that we do in the face of these 
two parties, one that wants out of Canada and one that is 
ambivalent about our united country.
<P>
	As part of the larger package, formal recognition of Quebec's 
distinct society is long overdue. We are expressing a characteristic 
of Canada that is on the positive side of the ledger as well as a 
historical fact. Canada is unique internationally in its multicultural 
nature, historic recognition of our aboriginal underpinnings and of 
our more recent two founding nations. We also have the capacity to 
constantly evolve through the different phases of these 
relationships.
<P>
	Quebec's right to a veto has long been supported by this party. 
We have gone even further in offering a similar veto to the Atlantic 
region, Ontario, the west, and have recently offered a veto to the 
province of B.C. These regional vetoes are a reflection of this 
government's commitment to reach a broad consensus on issues 
concerning the Constitution.
<P>
	In offering B.C. a veto, the Prime Minister has taken a leadership 
role in promoting flexibility and accountability in government. 
Since it was clear that B.C. was feeling misunderstood and 
unappreciated, the Prime Minister acted quickly and listened to its 
concerns. This is an  important step in our evolution in recognizing 
this right as a fact just as Quebec's distinct society is a fact.
<P>
	The leader of the third party on the other hand did not take 
advantage of an opportunity to propose a veto in committee. He did 
not even once in the House call for a veto for British Columbia. 
Those who view the third party as representatives of the west's 
interests may want to look at this obvious neglect to perhaps 
recognize that it is the governing party and our caucus that is 
listening and responding to every region in the country. I would 
like to congratulate my colleagues from B.C. who effectively 
represented their constituents and enabled this important 
amendment to be made to the original proposal.
<P>
<B>(1100)</B>
<P>
	There are some who say that the government has not gone far 
enough in passing a resolution. What they fail to point out is the 
very real impact several resolutions have had in the past, such as 
the official languages resolution of 1968, the resolution reaffirming 
linguistic duality in 1973, and the resolution regarding the 
language of work in the federal public service.
<P>
	Coming from New Brunswick I am very aware of the impact of 
all these resolutions, not only on the country but also on how the 
country operates inside my province. Those that would have us 
believe that Ottawa is simply throwing Quebec a bone but avoiding 
dealing with the issue with any degree of seriousness have 
questionable motives themselves.
<P>
	Of course the Bloc members will not accept the seriousness of 
the resolution because in admitting that Canada can work they 
make themselves redundant. It is all too easy to point a finger at 
Ottawa for not doing enough when in fact it is offering exactly 
those changes that Quebec has rightfully sought in the past.
<P>
	Is the attitude of Bloc members one that really takes Quebec's 
interest to heart, the interests of all Quebecers regardless of what 
language they speak? I think we know the answer to that question.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17548"> 17548 </A></B>
<P>
	Canada is not made up only of Ottawa and Quebec. In looking 
beyond Quebec there are a number of different realities that must 
be reconciled. In the eastern provinces we find loyal strongholds in 
regions rich with history. In the western provinces we find many 
new Canadians with rich multicultural influences and traditions. 
The ability to bring these regions together is the challenge, a 
challenge to which I am certain we will be able to rise.
<P>
	For all of those who are narrowly defining regional interests I 
ask simply: What region will be better off with a fractured country? 
There is no region in Canada that will benefit from the secession of 
Quebec. It is obvious which political party will benefit and that is 
what disappoints me.
<P>
	This debate must continue. The Prime Minister has opened the 
door for Canadians to speak to and of their country, not in a highly 
structured and regimented way but to simply open the door to 
opportunity much in the same way as the rally did on October 27.
<P>
	We must recognize that we need to move forward and not 
become mired in the past. Canada building should be our focus, not 
tearing Canada apart. This debate is about values, the values of 
fairness and acceptance that are integral to the successful 
resolution of the question.
<P>
	I would like to mention a forum that was held in my riding two 
Sundays ago. The topic of discussion was Canadian unity. Many 
individuals took the time to come and express their views on the 
subject. I want to commend everyone who helped make it happen 
and mention a few of their suggestions.
<P>
	The idea of generating more dialogue among Canadians inside 
and outside Quebec was brought out often, as well as having our 
educational system teach more about each other's histories and 
traditions. One individual felt that information is too filtered by the 
media and by politicians and someone else mentioned the need for 
everyone to better appreciate our economic interdependence.
<P>
	I would like to thank the member for Brome-Missisquoi who 
took the time to visit Fredericton and participate in this public 
forum. His insights were very useful to the debate and to our 
understanding. This forum was a logical progression from the rally 
that was held in Montreal, a rally that was attended by hundreds of 
constituents from my riding who were willing to drive in a bus for 
10 hours each way to express their desire that Quebec stay in 
Canada.
<P>
	When I was asked to speak in the House in the first week on this 
issue I felt that I should hear from my constituents on that weekend 
first before attempting to express their views. I appreciate their 
participation and hope I have been able to transmit to the House the 
level of their commitment to Canada.
<P>
	Finally, I would like to take a moment to commend the Prime 
Minister on his integrity and his broad Canadian vision. I am not 
surprised that he has acted quickly on this issue. I support him 
fully. I feel more Canadian because we have expressed a reality that 
makes Canada a great country. It is my great pleasure to support the 
resolution and I close by paraphrasing Lord Acton: ``A state which 
is incompetent to satisfy difference condemns itself''. It is not our 
intention to condemn but to construct.
<P>
<B>(1105)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the bill before us 
is one of the steps the government is taking to keep the promises 
the Prime Minister made at the  meeting of the no side in Verdun. 
The promises were made in the dying moments of the referendum 
campaign, when, for the previous two years, the government had 
systematically refused to discuss any constitutional matter.
<P>
	Only the phenomenal advance of the yes side forced the Prime 
Minister out of his constitutional lethargy and into giving 
Quebecers the hope of reform and satisfaction of their traditional 
claims.
<P>
	Quebecers, however, are not fooled. Now all of the evidence 
points to the fact that the Prime Minister's offers were tabled in a 
mad panic. For example, the last minute press conference. The 
phoney committee chaired by the Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs had not even finished its deliberations.
<P>
	The Liberal caucus had not been consulted either, and was put in 
the picture only after the Prime Minister's press conference. The 
offers presented are far from having unanimous support from the 
other provinces. This is a put up job, and a bad one at that, 
indicating that the Cabinet was beginning to panic about the 
challenges to the Prime Minister's ability to lead.
<P>
	Many political figures on the Canadian scene, particularly in 
Quebec, gave an extremely chilly reception to the proposal for a 
regional veto, which was probably a great blow to the Liberal 
government. What explanation can there be for such a uproar of 
disapproval in response to the Prime Minister's proposals?
<P>
	While the Meech Lake accord offered all provinces the right of 
veto over constitutional amendments, particularly those relating to 
federal institutions, here we have the Prime Minister reheating an 
old amending formula dating back to the seventies and the Victoria 
Charter. There is only one tiny change, the percentage of 
population required for the maritimes. The reactions were more or 
less the same in all the rest of Canada. English Canada reacted 
strongly to a proposal dating back to a distant time we were only 
too pleased to think had been forgotten forever.
<P>
	First of all, the premiers of the two most populous western 
provinces voiced strong opposition to this offer. In British 
Columbia, Mr. Harcourt was not terribly enthusiastic, and a 
number of academics in the province even suggested the Prime 
Minister would cause the birth of a separatist movement in British 
Columbia. To show you how hard it is to grant these veto powers, 
the Prime Minister immediately turned around and promised 
British Columbia it would have a veto too. All in less than 24 
hours. If you want a veto, the Prime Minister has a drawer full and 
will hand them out to anyone who makes a fuss and does not like 
his proposals.

	That is not the kind of veto Quebec had in mind. The same kind 
of reaction came from Premier Klein of Alberta, who was not at all 
keen to see Ontario have a veto while three western provinces had 
to share. He  maintained it was unfair to one of the three richest 
provinces in Canada and a province whose population was 
increasing at the fastest rate. Need I recall the position taken by the 
Reform Party, which is opposed to special privileges for any 
province and in the case of Quebec refuses to recognize anything, 
not even a symbolic and meaningless distinct society with no legal 
validity?
<P>
<B>(1110)</B>
<P>
	In Quebec, reactions were harsh as well. In one of his speeches, 
the Prime Minister maintained that Quebecers would recognize 
themselves in his proposals and that these would respond to the 
aspirations of Quebecers. Obviously we are not talking about the 
same Quebec.
<P>
	His comments now and during the referendum indicate that the 
Prime Minister no longer knows Quebec and that the fact that he 
has been living in Ottawa for more than 30 years has probably cut 
him off altogether from what is happening in Quebec.
<P>
	His proposals were intended to satisfy Quebecers, but he made 
the serious mistake of wanting to please everyone. By giving 
everyone half a loaf, he managed to please no one.
<P>
	Most political parties in Quebec either reacted very negatively or 
were not satisfied with the proposals or dismissed them out of 
hand.
<P>
	When there is a fire in Quebec, the other provinces panic. They 
show Quebec a whole arsenal of firehoses, telling us we can now 
feel safe and sound, protected by the other provinces and this array 
of firehoses. Too bad there was not enough water in the hoses to put 
out the fire. What we are being offered is not the real thing, but 
Quebec wants the real thing.
<P>
	As I said to a colleague yesterday, we want to be recognized as 
horses, but they recognize us as little ponies. A horse is stronger 
than a pony. Quebec claims to be that strong and powerful; it does 
not want to be seen as small, weak and disadvantaged.
<P>
	Mr. Dumont's Action démocratique also argues that what 
Quebecers want is not mere motions or bills but real constitutional 
reforms.
<P>
	Both the Parti Quebecois and the Bloc Quebecois have rejected 
the Prime Minister's proposals. Labour indicated that it was too 
little, too late. As for the very federalist Liberal Party in Quebec, 
all it had to say was that it was a step forward, but without any great 
enthusiasm. At a regional council held the day before the Prime 
Minister came out with his proposals, the Liberal Party in Quebec 
went much further in its constitutional demands.
<P>
	The Premier of Quebec and even Mr. Bourassa before him would 
never have agreed to the Prime Minister of Canada's watered down 
proposals. Beyond partisan politics, however, the media's reaction 
was the most  revealing indication of how the federal government's 
proposals were received. The editorial writer for <I>Le Devoir</I> refutes 
the federal proposals, arguing that enshrining this veto power in an 
act of Parliament would not really give Quebec its veto back.
<P>
	Quebec would not really get its veto back because although its 
veto was recognized by tradition, the Supreme Court stated that 
Quebec never had a legal veto. This editorial writer points out that 
any government could very well revoke this act. Reform would 
probably make it a point of honour to do so upon taking office. The 
most telling comments in the newspapers, however, are in <I>La 
Presse</I>, whose chief editorial writer, Alain Dubuc, who is 
well-known for his pro-federalist positions, wrote that Quebecers 
want much more than that. He added that, as long as these 
principles are guaranteed by legislation, all it would take for 
Quebec to lose its guarantees is a shift in policies or a change of 
government. The Prime Minister's proposals are held up to ridicule 
from all sides and considered as plainly unacceptable, both by 
English Canada and by Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1115)</B>
<P>
	To conclude, I would like to add that the main problem with this 
bill is its very essence; after all, it is just a bill. As long as all the 
provinces do not agree on its principle, it will remain just a bill.
<P>
	This simple bill has the same force in law as any other bill, 
which means that it can be repealed by any government, as it sees 
fit .That is its weakness and that is what we condemn.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Janko 
Pe</B><B>ric 
(Cambridge, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am honoured to speak on this 
issue. I should like to share my vision of Canada with members 
opposite, the Canada that I dreamed of as a 10-year old boy in 
Croatia.
<P>
	I dreamed about Canada. It was a huge country. I dreamed about 
Canada when I asked my parents whether there was anything for 
breakfast. Today as a parent I am asking my children what they 
want for breakfast.
<P>
	My dreams became a reality in 1968 when I arrived in Canada. I 
was by myself and not even 19 years old. The question is why 
Canada. I cannot answer that question. However today I know that I 
made the right choice. I had the chance to go to Australia or New 
Zealand or to stay in Croatia. However I chose to come here. Three 
years later when I became a Canadian citizen I was the luckiest 
person on the planet.
<P>
	I did not know about the differences within Canadian society 
until I arrived in Canada and I found out about English speaking 
Canada and French speaking Canada. That was great. There are 
Canadians in the middle, Canadians like myself, who came to build 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17550"> 17550 </A></B>
<P>
this great country. We cannot ignore that they built it and they made 
it the best country on the planet.
<P>
	We do not know how to appreciate that. Sometimes I ask myself 
what is wrong with us. When we return from travelling abroad and 
seeing how other people live and how much they have, we really 
appreciate what we have here and what we are.
<P>
	October 27 was an historic date for Canada. We gathered in 
Montreal and told Quebecers that we loved them. The Prime 
Minister made a commitment which I fully support. It is not just to 
recognize Quebec as a distinct society. It also recognizes the 
historical fact that French people in Canada are different. It is not 
that they are better or worse than anybody else, but that they are 
different. They have a different language and a different culture. 
That is great and we have to respect and admire that. We have to 
tolerate that if we want to be a strong, united Canada.
<P>
<B>(1120)</B>
<P>
	On October 27 I took my eight-year old son along with the rest of 
the 250 constituents from Cambridge to Montreal. He was a part of 
that historic day. He was proud to be part of that historic day, the 
beginning of a new Canada. Today he is learning French in school. 
He will probably share some time in Quebec with his eight and nine 
year old colleagues in the near future.
<P>
	Unfortunately maybe we do not know each other very well. It is 
about time that we took the effort to know each other, to get to 
know Canadians from British Columbia, Newfoundland, Prince 
Edward Island, Ontario, Quebec, Saskatchewan and the Northwest 
Territories. It is about time we know about our unique Canadian 
culture to which many newcomers and I contribute.
<P>
	By giving this recognition to French people in Canada, I am 
convinced that Canada will survive. We are facing difficulties 
today, but it is not the end. It is evident that we have to solve the 
problem today and continue building a stronger and better Canada 
for our children and grandchildren.
<P>
	I urge members from all three sides to work together to make 
Canada even better, to put our differences aside and work together 
to build a unique and stronger Canada. We can accomplish that, so 
help us God.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
a pleasure to speak to Bill C-110. As we all know, the bill was 
designed to give a veto to the province of Quebec over the 
Canadian Constitution.
<P>
	We thought at one time that we had dealt with the issue during 
Meech Lake and the Charlottetown accords when we gave all 
Canadians a say in the matter. Lo and behold Canadians said: ``No, 
we don't accept what politicians have done. We are staying with the 
way it is''. Here we are today after a referendum and the Liberals 
are right back at it again, on the top down approach.
<P>
	The bill also gives a veto to B.C., the prairies, Ontario and the 
Atlantic provinces. B.C. was not included originally. Six B.C. 
Liberals would like to say they had some influence on the 
acknowledgement of British Columbia as a separate region, so to 
speak, because of its position in the federation. They would like to 
take credit for that, but the fact is we are back to the way it has 
always been. They do what they are told over there. They had little 
or no influence. The party said ``you will'' and they did. They did 
nothing.
<P>
<B>(1125)</B>
<P>
	It was the outrage of people in British Columbia and across the 
country who said: ``What are you doing with four regions as 
opposed to five?'' The government changed its mind. The problem 
is that they are still talking about the governments of the regions 
and not the people of the regions. I do not believe that will ever get 
through to the government, ever, until the government is replaced 
by a populist party and not a party that works from the top down.
<P>
	Let us make no mistake. This is once again an act of 
appeasement to separatists in Quebec. Over the years we have been 
giving the country away piece by piece. Every time the separatists 
squawk this government and the government before it overreact.
<P>
	Let us look at why we are in this mess in the first place. Over all 
these years we have had some issues to deal with such as the 
finances of the country. The Liberal targets at best are weak. Their 
economic fiscal management, as well as that of the previous 
government, is a disgrace.
<P>
	At least the province of Quebec is open enough to say: ``Look, if 
you can't get your act in gear we are going to leave''. Other people 
are saying: ``If you can't get your act together, we are going to stay 
and try to fight it''.
<P>
	Let us look at the battle against crime. The Liberal government 
still does not understand how bad it is out there. It is still doing a 
messy, pathetic job at fighting crime in the country. We have one 
separatist province saying: ``We don't like the way you are doing 
that either, so we want out''. Whose fault is it that we have this 
spoiled child of separatism sitting here? It is the governments that 
have done very little to help the country since the current Prime 
Minister was finance minister.
<P>
	Today the government still appoints its friends and hacks to the 
Senate. It is still ripping off Canadians with an MP's pension. It 
voted out recall. All these issues are part of the problem in the 
country today. They are rubbing everybody the wrong way, from 
the east coast to the west coast.
<P>
	What did the Liberals come up with? They came up with a veto 
power in the Constitution. They said that it was the best a Liberal 
majority government could do in the country. That is very sad 
indeed.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17551"> 17551 </A></B>
<P>
	When the Bloc appeared for the first time in the last election in 
1993, what happened? How did the Liberal government deal with 
it? First it agreed to official opposition status. That was the first 
mistake. It has been dealing with that problem since we have been 
here. It is not dealing with all the problems across the country. It is 
only dealing in self-interest.
<P>
	The referendum came along. We saw a Liberal government with 
no vision. Its members were stumbling and bumbling through a 
referendum until in the dying days when it looked like they were 
going to lose it and they threw out a few carrots. That is a heck of a 
way to run a country. Now we see the government shelling out veto 
powers, not to the people but to the governments of the provinces 
within those regions.
<P>
	Why do we give vetoes in any event? To my knowledge no 
democratic country in the world provides vetoes on constitutional 
issues to a body, particularly to a provincial body that just happens 
to be a separatist government.
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
	What exactly does the government think it will achieve by doing 
that? It has not thought about it. It is another knee-jerk reaction to a 
group of separatists in the House.
<P>
	Coming from British Columbia, having lived there, with my 
riding being there, I can see the time is coming when British 
Columbia needs a very forceful government.
<P>
	We in the House had better understand why that will be 
necessary. It seems the only way we can improve a federation is to 
threaten these guys. That seems to be the game. The separatists 
show up and give a little more. The separatists speak out and the 
government gives a little more, piece by piece. They are never 
happy. What happened last night when distinct society came up in a 
motion to vote on? They voted against it. That is because they have 
not been given enough. When they are given enough, it will very 
likely be too late.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Sovereignty.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> A member says sovereignty. 
They are really saying separation.
<P>
	At what point is the government prepared to draw a line and say 
enough is enough? It proposes there is no point and there is no line; 
just keep shelling and giving until there is no more to give. That is 
not a plan. That is acquiescence.
<P>
	How do the people in my riding feel? If one has a spoiled child, 
how does one deal with it? A lot of people would say if one has a 
spoiled child perhaps one has parents who are not running it right.
<P>
	Here we have governments that do not run it right. That is the 
problem. We have a Prime Minister and a cabinet with many 
members from Quebec. There is a  conflict of interest when they sit 
behind closed doors and make deals about the province they are 
from.
<P>
	People in my riding say draw a line, tell these people where the 
line is. They say not to give a veto to governments. If they have to 
give a veto, if they will make that decision anyway, give it to the 
people, not to governments, particularly not to a separatist 
government.
<P>
	We have to say in the House and throughout this land to give 
these people the facts. Draw the line in the sand somewhere so they 
know what can be given and what cannot be given, not this year 
after year of saying more for you, more for you, at the alienation of 
every other province.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pat O'Brien (London-Middlesex, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
understand I have only 10 minutes, unfortunately. I wish I had an 
hour to respond to the remarks I just listened to very quietly, as 
difficult as that was.
<P>
	I heard so much fiction from the member for Fraser Valley West, 
so many dangerous interpretations of our history and society that I 
feel compelled to respond to at least a few of them.
<P>
<B>(1135 )</B>
<P>
	The hon. member and members of the third party are repeatedly 
saying that in the veto bill the federal government is giving the 
separatists a veto. That is patently nonsense.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Frazer Valley West):</B> What do you think it is?
<P>
	<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I listened very carefully to the member for Fraser 
Valley West without interrupting him. I would appreciate if he 
would do the same for me, as that is the nature of democratic 
debate in the House. We can disagree without interrupting each 
other as we speak.
<P>
	The current Government of Quebec unfortunately is a separatist 
government. We all know that. We do not need to be rocket 
scientists to know that. However, the mistake made by the hon. 
members opposite is they assume we will have a separatist 
government forever in Quebec. That is ridiculous. All we have to 
do is review the history of the province of Quebec to know there 
have been very few years when a separatist was in power.
<P>
	The bill proposes to give to the province of Quebec, as it does to 
the governments of four other regions, a veto power. It is not to the 
people or to the separatist Government of Quebec in a sense that it 
will be there ad infinitum.
<P>
	The hon. member mentioned that the six Liberal MPs in B.C. 
like to say they have influenced the government's change of mind 
in recognizing B.C. as a region. I think my colleagues did have an 
influence in that change of decision. One thing I do know for sure is 
the Reform Party certainly had no influence in changing the mind 
of the government in giving B.C. a regional veto.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17552"> 17552 </A></B>
<P>
	The ignorance of Quebec and the situation in Canada in terms of 
our veto power from some members opposite is unbelievable. As a 
Canadian and someone who taught Canadian history, the degree of 
ignorance, even by certain members of the House, about our 
history alarms me.
<P>
	Where did this idea of veto power for four regions come from? 
Was it dreamed up out of thin air? It was not dreamed up out of thin 
air. In the early 1970s at a conference in Victoria a decision was 
made to give veto powers to four regions in the country. That 
Victoria formula was endorsed by all 10 premiers of all 10 
provinces, including the province of British Columbia at that time, 
as well as by the Government of Canada.
<P>
	It is ignorance of Canadian history to suggest that somehow the 
government and the Prime Minister have dreamed up this plan. It is 
based in fact and it is based in history. The lack of knowledge of 
Canadian history by some members in the House is appalling.
<P>
	My colleague from Fraser Valley West said no democratic 
government in the world provides a veto. I am almost quoting him 
directly.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> That is right.
<P>
	<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> He is now saying that is right. I am sorry to see 
him lead with his chin like that. Let me introduce him to a nation to 
the south called the United States of America in which one 
democratically elected person, the president, has a veto power.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> That is not a state.
<P>
	<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The last time I checked, I thought the United 
States of America was a state. I thought it was a democracy. I 
thought the President of the United States had a veto power. I invite 
the hon. member for Fraser Valley West to enrol in some basic 
courses in political science and Canadian history. I would be very 
happy to recommend some for him.
<P>
	The United States of America empowers one person, its 
democratically elected president, with the right to veto legislation. 
It is incredible for me to hear an elected member in the House say 
that no democratic government in the world has a veto power. I will 
put it down to a bad day for my colleague from Fraser Valley West.
<P>
<B>(1140 )</B>
<P>
	The last point I will address from the hon. member is the 
characterization of Quebec as a spoiled child. The attitude that 
somehow Quebec is a spoiled child, to generalize and make the 
blatant characterization of Quebec as a spoiled child on the basis 
that 30 per cent of the people are separatists, is part of the problem 
we have. It is ignorance of the real demographics in Quebec. It is 
ignorance of what the people in Quebec really believe. It is a 
dangerous generalization that the most basic student of history is 
taught not to make. Because 30 per cent of the people of Quebec 
are very hard core separatists, we  should not be foolish enough to 
characterize the people of Quebec as spoiled children.
<P>
	What makes that all the more dangerous is that the people 
applauding the loudest secretly when members like the member for 
Fraser Valley West make these blatant generalizations are the 
separatists. Every time a member in the House of Commons spews 
that kind of logic, every time a Canadian anywhere in Canada 
makes that kind of ridiculous comment, it only advances the cause 
of separatism in Quebec. It only makes the job of the Bouchards 
and the Parizeaus easier in Quebec.
<P>
	It is a pity we have elected members saying that. I know the 
member for Fraser Valley West does not like to hear these truths 
and that is why he interrupts me, even though I did not interrupt 
him when he made these comments. That is okay. I will debate him 
now on the point that he does not have his basic facts correct. I will 
debate him here on the point that he does not have his basic facts of 
Canadian history straight. I will debate him anywhere he chooses. 
He does not have the facts of Canadian history, the history of this 
veto power, or the knowledge that the United States has a veto 
power.
<P>
	I am shocked. I am disappointed. Most dramatically, I am 
alarmed that an elected member would come into the House of 
Commons and make the kind of statements, the twisting of facts, 
and display the ignorance I have heard.
<P>
	I say these things in kindness. I offer them as constructive 
criticism. I think we can help the member for Fraser Valley West to 
learn more Canadian history if he has an open mind. That is the 
problem. One wonders if the attitudes are not so ingrained in some 
members of the House, if they do not bring the kind of attitudes and 
the lack of knowledge of Canadian history in such a visceral way 
into the House that perhaps they are not willing to listen to facts, 
not willing to learn some Canadian history and not willing to 
change.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> What do you know about the west?
<P>
	<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I have been in western Canada many times. I have 
an uncle in Quesnel, B.C. I have an aunt in New Westminster, B.C. 
I converse with them frequently. I know their views on this 
situation as people living in British Columbia now.
<P>
	There is some knowledge of western Canada on this side of the 
House. All wisdom, all logic, all knowledge and all defence of 
western Canada, thank goodness, do not rest with the party 
opposite.
<P>
<B>(1145)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Godin (Châteauguay, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
welcome this opportunity to speak after the hon. member for Fraser 
Valley West to set the record straight. The hon. member does not 
seem to understand a thing about what is happening in Quebec right 
now when he describes the province as a spoiled child. All that we 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17553"> 17553 </A></B>
<P>
in  Quebec are asking is merely for Quebec to be sovereign. We are 
asking nothing of him and, if he just agreed to Quebec's 
sovereignty, he would have nothing to do with us any more.
<P>
	I am also pleased to speak here today on Bill C-110, an act 
respecting constitutional amendments, to establish a regional veto 
so that no constitutional change can be made without the consent of 
all Canadians, according to this government.
<P>
	Is the government for real? No. And the same way I voted 
against the distinct society motion yesterday evening, I will vote 
against this bill out of pride and respect for the people of my riding 
and of Quebec as a whole.
<P>
	How can Quebec be recognized as a distinct society through a 
motion that is binding on the federal government but not on all of 
the provinces, a motion that may be overturned by a new 
government? And how can the government at the same time 
introduce a bill establishing a regional veto that is the same for 
every province? Only our Prime Minister can do such somersaults.
<P>
	This only meets the election minded expectations of the Liberal 
Party of Canada. These projects are meaningless; they are a smoke 
screen and they also show a lack of respect for Quebecers. This 
government never gave a better illustration of how panic-stricken it 
is, which explains why it is totally improvising. After saying loud 
and clear before the referendum that it was not going to talk about 
the Constitution, the government started alluding to changes one 
week before the referendum. Then, after a narrow victory, it tabled 
a motion on the distinct society, followed by a bill on regional 
vetoes.
<P>
	After dragging its feet for two years, the government introduces 
a UI reform which clearly shows that it intends to bypass the 
provinces, regardless of their distinct nature, and not give them an 
opportunity to be heard. Then it tells us that we must refer to a 
Canadian, not Quebec, culture. Finally, the federal government 
reconsiders its decision and gives British Columbia the status of 
region, for the purpose of its Bill C-110.
<P>
	In the meantime, a phoney committee is on standby, waiting for 
the government to stop its antics and give it a mandate. This is 
mind boggling. I would be hard pressed to show the logic in all this. 
The government acts like a chicken running in all directions with 
its head cut off, trying to save its broken eggs. It did not even 
realize that it came very close to losing Quebec. Will the 
government finally realize that, in spite of all its foolish attempts, it 
clearly shows that it will never be able to come up with a 
constitutional reform project that meets the expectations of 
Quebec, as well as those of the rest of Canada?
<P>
	We are two peoples in Canada, but one country is missing. What 
would be a worthwhile and possible  undertaking would be to 
accept that we are a people and that Quebec is a country. The Prime 
Minister told us here in this House just recently that he was most 
anxious to see the Bloc members vote against his motion on 
Quebec as a distinct society, against Bill C-110 and against 
unemployment insurance reform. I would like to tell him that the 
people in my riding are equally anxious, but not for the same 
reasons.
<P>
	The 58 per cent who voted to elect me in October 1993, and the 
58.3 per cent who voted in the October 30, 1995 referendum, asked 
me to attend the House on Monday, although that is the day I am 
generally in my riding office. They wanted me to be here to vote 
against this ridiculously out of date project. It is a matter of too 
little, too late. The 49.4 per cent of Quebecers who voted in favour 
of Quebec sovereignty in this referendum were voting for the right 
to pass our own laws, to collect our own taxes, to sign our own 
treaties.
<P>
<B>(1150)</B>
<P>
	They do not want a bill aimed at making it impossible for any 
government, including the Government of Quebec, to change the 
Canadian Constitution.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice has stated, and I quote: ``True, this 
resolution will satisfy neither the Parti Quebecois nor the Bloc 
Quebecois. As we know, sadly, nothing short of breaking up this 
country would satisfy them''. What a wonderful red herring to push 
through a bill that will make any in depth changes to the 
Constitution impossible until the end of time. Canada does not 
need the Parti Quebecois or the Bloc Quebecois to break itself 
apart, the Prime Minister and his centralist federalism are doing 
well enough on their own. Unfortunately, they do not realize this.
<P>
	On Friday, December 8, a SOM-La Presse poll reported that 
Quebecers are not satisfied with the Chrétien government's 
proposals. A meagre 31 per cent of Quebecers now admits to 
having supported the federalist option. Furthermore, no sooner was 
the bill tabled than the Minister of Justice made an about-face and 
agreed to the concept of a fifth region to satisfy British Columbia, 
which proves this government is playing it strictly by ear.
<P>
	The minister asked us to trust him, saying it was hard to imagine 
how the government would support a constitutional amendment 
that did not have the support of all regions. In other words, the 
federal government should not support a constitutional amendment 
unless all regions agree. The minister has a poor memory. He must 
have forgotten the lesson we learned in 1992. The minister ought to 
know that once bitten, twice shy.
<P>
	Remember when in 1982, the Canadian Liberal government 
patriated the Constitution and amended it and adjusted it in the 
image of English Canada, without the consent of Quebec. What 
may seem immoral to the present Minister of Justice did not seem 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17554"> 17554 </A></B>
<P>
so to the then  justice minister in 1982, who is now the Prime 
Minister. All things considered, we are not inclined to trust the cat 
who tells mousie he loves her dearly, but well done, with stuffing à 
la Clyde Wells.
<P>
	This is not about giving Quebec a veto, let us be clear about that. 
What we have here is a cosmetic exercise that gives a pseudo-veto 
to four, five or six regions unilaterally identified by the federal 
government. These regions are both distinct and equal, as far as I 
can see. The government probably thinks it has found a way to give 
the impression it is giving Quebec what Quebecers want, while 
giving the other regions in Canada the impression this does not 
mean a thing. Not surprisingly, the rest of Canada is not any more 
pleased than Quebec with this sleight of hand. This 
extra-constitutional exercise is only an exercise in wishful 
thinking.
<P>
	After the first constitutional veto, requiring unanimous consent 
on any change in the responsibilities of the Queen, the governor 
general or the Senate, came the veto on amendments involving one 
or more provinces, such as to borders, then came the veto on 
general amendments-the rule of seven and fifty: 7 provinces and 
50 per cent of the population-and now we have the so-called 
regional veto, the criteria to be determined by the government, 
such as: a resolution by a legislative assembly, an order in council, 
a notice signed by the provincial premier, a notice signed by a 
provincial lieutenant governor, a provincial referendum organized 
by a province, a federal referendum in one or a number of 
provinces or a vote by federal members of Parliament from the 
province in question.
<P>
	With such a collection of distinct criteria, the federal 
government has any number of ways to go over the heads of the 
provinces.
<P>
	The last piece the government needed to never again change the 
Constitution has just been tabled in the House, and all those who 
voted no believing in the fine promises of the Prime Minister to 
amend the Constitution to meet Quebec's requirements are, today, 
in mourning. On their behalf, I will vote against this bill.
<P>
	I must, nevertheless, in closing, thank the Prime Minister for the 
10 per cent of electors we lacked to achieve Quebec's sovereignty. 
With this sort of understanding of Quebec, the next referendum 
will be the winner.
<P>
<B>(1155 )</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jerry Pickard (Essex-Kent, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
November 27 the Prime Minister introduced three initiatives for 
change in how government works in Canada. It is important to 
remember that these changes are not constitutional changes in 
themselves. Rather these initiatives respond to how Canadians 
want their government to respond to the realities of Canadain the 1990s.
<P>
	Canadians want the government to move forward, to respect the 
needs of our people, to make government more accessible. In the 
wake of the Quebec referendum, Canadians expected the federal 
government to make good on its commitments to maintain a 
unified country.
<P>
	Canadians recognize the need for governments to remain 
focused on the issues of importance; issues such as employment 
creation, consumer and investor confidence, government spending 
and control.
<P>
	Canadians also recognize that initiatives on distinct society, 
regional veto and manpower training will permit the government to 
fulfil its obligations to Canadians without allowing the country's 
agenda to be hijacked by those who wish to further their own 
personal agenda of destroying rather than building our country.
<P>
	These unity incentives are a very important first step. These 
initiatives are also an effective way of dealing with the concerns of 
Canadians and of building partnerships with all regions of Canada, 
while at the same time not reopening the whole constitutional 
debate.
<P>
	The proposed actions are consistent with what Canadians want 
and are the most expeditious way of achieving those goals. For 
many of us, both inside and outside government, constitutional 
discussions gave rise to concerns of lengthy, protracted debate 
without meaningful resolution.
<P>
	Bill C-110, the act respecting constitutional amendments, does 
not raise these concerns. Evidence of this can easily be found in 
how government reacted to the issue of regional vetoes. By 
responding quickly to the concerns of B.C., the government has 
modified its regional veto to include British Columbia as a separate 
regional veto. This action flows directly from the commitment to 
listen to people and to introduce actions that bring people from all 
regions together.
<P>
	The act, in its present form, would require the consent of 
Ontario, Quebec, British Columbia, the Atlantic and the prairie 
regions before any constitutional amendment can be proposed in 
Parliament by the Canadian government. This is, in effect, a 
guarantee that each of these five regions will have a general veto in 
areas where they do not already have a specific veto. This 
authority, simply put, will allow any one of the five regions to stop 
an amendment from the outset.
<P>
	This bill keeps a commitment to all Canadians for increased 
protection within the Canadian federation and it recognizes the 
Constitution and its amending process is of interest to all parts of 
the country. By recognizing a regional veto for the province of 
British Columbia, the government is recognizing the existence of a 
uniquely Canadian west coast situation.
<P>
	British Columbia, with its size, population, location and 
economic development, constitutes a region of interest that 
requires its own recognition on regional issues. By extending this 
regional veto power to British  Columbia, the government is 
reaching out to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17555"> 17555 </A></B>
<P>
Canadians, acknowledging the variously uniquely Canadian 
situations and bringing us closer together by helping this part of 
Canada survive and strengthen its loyalties.
<P>
	In a recent Regina editorial, the unity initiative was referred to as 
having solid potential and the Prime Minister's olive branch to 
Quebec could do what eight years of constitutional debate did not. 
This is an indication that the prairie provinces recognize the 
importance of a federal government that actively pursues 
addressing the regional interests of Canadians. The inclusion of 
B.C. in a veto power builds on an initiative and a decisive act that 
can be a valuable component of national building.
<P>
	In the same editorial, the Prime Minister's actions were 
described as swift and bold in the government's accommodation of 
Quebec. These are again descriptions that could justifiably be used 
to describe the government's movement to address the B.C. 
situation.
<P>
<B>(1200)</B>
<P>
	The unity initiative promoted by the government is much more 
simple than the Charlottetown accord of 1992. Today's bill is much 
more concise and limited in its scope, yet it moves to achieve 
certain goals that have been sought by regions. Even in Quebec, 
sovereignists like Mario Dumont believe that this is a new, much 
simpler proposal and should be judged on its own merits.
<P>
	Before the proposed veto change for B.C., a Vancouver editorial 
commented on the Prime Minister's unity package by saying: ``It is 
an offer of tangible, substantive change that even Bouchard will 
find hard to discredit''. Now that the B.C. veto is being promoted in 
this package, one can only assume that certain of those reservations 
have now been looked upon and completed with B.C. coming into 
the union with a veto.
<P>
	In Edmonton an editorial comment suggested that the Prime 
Minister ``did all he could within the powers of his government'' in 
reference to Quebec's uniqueness and the veto rights. Yet it was 
this government that once again rose to the occasion by finding a 
way to enhance western Canada's position, not at the expense of 
others, but in recognition of British Columbia.
<P>
	One can easily detect the concerns and desires of our Canadian 
regions. If one listens and acts in a comprehensive way, the same 
regions will recognize that efforts are for the benefit of the whole 
and do not jeopardize or favour the position of one region over 
another. Simply put, the veto proposal and the added recognition of 
British Columbia says to the provinces that no constitutional 
change will occur if regions oppose. This is more than any province 
has today and the inclusion of B.C. as a separate veto does nothing 
to favour one over another.
<P>
	The Edmonton <I>Journal</I> noted: ``Albertans cannot have 
something for nothing. Life, as we know it, would not end if 
Alberta lost the provincial veto it never had''.
<P>
	Many Canadians recognize that unity initiatives are probably 
about as far as government can reasonably go in the political 
climate of the 1990s. It is the recognition of the desires of 
Canadians and a response to the same within the context of 
Canadian society and will be acceptable by law. It will also give 
Canadians a chance to view the Constitution before any changes 
occur.
<P>
	The proposals for a regional veto try as best as possible to 
acknowledge that the country has great variation of population 
densities. It would be much easier to divide the geographical area 
without the need to regard the population of the regions of the 
country. But this is not possible in Canada. What is possible is to 
pursue and find a compromise that will address the regional 
concerns within the context of national programs. The regional 
veto is a logical attempt to balance the will of our regions and its 
populations.
<P>
	In central Canada editorial opinion suggests that the regional 
veto is a move that recognizes the reality of the country and its 
population. It is the recognition of what Canada is and what we 
stand for and how best the government can deliver these services is 
the driving force for change. It is not the government proposing 
change for the sake of change, but rather change for the sake of 
addressing concerns of Canadians.
<P>
	There was also an observation in a central Canada newspaper 
that the unity proposals allowed us to test drive the concepts of 
them without enshrining them in our Constitution. Perhaps this is 
the most telling observation of Canadian society. We are a people 
that do need to be prepared to accept change. We must accept 
change, not one region over another, not with the idea of the 
contempt of change, but we must make certain that our drive 
forward is to unify the country, what we can do to help Canada and 
Canadians survive in this ever changing society.
<P>
<B>(1205 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I will start by 
telling the House why I ran for office. Why did I want to come to 
this place? To sum it up I would say it was because I could add 
something to this country. I believe in this country. I have travelled 
extensively and I know what people think of this country.
<P>
	What is wrong with the country? I thought there was a lack of 
equality. The political system was one where the message came 
from Ottawa back to the ridings and the parties were too strong. I 
was mad because of the GST, because of the national energy 
program. I was mad at the arrogance of government. I looked at it 
and thought that this was a very centralist place. In the past as I 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17556"> 17556 </A></B>
<P>
have mentioned the national energy program and the GST were 
forced on people by Ottawa.
<P>
	I look at this Parliament and I do not see that much has changed. 
I see employment equity being forced down people's throats when 
others are getting rid of it. I see gun control being forced on people 
without any attempt to change any of the clauses. There was the 
Quebec referendum where we were told to be happy, that 
everything was fine and it was not.
<P>
	Now there is this unity package and I see closure. Closure is the 
ugliest thing that can happen in this place. People are 
disenfranchised and are not allowed to speak for their constituents.
<P>
	Canadians are saying: ``We need jobs. We need tax reform. We 
need somebody to deal with the criminal justice system. We need 
the reform of Parliament itself. We need more free votes. We need 
to know that our MPs can stand up for what we believe''.
<P>
	Now we get this veto package, which totally lacks a vision for 
Canada. This is supposed to be a unity package. It is anything but. 
It is anything but creating the equality that we all believe in. We all 
want change and this package does anything but allow us to ever 
have any future change.
<P>
	We now will need something in the neighbourhood of 92 per cent 
of Canadians in order to get any change by a package like this. Our 
hope of free votes, our hope of getting rid of that other place are 
gone now. It does anything but provide any kind of unity for the 
country.
<P>
	We look at the government listening to the people. The PCs did 
not listen during the GST. They did not listen during 
Charlottetown. We saw what happened to them in 1993. We now 
have a government that seems to be following the same pattern.
<P>
	I look to an example of a week ago in Edmonton where the 
member from Edmonton East had a meeting. Seventeen people 
went to listen to the unity package of the Prime Minister while 
across town 800 people were telling us exactly what they thought 
of that unity package.
<P>
	In my riding I have completed a survey that went out last 
Thursday. So far we are into the hundreds of returns and 87 per cent 
are saying not to give special status or the veto to anybody. That is 
87 per cent of the people who answered that question.
<P>
	The people of the west and the people of Canada are mad. 
Yesterday, Mr. Klein dropped out of Team Canada. Is that building 
unity? Listen to the message. The government is losing the country. 
This centralist top down government will lose the country. Even the 
national polls show that 53 per cent of Quebecers are unhappy with 
this package as are 58 per cent of the rest of Canada.
<P>
	Only 23 per cent of Quebecers think this package is worth 
anything. It is just a rehash of Meech Lake and Charlottetown. 
They did not get the message last time  and now they are going to 
wait until 1997-98 to get that message. We will never get rid of that 
Senate.
<P>
	There are 105 people who came here because their constituents 
demanded change. The separatists want a different approach than 
we do but they are asking for change. Not one province is not 
asking for change. This government has no vision. It is into this 
centralist philosophy of government.
<P>
	We need some strong leadership to face Mr. Bouchard, a very 
credible leader. We do not have it.
<P>
<B>(1210 )</B>
<P>
	We no longer have an amending formula. We have a veto 
formula drawn up by a centralist government. The veto is not fair, it 
is not equitable and it was done without the consultation of the 
people.
<P>
	How would we get out of this problem? Our Prime Minister had 
the obvious opportunity to get out of it by giving the veto to the 
people. Give it to all of the people. Do not put in the hands of the 
separatists. Do not put it in the hands of provincial politicians. Put 
it in the hands of the people. We can trust the people. They have 
shown they are involved and will be involved.
<P>
	The people have spoken. They spoke in Charlottetown. They 
spoke in 1993. Of course the people spoke to the referendum. It 
was not the politicians that helped the yes side catch up, it was the 
people. Everybody, even on the other side, agrees to that.
<P>
	We need to show some leadership. We need to show some terms 
and conditions. What does it mean if a province wants to separate? 
Tell it. Put it straight. The people will understand it. It is the 
politicians who want to manipulate it. Talk about what land goes 
with separation. Talk about the language and the culture, the debt 
sharing, the citizenship. Talk about all of those things, including 
the protection of minorities, but talk about it. Talk about it with the 
people.
<P>
	We need a vision. We need to fight that separatist dream with a 
vision. We need to fight deception and untruths with truth and 
facts. That is what this vision is all about. We need to develop a 
vision and a passion for Canada. That is what we need.
<P>
	Many of us felt that in 1967 when we went to Expo in Montreal. 
There was passion there. We felt passion during the Olympics in 
Calgary. We felt passion whenever we travelled. Last year my 
constituency hosted the World Junior Hockey Championship and 
there was passion and feeling for what it was to be Canadian. We 
were proud of our Canadian kids who won that championship and 
who demonstrated what it was like to be Canadian.
<P>
	Do not whine and cry. Plan a vision. Get a vision for the country. 
Show that we are listening to the people. This country is worth 
saving. I implore the Prime Minister to get out of the past, do what 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17557"> 17557 </A></B>
<P>
is right for  Canada. Involve the people. Abandon the centralist 
governments of the past which did not work. They will never work.
<P>
	It will destroy this country if we keep following this path. 
Continuing on this course will truly mean the Prime Minister will 
go down in history as the Prime Minister who destroyed the 
country. We must change that.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I too will begin by speaking about why I am in this House.
<P>
	My sense of this country and therefore my mission as a member 
of Parliament comes from two main things. First, my father was an 
immigrant. I do not remember when I first heard how lucky I was 
to be a Canadian, how lucky I was to live in this wonderful country, 
to have this as my home and as my future. Having come from 
Europe my father was very much aware of what a wonderful future 
this nation has.
<P>
	The second reason that gives me a sense of why I am here, of 
what my purpose is and what this country is all about I owe to a 
grade five teacher whose name I have even forgotten. I was 10 
years old and I learned about this country from coast to coast from 
that teacher. I learned about the Rockies, the west coast, the east 
coast and the north. I also learned about the voyageurs who had 
opened up this continent for us. They had travelled on rivers and 
through mountain ranges nobody had ever travelled before, except 
our aboriginal peoples. From that I have such a strong sense of the 
importance of the two founding peoples of this country. Without 
the French settlers and explorers who came to the country we 
would not have what we have today.
<P>
<B>(1215)</B>
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> We would have something far better.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Catterall:</B> A member opposite says that we would have 
something far better. I could not disagree with him more. To deny 
the contribution of the people who came to the continent from 
France, who had the courage, as Champlain did, to last an entire 
winter at Annapolis and to continue up the St. Lawrence and the 
Ottawa rivers into the heartland of the continent, is a denial of what 
the country is all about.
<P>
	The country was built by consent and consensus, not by force 
and not by dominance. The three measures now before the House to 
reinforce national unity continue the marvellous tradition of 
moving ahead together by consent and by consensus, not by one 
exercising power over another.
<P>
	As we came together as a Canadian family at each stage we made 
special provisions for newcomers to the family and recognized 
their special needs. Whether it was the size of Prince Edward Island 
and the assurances it  needed with respect to its representation in 
Parliament, whether it was British Columbia with its need for the 
recognition of a railway to link it to the east, we have always made 
special provisions. We respected the fact that we were creating a 
family.
<P>
	That sense of family took a thousand people from my riding and 
tens of thousands from all over the country to Montreal on October 
27. The hon. member is absolutely right: politicians could not have 
created that tremendous outpouring of goodwill and love for our 
country and commitment to keeping Quebec within Canada. 
However politicians could make it possible, as many of us did, for 
the people we represent to have the means of expressing that 
sentiment.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In the last week of the referendum campaign, the Prime Minister 
of Canada promised Quebecers that Quebec would be recognized 
as a distinct society within Canada, that no constitutional changes 
affecting Quebec would be made without their consent, and that 
changes would be initiated to bring citizens closer to services and 
to decision making.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It may be unusual for the Reform Party to see in place a 
government and a Prime Minister that keep their commitments. 
Just as we did in the 1993 election when we put forward very 
clearly our commitments to Canadians and our intention to keep 
them, in the last two weeks we have been doing exactly what the 
Prime Minister committed to do.
<P>
	We are not trying to pacify, appease or please the separatists or 
gain their consent for what we are doing. We know they will not 
consent to anything that will unify and strengthen the country. We 
certainly are trying to speak to Canadians across Canada who want 
to see change, who want to see us moving forward together and not 
as the western separatists or the Quebec separatists want.
<P>
	With the recognition of a veto for each of the regions of the 
country, we are saying that if we are to change the relationship that 
binds us together we will have to work at building a consensus 
around it. We cannot have parts of the country imposing their will 
on other parts of the country. That is not easy to do, but it is 
important that as we move forward we do it with consensus as we 
have done to this point in our history.
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	People have been concerned about distinct society and what it 
recognizes. First I will talk about the meaning of the word distinct. 
It does not, as some would have us believe, mean special, better, 
superior in some way or deserving of special treatment. It means 
different.
<P>
	If there is one person in the Chamber who does not feel a great 
pride or does not accept that Quebec, with its  majority French 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17558"> 17558 </A></B>
<P>
language, its unique culture and its law system that is different 
from that of the rest of the country, constitutes a part of Canada that 
is different and by its very difference enriches the whole country, I 
am not sure he or she understands what the country is all about.
<P>
	Concern has been expressed about how this might affect our 
attitude to people of different ethnic cultures, backgrounds and 
origins. I say to them the respect for diversity of the country is 
found in the original agreement that created the country, that we 
would respect each other's differences and each other's languages. 
Without the initial bargain of Confederation we would not have a 
country that is now a model for the world of how people of 
different cultures, backgrounds and languages can live together as 
one while respecting each other's uniqueness.
<P>
	For the House to simply say we recognize the distinct nature of 
Quebec within the Canadian family and we undertake to respect 
that distinctness as we move forward with the business of the 
nation is not a threat to anybody. It is a reassurance to people who 
badly need to know that the rest of the country does value and does 
not intend to try to dominate, demean or diminish the special 
society that has been built in Quebec. Nor does it diminish our 
commitment as a federal government or our obligations of 
fiduciary responsibility for aboriginal peoples everywhere in the 
country inside and outside Quebec.
<P>
	I will speak about the veto briefly. Perhaps there are some who 
feel that the majority simply by its numbers should be able to 
dominate and have its way. I am not one of those. I believe we can 
continue to solve our problems and our differences and to change 
and grow in the future by agreeing together as we have always done 
in the past.
<P>
	I am proud to support the changes that have been brought 
forward. I am proud to look forward to a future for my children in a 
united Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> As you know, Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday the House of Commons passed a motion recognizing 
Quebec as a distinct society. For us in the Bloc Quebecois, this 
motion was pointless because it was insufficient. Why? Because it 
does not recognize Quebec's special status and does not actually 
grant that province any additional powers.
<P>
	Today we are debating Bill C-110 dealing with constitutional 
amendments. This bill would give certain provinces a say 
concerning the federal veto over constitutional amendments.
<P>
	There have been many speeches so far, and I think it would be a 
good idea to remind those listening to us of the bill's purpose.
<P>
<B>(1225)</B>
<P>
	The bill reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>No minister of the crown shall propose a motion for a resolution to authorize 
an amendment to the Constitution of Canada- unless the amendment has first 
been consented to by a majority of the provinces that includes:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(<I>a</I>) Ontario;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(<I>b</I>) Quebec;</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This majority must also include the Atlantic provinces, provided 
that at least two of the four provinces represent 50 per cent of the 
population; and at least two of the three prairie provinces, provided 
that these two provinces represent 50 per cent of the population.
<P>
	Following the representations made by BC residents, and 
particularly by the third party, British Columbia was granted a 
veto. One might think that, had some pressure also been exerted by 
residents of other parts of the country, for example Yukon or the 
Northwest Territories, these regions might also have been given a 
veto.
<P>
	If Bill C-110 is passed, three provinces will have a veto: Ontario, 
Quebec and British Columbia. The other provinces would have 
such a veto by groups of two, as long as they represent 50 per cent 
of the population of their region.
<P>
	What did the 1982 formula provide? Let us compare the current 
proposal with the 1982 formula. The 1982 Constitution provides a 
veto, not only for the federal government, but also for the 
provinces, although that constitution was rejected by Quebecers, 
through their National Assembly, in 1982. There is a formula 
provided in the Constitution.
<P>
	What does it say? It provides that constitutional amendments 
require the approval of seven provinces, or 50 per cent of the total 
population.
<P>
	In our opinion, Bill C-110 offers less than Meech and 
Charlottetown. Quebecers thought Charlottetown did not go far 
enough, while the rest of Canada, and particularly the western 
provinces, felt that it was going too far. Since Bill C-110 provides 
less than that, you will understand that the Bloc Quebecois, which 
looks after the interests of Quebecers, is not happy with that 
measure. The Reform Party, which primarily represents western 
Canada, thinks it is still going too far. This is a catch 22 situation, 
and the more we forge ahead, the worse things get.
<P>
	Another major problem with Bill C-110 is that it only commits 
the House of Commons. Therefore, it can be assumed that, 
following a change of government, after an election, the Reform 
Party could hassle the new government and, if it displayed its 
current attitude, could prompt that new government to repeal this 
piece of legislation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17559"> 17559 </A></B>
<P>
	This is not really a constitutional change, but merely a bill that 
could be superseded by another, as the current government could 
easily do, given its majority.
<P>
	But the fundamental problem with the federal system as we 
know it rests mainly with a distribution of powers that favours the 
federal government too much. Through its spending power and 
under special circumstances, it invades provincial jurisdictions 
from which it never withdraws afterwards.
<P>
	The Quebecers who voted on October 30 were hoping for a more 
meaningful veto. They will not buy this bill that may be amended 
by the next government. The provinces did not consent to this bill 
being introduced.
<P>
	Why not have had this veto proposal tested by submitting it to 
the provinces for discussion? No, the Prime Minister did try to get 
discussions going, but he was put in his place in no time flat, as 
they say. So, he consulted only with the members of his party in the 
federal government.
<P>
<B>(1230)</B>
<P>
	Now the amendment to include British Columbia in the deal 
made the people of Alberta and the aboriginal peoples unhappy. As 
we can see, instead of putting an end to the debate, this bill is 
keeping it going. If that trend can be reversed, it should be pointed 
out.
<P>
	But what matters to the people of Quebec is that they are a 
people, one of the founding peoples of Canada. For any 
negotiations on the future of Quebec to be successful, it must be 
recognized from the outset that the people of Quebec are masters of 
their own destiny. Bill C-110 respecting a so-called veto for 
Quebec does not meet the expectations of one of the founding 
peoples of Canada, namely Quebec. This bill responds solely to the 
electoral ambitions of the Liberal Party of Canada.
<P>
	All of the governments of Quebec for the past 35 years have, as 
representatives of the people of Quebec, demanded repatriation of 
the legislative powers that will be essential for Quebec's social and 
economic development. All of Quebec's efforts to negotiate a new 
agreement with the rest of Canada over the past 35 years have 
arisen out of a desire to change how powers are shared.
<P>
	This bill is not a satisfactory response to the promises made by 
the Prime Minister at the meeting in Verdun in late October. No one 
in Quebec believed the federal government would propose such an 
insignificant veto to the people of Quebec, not even the militants of 
the Quebec Liberal Party who voted no on October 30, 1995. No 
Quebec government, whether PQ or Liberal, has ever had such an 
insignificant change to the constitutional amending formula in 
mind. Quebec has traditionally demanded a true constitutional veto 
for Quebec, not a mere legislative promise not to proceed 
unilaterally during the lifetime of this present government.
<P>
	It would appear that the Prime Minister wants to save face by 
pretending to keep his referendum promises, but Quebecers have 
not been taken in. This sham veto does not meet the needs for 
change expressed by Quebecers-far from it. All that it is is a 
continuation of the unilateral patriation of the Constitution in 1982 
and the imposition of Trudeau's Charter of Rights and Freedoms, 
and none of this was agreed to by Quebec, not only not by the PQ, 
but not by the Quebec Liberals either. Even Claude Ryan, that ultra 
federalist, who was then leader of the Quebec Liberal Party, did not 
agree.
<P>
	Instead of offering constitutional change, this is one more 
padlock to prevent future constitutional changes in a process 
already complicated by the so-called Canada Bill of 1982, which 
required the consent of the federal government and seven provinces 
out of ten representing 50 per cent of the population. And now, the 
federal government will make exercising a veto even more 
difficult. In addition to the veto powers I just explained, the 
government's own veto will depend on how it is exercised by five 
regions, in two of which the consent of at least two provinces will 
be needed.
<P>
	Quebec's motto is: ``Je me souviens'', and we on this side of the 
House remember that the man who moved the patriation of the 
Constitution of 1982 is the same person who is now proposing a 
padlock that will prevent any future changes.

<P>
	<B>Mr. John Cannis (Scarborough Centre, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it is a pleasure and a privilege to have the opportunity to 
speak on such important legislation as Bill C-110, an act respecting 
constitutional amendments.
<P>
	Many hon. members over the past couple of days have spoken on 
this most important issue and debate has flowed from both sides of 
the House. We have have heard all the figures and all the 
mechanics, such as the five and seven ratio. That is fine. I do not 
want to go over the facts and figures and the mechanics. I want 
begin my presentation with a quotation from two distinguished 
Canadians who gave their heart and soul to Canada.
<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
	I quote Sir John A. Macdonald:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>If I had influence over the minds of the people of Canada, any power over 
their intellect, I would leave them with this legacy. Whatever you do, adhere to 
the union. We are a great nation and shall become one of the greatest in the 
universe if we preserve it. We shall sink into insignificance and adversity if we 
suffer it to be broken. It is God and nature who made Canada one. Let no person 
be allowed to put it asunder.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Another great Canadian, Sir Wilfrid Laurier, said this:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This cathedral is made of marble, oak and granite. It is the image of a nation I 
would like to see Canada become. For here, I want the granite to remain the 
granite, the oak to remain the oak, and out of all of these elements I would build 
a nation great among the nations of the world.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17560"> 17560 </A></B>
<P>
	Approximately 100 years later the words that were spoken by 
these two distinguished Canadians we hear today from nations, that 
Canada is the best country in the world in which to live. I reach out 
to members in the House and tell them how blessed we are and I 
continuously remind my family and friends of that.
<P>
	I really do not know what is going on here. I noticed last week 
that the new words inscribed in the coat of arms state: ``They desire 
a better country''. These two distinguished Canadians desired a 
better country. Each and every one who came to this country, 
whether as immigrants, such as our parents or grandparents, came 
because they desired a better country. People came to build on the 
foundations that Laurier and Macdonald established for us.
<P>
	Where do we go from here? Do we have the will to survive? I say 
we must develop a Canadian soul. We must develop unity and pride 
and share it publicly. We must share the joy of being Canadian, 
share the joy of being unique among nations.
<P>
	I am afraid of what has happened because this whole situation is 
out hand. Specifically, there seems to be a shoving match because 
neither the Bloc Quebecois nor the Reform Party are prepared to 
say: ``Yes, we have made a mistake. Yes, our country comes before 
petty politics. Yes, there are times for give and take as the Fathers 
of Confederation did''.
<P>
	The country said yes to the railway in order to appease British 
Columbia in past years to make the union strong. I really fear what 
is taking place in the country right now.
<P>
	I took my family to see the Lion King not too long ago. What I 
see across the way reminds me of the hyenas and the vultures, just 
sitting there waiting to grasp on to a situation. It worries me 
greatly. It worries me because we must be accountable to our 
children and our grandchildren and their children in generations to 
come. I am concerned because I do not even want to think of the 
day when I will sit with my grandchildren, and if God keeps me 
well, with my great grandchildren and tell them what a great 
country we had called Canada. There is a possibility that my 
grandchildren and great grandchildren will need a passport to visit 
their friends in Montreal or Quebec City. I do not even want to 
think about that.
<P>
	Today I want to reach out, not just to members of the Bloc or the 
Reform Party who say they speak on behalf of their constituents. I 
do not believe that for a moment. On October 28, at three or four 
o'clock in the morning many of my colleagues and their 
constituents, seniors and students came together at Lawrence and 
Midland to load on to buses and take that six and a half hour ride to 
Montreal. They did not do it to beg Quebecers to stay in Canada. 
What they did was show their true love for this country. They tried 
to tell the nation from sea to sea to  sea that we are one strong, 
united country and it only makes sense to keep it strong and united.
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
	Their only means of getting to Montreal that day was in buses 
and planes organized by the members of the Liberal Party. I want to 
take this opportunity to thank the unity committee for its efforts in 
putting that project together.
<P>
	I am concerned because there seems to be a falsification of the 
facts. The leader of the Bloc Quebecois stands up and through 
innuendo creates strawmen in trying to touch the emotional aspects 
of an ambiguous question, a question that was full of misleading 
statements, a question that was full of gaps, a question that had no 
substance, a question that was misleading.
<P>
	I walked the streets of Montreal. I visited grocery stores. I 
visited restaurants. The people were confused right up to the very 
last minute. They did not know what they were voting for. God 
forbid if there is another referendum. I certainly would advocate 
putting a straightforward question to the people of Quebec: Do you 
want to stay in Canada or do you want to leave Canada? Do you 
want to continue to be a Canadian or do you want to become 
something else?
<P>
	We are a relatively young nation compared to most of the nations 
in the world. But in that short period of time, we have managed to 
attain the status of the number one country in the world.
<P>
	Earlier I spoke about Laurier and Macdonald. They too were 
immigrants. I am proud to stand in this House 100 or so years later, 
another immigrant, defending this country. It is a darn shame that 
we have members from the Bloc, members from the Reform. I was 
not born here but I am blessed to be living in this country.
<P>
	There are not words that I can say to the members of the Reform 
or the Bloc that will change their minds. I am not going to attempt 
to, but I will be speaking to my friends in Montreal and in Quebec 
City and I am going to tell them what is the truth.
<P>
	Members of the Reform Party keep flipping back and forth. The 
vision of their 20-point plan is this. They say they represent the rest 
of Canada and the rest of Canada does not want any province to 
have special rights over any other province. They say that they will 
never vote for a bill that gives one province more power than 
another. They forgot they felt this way when they brought out their 
20-point new Confederation package. In it the leader of the Reform 
Party states that his party is in favour of Canada being split into 
five regions, in favour-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Johnston:</B> That is rubbish.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stinson:</B> Be honest for a change.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cannis:</B> Be honest with the people of Canada. Do not get in 
front of the TV cameras and make a scene  trying to score cheap

<P>
political points. Members will have to answer to the people of 
Canada. That day is not too far off.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Johnston:</B> You bet.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> That will not wash.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cannis:</B> The debate we are having in this honourable House 
on this motion is a very unique opportunity. It is an opportunity to 
lay the groundwork and to send a signal to Quebecers and all 
Canadians for 1997. It is a signal to the official opposition. It is a 
signal to the Reform Party to save face and to show solidarity, to 
work together, to create a climate for economic prosperity.
<P>
	Working Canadians are happy Canadians. This agenda is about 
getting Canadians back to work, bringing some dignity into the 
household.
<P>
	We must make this Canada the nation that it deserves to be, 
second to none. I am proud to support this legislation. Yes, I will 
have to answer to the people of Canada come election time and so 
will all members. God bless Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am standing today to oppose Bill C-110 for a number of 
reasons.
<P>
<B>(1245 )</B>
<P>
	I find this bill extremely divisive. After listening to the hon. 
member from the other side who just spoke I find it even more 
divisive. Here is a government that had its opportunity during the 
referendum in Quebec. The Prime Minister said: ``Don't worry, be 
happy. We are happy. Canada has no reason for concern over what 
might happen in Quebec''.
<P>
	Government members told us and all of Canada that it was only a 
small movement in Quebec that was looking for separatism, and 
the Canadian people believed them. The Reform Party never 
believed them. We told them there were all kinds of warning signs 
that this was a stronger movement than government members were 
telling the Canadian people. The Prime Minister likes to play like 
an ostrich and bury his head in the sand, unfortunately. We almost 
lost that province through acts such as this. This great government 
decided to tell the people. It tells them anything but the truth.
<P>
	Now we stand here today, the day after the vote on distinct 
society, on which closure was invoked. We stand here today 
discussing the veto. No matter how we look at this we see a 
government that has gone on its hands and knees begging a 
separatist government to please on board. In order to do this it is 
willing to sell out the rest of Canada. When government members 
start talking about veto powers to certain provinces, when they start 
telling people that because of the regions they live in they will have 
more power than other people in different regions, they are asking 
for trouble.
<P>
	When I was brought up and in school I was taught the number 
one law in Canada is equality of all of its citizens, not a select few, 
not for the few who sit here in government, but for all citizens of 
Canada. The bills we have seen in the last few days absolutely 
contradict everything we have been taught about Canada. The 
government has decided that because of our ethnic backgrounds 
some of us can no longer be classified as Canadians; they will be 
distinct Canadians. What does it think this does to the rest of the 
people in Canada?
<P>
	We hear from hon. members on the other side that there are two 
founding nations. That went out over a hundred years ago. There 
are many Canadian citizens and they want to be called Canadian 
citizens, not on the basis of their ethnic backgrounds. They came 
here to be Canadians and yet bills such as this cut that all apart.
<P>
	The government will create a backlash that will see once again in 
all probability the ugly head of western separatism rise. Yet the 
government has no fear of that. It does not worry about that. Its 
members say: ``We gave B.C. the veto. Shouldn't you be happy?''
<P>
	The Prime Minister was led kicking and screaming to give B.C. 
the veto. I remind the government there is no way he wanted to give 
B.C. the veto. It is not so much that B.C. wanted that veto; it was to 
appease the rest of Canada. It is backfiring.
<P>
	We heard another member say the Reform Party was in favour of 
the five regions. Let us set the record straight. We put 20 questions 
out to be discussed by the people of Canada, not by some high and 
mighty, so-called little tin god the government thinks it is.
<P>
<B>(1250 )</B>
<P>
	If there are concerns about any part of these 20 questions, please 
come back to the Reform Party and address these problems. We 
stand by taking it to the people and letting the people decide what 
our policy should be. Not one of these becomes policy until passed 
by our members, not by the elite few like the government members 
with their policies.
<P>
	Let us look at what we give up. Under this veto power there will 
be no change. The status quo will go on forever. One region may 
decide it is against its best interest or another region will decide it 
is against its best interest. Therefore nothing will change except the 
fostering of greater discontent from the Canadian taxpayer's not 
being able to see change made.
<P>
	We will not see a centralized government which is what the 
government is trying to pull here. If anything, it will be torn further 
apart. We will see the people finally rising up and saying they have 
had enough of this dictatorial state from a one person government. 
We will find that people will look at this as a return to the 
Charlottetown accord, soundly defeated across Canada. Because 
the accord was defeated, the government will find those back doors 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17562"> 17562 </A></B>
<P>
to open this up, bring it forward  and pass it into law. It will pay no 
attention to how that vote went.
<P>
	The government does nothing to listen to the people. It has no 
intention of ever listening to the people of Canada. Its members' 
only intention is to make sure their plates are full of whatever they 
need to eat, that they are warm, safe and cuddly while their pay 
cheques comes in on time. That is the only concern I can see that 
the Liberal government has ever thought about in the last two 
years.
<P>
	Look at their vision. The Liberals say they have a great vision, a 
vision of a united Canada. All Canadians have that vision. It might 
come as a shock to the government, but it does not really have to go 
out and sell that. It has to be honest to the Canadian people. It must 
tell them exactly what it is giving to the separatist government in 
Quebec. People will understand. The government is selling them 
out. It is selling out the Canadian public and making a poor job of 
it.
<P>
	These proposals will do nothing to promote national unity. We 
sit here every day and listen to the sell, sell, sell idea from the 
government. I have to admit, some members over there could sell 
snow in Alaska. They practice very well. They study this: ``Be 
happy, it will not hurt''. However, every time one of these things is 
implemented it hurts. The Liberals will come back in about six 
months and say: ``We did not realize there was any concern. 
Nobody told us there was any concern''. That is their standard 
answer on anything they do.
<P>
	We came back here thinking we still lived in a democratic 
country. No, we do not. When governments can put time closure it 
is no longer a democracy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Maloney (Erie, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am pleased 
to participate on the debate on Bill C-110.
<P>
<B>(1255 )</B>
<P>
	I will outline some of the salient features of what I consider a 
sound, innovative piece of legislation. The bill on the regional veto 
will require the consent of Quebec, Ontario, British Columbia and 
the Atlantic and the prairie regions before any constitutional 
amendments can be proposed in Parliament by the Government of 
Canada. Currently only the House of Commons has an absolute 
veto over any constitutional amendment.
<P>
	The bill guarantees Quebec, Ontario, British Columbia, the 
Atlantic region and the prairie region a general veto over any 
constitutional amendment in areas where they do not already have 
an absolute veto or right of withdrawl. This veto will apply to 
changes to national institutions such as the Senate, the creation of 
new provinces and any amendments regarding the distribution of 
powers.
<P>
	Under the bill a constitutional amendment will have to receive 
the consent of at least six provinces, including Quebec, Ontario, 
British Columbia, two provinces from  the Atlantic region 
representing more than 50 per cent of the region's population, and 
two provinces in the prairie region representing more than 50 per 
cent of the prairie's population, before it can proceed to Parliament.
<P>
	The federal government could not proceed to table an 
amendment if one of the regions refused to give its consent, even if 
seven provinces or more representing 50 per cent of Canada's 
population passed resolutions in favour of the amendment. The 
consent of the provinces and the regions will be expressed in 
various forms: by direct notice, a vote in the legislative assemblies 
or by a referendum.
<P>
	The bill does not amend the Canadian Constitution. 
Nevertheless, an act of the federal Parliament is a serious measure. 
This law will become part of Canada's consolidated statutes and 
will be binding on the current government and on succeeding 
governments.
<P>
	In tabling the bill, the Government of Canada is keeping its 
commitment to Quebecers and ensuring them increased protection 
within the Canadian federation in a way that should not offend its 
sister provinces. Moreover, the Government of Canada has 
recognized that the constitutional amendment process is of interest 
to all parts of the country. That is why the federal government is 
lending its veto to the five regions of the country, treating all 
regions fairly and equitably.
<P>
	Now is not the time to hold a series of constitutional discussions. 
The Government of Quebec and its premier in waiting are 
unequivocally devoted to their secessionist option. If future 
conditions were to change where Quebec and the other regions 
were to agree the veto proposed by the bill could be incorporated 
into the Constitution. This will be for future discussion and future 
debate; this after due consideration and with the contribution and 
input from our constituents, the citizens of Canada.
<P>
	In the past attempts to accommodate Quebec within the 
Constitution have failed. When the citizens of the country voted 
against the Charlottetown accord in 1992 they rejected a complex 
package of changes to the Constitution, including an elected 
Senate, which I agree with, aboriginal self-government, a veto for 
each province on changes to the composition of the Senate, the 
House of Commons and the Supreme Court, and the recognition of 
Quebec as a distinct society.
<P>
	The Prime Minister's new, much simpler proposal is easily 
understood and should be judged on its merits.
<P>
	In the past in attempts to accommodate Quebec within the 
Constitution Canadians outside of Quebec were united on one key 
point, and I agree wholeheartedly with them, that Quebec not be 
given powers which would make Quebecers more equal than their 
fellow Canadians. A veto for Quebec alone, even if it applied only 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17563"> 17563 </A></B>
<P>
to language, culture and civil law, would have meant very special 
status, which the majority of Canadians oppose.  My constituents 
would oppose special status for any region.
<P>
	On the other hand, a veto for all 10 provinces would have 
enabled situations to exist; for example, the claim that Prince 
Edward Island, with a population 130,000, could thwart Ontario's 
democratically expressed aspirations. A provincial veto would be 
easier to champion if every provinces had the same number of 
citizens. They obviously do not.
<P>
	Some are not thrilled with having their province lumped in with 
others in a geographical region. If they are honest with themselves 
they will realize the regional veto recognizes the reality of the 
country and its population.
<P>
	The government's regional veto is a logical attempt to balance 
fairly equal blocs of population so that aspirations of several 
million people are not thwarted by several hundred thousand. Is 
this not fair and equitable?
<P>
	If every province had a veto a national compromise would prove 
more difficult to negotiate than all of our combined frustrating 
constitutional negotiations of the recent past.
<P>
	It is important to point out that until 1982 Quebec had a de facto 
veto, if not a constitutionally entrenched one, over fundamental 
constitutional change. The proposed change restores the principle 
which was done away with by René Levesque in the final 
negotiations of the 1982 Canada Act.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	Despite difficulties, Canada grew and prospered for 125 years 
with a Quebec veto. We should ask ourselves now how long it 
could last without one. Canadians now realize that we cannot 
continue to build a strong, unified federation by trying to force 
Quebecers to accept a Constitution that is definitely not acceptable 
to them.
<P>
	Canadians from all parts of the country began the crusade for 
Canada at the Montreal rally. We have a responsibility to take up 
the mantle and seek the final victory. I further point out that we are 
dealing with an act of Parliament which can be amended and 
repealed, rather than a binding constitutional change. Let us give it 
a try. We should think of what we might lose if we do not.
<P>
	The legislation is a welcome attempt to wrest debate on 
Canada's future out of the hands of separatists. All Canadians want 
and are entitled to a say on the issue. It is an offer of a tangible, 
substantial change that even the Leader of the Opposition and his 
cohorts have found difficult to discredit. It is one with which the 
rest of Canada can live, albeit with some reservations.
<P>
	It was interesting to see how the Leader of the Opposition and 
his cohorts explained to Quebecers why they were not interested in 
accepting an offer that Quebec felt it required. The Leader of the 
Opposition  and his cohorts say that no federal offer to Quebec 
would ever be acceptable. Their sights and their egos are set on an 
independent country. They fail to appreciate that in the most recent 
referendum Quebecers again rejected sovereignty. Yet these 
separatists continue to contradict the people who elected them and 
strive for the goal the majority of Quebecers have rejected. They 
are democratic when the people agree with them and autocratic 
when they do not.
<P>
	The proposals send a clear message to Quebecers that the 
Reform Party's shrill cries do not reflect the views of the rest of 
Canada. There is a willingness in the nation to make some 
reasonable accommodation for Quebec. The Bloc Quebecois does 
not have the appropriate answer. I remind Reform members that 
western Canadians wish for Canada to stay in one piece. Life will 
not end if Alberta loses the provincial veto it never had. There is no 
dishonour in losing a minor disagreement to keep a wonderful 
treasure: Canada. It is a small price to pay for a united country. The 
obligation to compromise is not really that difficult or that horrible.
<P>
	Canada is weary of the Quebec issue, but at the same time it is 
very concerned about the Quebec issue. Many Canadians will 
admit to nights of fitful sleep leading to the referendum on October 
30 and a collective sigh of relief when the majority of Quebecers 
rejected separation.
<P>
	Bill C-110 is a welcome step forward. It is not the end or even 
the beginning of the end of our constitutional malaise. The 
separatists who deem it unacceptable should ask their constituents 
for their opinion and then be honest with themselves and with us, as 
it gives much of what Quebecers want. At the same time the 
constitutional veto powers to Quebec, Ontario, the Atlantic 
provinces, the prairie provinces and British Columbia should 
alleviate concerns that Quebec would have regional powers the rest 
of the country would not. Have we not struck a reasonable 
compromise, a compromise with which we can all truly live?
<P>
	The government has acted in good faith. Although these 
proposals lack constitutional clout, they could very well represent 
the best and perhaps the only hope to keep our country strong and 
united. I urge members of the House to put aside petty regional 
jealousies and partisan politics. These proposals deserve the 
support of all who would keep this great country together.
<P>
	Give unity a chance. Give Canada a chance.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is with 
great interest and a sense of conviction that I rise in the House 
today to speak to Bill C-110 introduced by the government, a bill 
that would add to our constitutional jargon one more formula to 
amend a Constitution that the Quebec nation rejected when it 
refused to sign in 1982.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17564"> 17564 </A></B>
<P>
	I rise in the House today with a sense of conviction because since 
yesterday, when the Prime Minister was again heard to deny the 
very meaning of these meagre proposals for change, I feel I have an 
even better case for attacking this government's indecent show of 
irresponsibility on a subject as fundamental as an agreement 
concluded in the past by two founding peoples.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	Yes, like millions of fellow Quebecers, I heard the Prime 
Minister yesterday renege on his referendum commitments and put 
on the back burner all good intentions he served up in a panic to 
Quebecers towards the end of the referendum campaign.
<P>
	Those who believed the Prime Minister was sincere, when he 
promised sweeping changes after the referendum, realized 
yesterday how thoroughly and rudely they had been tricked.
<P>
	In an interview on the CBC, I heard the Prime Minister explain 
the thinking behind the changes he is proposing. I heard the Prime 
Minister say that he had promised Quebec three little things, and 
those are his words.
<P>
	So, if we are to believe the statement the Prime Minister made 
yesterday to the nation, the government is inviting us to debate one 
of the three little things-Bill C-110.
<P>
	What of this little thing for Quebec? Really, it is not much at all. 
We knew as much, even though, until yesterday, the government 
members were doing their best to sell this provision to Quebecers 
like it was the find of the century. In a gesture of magnanimous 
imperialism, the federal government is trying to show its 
generosity towards Quebec in lending it a veto.
<P>
	In fact, the federal government is dangling a veto in front of 
Quebec, which does not come under the province's jurisdiction, but 
rather that of the federal government. At any time, the government 
may circumvent the opinion and the jurisdiction of the National 
Assembly by imposing its own rules on the use of this bogus veto.
<P>
	What the federal government claims to be giving with one hand, 
it is already preparing to take away with the other. In Quebec, we 
have got used to this sort of double cross in the course of the 
various attempts at constitutional reform. Never, however, has the 
affront reached the level of being written into a bill. Never 
throughout the fruitless constitutional negotiations of the past has 
anyone thought of serving up such insignificance to Quebec.
<P>
	In this regard, federalist utterances are fairly paradoxical. To the 
Quebecers, the return of the veto is being heralded. To English 
Canada, with the Prime Minister having to justify his poor 
referendum  performance, the bill is being touted as nothing at all. 
Just enough to cobble together a few sad promises that they already 
regret have made, while appearing to formally resolve the big issue 
of national unity.
<P>
	This bill must be rejected because it became obvious as soon as 
it was introduced that it was thrown together hastily. Originally 
designed, according to the government, to meet one of Quebec's 
historical demands, it is now so watered down that every province 
would also get a veto at the same time, including those who have 
never demanded one.
<P>
	Let us acknowledge right off the bat that the federal offer to give 
Quebec its veto back is based on false premises. The government 
accuses Quebec's sovereignist leaders, René Lévesque first of all, 
of losing Quebec's veto after giving up on it. That is a false 
premise, as federal mandarins and the Minister of Justice know full 
well. In 1982, the Supreme Court ruled that Quebec did not have a 
veto and never had one. In a second ruling following the irreparable 
patriation of the Constitution led by today's Prime Minister, the 
Supreme Court concluded that Quebec never had a veto.
<P>
	It is clear that neither this government nor English Canada want 
a real veto for Quebec, as demonstrated by the fact that this bill 
provides for not one but four vetoes, with a fifth one that recently 
surfaced. Since they do not really have anything to give, they are 
generous: they are willing to give everything to everyone. Yet, 
when the time comes to give Quebec what it has rightfully 
demanded for decades, they only respond with pettiness, 
narrow-mindedness, and a total disregard for the hope for major 
changes expressed by Quebecers in the last referendum.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	It only took a short 40 days for all the solemn promises and 
demonstrations of love and affection to boil down to three 
meaningless proposals. First, a distinct society motion of no legal 
significance, that has already been disavowed by the Prime 
Minister who denies the very existence of a Quebec culture. 
Second, a veto granted, or rather imposed on everyone, a veto no 
sooner granted than it is taken back, given that the federal 
government is the only one with fiduciary rights. And finally, a 
travesty of transfer of jurisdiction over manpower training, an area 
in which the government takes pleasure in shifting responsibility 
without the related financial authority.
<P>
	Indeed, the interpretation the Prime Minister gave yesterday is 
accurate: these are three small things that he is giving the people of 
Quebec to fulfil his promises and meet the expectations of those 
who voted no in the referendum, confident that the change 
promised were coming.
<P>
	But a great people makes great things. It refuses to let 
imperialism impose small things on it. That is what we call pride.
<P>

<P>
	And I will proudly vote against this bill.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I deem it an 
opportunity to speak to Bill C-110 which gives a regional veto and 
to the amendment which changes the number of divisions from 
four to five.
<P>
	The question I ask today in rising to speak on report stage of Bill 
C-110 is why we are here in this situation. Why are we here at this 
time? What has led us to this discussion?
<P>
	If we look back to the beginning of this parliamentary session in 
October 1993 and the spring of 1994 we had certain expectations. I 
had an expectation of the Liberal government. For nine years it sat 
in opposition. The rules are clearly set out in Beauchesne's. Any 
group that sits in the place of official opposition is there to prepare 
to take over government and to be ready to take on the 
responsibility.
<P>
	I asked a question early in this session that I ask again today. 
Was that Liberal opposition ready to be the Government of 
Canada? Clearly it was not, for in the first session of the spring of 
1994 the government did not move on its fiscal policy. There was 
no plan to reduce the deficit of the country. There were complaints 
about what the Conservatives did previously but nothing in terms 
of a plan to deal with the deficit of the country and on a long term 
basis to bring the deficit of the country to zero and balance the 
budget. That was it.
<P>
	In other areas, for example social policy, pension issues and 
justice issues, there was a whole string of committee reports, 
sittings and studies done. The House leader for the Liberal Party 
mentioned over and over again that he had to study something. It 
became an item of humour in the current House, in the 35th 
session, that things were being studied and no decisions were being 
made. That is what happened and things have been allowed to drift 
because of it.
<P>
	It has been a do nothing time since 1994. A huge social policy 
review has now come forward and produced nothing. There is still 
a white paper on pension reform that is 20 months overdue. That is 
the setting in which the discussion on Bill C-110 is placed.
<P>
	The government made it up as it went along. It has resulted in ill 
conceived policies that do not work, for example the policies of the 
human resources minister on employment insurance. The question 
is: Will it really get anyone back to employment? We question that.
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	They are hollow, symbolic policies that do not attack the real 
problems which have been presented to us. The best example of 
that in this current House is the justice minister's gun control bill 
which is supposed to stop crime when a gun is registered. As we 
have said over and  over again, that is the most foolish thing we 
have ever heard.
<P>
	If we look at the current piece of legislation in that context, we 
again find that even the Prime Minister's referendum strategy that 
occurred before October 30, 1995 was a fly by the seat of your 
pants stewardship. There was no plan for any renewed federalism, 
only more of the status quo. There was no effort to dispel the 
separatist myth of a painless divorce, only silence. There was no 
concept of a referendum strategy, only a hope that if nobody said 
anything it would turn out all right. We know that the vote was very 
close. It almost cost us the country of Canada because of the 
Liberal government being ill prepared and only knee jerk reacting 
to every one of its responsibilities.
<P>
	We look at this legislation and the Prime Minister has done it 
again. Having made a desperate promise in the last week of the 
campaign that Daniel Johnson would not let him forget, the Prime 
Minister and three or four of his advisers huddled on the third floor 
of centre block and came to the conclusion of providing a unity 
package. They put that proposal before us to study.
<P>
	The unity package is going to do more to divide Canada than to 
bring it together. Looking at it within Quebec, what has it done 
within Quebec? Has it brought Quebec into Canada? No, it has not. 
The potential new premier of Quebec has said in this House 
regarding the proposal: Is this all that Canada has to offer?
<P>
	The federalist cupboards are bare. It has not satisfied that 
seemingly unquenchable thirst in Quebec at all. It has caused more 
division. Other Canadians are asking: ``Why do you keep giving it 
things when you are not treating the rest of Canada in an equal 
way?''
<P>
	Is this package any better than the Meech Lake or Charlottetown 
proposals? Many of us have called it Charlottetown light because it 
promises less to Quebec. As such, how is it ever going to do more 
for the federalist cause in Quebec?
<P>
	Outside of Quebec what is it doing? Outside of Quebec we feel 
this legislation and the distinct society resolution will only divide 
Canadians, rather than unite them. For example, with this regional 
veto proposal, even after the government amendments which are 
being proposed here to change the divisions from four to five, 
British Columbia and Alberta are still opposing the bill. There must 
be something drastically wrong when the regions do not accept it, 
even after they have had a little more say in the outcome of the 
veto. Through its own actions, the Liberal government is creating 
what we think are first and second class provinces. This is more of 
the old style traditional politics of tired old federalists.
<P>
	Over the course of a week or two the Prime Minister and his 
cronies cooked up a Quebec package. Now they are trying to shove 
it down the throats of not only Parliament, but of all Canadians. We 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17566"> 17566 </A></B>
<P>
must remember  that we each stand in our place as representatives 
of all Canadians.
<P>
	We have to recognize that the provinces were not consulted. The 
people were not consulted. Not even all the members of the Liberal 
caucus were consulted in terms of the process in reaching a final 
conclusion or proposals that were presented to the House of 
Commons.
<P>
	As my final point, I raise the matter that there has been some 
confusion over Reform's own proposal on constitutional 
ratification. Some people have misunderstood the regional aspect 
of it and have asked about the difference between the government's 
proposal and Reform's proposal. The difference is that we believe 
there should not-

within the minute I have.
<P>
	It is very clear what we are attempting to do in this House of 
Commons is to make an amendment to section 38(1)(a) of the 
current Constitution Act of Canada. This amendment allows the 
provinces and their legislatures to make a vote with regard to this 
matter. The Reform Party clearly wants to have the people of 
Canada by referendum vote in the regions to determine what 
constitutional changes come about. That is the distinct difference 
that we believe in.

<P>
	<B>Hon. Jon Gerrard (Secretary of State (Science, Research and

C-110, the bill which provides for a regional veto over changes to 
our Canadian Constitution.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17567"> 17567 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1325 )</B>
<P>
	The bill provides for a historic recognition that the people of 
Quebec should have input into and a veto over constitutional 
change which affects national institutions such as the Senate, and 
any amendments which might affect the distribution of powers. At 
the same time with our amendment to recognize British Columbia 
as a region we are giving historic recognition to the regional 
make-up of Canada in which our 10 provinces are within five 
regions.
<P>
	The bill clearly recognizes the fact that British Columbia by 
itself represents an identifiable region. This recognition is 
consistent with the unique geographic situation of British 
Columbia, the rapidly growing population of British Columbia and 
the emergence of the Asia-Pacific trading region in which Canada 
and particularly British Columbia have a major role.
<P>
	In making this amendment we are also recognizing in law the 
importance of the prairie region of Canada representing the 
provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta as a region. As 
the representative from Portage-Interlake in Manitoba, having 
roots and family in Saskatchewan and having many friends and 
having visited frequently in Alberta, this seems to me to be a 
particularly timely and appropriate recognition.
<P>
	The bill we are discussing today represents one part of a package 
we are bringing forward in the follow-up to the recent referendum. 
It has measures which are designed to strengthen and to promote 
the unity of Canada and the ability of Canadians to be full 
participants in our planet's global village. In this context I will 
comment briefly on the place of this bill as part of the whole 
package of changes which we are bringing forward.
<P>
	The recognition of Quebec as a distinct society is appropriate 
and timely. It provides within the framework of our country Canada 
a vision of the make-up of our component parts. Quebec is 
distinctive in having a system of civil law which is based upon the 
Napoleonic tradition. This is different from the rest of Canada 
which has civil law based on the English common law tradition. 
Quebec is also distinctive linguistically and has its own distinctive 
cultural traditions.
<P>
	I would liken the development of this historic recognition to the 
historic recognition and evolution of English and French as official 
languages in Canada. The recognition of French and English as 
official languages provides a recognition of the fundamental nature 
of our country, Canada. The recognition does not give rights to 
other languages: Ukrainian, German, Italian, Chinese, aboriginal 
languages and so on. However it has sent a signal that individuals' 
historic languages and cultures are important.
<P>
	That signal has been fundamental to the evolution of Canada as a 
country which is very different from the nature of the United States 
south of our border. Instead  of the United States model of a 
melting pot, we have a pluralistic community in Canada, a country 
which clearly recognizes and thrives on diversity, a country in 
which the different regions of Canada can take pride in aspects in 
which each is distinct.
<P>
	I will argue that the tolerant diverse country we have built in 
Canada is ideally prepared for participation in the future of our 
planet. With multiple global languages around the world, with 
multiple global cultures in which it is increasingly important that 
we work together and trade together for our common benefit, our 
background as a diverse and tolerant society is particularly fitting.
<P>
	It is in the context of this changing world that we have presented 
a new employment insurance program to decentralize training in 
Canada. Individuals will have better access, more freedom of 
choice and more opportunity to learn as they would desire to learn 
for their own benefit and for the benefit of Canada.
<P>
	We are entering the knowledge age, a time when the information 
highway will dramatically change opportunities for learning, 
opportunities for work and opportunities for self-expression.
<P>
<B>(1330 )</B>
<P>
	We are moving to a model which people have called a client 
service model in which individuals will have more choices, more 
options and more opportunities. Therefore the government in many 
respects is changing its own role dramatically; changing from the 
old world in which government tried to do things alone to provide 
solutions, to a new world in which the government is a facilitator 
and a catalyst, helping Canadians from coast to coast find their own 
solutions.
<P>
	The role of Canada in the world has similarly changed. The 
Canadian people, a people of diverse backgrounds, are an example 
to the rest of the world of how to achieve a very high quality of life 
which we have here, an example of how to work and to co-operate 
together for our mutual benefit, an example of the benefits of our 
linguistic, cultural, economic, scientific and technological 
strengths in Canada, benefits which enable us to reach out to help 
and to trade with the rest of the world.
<P>
	In providing in products and services an understanding based on 
our diversity and our tolerance to others in the world, we can help 
others improve their quality of life even as we improve our own. 
Through increasing our exports of products, services and 
knowledge, Canadians can derive economic benefit and improved 
quality of life even as we help others to improve their own 
circumstances.
<P>
	The tolerance and the diversity, the cultural sensitivity and the 
linguistic abilities of Canadians provide us with a unique position 
in the world which we should recognize and celebrate. It is the 
Canadian paradigm that we have diversity and tolerance even as we 
have unity and co-operation.

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17568"> 17568 </A></B>

<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I rise in this House to speak to Bill C-110 respecting 
constitutional amendments. It seems obvious to me that, by its very 
substance, Bill C-100 cannot meet the demands of the people of 
Quebec and Canada.
<P>
	Quebecers have always asked for a real constitutional veto for 
Quebec, not a mere legislative promise. This veto granted to 
Quebec through Bill C-100 is reminiscent of the 1982 
constitutional amending process. If they disagree, the federal 
Parliament may overrule Quebec's veto.
<P>
	Under Bill C-110, it is up to the federal government to determine 
the criteria governing a province's approval. There are at least 
seven different ways of doing that: through a resolution from the 
provincial legislature; through an order in council, which means a 
simple notice from the government; through a notice signed by the 
premier of a province; through a notice signed by the lieutenant 
governor of a province; through a provincial referendum held by a 
province; through a federal referendum held in the province or in a 
number of provinces; and, finally, as a last resort, through a vote by 
the MPs representing the province concerned.
<P>
	The Constitution Act, 1982 includes specific provisions 
regarding the amending formula, but the government did not see fit 
to include them in Bill C-110. There is a strong consensus in 
Quebec regarding the need, for the province, to have a veto, and 
Quebec's interpretation of that right is totally different from that of 
the rest of Canada.
<P>
	Quebecers always felt that Confederation was a pact between the 
four original provinces and basically an agreement between the two 
founding nations. Former Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau 
supported that view in 1967, when he said that the BNA Act of 
1867, which was proclaimed by the imperial Parliament, was based 
on an agreement reached by two parties.
<P>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
	Thus, any constitutional amendment requires Quebec's 
approval, as one of the two founding nations. The Constitution was 
patriated with a new formula, in spite of the opposition of Quebec, 
which was not granted a veto over future constitutional 
amendments.
<P>
	In his memoirs, former Quebec premier René Lévesque 
explained why he accepted the right of withdrawal with 
compensation, instead of the traditional veto power. He felt that a 
veto could impede development, and that if Quebec got it, Ontario, 
and perhaps other provinces, would demand it. His view of  things 
was right, since British Columbia in fact claimed a veto and 
recently got it.
<P>
	As my colleague for Joliette said earlier, the Prime Minister 
opened his veto drawer, pulled out a copy and handed it to British 
Columbia.
<P>
	The government of Robert Bourassa, premier of Quebec at the 
time-and this was before the failure of the Meech Lake 
accord-then wanted to back both horses on the Quebec veto issue. 
He claimed for Quebec both the constitutional right to oppose 
changes to federal institutions and the creation of new provinces 
and the right to withdraw with financial compensation.
<P>
	The constitutional question was always at the heart of the debate 
in Canada and, until 1982, no constitutional change affecting the 
legislative powers of the Quebec National Assembly was adopted 
in Canada.
<P>
	The fact that Jean Lesage's Liberal government dropped the 
Fulton-Favreau amending formula in 1966 and Robert Bourassa's 
Liberal government rejected the Victoria charter in 1971 indicated 
that Quebec, the other provinces and the federal government 
considered Quebec had a veto on constitutional amendments.
<P>
	However, the Supreme Court of Canada reminded us in 1982 that 
Quebec had never had a constitutional veto and thus confirmed that 
the federal government could, with the support of the Supreme 
Court, circumvent the opinion of the people of Quebec.
<P>
	And now for a bit of history, let us go back to the time of Honoré 
Mercier, who has gone down in history as a great 19th century 
premier of Quebec. From 1887 to 1891 his concerns were the 
Constitution, education, the public debt, regional economic 
development and the challenge of industrial change.
<P>
	His great idea was to redefine the Constitution Act, 1867 by 
totally affirming the principle of provincial autonomy, particularly 
for Quebec. He said, ``Our cause is the cause of our nation, the 
cause of provincial autonomy. It is the cause for which our fathers 
fought, the cause of patriots throughout history, the cause of those 
who do not want the province of Quebec to be a province in 
bondage, who want it to be self-governing in accordance with the 
wishes of its inhabitants. We do not want to hear our province 
referred to with disdain any longer. We wish to be masters of our 
destiny; we wish the voice of the majority to be heard and respected 
by all''.
<P>
	I should point out that premier Honoré Mercier governed with a 
two-party government, the Conservatives plus the Liberals, in a 
national unity government.
<P>
	In 1887, 20 years after Confederation, premier Honoré Mercier 
called a provincial conference in Quebec City .Although Sir John 
A. Macdonald, the Prime Minister of the day, refused to send a 
representative, the Quebec conference was a success. Twenty 
ministers, five premiers among them, affirmed the principle of the 
autonomy of  the provinces making up our confederation. They 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17569"> 17569 </A></B>
<P>
protested against the centralist approach of the government in 
Ottawa and that government's tendency to abuse its power of 
disallowance, as it still does today.
<P>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
	The conference was a milestone in Canada's political history in 
that it confirmed the political and constitutional rights of the 
provinces, thus reminding the central government of what should 
be the very essence of a confederation's constitution.
<P>
	Today, as the year 1995 draws to a close, what was said by 
Honoré Mercier, Premier of Quebec from 1887 to 1891, seems as 
topical as it was at the time.
<P>
	Bill C-110 takes us back to the sad realization that there are truly 
two solitudes, two peoples, two cultures, each with a completely 
different vision of Canada's future.
<P>
	On November 30, the Leader of the Opposition reminded the 
House of the disastrous impact of this bill, and I quote: ``This leads 
me to believe and shows us that Bill C-110, in fact, has a pernicious 
effect in that, since the Canadian Constitution is so complex and 
twisted in certain respects, this bill, and that is a paradox, will in no 
way solve the current problems, but will make it even more 
difficult to transfer the powers that the federal government might 
be willing to give to Quebec''.
<P>
	Quebec's demands for more powers have persisted since the 
beginning of Confederation. The post-referendum of promises the 
federal government appear in this bill, and this veto is just a lot of 
smoke and mirrors. A real veto should be in the Constitution and be 
binding on all parties concerned.
<P>
	The federal justice minister claimed that Bill C-110 was valid 
federal legislation, and I quote: ``Let me express my sincere 
conviction that Bill C-110 is valid federal legislation. It does not 
amend the Constitution in any way. Indeed, it is complementary to 
the constitutional amending provisions''.
<P>
	In its content, the bill remains silent about the manner in which 
the provinces will be able to express their position.
<P>
	This bill, which covers a scant two pages, merely indicates what 
the federal government means by a majority of the provinces. To 
the leader of the Bloc Quebecois and to most Quebecers, this 
proposal is a step backward, a proposal that offers far less than 
Meech Lake or even Charlottetown, which was rejected by Quebec. 
There has been a succession of offers from Ottawa, but the 
substance of those offers keep shrinking all the time so that in the 
end it is just a joke, according to the Leader of the Opposition.
<P>
	And what about the criticisms from the Reform Party? 
Reformers are against this bill because it would give a 
constitutional veto to Quebec's sovereignist government,  which 
should soon be led by the leader of the Bloc Quebecois. Which 
brings us back to square one, in that it is impossible to satisfy both 
English Canada and Quebecers.
<P>
	This vision of Canada compels us to stop these endless demands 
and deal with the real problems.
<P>
	Quebec sovereignty will bring about a new climate allowing us 
to negotiate as equals with the people of Canada. I submit to you 
that the people of Quebec cannot support Bill C-110. We are still 
waiting for real, valid offers from the Prime Minister of Canada, in 
keeping with the promises he made before the October 30 
referendum.
<P>
	I have been a sovereignist for over 30 years and I cannot be 
happy with a veto that is a mere legislative promise and a total 
improvisation. That is why I will vote against Bill C-110.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Waterloo, Lib.):</B> Madam Chair, it was 
less than two months ago, on October 30, when 50.6 per cent of 
Quebecers said no to separation and yes to Canada. The Canada 
votes would have been higher were it not for the fraudulent 
question, the fraudulent campaign and the questionable counting.

	The leader of the Canada campaign was Daniel Johnson and the 
leader of the separatist campaign was originally Jacques Parizeau. 
The leader of the Bloc Quebecois displaced Mr. Parizeau as the 
leader of the separatists and proceeded to conduct a campaign of 
deceit and mistruths.
<P>
	A week before the referendum the Canada side was 7 per cent 
behind in the polls, and the Prime Minister became highly active in 
the campaign. On October 24, to counter the winning campaign of 
the separatists, the Prime Minister promised at a rally in Verdun 
that changes would be made to recognize Quebec as a distinct 
society and to ensure that future constitutional change would 
require Quebec's approval. The Prime Minister's nationally 
televised address to the nation on October 25 helped mobilize 
Canadians from coast to coast to coast.
<P>
<B>(1345)</B>
<P>
	On October 27, more than 150,000 Canadians gathered in 
Montreal to express their love for Canada, a Canada that includes 
the province of Quebec. Among those at the rally, close to 600 were 
from my community. Had there been more buses available there 
would have been 2,000 people there. People from my community 
boarded buses at midnight on Thursday and did not get back home 
until midnight on Friday. They put their lives on hold for a day to 
go to Montreal to express their love for a Canada that includes 
Quebec.
<P>
	The 150,000 Canadians at the Montreal rally supported the 
Prime Minister's promise for change. They will be the guardians of 
that promise.

<P>
	On October 30, in spite of a fraudulent question, in spite of a 
fraudulent campaign, Canada won. The Prime Minister was 
instrumental in taking the pro-Canada side from a deficit of 7 per 
cent a week before the referendum to victory on referendum night.
<P>
	The separatists blamed their loss on money and ethnics, ignoring 
the 40 per cent of French Quebec that voted yes to Canada and no to 
separation. The leader of the Bloc Quebecois and future premier of 
Quebec has stated that he is not in favour of constitutional change. 
He wants a Quebec that is separate from Canada.
<P>
	The Prime Minister introduced a regional veto and distinct 
society clause through federal legislation, the only way he could 
keep his promise that there would be no constitutional change 
without Quebec's support. We approved the distinct society clause 
on Monday and will approve regional vetoes tomorrow.
<P>
	The Prime Minister has delivered on his promises. On Monday 
evening the House of Commons approved the distinct society 
clause. The Bloc Quebecois voted against it saying that it gave 
nothing to Quebec. The Reform Party voted against it saying it 
gave too much to Quebec. The leader of the Bloc Quebecois and the 
separatists have been historically consistent in opposing distinct 
society for Quebec as they worked for the failure of Meech Lake 
and the Charlottetown accord.
<P>
	The leader of the Reform Party and his followers have also 
opposed accommodating Quebec in Canada. While the Bloc 
Quebecois is trying to pull Quebec out of Canada, Reformers are 
trying to push Quebec out. The Reform Party aided and abetted the 
separatists before the referendum and is doing the same now.
<P>
	Reformers would be revisionist historians who would deny the 
Quebec Act of 1774 where the British Parliament recognized the 
French language, civil code and the distinct culture of Quebec. The 
reality is that the formation of Canada was a miracle based on the 
coming together of two of Europe's leading peoples, the French 
and the English, with the accommodation of the First Nations. 
Without this coming together we would likely be part of the United 
States.
<P>
	Our willingness to embrace a bilingual society is welcoming to 
new Canadians. We have evolved as a compassionate, humane and 
understanding country. Together we have built a country that the 
United Nations has judged on a number of occasions as the best 
country in the world in which to live. Canada is the country of 
choice of millions of would-be immigrants.
<P>
	When we examine the demographics of Canada, 22.8 per cent of 
Canadians are of French origin; 20.8 per cent are of British origin; 
1.7 per cent aboriginal and the remaining 54.7 per cent have roots 
in other countries, with half of those having multiple origins.
<P>
	Canada represents a beacon of hope in a troubled world. We have 
built a country that has its make-up from  the rest of the world. 
Canada is an example of civility and compassion, caring and 
sharing, tolerance and understanding.
<P>
	Canada welcomed my family after the Hungarian revolution in 
1957. We were refugees and Canada offered us refuge. My wife is a 
sixth generation Canadian whose roots go back to Ireland. My 
daughter is nine years old and all three of us are fiercely proud 
Canadians.
<P>
	When my family first arrived in Canada we lived for the first 
five years in Vancouver, B.C. I am acutely aware that B.C. looks on 
itself as a distinct region of Canada. The fact that the regional veto 
was extended to B.C. shows the flexibility of the government's 
approach.
<P>
	In the past 39 years I have had the opportunity to travel this 
country from coast to coast. I have watched the sunrise on Signal 
Hill St. John's, Newfoundland and have seen the sunset in Tofino 
on Vancouver Island. I have viewed the majesty of the Rockies and 
the vastness of the prairies, the wilds of northern Ontario and the 
beauty of the Great Lakes. For me the Gatineau hills, the St. 
Lawrence seaway, Isle d'Orleans, old Montreal, the Quebec winter 
festival give meaning to la belle province. I have enjoyed the 
quaintness of Prince Edward Island, the beauty of Nova Scotia and 
New Brunswick. I have much more to see and I am awestruck at the 
beauty of my country.
<P>
	Early this past October, a delegation from Waterloo, Quebec, 
visited Waterloo, Ontario, for a twinning ceremony. Bernard 
Provencher, mayor of Waterloo, Quebec, informed the people at the 
twinning ceremony: ``If by some magical way we could have all 
Quebecers experience the hospitality that we have experienced 
these last few days and do it in reverse and have Canadians outside 
Quebec visit Quebec then we would not even have this referendum 
on what we already own''.
<P>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
	The two mayors a couple of weeks later exchanged their flags in 
the Prime Minister's office and stated that they would fly the flags 
at their respective city halls in the hope that Canada would remain 
united. The two Waterloos are an example of how communities 
from across the country need to foster exchanges to promote 
goodwill and understanding among Canadians. Canada is a miracle 
we cannot take for granted. We must nurture it, build it and 
strengthen it.
<P>
	The distinct society recognition for Quebec which was passed by 
the House on Monday and the regional veto clause which will be 
passed tomorrow are federal laws, not constitutional amendments. 
Constitutional review must take place in 1997. It will be then that 
the federal government will review the Constitution with the 
provinces.
<P>
	Historically, constitutional change has been a point of division 
among Canadians. It was for this reason that the fathers of 
Confederation could not agree on a  constitutional amending 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17571"> 17571 </A></B>
<P>
formula when Canada was founded in 1867. Constitutional 
amendments tend to bring out regional grievances that test our 
mettle as a nation. It is easy for opposition members to criticize, as 
they can attack everything and be responsible for nothing.
<P>
	In putting forward the distinct society resolution and the regional 
veto we did not expect the separatists across the aisle to support it. 
They want to separate. They want to tear up Canada. Their leader, 
the Quebec premier in waiting, has already made it abundantly 
clear that no constitutional amendments will be acceptable to his 
government.
<P>
	The neo-separatist Reform Party does not want to support the 
government's initiative. The Reformers lust after official 
opposition status. They dream of forming a government in a 
Canada without Quebec. The Reformers helped the Bloc Quebecois 
before the referendum and they are helping them now.
<P>
	We believe the majority of Quebecers and the majority of 
Canadians will support the government's initiatives. Distinct 
society and the regional veto are issues that have to be dealt with 
quickly so the government can focus its attention on the economy 
and getting people back to work.
<P>
	Last week the media reported on a CROP poll conducted in 
Quebec. When Quebecers were asked directly whether the 
government should focus its attention on the economy or the 
Constitution, 86 per cent said the economy and only 10 per cent the 
Constitution. Four per cent had no response. Clearly, Canadians 
from Quebec and Canadians from the rest of Canada have a lot in 
common.
<P>
	In July 1982 Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau succeeded in 
giving Canadians their Constitution. He was assisted in his efforts 
by the present Prime Minister who was then the justice minister. 
They were both attacked for their accomplishments by the 
separatists who would tear Canada apart. Mr. Trudeau and the 
current Prime Minister are distinguished Quebecers who, during 
the quiet revolution, helped transform Quebec from a society 
dominated by Duplessis and the church into a modern society, but 
the separatists questioned their Quebec roots.
<P>
	The situation reminded me of Sir Wilfrid Laurier, our first 
French Canadian Prime Minister, who during the election of 1911 
set out the frustrations that beset him as he tried to follow the 
middle path in politics: ``I am branded in Quebec as a traitor of the 
French, and in Ontario as a traitor of the English. In Quebec I am 
branded as a jingo, and in Ontario as a separatist. In Quebec I am 
attacked as an imperialist, and Ontario as an anti-imperialist. I am 
neither. I am a Canadian''.
<P>
	Canada is an example to the world. It is made up of peoples from 
around the world who have together built a country which is the 
best in the world.
<P>
	Vive le Québec. Vive le Canada. Vive le Canada uni.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on 
behalf of the people of Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt and 
oppose Bill C-110, an act respecting constitutional amendments.
<P>
	My constituents are proud and eager to have me rise on their 
behalf to express the anger, outrage and fury over the insult which 
the Prime Minister and the Liberal Party of Canada have hurled at 
the Canadian people. The anger, outrage and fury is over the fact 
that Canadians do not think the federal government's power to veto 
constitutional changes should be delegated to provincial 
legislatures. The power to reject or ratify changes to the country's 
Constitution should be given to only one body, and that body 
should be the people of Canada. Over and over we on this side of 
the House and in the ranks of the Bloc Quebecois heard the 
members of Parliament from western Canada and Quebec yelling 
at the Liberals to listen to the people. The Liberals just do not 
listen.
<P>
<B>(1355)</B>
<P>
	The people of British Columbia, where I come from, are insulted 
by the antics of the Liberal Party under the dictatorship of the 
Prime Minister. One morning we wake up and find out that B.C. 
has not been given the power of veto like the other provinces by the 
Liberal Prime Minister. This comes right out of the blue. My 
constituency telephone was ringing off the wall. The mail and fax 
machine were working overtime and the people were asking what 
was going on.
<P>
	Then the Liberals start talking about four regions versus five 
regions. They are trying to convince Canadians how great a thing a 
veto is. The Liberals hope Canadians would not understand and the 
Liberals could hide the fact that they were not giving the people of 
Canada anything, nothing, zero.
<P>
	The Liberal Prime Minister became afraid of the people of B.C. 
like he is afraid of the people of Quebec and so another morning 
comes along. My constituents wake up and discover the Liberal 
Prime Minister from Quebec has given B.C. a veto. But it is too 
late. The people of B.C. saw what the Prime Minister did. He thinks 
so little of the people from western Canada and he thinks about 
Quebec, so he inadvertently insulted western Canadians and 
Canada's most western province.
<P>
	The people of western Canada know that in the Liberal's 
proposal under Bill C-110 and under the command of the Prime 
Minister the federal government is giving the leader of the Bloc 
Quebecois a consultation prize-no, it is not really a consultation 
because there was no consultation. It is a consolation prize for 
losing the Quebec referendum, a veto.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="17572"> 17572 </A></B>
<P>
	The Prime Minister could be called the Bob Barker of Canada. 
Quebec spun the wheel and lost but the Prime Minister turned to his 
deputy and said: ``Sheila, tell them what they've won''.
<P>
	It is unacceptable. The people in western Canada know that this 
is typical of Ottawa and the Prime Minister. Liberal prime minister 
or Tory prime minister, prime ministers from Quebec make it a 
habit to give things to Quebec: the CF-18s, military bases, the 
environmental secretariat, distinct society, all kinds of things. 
Western Canadians are used to this.
<P>
	The Prime Minister, because of his lack of understanding of what 
the people of Quebec want and are saying, brought the nation to the 
brink of disaster. Single-handedly he nearly smashed Canada to 
smithereens.
<P>
	Before the referendum in Quebec the Liberals were told to sit on 
their ham hands until further notice: ``Don't even talk about the 
referendum''. After months the Prime Minister allowed his caucus 
to discuss the Quebec referendum but only at the very last minute, 
within days of the people of Quebec taking their trip to the ballot 
box.
<P>
	Then the big mistake happens. The people of British Columbia 
are watching a pathetic speech by the Prime Minister in Verdun, 
Quebec one night. Verdun is a very cool place, especially for young 
people. As a matter of fact Montreal boasts the best night life 
anywhere in Canada. Unfortunately the Prime Minister got carried 
away. He forgot himself and he forgot his speech. He started to 
promise Quebec everything.
<P>
	I am sure the leader of the Bloc Quebecois was very upset. The 
Prime Minister on behalf of the Liberal Party of Canada started 
spewing forth a litany of gifts to the political elite, the rulers of 
Quebec, win, lose or draw. The people of British Columbia 
changed the channel on the television set because they could not 
watch it any more. They were insulted.
<P>
	The next day the people of B.C. got together and commenced a 
long journey. They have to remind the Liberal Party and the Prime 
Minister that they exist in British Columbia. They must not be 
angry or hurt. They have to be diplomatic. We tell the Liberals: 
``Don't give a veto to the provinces, territories, groups of 
provinces, premiers, separatist governments, foreign nations, the 
Ayatollah or anyone else. Give a veto to the Canadian people''. The 
people of Canada deserve a veto. The Liberals do not listen to 
Canadians.
<P>
	On behalf of the good people of 
Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, I am proud to stand here today 
and oppose Bill C-110.

	<B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of the legislative proposal of the Minister of the 
Environment for an endangered species act.
<P>
	In our diverse Confederation there is always a danger of 
government inaction simply because of the daunting prospect of 
complex, legal and political negotiations. To get things done 
someone has to have the nerve and energy to take a firm first step.
<P>
	In the case of over 250 endangered species that do not know or 
care in which jurisdiction they live, it is most appropriate the 
federal government take the lead.
<P>
	The minister has produced a detailed draft of an act that would 
protect endangered species. If necessary, I urge that she proceed 
alone with the legislation to the limit of her jurisdiction. However 
it is my hope that the provinces and territories will move quickly to 
join her.

	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ): </B>Mr. Speaker, last 
week, I had the honour and privilege of attending the sacred 
assembly presided by my colleague from Churchill. Although the 
themes of this assembly were reconciliation and spirituality, it 
reeked of politics.
<P>
	We were quite surprised to read in the hon. member for 
Churchill's letter of invitation and to hear in his opening speech 
that the Great Creator was in favour of Canadian unity. The Bloc 
Quebecois denounced this unacceptable statement on Saturday and 
wishes to do so again in this House today.
<P>
	The notion of spirituality transcends politics and the Great 
Creator has no use for national borders. The next step would have 
been to come straight out and say that the Creator is a Liberal.

registered voters in my riding were asked if a national referendum

Quebec should be recognized in the  Constitution as a distinct

society. In just two short days my constituents have rejected such 
recognition by a margin of 86 per cent. The survey will be ongoing 
until the end of December.
<P>
	It would appear that the days of government imposing its will on 
the people are drawing to a long overdue close and direct 
democracy will allow them to be heard.
<P>

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="NUCLEARDISARMAMENT">NUCLEAR DISARMAMENT</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
there is increasing concern among Canadians concerned about 
nuclear disarmament that the Canadian government, despite its 
official support of various treaties, is not as serious as Canadians 
want it to be about bringing an end to nuclear testing, about the 
proliferation of nuclear weapons and about the destruction of 
existing nuclear warheads.
<P>
	The post cold war era was to be an opportunity for the world to 
put behind it the fear of nuclear war. The public has been lulled into 
thinking that significant progress is being made.
<P>
	In reality, the nuclear club permits certain of its members like 
France and China to continue threatening the planet with nuclear 
testing. This same nuclear club, with which Canada is associated 
through NATO, also refuses to countenance the significant 
destruction or elimination of its nuclear capacity, thus encouraging 
other countries to seek such weapons.
<P>
	The doomsday clock is being advanced once more. The Liberals 
need to wake up and show some courage on the issue instead of 
speaking out of both sides of their mouth, saying one thing at the 
UN and another thing through NATO.

Harry Cavers.
<P>
	Mr. Cavers was born in St. Catharines in 1909. He practised law 
until joining the Royal Canadian Naval Volunteer Reserve in the 
second world war, rising from ordinary seaman to lieutenant. After 
the war Mr. Cavers practised law as a partner in Cavers, Chown and 
Cairns.
<P>
<B>(1405)</B>
<P>
	He was elected as the member of Parliament for Lincoln in 1949 
and again in 1953. He was the first Liberal elected in the area in 50 
years. He was an  effective representative of Lincoln for nine years 
and worked hard to make a difference for the area.
<P>
	Following his time in the House of Commons, Harry Cavers 
returned to the legal community as a judge for Dufferin County. A 
former law partner, Mr. Roy Cairns, has spoken of Harry's 
fair-mindedness and ability to see both sides of an issue.
<P>
	St. Catharines has lost an excellent ambassador and elder

	<B>Mr. Andy Mitchell (Parry Sound-Muskoka, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to address what I believe to be the essence of 
Canadianism. We are ten provinces, two territories, numerous 
municipalities and many neighbourhoods, but above all we are 
Canada.
<P>
	We are a nation that shares common values, a nation shaped by 
the challenges of nature, a nation forged by war but one that has 
fought for peace. We are people who have developed compassion 
and understanding for others in society. Most of all being Canadian 
means understanding that the issue is not whether we get a fair 
share of the pie but rather that the pie is shared fairly.
<P>
	If we are to survive as a nation, those blessed by economic 
advantage must be willing to help those areas not so fortunate. That 
is the way it should be. I am proud to live in a society that cares for 
the least advantaged and whose people share their good fortune 
with their fellow Canadians.

	<B>Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Middlesex, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, under the 1992 legislation there will be a review of the 
Bank Act in five years or in 1997.
<P>
	I have received many calls and briefs from insurance companies 
in my riding of Lambton-Middlesex that are very concerned, as I 
am, about the potential changes in the Bank Act that could give the 
very powerful banking sector the ability to retail insurance from its 
branches.
<P>
	While it is important to have a strong banking system in Canada, 
I do not believe it is right or fair to other sectors of the financial 
services industry to allow the most powerful sector, the banks, to 
accumulate strength which would likely turn into a virtual 
monopoly.

children have been killed, between four and five children crippled, 
and ten million psychologically scarred by the ravages of war over 
the past ten years.
<P>
	That is what UNICEF says in its 1996 report released yesterday. 
Various conflicts around the world have left in their wake some 
horrifying and monstrous scenes in which children are all too often 
the victims.
<P>
	Confronted with this sad finding, Western countries, including 
Canada, are forced to give serious thought to their moral 
obligations. For example, UNICEF does not hesitate to blame this 
sad situation in part on antipersonnel mines.
<P>
	Yet Canada remains reluctant to dispose of its own mines as long 
as the other countries have not done so.
<P>
	In the name of these children who are war victims, Canada 
should lead the way in eliminating these weapons of suffering.

when Canada is overburdened with old ideas and old institutions 
the government has come forward with far reaching, regressive 
veto legislation that will etch in stone for all time parliamentary 
anachronisms such as the current Senate.
<P>
	The Prime Minister's outdated, outmoded, traditional political 
practice of stuffing that institution with patronage appointments 
has loaded this powerful unelected body with partisan failures, 
flatterers and pleaders of special interests.
<P>
	Tomorrow I will be introducing my private member's bill that 
will give electors of a province a vote on who should be summoned 
to represent them in that chamber. It is absolutely vital that we 
remove porky patronage appointments from the Prime Minister's 
paws, if we are to have any true legitimacy in Canada's upper 
house.

Association of Ontario. This association represents over 8,000 
licensed brokers plus support staff employed in over 1,100 offices 
contributing to local economies throughout Ontario.
<P>
	These small business people have valid concerns about the 
possibility of chartered banks being permitted to aggressively enter 
the insurance business. On the surface it may appear to be just two 
industries in competition over a business segment, but it is much 
more than that. It is about the survival of many hundreds of small 
insurance brokerage firms. It is about the survival of thousands of 
Canadian jobs.
<P>
	I implore the government not to alter the 1992 legislation which 
is working very effectively. The banks are raking in record profits. 
They have moved in on the brokerage industry. Now they want to 
move in on the insurance industry. What is next? It is time the little

	<B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Vaudreuil, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Conservative leader was quoted in the December 4 edition of <I>Le 
Journal de Montréal</I> as saying: ``The Progressive Conservative 
Party will support the government motion recognizing Quebec as a 
distinct society within Canada. This is a necessary first step in 
recognizing Quebec's identity within our federation''.
<P>
	However, the day after our government passed this important 
motion in favour of Quebec, it is with sadness that the people of 
Quebec have realized that not all the federalist allies they were 
counting on were on board.
<P>
	After so much energy was spent on having Quebec's distinct 
identity recognized when the Progressive Conservative Party was 
in office, it is a pity that not one Conservative member took part in 
the whole debate on this issue in this House.
<P>
	They could have joined us in taking this major step toward 
recognizing Quebec within our federation, as the Conservative 
leader did enthusiastically throughout the referendum campaign.

	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Quebec's rural regions voted yes in the October 30 referendum. 
Following that, the federal Minister of Agriculture showed up at 
the UPA congress and said that he got the message. This is quite the 
change, considering that the last federal budget dealt a direct blow 
to the agricultural sector.
<P>
	Producers are asking that Quebec's programs not be tampered 
with, and that federal spending in the agricultural sector be spread 
fairly. The minister has his work all cut out, given that he only 
spends 10 per cent of his budget in Quebec, that he still managed to 
close three research centres in the province, including the one in La 
Pocatière, and that he also reduced dairy subsidies by 30 per cent.
<P>
	I do not know what gimmick the minister will use to try to prove 
that Ottawa looks after Quebec's agricultural interests. But I do 
know that the facts speak for themselves and that agricultural 
producers are not dumb.

statement is about this high powered committee consisting of the 
collections commissioner, parole board chairmen, deputy ministers 
of justice and  the solicitor general's department. They feel there 
are problems, and these are some of the reasons.
<P>
	They say that sentences are longer. Is that a problem? They also 
say that there are more challenging prisoners, the criminally 
challenged; increased periods of detention; a growing lifer group; 
an aging prison society; declining parole grant rates; and the 
toughening of laws.
<P>
<B>(1415)</B>
<P>
	Perhaps I can help the Liberal government. Why not look for 
new ways of doing things? Why not look at privatization of a 
couple of the prisons? What is wrong with double bunking? Why 
not restrict some of the ridiculous benefits like golf, project bleach, 
GST rebates for prisoners, prisoner's ability to sue and the ability 
to refuse work?
<P>
	If the government does not like that, resign and let someone else 
with new ideas and courage take over.

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ): </B>Mr. Speaker, yesterday, 
on the very day the government was boasting of having met its 
referendum promises by a simple inconsequential resolution on the 
distinct society, the Prime Minister was busy making unacceptable 
and antidemocratic statements, claiming that he reserved the right 
to use any means available to prevent another Quebec referendum.
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister. Now that he realizes that 
his phoney offers do not satisfy Quebecers, and since he plans to 
use all means available to prevent another Quebec referendum, are 
we to take the Prime Minister's words to mean that the only hope 
remaining to him for winning the next referendum is to make up 
the rules himself?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the contradiction is immediately obvious. The hon. 
member says that I want to prevent a referendum, and then he 
refers to what I will do to win it. Either there will be a referendum 
or there will be none.
<P>
	What I said yesterday is that we want a clear question. That is 
what democracy is all about. We do not need the Bloc to give us 
any lessons in democracy. As Michel Vastel said not too long ago, 
``The Bloc is a hereditary monarchy. When it comes down to it, 
eight people, six men and two women, decided how their leader 
would be chosen, eight people representing 0.007619 per cent of 
the total Bloc membership of 105,000''.
<P>
	We need no lessons in democracy from a party accused of all 
manner of funny business in the last Quebec referendum.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, since the 
Prime Minister wants to play it that way, I may remind him that he 
and his cabinet ministers were guilty of violating the Quebec 
Elections Act. To talk about democracy and refuse to recognize the 
results of a democratic vote is really pushing it.
<P>
	The Prime Minister stated yesterday that 2.5 million citizens 
should not be allowed to determine the future of a country with a 
population of 30 million. Does this mean he denies the Quebec 
people the fundamental and inalienable right to determine their 
future?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, they have already done so twice. There have been two 
referendums in Canada in which Quebecers decided to vote in 
Canada.
<P>
	All I said yesterday was that the rest of the country has a say in 
the future of that country. We have twice accepted the results of a 
referendum in Quebec, and democracy is being denied by those 
who refuse to take no for an answer.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
surprised that a politician of the Prime Minister's stature does not 
understand one cannot stop a people on their way to becoming 
economically independent.
<P>
	How can the Prime Minister expect Quebecers to believe him 
when he says he kept the solemn commitments he made during the 
referendum campaign, when he changes his tune in English Canada 
and refers to his own commitments as three little promises of no 
consequence?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the promises I made go back a long way. Unlike the Bloc 
Quebecois, I voted for Charlottetown and for the distinct society. 
They voted against it. Since 1970, I have supported veto rights and 
the Victoria formula. That has always been the position of my 
party. In fact, I was merely confirming what our party has 
supported for a long time.
<P>
	And talking about democracy, again their leader said on 
television a few days ago that they were going to take everyone by 
surprise. And when he was asked: ``Do you intend to ask an honest 
question''? He said: ``No, I will ask a winning question''.
<P>
	The only way to win honestly is to have an honest question, a 
question that everyone understands. In this way, there can be no 
confusion about the result.

	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Paul Tellier has threatened to close the firm AMF in 
Montreal, if the union refuses to accept the conditions imposed by 
CN. The union and GEC Alsthom, the company trying to buy AMF, 
have almost reached an agreement, but CN is blocking any 
initiative that might lead to a settlement. At stake, let us not forget, 
are 1,300 direct jobs and 5,000 indirect jobs in southwest Montreal.
<P>
	In view of the fact that CN's attitude in this matter could end up 
costing Montreal 6,300 jobs, does the Minister of Finance, 
responsible for regional development in Quebec, intend to 
intervene in this matter of importance to Montreal, the southwest 
part of Montreal, in his area, near his riding? Will he bring CN back 
to its senses?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17577"> 17577 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my hon. colleague knows that the CN is now in the private 
sector. We have, however, been trying for months to find a solution 
for AMF. The CN had agreed to keep the plant open. Negotiations 
have been very long and hard, but I am confident, given the 
employees' attitude at the moment, that we will reach a solution.
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
	We will follow this very closely. I know that my colleagues for 
the greater Montreal area are very interested in this. So are we. I 
hope that, at the last minute, all those involved in this matter will 
understand the importance, as the hon. member has mentioned, of 
keeping the plant in operation with all the jobs involved.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, since the federal policy on rail transport has always 
favoured western Canada, will the federal government, for once, 
make CN listen to reason or will it turn a blind eye?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh!
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> We will wait-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> They do not like the truth.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Laurier-Sainte-Marie may 
continue with his question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> I therefore ask the Minister of Finance, who is 
responsible for Montreal's regional development, if he is still 
responsible for it or if that is only one of his titles? Will he let 
Montreal lose 6,300 direct and indirect jobs to Winnipeg?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there has never been any question of the jobs of AMF 
going anywhere else but where they are.
<P>
	The question we have been trying to address now for several 
years, as the hon. member should know, is whether through 
co-operation between Canadian National, GEC Alsthom and the 
employees we can keep an operation going in Quebec that has 
between 600 and 1,300 employees, depending on the level of 
demand within the shop.
<P>
	The hon. member would be far better advised if he spent his 
efforts trying to convince the parties to arrive at an agreement 
rather than raising the spectre of the jobs going somewhere else. If 
the jobs are not kept in Montreal at AMF by GEC Alsthom and by 
CNR they will not be going anywhere else, they will disappear. 
That would be very unfortunate for Montreal, for Quebec and for 
Canada.

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, last night the Prime Minister talked about  another Quebec 
referendum after saying he would not talk about another Quebec 
referendum. He went on to say: ``The Constitution has a lot of 
powers for the federal government to act under peace, order and 
good government. We have powers and we have to use the powers 
to make sure the question in the next referendum will be fair to 
Quebecers and will be fair to the rest of the country''.
<P>
	Precisely what powers under peace, order and good government 
was the Prime Minister referring to? Precisely how does he plan to 
use those to ensure a clear question in the next referendum?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is very important to have a fair and honest question if 
there is another referendum.
<P>
	I do not want to speculate on when there will be another 
referendum because the leader of the Bloc Quebecois said that 
when he goes to Quebec his priority will be to run a good 
government and put the province's finances in order. If he wants to 
do that we will help because we want Quebec to have a good 
economy.
<P>
	However, I said that if there is another referendum the question 
has to be clear. We will not accept any more ambiguity and we will 
take the necessary steps to achieve that goal.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we have heard all that. However, my question was what 
powers under peace, order and good government does the federal 
government propose to use to affect the question in the next 
referendum?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, he can consult his lawyers. We know what to do.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister got into this discussion by talking 
about the uncertainty another Quebec referendum would create. 
These types of comments, saying the federal government has 
powers to do something about that referendum, and then refusing to 
explain how and what powers it will use add to the confusion.
<P>
<B>(1430 )</B>
<P>
	I will ask the Prime Minister again: If he knows what he is 
talking about, how does he propose to use federal powers to effect 
the fairness of the next Quebec referendum?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, last week the Reform Party had a plan with 20 different 
points to deal with that.
<P>
	The question was asked of me and I said that the question of a 
referendum, if there is another one, is not only for the people of 
Quebec to vote on, it is a question for all the people of Canada. I 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17578"> 17578 </A></B>
<P>
said that very clearly. I said that there are means available to the 
federal government-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> Mr. Speaker, they are always 
asking political questions.
<P>
	I said that the federal government has the obligation and the duty 
to the people who are going to vote to ensure that the question is 
clear. We will use the power we have to achieve that goal. Do not 
worry about that.

	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	Despite the Prime Minister's promise to completely withdraw 
from manpower training, the UI reform package tabled 10 days ago 
would introduce five new labour programs. Faced with this 
announcement, the National Assembly unanimously reaffirmed the 
Quebec consensus on the need to transfer all federal manpower 
programs to Quebec.
<P>
	With the Minister of Human Resources Development scheduled 
to meet his Quebec counterpart tomorrow to discuss the issue of 
transferring manpower programs, can the Prime Minister tell us if 
his minister will have the mandate to discuss the transfer of all 
manpower matters to Quebec, without conditions or national 
standards, as provided for in the Quebec National Assembly's 
unanimous resolution?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member knows that 
the primary mandate of all government ministers is to help people 
get back to work, to provide jobs, employment opportunities and to 
work closely with the provinces, the municipalities, the private 
sector and all individuals who can be our partners in achieving that 
mandate.
<P>
	The Prime Minister made it very clear in his statement that we 
are withdrawing from the area of manpower training. In the 
legislation we made it clear that we will be working with the 
provinces to gain their consent on any measures which would in 
any way be involved in training. We will work in concert with them 
as much as possible to develop effective employment measures and 
partnerships for employment.
<P>
	I am very pleased to have the initial round of exploratory 
meetings with Quebec's minister of employment so that we can 
clarify exactly what is in the bill. Clearly, the Quebec government 
does not fully understand all the measures, just as the hon. member 
does not. I look forward to the opportunity to begin a process of 
good dialogue and good discussion so we can work jointly to help 
Canadians become employed.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, from the 
minister's comments, I understand that he will continue to decide 
which agreements he can sign and negotiate.
<P>
	Since the distinct society motion tabled by the government is 
supposed to mean something, can the Prime Minister tell us if his 
Minister of Human Resources Development has received a 
mandate to make a distinct proposal to Quebec, which has the 
largest consensus on the need to transfer responsibility for all 
manpower issues?
<P>

<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is seemingly odd and 
strange that the hon. member for Mercier would be citing the 
decision by this Parliament to support distinct society when the 
hon. member voted against the bill. It seems to me that the hon. 
member cannot have it both ways. She cannot be telling us that we 
have to respect distinct society when she does not have the 
goodwill and the resolution to vote for distinct society for 
Quebecers.

occur by providing clear answers to the questions that are being

	Let me come at it another way. Last month in Toronto the Prime 
Minister said that he did not want any more referenda and implied 
that he would use the federal power to prevent future referenda. 
Last night he conceded that there will be another referendum. He 
said that he is going to use the federal power to ensure that it is a

another referendum, or is he proposing to use the federal power to 
ensure that the next referendum is more fair? Which is it, one way 
or the other?

<B>(1440 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr.

Quebec and try to provide good government.

	If they were to provide good governance in Quebec, of course 
the rest of Canada would be very happy and we would help them.

<P>
	Yesterday, the Minister of Health made her intentions known 
regarding advertising and sponsoring by tobacco companies. 
Contrary to all expectations, the minister's plan will considerably 
exceed the scope of the legislation that the Supreme Court 
invalidated just three months ago.
<P>

is pushing cigarette manufacturers to put an end to their voluntary 
moratorium on advertising and to resume advertising tobacco 
products without any constraints?
<P>

when I met with tobacco company officials not too long ago, before 
making this announcement, they told me they were preparing to 
start advertising again as of January. So, there was going to be 
advertising one way or another.
<P>
	We definitely want to exercise control over this advertising 
because, as you know, cigarettes are harmful to the health of 
Canadians. Companies are always looking for new customers and 
these are often young people just taking up smoking. We will make 
every effort to prevent young people from starting to smoke, and 
this is a step in the right direction.

	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	Given the Prime Minister's answers to our questions and to those 
of the Reform Party leader, we realize that he does not know how to 
stop the constitutional circus that he put on the road a few weeks 
ago. Six weeks ago, according to the Prime Minister, Quebec was 
his homeland. One week ago, Quebec no longer had a culture and, 
since yesterday, it is no longer entitled to democracy.
<P>
	Are we to understand that, in order to save his skin in the rest of 
Canada, the Prime Minister is prepared to do anything, even to 
threaten Quebecers with using everything within his power to keep 
them from achieving sovereignty?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is not very complicated. I simply asked the Bloc 
Quebecois and the Parti Quebecois to be honest and to say that they 
want to separate from the rest of Canada, pure and simple. They 
have the answer.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> The Bloc Quebecois is very honest.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Dear colleagues, I ask you to choose your words 
very carefully. We should never question honesty in this House. 
Therefore, I would appreciate it if members would using that word 
during question period, with the connotation given to it today.
<P>
	As you know, some words tend to trigger a strong reaction. 
Consequently, I ask the Right Hon. Prime Minister to avoid using 
the word honesty with that connotation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> Mr. Speaker, I said that they 
should ask a clear and honest question. They will be the ones 
asking the question. All we want is a very clear question, and not 
one that tries to include all sorts of conditions to get people 
confused to the point where they do not know whether they are 
voting for or against separation. All we want is a clear question. If 
they want a suggestion, here is one: ``Do you want to separate from 
Canada?'' This is very clear and everyone will understand. There 
will be no problem. However, they know that they will lose if they 
ask a question like this one.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, should the hard line towards Quebec announced yesterday 
by the Prime Minister not be seen as a metaphor for his entire 
career, in other words, as consolidating his base in Canada while 
trying to crush Quebecers?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The question in and of itself is giving motive to 
why one person is acting one way or another. A question should be 
straightforward rather than asking or implying motive.
<P>
	The question as it is stated is out of order. If the right hon. Prime 
Minister wants to answer it, fine; if not I pass from there.
<P>
[Translation] 
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will reply, because they do that all the time. If you 
happen to be from Quebec and you believe that Quebec's future is 
within Canada, they brand you as a traitor, but the fact is that 
French was able to survive in North America because of Canada.

	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, recently the dollar went down and the interest rate went up 
substantially. This is not exactly a ringing endorsement of the 
finance minister's proud announcement that his deficit elimination 
plan is on track.
<P>
	Will the minister admit that drifting targets are not enough, that 
overspending $4 million an hour is too much and that markets and 
future generations of Canadians want him to do better like, for 
example, the eight provinces whose finance ministers he will meet 
tonight?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member 
knows full well the reasons for the volatility in Canadian currency 
markets in terms of interest rates has an enormous amount to do 
with speculation of what action the Fed is going to take and what 
action a number of the European central banks is going to take. The 
hon. member knows it.
<P>
	It is a tribute to the budgetary action taken by the government 
that the spread between Canadian interest rates has narrowed as 
much as it has.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the provincial finance ministers are complaining, with 
much justification, that the  government has cut them more than it 
has cut

<B><A NAME="17581"> 17581 </A></B>
<P>
other federal spending. This is a typical Liberal approach to dealing 
with problems. Shift the burden, let someone else take the blame.
<P>
	Will the minister cut other federal spending more, not just to 
restore harmony with his provincial counterparts but also to send 
the right signals to capital markets?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, when reductions in 
transfers to the provinces by the government were made, unlike 
previous governments there was a lengthy period of notice given. 
The fact is that we cut the provinces less than we cut ourselves. It 
was less than 2 per cent of provincial revenues.
<P>
	If the hon. member will take a look at the Fiscal Monitor which 
came out today he will notice that program spending by the 
government is down and transfers to the provinces are up.

program Revenue Canada's responsibilities are to calculate the 
amount of each benefit, maintain each account and respond to 
inquiries.
<P>
	Revenue Canada now has the added responsibility of 
determining who is entitled to the benefit. Can the minister explain 
to the House how this change has improved the child tax benefit 
program?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, before I respond to the question may I thank the hon. 
member for her consistent endorsement and championship of the 
problems and rights of children.
<P>
	In response to her question, the integration of the program in one 
department is allowing us to maximize the efficiency and to 
improve our client services in a number of ways: first, by 
processing the child tax benefit applications at one stage instead of 
as was formerly the case; second, by eliminating the duplication of 
databases and the weekly transfers of information that previously 
took place between two departments; third, by simply reducing 
program costs and finally, by providing clients with a single point 
of contact.

	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, a 
minute ago the finance minister made the absurd statement that 
somehow the government has cut more of its spending than it has 
cut transfers to the provinces. I point out that it did back flips to 
preserve Liberal pensions and the finance minister led the charge in 
that whole argument.
<P>
	The people who have been showing leadership in the country are 
those in the provincial governments. The only leadership this 
minister has shown is in defending his interests.
<P>
	Will the finance minister commit to taking a page from the book 
of the provinces? Will he balance the budget and will he hold out 
the hope of tax relief for ordinary Canadians who actually pay 
taxes?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, surely there ought to 
be some connection between the preamble to the question and the 
question itself.
<P>
	The hon. member knows that the government's objectives are to 
eliminate the deficit. It has pursued a  very clear track of deficit 
elimination. It has bettered its targets every time, which is the first 
time in a long while that that has happened in this country's history. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17582"> 17582 </A></B>
<P>
It is focused on the preservation of social programs and on job 
creation.
<P>
	The government is not going to throw the fabric of the country 
away because of any narrow fiscal ideology as expressed by the 
members opposite.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the fact 
is job creation has stalled in the country. The fact is the government 
is being forced to cut into social programs because the interest on 
the debt is undermining those programs. The fact is that the 
provinces are leading the way.
<P>
	Will the Minister of Finance take a leadership role for a change, 
go to the conference today and tell the provinces that he is going to 
undertake to do what they have done and begin the process of 
balancing the budget. Will he ultimately hold out some hope to 
Canadians that there will be some tax relief, not in the 21st century 
but in this century?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the history of the last 
decade in this country and its deficit projections have been one of 
missed target after missed target.
<P>
	Since the government took office, not only has it hit the targets, 
but it has bettered them. That is very clear. Rounding off the 
numbers, when the present government took office the deficit was 
at 6 per cent of GDP. Then it went down to 5 per cent, next 4 per 
cent, then 3 per cent and then 2 per cent. That is a pretty clear track 
and we are going to take it all the way to zero.

	The House resumed consideration of Bill C-110, an act 
respecting constitutional amendments, as reported (without 
amendment) from the committee; and of Motions Nos. 1 and 2.
<P>
<B>(1510 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Audrey McLaughlin (Yukon, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
to speak on Bill C-110, part of the unity package by the Liberal 
government and the Prime Minister, which appears has created 
more disunity than any recent package.
<P>
	As minister Petter from British Columbia recently said, it not 
only fails to promote national unity but it has impaired national 
unity, a position with which I heartily agree.
<P>
	In the north, in particular Yukon and Northwest Territories, and I 
hope my colleagues from Western Arctic and Nunatsiaq will speak 
up on this issue, this bill will make it even more difficult for the 
creation of new provinces. I find it difficult to understand why 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17584"> 17584 </A></B>
<P>
those two  important members of the Liberal government would 
not be speaking out strongly against this proposal.
<P>
	The west, as we know, feels alienated. Quebec says no. Clearly 
this bill is not creating unity. As has been said recently, when you 
have painted yourself into a corner, you walk out on the paint. The 
Prime Minister has really walked out on the paint in this case. The 
footprints are causing reverberations right across Canada. They are 
not reverberations of unity but of discontent with the actions of the 
government prior to the referendum in Quebec and with its actions 
to address issues since then.
<P>
	I will talk about three issues: the purpose of this bill, the process 
surrounding this bill and the other two aspects of this package, and 
the content. As good New Democrats always do, I will give some 
specific suggestions to what should be done with this bill.
<P>
	I have listened very carefully to various members who spoke 
before committee, in particular the Minister of Justice, about why 
it was important to have this bill. I am left wondering whether there 
has been someone out there hiding behind a rock, excuse the 
expression, waiting to leap out and spring some kind of 
constitutional proposal on us that somehow the federal government 
has to be protected against and enshrined in legislation such as Bill 
C-110 so it will know what to do. Maybe that is one purpose, but it 
was something that was certainly a surprise to most of us.
<P>
	Bill C-110 instructs the government on how it will use its power 
to accept or not accept constitutional amendments. It does not 
change the Constitution. Therefore that was obviously not the 
purpose of the bill.
<P>
	The leader of the Liberal Party in Yukon, always with 
constructive comment, said in the Whitehorse <I>Start</I> of December 5 
that the Prime Minister is trying to fulfil his promise of coming up 
with a plan that will satisfy the people of Quebec. He clearly has 
not done that.
<P>
	What could be the other purpose? The Minister of Justice said in 
committee hearings: ``This bill is just a bridge to the April 1997 
constitutional conference on the amending formula. It can be 
changed. It is just in place temporarily''. Again, we have to ask 
why. If it is there temporarily, it is satisfies no one, what is the real 
purpose?
<P>
	The leader of the New Democratic Party, Alexa McDonough, 
called this constitutional package a fly by the seat of its pants 
response to yesterday's polls and today's editorials. That about 
sums up the purpose of this package, in particular this piece of 
legislation under discussion today.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice said in terms of purpose that Quebec is 
acting and so we have to act. I guess by that sense of logic if 
someone decides to leap off a building, they will decide to leap off 
a building. There does not seem to be any comprehensive reason 
for this package other than for the Prime Minister to save face. He 
has  not succeeded. It is a heck of a way to run a country if the 
government and the Prime Minister are simply putting proposals 
forward to keep a promise. These proposals do not keep that 
promise and they alienate not only the province to which they are 
destined but the other provinces and territories.
<P>
<B>(1515 )</B>
<P>
	What about the process? There was no consultation with 
provinces, territories or aboriginal people. Apparently there was no 
obvious consultation even with members from British Columbia on 
the Liberal side.
<P>
	It is fair to say that the process generally in place for 
constitutional discussions was totally circumvented. Those of us 
who have been a part of many constitutional endeavours in the 
House know how difficult it is and are empathetic to it. However, 
no process is not a substitute. No process is no democracy. That 
cannot be the essence and principle on which constitutional change 
is made.
<P>
	The Prime Minister said that he responded to British Columbia, 
that it would now have the veto it requested. He added in a recent 
television interview that he knew the country well and had 
travelled it for 32 years. If the Prime Minister knows the country 
and the people so well, why does he not listen beforehand rather 
than act in an ad hoc manner?
<P>
	I have to say, because I want to be fair to the government, that 
there was not a complete lack of consultation. In the same article of 
December 5 in the <I>Whitehorse Star</I> the president of the federal 
Liberal association is quoted as saying that she received calls from 
the prime minister's office and was reassured that changes would 
not be a hindrance to Yukon. The president went on to say that she 
felt very reassured after speaking with officials from Ottawa.
<P>
	I would only say: ``It should be so easy''. If we have Canadians 
and members of the Liberal Party in other parts of the country who 
simply by making a phone call to Ottawa can be reassured by the 
Liberal government that everything they are doing is fine and there 
is no worry, I have to say we are in big trouble.
<P>
	To the people of Yukon and elsewhere I say that a simple 
reassurance will not do it. It has not done so in this package. It has 
not done so in Bill C-110. Clearly the Minister of Justice has 
difficulty defining for Canadians and members of the House what 
purpose it will actually serve. The process was clearly not 
respected in any way in the development of the legislation.
<P>
	In terms of process, the Liberal Party brought in closure on 
debate. It is something we have great difficulty with because we 
feel in a democratic system everyone should have an opportunity to 
speak. Although my party and I did not support closure, in this case 
I suppose the Liberals are only talking to themselves anyway. We 
have to wonder how serious that will be.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17585"> 17585 </A></B>
<P>
	Now I will refer to the content. How does Bill C-110 relate to 
section 38 of the Constitution? That is the real question. Section 38 
talks about the amending formula of seven provinces with 50 per 
cent of the population. This legislation would require over 80 per 
cent of the population to make change. It is clearly a very different 
intent from the actual Constitution.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice says that it does not matter, that it is only 
temporary. Again I ask if there is someone out there lurking, 
wishing to spring something on us, from which we have to be 
protected. Why can we not have a process that people are involved 
in, with full consultation involving all the provinces, territories and 
aboriginal people?
<P>
	We ask whether the formula being proposed under Bill C-110 
will be the position of the federal government in the talks in April 
1997 on the Constitution and the amending formula. The 
government has been very unclear about that and has not 
committed at all to what it will do.
<P>
	In the generosity of spirit for which my party is known I should 
like to make some recommendations. The first one is to withdraw 
the bill. It is ill advised. It is not achieving any objective. The 
process has been illegitimate and the content does not address the 
real issues of Canadians today.
<P>
	The second one is to undertake consultations with the provinces, 
the territories and the aboriginal people to reach a consensus.
<P>
<B>(1520)</B>
<P>
	The third and most important one is if the bill is simply for the 
Prime Minister to save face and to be seen to keeping his promises, 
he should keep his promises and create jobs. Last month 44,000 
Canadians lost their jobs. If the Prime Minister wants to keep his 
promises, he should create jobs and help the youth to participate in 
the economy. The participation rate of youth in our economy is the 
lowest in 20 years. He should put in place the 50,000 child care 
spaces promised by the Liberal Party and ensure cash transfers are 
maintained so that the national health care system is preserved.
<P>
	In other words, unity will be achieved by what we do to ensure 
economic security, safe communities and the rights of Canadian 
citizenship, which surely must mean good health care, jobs, 
security for the elderly and the eradication of child poverty. Instead 
of trying to devise formulas for 50 ways to say no, the Prime 
Minister must create unity by creating a country in which every 
Canadian wants to say yes.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is with 
considerable interest that I rise this afternoon to speak to Bill C-110 
concerning a veto for Quebec.
<P>
	You are aware that, during the referendum, the Prime Minister 
spoke of major change and promises. What is odd, immediately 
after the referendum, is that the Prime Minister is saying he made 
little promises and that he has just acted on his little promises.
<P>
	As regards Quebec's veto and the concept of distinct society, it 
would be a good idea perhaps to remember the people of Quebec 
have a motto, which is: ``Je me souviens'', or ``I remember''. We 
often have to remind the Prime Minister of Canada, a Quebecer 
himself, to remember a little bit of Quebec's history. We must also 
remind Quebecers that they have a history that they must never 
forget.
<P>
	Quebecers have been demanding their rights and privileges since 
Confederation, when they were misled. This Confederation was 
decided on without Quebecers being asked for their opinion, 
without a referendum, probably with the help of a few Quebecers 
who were richly rewarded afterwards. Between 1936 and 1940, Mr. 
Duplessis was already saying that, of course, Quebec had to 
``repatriate its booty''. The Union nationale, a party of Quebec 
nationalists, was created as early as 1936. Mr. Duplessis managed 
to stay in power for almost 20 years by repeating that the federal 
government must not be allowed to encroach on Quebec's 
jurisdiction. Then, in the 1960s, Mr. Lesage was elected by talking 
about being ``Masters in our own house''.
<P>
	You must remember that these slogans were very important; Mr. 
Lesage, a former deputy minister in Ottawa, came to Quebec City 
after realizing that Quebec was being taken for a ride. He led the 
Liberal Party to power with a slogan that went like this: ``Masters 
in our own house''. A little later, Mr. Johnson senior became 
Premier as leader of the Union nationale by calling for ``Equality or 
independence''. In 1976, Mr. Lévesque won the election on a 
sovereignty-association platform. As you can see, this is nothing 
new.
<P>
<B>(1525)</B>
<P>
	I wish to remind him today that this is nothing new and that the 
Parti Quebecois and the Bloc Quebecois are not the only forces 
behind the recent referendum. It has a long history. In 1980, Mr. 
Lévesque lost his referendum because of Mr. Trudeau's promises 
that they would patriate the Constitution and amend it in line with 
Quebecers' legitimate needs.
<P>
	Again, this promise was not kept, since the Constitution was 
patriated and amended without Quebec's consent. This is 
somewhat reminiscent of the Prime Minister's promises in the last 
referendum.
<P>
	I was elected here for the first time in 1984 with a mandate for 
national reconciliation. We wanted to reconcile all that. From early 
1985 all the way up to 1987, we worked very hard on what was 
called the Meech Lake project, which met with the provincial 
premiers' approval in 1987. But since it had been decided that the  
consent of seven provinces representing 50 per cent of the popula-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17586"> 17586 </A></B>
<P>
tion was required to amend the Constitution, consent had to be 
sought. The provinces were given three years to approve the 
agreement signed by the premiers in 1987.
<P>
	You will recall that, in 1990, the Meech Lake accord was 
rejected, by English Canada in particular, once again with the 
support of the current Prime Minister, who made every effort to 
have it fail, in co-operation with premier Wells of Newfoundland 
and Ms. Carstairs, who was leader of the Liberal Party in 
Saskatchewan at the time and has since been appointed to the 
Senate. She was rewarded for doing that.
<P>
	All this to show that, once again, the current Prime Minister was 
against it, because his only goal at the time was to become the next 
Prime Minister of Canada. He made every effort to ensure that the 
Meech Lake project fail because, had it worked, it would has been 
to the credit of the Conservatives. Since they could not allow that to 
be, the current Prime Minister, then preparing to become the leader 
of the Liberal Party, did his best to have this project fail, so that he 
could have a chance of becoming the Prime Minister of Canada. 
That is what we must bear in mind.
<P>
	When the Meech Lake accord failed, they panicked, so to speak, 
wondering what to do. That is when the commissions started, the 
Castonguay-Dobbie commission and all the others. There was also 
Keith Spicer's travelling commission. That cost us millions. At the 
same time, Quebec got into the act and established the 
Bélanger-Campeau commission. That was the most serious 
exercise ever conducted in Quebec since Confederation.
<P>
	More than 600 briefs were submitted to the commission. Over 
200 witnesses were heard, and 55 experts were hired by the Quebec 
Liberal government of the time. The commission came to the 
conclusion that, to thrive and grow, while also preserving its 
culture and its language, Quebec needed greater powers, more than 
20 real powers, to achieve its destiny as a nation.
<P>
	During that period, as I mentioned earlier, the 
Castonguay-Dobbie and Spicer federal commissions were working 
on a project called the Charlottetown proposal. A referendum was 
held in 1992 and, unfortunately, the project was still not quite 
complete. It was called a draft and it was truly that.
<P>
<B>(1530)</B>
<P>
	In spite of all that, English Canada turned down the proposal 
because it felt that Quebecers would be getting too much. As for 
Quebecers, they felt that they would not get enough. So, everybody 
voted against the proposal, though not for the same reasons.
<P>
	As you can see, it is not possible to reach an agreement. There 
are two irreconcilable views in this country that must be 
acknowledged. Following that  referendum, Quebecers elected a 
sovereignist federal party, the Bloc Quebecois, in 1993. Out of 75 
MPs, they sent 53 Bloc members to Ottawa. Let us not forget that. 
Then, the following year, another sovereignist party, the Parti 
Quebecois, was elected in Quebec. Finally, a Quebec referendum 
was held in 1995. This is when the Prime Minister promised major 
changes. But now he comes up with minor changes and he has the 
nerve to say: ``Here are the small changes I promised you''. 
However, during the referendum, Quebecers were led to believe 
that there would be major changes.
<P>
	Unfortunately, we lost that referendum. However, 49.4 per cent 
of Quebecers supported sovereignty. The two sides were literally 
neck and neck. Sixty per cent of Quebec's French speaking voters 
supported sovereignty, but this is not enough to achieve our 
destiny.
<P>
	As I said, in 1980, Mr. Trudeau promised major constitutional 
changes. Quebecers believed him, but he did just the opposite of 
what he had said. In the 1995 referendum, the current Prime 
Minister also promised major changes. Everybody was expecting 
great constitutional amendments. But instead, all we get are not 
even amendments, just a House of Commons bill, Bill C-110, 
which gives Quebec a veto and recognizes Quebec as a distinct 
society. This is a far cry from constitutional amendments.
<P>
	We know full well that a bill can be amended at any time. Even 
the present government could amend this act tomorrow morning, 
next week, next month. The Liberal government could be replaced 
and its successor could decide to change this constitutional 
amendment. This does not mean anything. This is an affront to the 
people of Quebec.
<P>
	Moreover, five regions are given a veto: British Columbia, the 
western provinces, Ontario, Quebec and the maritimes. A veto for 
Quebec would mean, for instance, that Quebec has a veto on 
account of it being a people who is a minority in Canada. The 
Quebec people must have a veto. But if it is also given to 
everybody else, it does not mean anything any more.
<P>
	The Prime Minister is once again trying to deceive Quebecers, to 
trick them. He keeps on repeating: ``We want to give Quebecers a 
veto, we want to recognize Quebec as a distinct society''. But at the 
same time, he does not mention the he is giving a veto to the others.
<P>
	Essentially, what this really means is that the Prime Minister and 
the Liberal Party have decided that there will never be any 
constitutional amendment. By giving a veto to five regions, you 
make sure that there will always be a region which will not agree to 
the amendments put forward by the federal government or 
somebody else. There will always be obstacles and the Prime 
Minister is deceiving the Quebec people trying to make them 
believe that they are being given veto power. By giving veto power 
to everybody he is not willing to amend the Constitution. It is as 
simple as that.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17587"> 17587 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1535)</B>
<P>
	It is a trap and I am telling Quebecers that the Prime Minister 
and the Liberal Party of Canada are trying to deceive them. If we 
are voting against this veto power and against this distinct society it 
is because it is a trap set for Quebecers. I want to say that clearly to 
Quebecers today.
<P>
	It is an insult to Quebecers and they should remember the little 
story I just told, because we tend to forget it.
<P>
	At the present time, what the Prime Minister is doing is making 
fools of Quebecers. He believes they are not too bright. He seems 
to think that Quebecers have a short memory.
<P>
	I remind the Prime Minister and the Liberal Party that in Quebec 
the motto on the license plates is ``Je me souviens'', I remember. I 
often tell my constituents: Never forget to look at the car in front of 
you, its license plate probably says: ``Je me souviens''. We should 
remember our history, it is not that long. If we do, maybe we will 
not be duped so easily.
<P>
	During the last referendum, people in English Canada panicked 
because polls were saying the yes side was leading. They were 
totally panicked. Why? Because the Prime Minister of Canada had 
made these people believe that there was no danger whatsoever that 
Quebecers would ever vote for sovereignty. Yet, it was close. It was 
very close and I find it regrettable that the Prime Minister had 
concealed the Quebec reality from the rest of Canada.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, you are indicating that my time is up. Is it, really?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It is the Chair's fault; your time was up 
four minutes ago.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leblanc (Longueuil):</B> Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. I 
would have a lot more to say, but I think that what I just mentioned 
will certainly enlighten Quebecers.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the more I hear from the government, and from the Bloc 
Quebecois and its leader, it begs the question: Why are we wasting 
time trying to fix the problems of Confederation in Quebec when 
the leader of the Bloc, the heir apparent of the separatist Parti 
Quebecois in the province of Quebec, has stated that he will not 
accept anything that is done? Why not get on with fixing the 
problems that affect all of Canada, including Quebec? When the 
Government of Quebec is ready to sit down at the table and discuss 
its concerns, that is the time to do fine tuning on Quebec's specific 
problems.
<P>
	Let us look at our humble beginnings in this country. What is 
now Quebec and Ontario was thought of as the main part of 
Canada. The rest was looked on as the colonies. The Atlantic 
region was mainly considered an  east coast access, the prairies as 
farm country and British Columbia as west coast access. Each 
outlying region was expected to harvest its raw materials or 
produce and send it to the centre for processing and consumption. It 
was not until the 1930s that the prairies gained control over its oil 
and gas reserves.
<P>
	The government of the day primarily represented central Canada 
and concerned itself mainly with the issues of central Canada. The 
rest of the country was simple, under developed and relatively 
unconcerned with the concentration of power at the centre core. 
That notwithstanding the fact that there was a certain reluctance on 
the part of many people in British Columbia to join Confederation. 
It was not until late this century that Newfoundland on the opposite 
coast finally agreed to join Confederation.
<P>
	Overall this worked acceptably but times change. Consider how 
the average family operates. Within that family there are certain 
rules by the head of the family, by a parent laying down rules that 
are appropriate for the time and place of that family. As the 
younger members of the family become teenagers, if the parent 
group continues to treat them like pre-schoolers, there will be a lot 
of resentment and problems within that family.
<P>
<B>(1540 )</B>
<P>
	As those teenagers grow into adults, as times change and as 
evolution takes place in their personal development, it will be time 
for them to move on and become adults in their own right, to stand 
on their own. If the rules of the family have grown with them and 
been proper and reasonable, then there will always be close family 
ties and there will be an interdependence and relationship between 
family members. However, if the head of the family is unyielding 
and unreasonable, then the younger family members will flee the 
family, never to be a part of it again. This is a very fitting analogy 
to view the way Canada is going at this moment.
<P>
	Quebec is distinct. No one could or wishes to dispute that. 
However, the Atlantic provinces are distinct in their heritage and 
culture. The prairies had a much harder struggle for survival and 
development than central Canada. That makes them unique, or as 
the popular buzzword goes today, distinct. British Columbia is 
geographically and culturally distinct from the rest of this country. 
Perhaps the most distinct of all is the territories. Their unique 
geography and climate sets them apart form the rest of the country. 
It takes a special kind of person to develop the territories and those 
people and their area are unquestionably distinct.
<P>
	The only way the concept of a distinct society can be dealt with 
fairly is to recognize that all of Canada is made up of a collection of 
distinct societies, each with its merits. Saying this does not 
diminish the uniqueness of Quebec's language or culture but no 
province, territory, region or group should have any special powers 
not bestowed on the others.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17588"> 17588 </A></B>
<P>
	Each of the provinces should have more autonomy to deal with 
its needs. Most of what Quebec apparently wants should be granted 
to all provinces. When the federal government finally realizes that 
not only the 19th century is gone but most of the 20th century as 
well, perhaps it will start to deal with the needs of the 21st century. 
It is time to realize that Canada is no longer a central core with 
supporting colonies on either end.
<P>
	The whole concept of a constitutional veto is wrong. What is 
needed is constitutional ratification which is now in place with the 
seven and fifty formula. The current veto legislation is a knee jerk 
reaction from a government that felt it needed to do something and 
frankly did not know what to do.
<P>
	First it was a veto for Quebec. When that did not sell, it added in 
the provinces and regional concept. Still no sale, so the government 
tinkered a bit more. As it now stands there are senior provinces and 
junior provinces. Reform's position has always been that if there is 
a veto it is the people of the various provinces or regions that 
should have it.
<P>
	When the government first came forward with its ill-conceived 
veto idea, it could not have gotten it more wrong if it tried. 
Sometimes I think it probably did try. First and most important, it 
provided this veto to the regional governments instead of the 
people. Second, it did not even know the proper concept for the 
regions. Belatedly it tried to correct its error on the real number of 
regions but in so doing it continued to provide vetoes to 
governments instead of the people.
<P>
	Imagine the horror of people right across this country: a veto on 
the Constitution in the hands of a separatist government. Bill C-110 
is not a unity bill. It is a disunity bill.
<P>
	The Prime Minister thought he could get away with his standard 
strategy during the Quebec referendum. That strategy is doing 
absolutely nothing. What the heck, it has kept the government 
artificially high in the polls ever since the election so why not 
continue? The swing to the yes side leading up to the referendum 
provided the answer to that. The Prime Minister's lack of 
leadership, which had worked so well for him in the past, proved to 
be a problem which almost cost us the country.
<P>
	His continued lack of a real plan and his unwillingness to deal 
with the real problems may yet destroy the country. For too long 
divisiveness has been a great problem in Canada: English versus 
the French, aboriginal versus non-aboriginal as well as cultural 
issues.
<P>
<B>(1545 )</B>
<P>
	Instead of working to resolve the differences and making all 
Canadians equal, the government has worked on the basis of divide 
and conquer. It seems to believe that only where there is 
confrontation is there a real need for government. It is time for the 
government to realize that it is not the solution and in fact is the 
problem.
<P>
	This latest bill by the government, often referred to as something 
drafted on the back of a napkin, follows the old divide and conquer 
philosophy. However the government is losing its ability to 
conquer. When that happens, all that is left of the old formula is 
divide.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois and Parti Quebecois are really one and the 
same. They must be taking a secret delight in the government's 
latest faulty strategy. Both of them want to break up the country at 
any cost and the Prime Minister is playing right into their hands. 
The country's problems cannot be solved by playing one problem 
against another, and that is exactly what Bill C-110 does.
<P>
	The Prime Minister knew that offering a deal to Quebec alone 
would not be accepted so he included another province, Ontario. 
When that did not appear to be working he added one more, British 
Columbia. When Alberta protested he suggested that it effectively 
had a veto over the rest of the prairies by virtue of its population 
mass.
<P>
	Indian versus white, immigrant versus citizen, English versus 
French, east versus west, and now province versus province. When 
will the government wake up and realize that it is not saving or 
protecting the country but is destroying it?
<P>
	Bill C-110 is not the answer to the country's problems. It is a 
symptom of the problems. Not only should the bill not be passed. It 
should not even be voted on. If the government had any integrity at 
all it would withdraw the bill and proceed instead to a process of 
decentralization.
<P>
	Not only will I not be supporting the bill, but as a member of 
Parliament from B.C. and one who has certain unquestioned 
loyalties to my home province I will also vote against the 
amendment to give B.C. a veto. To do otherwise would be 
providing an indication of endorsing a nationally unacceptable 
concept.
<P>
	Instead of the continuing policy of divide and conquer, it is long 
past time that the government started practising a new policy of 
equality of all people and provinces in Canada. It may be a bit 
much for me to expect it. However it is Christmastime. Maybe 
miracles still happen. What a Christmas present it would be for 
Canada if it happened now.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, today, we 
are rushing through debate on Bill C-110, an act respecting 
constitutional amendments.
<P>
	I say rushing, because, as you know, the Liberal government has 
been attempting in the last few days to speed up the political 
process to ensure speedy passage of Bill C-110.
<P>
	Let us first take a look at the general context of this real crab trap 
the Prime Minister got himself caught in, according to some 
analysts, and we certainly agree with them.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17589"> 17589 </A></B>
<P>
	A few days before the October 30 Quebec referendum, the 
federal Prime Minister, driven by panic, made an about-face and 
promised major changes to Canadian federalism. So, in early 
November, he created two committees made up of federal ministers 
in order to examine the issue of constitutional and administrative 
changes. I want to point out that, since then, we never heard 
anything more about those committees.
<P>
	Then, on November 27, two weeks ago, even before knowing 
what these committees werre going to propose, the Canadian 
government announced its intentions on constitutional matters: 
first, a resolution symbolically recognizing the distinct nature of 
Quebec, then a bill where the federal government committed itself 
to never adopt constitutional amendments to which one of the four 
regions of Canada, namely, Quebec, Ontario, the Maritimes and the 
West, were opposed.
<P>
	Finally, the third measure expressed Ottawa's intention to 
partially withdraw from manpower training programs, while, of 
course, maintaining control over funds and national standards. One 
can understand the government for trying to gag any opponent of 
its constitutional reform package. The utter mess it has created and 
cannot get itself out of verges on the most grotesque cynicism.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	Quebecers have nevertheless seen through its scheme. The 
results of a SOM poll which was released last Friday show that 53 
per cent of Quebecers find the federal proposals inadequate, and a 
meagre 24 per cent find them adequate.
<P>
	Interviews for the poll were conducted between December 2 and 
December 5, two days before the last episode of government 
bungling over the veto for B.C. and Alberta. Results would be even 
more critical if the poll were taken today.
<P>
	As far as improvisation and inconsistency go, in an area as 
fundamental as constitutional changes, the federal government 
takes the cake. Even before Quebecers had a chance to say these 
proposals were unacceptable, the federal government yielded to 
pressure from the west and granted a veto to B.C. and a veto by 
default to Alberta.
<P>
	But the show did not end there. Last week, federal Liberals fell 
all over themselves to tell us Quebec does not have a distinct 
culture and there is only one Canadian culture from coast to coast.
<P>
	We have a government that claims to be willing to grant 
symbolic recognition of Quebec's distinctive character, but says at 
the same time that this does not mean anything and that Quebecers 
do not have a distinct culture. As I already said, these intellectual 
flip-flops are tragically funny and deceptive.
<P>
	With Bill C-110, the roundabout ways of the government are just 
as difficult to follow. First of all, we  are told that this bill gives 
Quebec a veto power, which Quebec thought it had until the 
Supreme Court stated otherwise in 1982. Since it is one of the two 
founding nations, Quebecers had always thought that, in order to 
maintain a good relationship, both partners had to agree before 
major changes could be made. However, Bill C-110 does the exact 
opposite and achieves an incredible feat by annoying all Canadians 
from sea to sea to sea.
<P>
	Quebecers have always considered the veto power as, by 
definition, a kind of constitutional protection, because they did not 
want to relive the events of 1982 and be excluded from the 
constitutional amendment and reform process. But Bill C-110 is 
only a bill. All it will take is a majority of members in this House 
and Quebec can say goodbye to its veto power.
<P>
	We are far from entrenching this power in the fundamental law 
of Canada. This unconstitutionalized veto will not be granted only 
to the two founding nations.
<P>
	At first, besides Quebec, Bill C-110 was to grant this veto power 
to Ontario, the Atlantic provinces and the Western provinces. A 
week later, after a press conference given by the premiers of B.C. 
and Alberta, these two provinces also got the veto power. By the 
end of my speech, the federal government may have granted a veto 
to Nova Scotia and Manitoba.
<P>
	As my colleague from Bellechasse put it, in his colourful 
language, this is the Colonel Sanders' veto power, a big chicken 
with legs for everybody.
<P>
	The message the Liberal government is conveying is pretty 
simple: Quebec is a province like any other and only gets a veto 
because of the size of its population. With the recent presents 
offered to us by our federal Santa Claus in this Christmas season, 
any change will require the support of at least seven provinces 
representing at least 91.8 per cent of the Canadian population.
<P>
	In other words, Quebec is not getting a veto, but rather a 
guarantee that all future constitutional negotiations will have the 
same fate as Meech or Charlottetown. We have reached a 
constitutional dead end and there is virtually no way of getting out.
<P>
	One has to be particularly out of touch-and we thought we had 
seen the worst of it with the Charlottetown Accord-to add insult 
to injury.
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	In a press release dated November 27 of this year, the Liberal 
government said, and I quote: ``Now is not the time to hold a round 
of constitutional talks since the Government of Quebec is 
completely dedicated to the secessionist option. If conditions 
changed, that is if Quebec and the other regions agreed, the veto 
proposal contained in this bill could be enshrined in the 
Constitution''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17590"> 17590 </A></B>
<P>
	So the federal government is imposing its own constitutional 
rules without seeking the approval of Canada's four or five 
regions-the number varies from one day to the next. Already the 
government is not respecting the principles of Bill C-110 in its 
current approach. Like Trudeau in 1982, this Liberal government is 
trying to impose a formula for amending the Constitution through a 
process that goes against the very principle underlying the 
proposed formulas.
<P>
	In closing, I urge Liberal members to oppose Bill C-110-I 
know I am dreaming but one more nightmare will not make a 
difference-for the simple reason that if Liberal members love 
Quebec so much, as they came to tell us before the referendum, 
they should understand that Quebecers will never be satisfied with 
empty shells and constitutional footballs that have no more 
credibility that the rhetoric that comes with them. The least we can 
say is that, in the best country in the world, even crabs are laughing 
their heads off.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Secretary of State (Parliamentary 
Affairs) and Deputy Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to take part in today's 
very important debate which, as you are aware, has grown out of 
the referendum debate we had not long ago. On October 30, Canada 
gained more than a mere referendum victory.
<P>
	History will recall this referendum as one in which not only 
Quebecers but millions of Canadians renewed their allegiance to 
our country and proclaimed their pride at being Canadian. From sea 
to sea, millions of Canadians realized more clearly than ever before 
how important it was for them to live in this great country rich in 
resources and in potential.
<P>
	People everywhere also became aware that the unity of our 
country is more important than many individual demands. People 
everywhere said that keeping this country together was a 
worthwhile undertaking, was worth a few concessions and 
compromises. The Prime Minister clearly understood what 
Canadians were feeling on the eve of the referendum. He saw our 
desire and our determination to continue to see this best of all 
countries progress even further. He also recognized the desire 
everywhere in the country for change, concrete and progressive 
change within Canada.
<P>
	The Prime Minister kept his promise. Barely a month after his 
promise to Quebecers to recognize the distinct society, to give 
Quebec a veto and to decentralize powers, he has made good on 
that promise. Last Monday we passed the motion the Prime 
Minister had promised recognizing Quebec as a distinct society. 
Today, we are looking at Bill C-110 on the right to a veto.
<P>
	A few days ago, my colleague, the Minister of Human Resources 
Development, proposed a new employment insurance plan which 
gives the provinces full jurisdiction over manpower training. This 
is a real and effective way  to bring services and decision making 
closer to the people.
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	The Prime Minister's initiative for change is a high point in the 
recognition of Quebec's traditional claims.
<P>
	These three elements-the distinct society, the veto and 
decentralization of powers-form the essence of what Quebec has 
wanted and has sought for 30 years.
<P>
	We now know that there is no need to throw everything up in the 
air or to give up our country, our citizenship or our future for our 
identity to be recognized with dignity and our place to be 
confirmed with pride in Canada's confederation.
<P>
	Obviously, I am under no illusions. The opposition parties do not 
recognize the immense value of the Prime Minister's proposals. 
For the members of the Reform Party, the whole thing goes way too 
far. To them, Quebec is not different, it is insufferable. It is not 
distinct, it is incomprehensible. It does not need a veto, but rather 
an ultimatum.
<P>
	In fact, what the Reformers want is to separate Canada from 
Quebec and thus rend a most noble fabric that forms the heart of an 
independent, autonomous and unique Canada.
<P>
	For the members of the Bloc Quebecois, opposite, the Prime 
Minister's initiative does not go far enough. They treat it with 
disdain and contempt. The leader and the members of the Bloc 
Quebecois should remember that, on October 30, a majority of 
Quebecers rejected their option of sovereignty. They said no to 
their plan to separate Quebec from Canada. They said no to the 
farfetched promises that were made. They said no to the enormous 
economic risk the Bloc Quebecois wanted them to take.
<P>
	Our friends opposite should humbly recall that on October 30, 
Quebecers chose Canada. They chose to keep their Canadian 
citizenship. They chose to keep their Canadian passport, invaluable 
when you travel. They said they wanted to go on living in the best 
country in the world.
<P>
	On October 30, Quebecers chose to go on living in the country 
that affords them the best guarantees for progress, success and 
prosperity. And on October 30, Quebecers chose to live in Canada.
<P>
	Of course Quebecers and Canadians as well indicated they 
wanted change, but change within Canada. That is exactly what we 
are proposing. The Bloc Quebecois maintains that it is not enough, 
the Reform Party that it is too much. It should come as no surprise 
that our position differs totally from that of the opposition parties. 
The Bloc wants to isolate Quebec. We encourage Quebec to look 
outward. The Bloc rejects everything we have built in the past 127 
years. We are using our experience to make social and economic 
gains. The Bloc  wants to destroy our country. We are working to 
make it even more prosperous, fairer and equitable.
<P>

<P>
	What we are proposing to Quebec today and what we have been 
discussing for the past few weeks is a new way of approaching 
constitutional amendments that might affect the powers, rights and 
privileges of the National Assembly and the Government of 
Quebec. In fact, what we are proposing to Quebecers is the 
assurance that we will never amend the Constitution without their 
consent. What we are proposing to Quebecers is an authentic 
partnership that respects the rights and responsibilities of each 
partner.
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
	We often said during the referendum campaign that federalism is 
a flexible and dynamic formula. We said that we were open to 
change and that change is possible within Canadian federalism.
<P>
	The Prime Minister is a man of his word who leads a government 
that keeps its promises. We had further proof of that today. Thanks 
to the Prime Minister's initiatives for change, Canada and Quebec 
are turning a new page in our history. This page and the pages that 
follow will be imbued with the openness, respect and pride shown 
by so many Quebecers and Canadians during the referendum 
campaign.
<P>
	In keeping with the will expressed by a majority of Quebecers on 
October 30, we are now full partners. Thanks to this modern and 
strong partnership, we will enter the next century still at the head of 
the line and we will stay there.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Okanagan Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
rise to enter this debate with mixed emotions, emotions of sadness 
and gladness at the same time. I am reminded of the novel <I>A Tale of 
Two Cities</I>. The opening sentence goes something like this: ``It was 
the best of times; it was the worst of times''. Today we find 
ourselves with that ambivalence in Canada.
<P>
	In the last three weeks and the weeks preceding the October 30 
referendum we have seen some of the most terrible things happen. 
We have also seen some of the most wonderful things happen. 
People have been divided and people have come together on this 
issue. The Montreal rally was a coming together that we have 
probably not witnessed ever before in this country, yet the occasion 
was a negative one. It was one of tearing people apart.
<P>
	Our country is a democracy. Unlike the words that were used 
only a moment ago about the mutual respect that we need from one 
another, the unfortunate part of it is that too often we impute 
motives to people. People impute motives to members of the 
Reform Party and say we want to tear Canada apart. Nothing could 
be further from the truth than that.
<P>
	I stand here today as a proud Canadian, as someone who was 
born in this country, as someone who can look back to a 
grandfather and father who left a country that was being taken over 
by a
<P>
government that was not democratic. The Bolshevik revolution 
brought about my family's emigration from Russia.
<P>
	My grandfather came to Canada with his children and they 
became citizens. They were buried here. Now I stand here and say I 
am proud to be able to be in Canada. It is a privilege to be able to 
speak one's mind and not be afraid that one might be stricken down 
or killed because of opinions that one might hold.
<P>
	While there are a lot of differences and variations in this country, 
the real reason we are here is that this nation is free. It is here where 
we can express our religious beliefs, where we can express our 
political beliefs, where we can move forward and build a country 
that is strong, a country that is united.
<P>
	We saw a few days ago how fragile that peace can be. It reminds 
me so much of a conversation I had with one of my constituents. He 
is a person who came to this country seeking freedom, seeking a 
domicile that would allow his children to grow up in peace and 
harmony. This person has family in the old Yugoslavia.
<P>
<B>(1610 )</B>
<P>
	My constituent said to me: ``I want you to know that I am not so 
much concerned about what is happening in Bosnia right now 
where my people are suffering the ravages of so-called ethnic 
cleansing. I was very concerned. Two years ago when you were 
elected all I could talk about was the way in which my forefathers' 
country and the things they built were being taken apart. Now, I 
want you to pay attention to what is happening in Canada. The very 
things that are happening in Canada today, in October 1995, are the 
very things that brought about the division and the terror we now 
see as the Bosnian conflict in the former Yugoslavia''.
<P>
	That is so serious. Why do we not listen to those people? Why do 
we think that we must somehow create differences and create a 
distinct society based on where people live because of a particular 
language, culture or race? It is wrong. Not only is it wrong, it 
carries within it the seeds of disintegration of what is a nice 
country. We should do everything we can to make sure that those 
seeds do not sprout. We must make sure that we can continue to 
develop a mutual respect for one another without fear and at times 
perhaps even express love for one another. I wish we could do that 
all the time.
<P>
	I also want to draw attention to the west. The west is a very 
interesting part of the country. I was born in Alberta and moved 
across the mountains into British Columbia. Those of us who were 
born in Alberta can detect the difference. Something happens to all 
of us in western Canada. We are fiercely independent but we are 
also very, very patient. We know how difficult it is to eke out  a 
living on the prairies. Quebec and Ontario think they know 
everything and that they can tell the westerners how to live. They 
cannot. They do not know how but Ontarians say: ``We will tell you 
how''.

	Mr. Harris wrote an article in one of our local newspapers which 
I think covers it very well. With respect to the unity question he 
said: ``But the sleeping giant in all this may well turn out to be 
Manning's west''. Why it is Manning's west I do not know. I think 
it is just as much Schmidt's west as it is any other person's west. 
Nevertheless, that is how it was said.
<P>
	He went on:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This great and insanely loyal part of Canada has waited for more than 100 
years to take its proper place in the Confederation; it is still waiting.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The PC Party died on the prairies because it sold out the notion of a strong and 
equal Canada in the name of winning in Quebec, just as the Liberals have for 
generations.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>If Ottawa continues to fail the west while it woos Quebec with special status, 
the country may still fall apart like a soggy jigsaw puzzle starting with the 
Rocky Mountains rather than the Laurentians.</BLOCKQUOTE>
That is the opinion of one columnist.
<P>
	If members had been in my riding in the last four days and 
listened to the comments that were made, particularly when the 
Prime Minister presented the motion we voted on last night and the 
bill we are now facing closure on today, they would have heard 
people ask: ``How much longer do we have to put up with this?'' 
They do not want to put up with it at all. Do they want to be part of 
Canada? Absolutely. They want desperately to be part of Canada, 
but they want to be part of a united Canada, a part of Canada that 
says people are equal, the provinces are equal and that no one 
deserves any special status regardless of language or geography. 
That is what they want and it is what I want.
<P>
	I do not think there is one person in the House who is any better 
than anyone else. I do not think anyone on this side of the House is 
any better than anyone on that side of the House and vice versa.
<P>
	We are trying to build a united country. There are those of my 
colleagues who would say: ``Well, those guys over there cannot 
possibly be as good as we are''. In reality and in our hearts we 
really are trying to do the best we can for our constituents, but we 
certainly disagree on certain things. In particular we disagree with 
what happened yesterday.
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	Yesterday the government had a chance to recognize that special 
status does not mean unique powers, and what did it do? It refused 
to accept certain amendments which stated that if we were to 
recognize special status it should not be conferred or interpreted as 
conferring upon the Government of Quebec any new legislative or 
executive powers, priority rights, status or any other  rights or 
privileges not conferred on the legislature or government of any 
other province.
<P>
	That was a good step forward and it was rejected. It would have 
brought about unity. Instead the government did the opposite. It 
said: ``You have special powers and you may indeed have unique 
powers that other provinces do not have''. That was completely 
unacceptable to me and to my constituents. They have told me 100 
times, if they have told me once, that it is not acceptable to them.
<P>
	The government had another chance. It could have said that it 
was not to be interpreted as diminishing in any way the rights and 
freedoms of any citizen of Canada under the Canadian Charter of 
Rights and Freedoms by virtue of province of residence. This 
second chance was turned down. It would have helped. It would 
have brought about unity but it was rejected.
<P>
	The final chance was to deny or be interpreted as denying that 
Canada constitutes one nation. This too was rejected. I went home 
sad last night because an opportunity to bring about a direction that 
could have healed the nation was denied. It was a sad day.
<P>
	Today we are not approached with recognizing Quebec as a 
distinct society. We are told that society is distinct and shall now 
have a veto. It is totally contrary to democracy that any one group 
would have the power of veto when the group cannot constitute a 
majority. It is wrong in principle.
<P>
	We are in danger of committing one of the worst possible actions 
we have seen in a long time. This is where a positive comment can 
also be made. If the Prime Minister wants to bring about the 
unification of the country, he would come to the House and 
withdraw Bill C-110. If the Prime Minister would do that he would 
recover some of the losses he has experienced in the last little 
while. We could then respect him as a leader.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> He would want that, because then we would win 
an election with 70 per cent instead of 60 per cent.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Schmidt:</B> It is possible for the Prime Minister, even though 
he has a majority, to make a mistake. It is not a sign of weakness to 
admit an error. It is not a sign of weakness to stop yelling across the 
floor.
<P>
	It is important to recognize that we can bring about a positive 
Canadian unity. We ask the Prime Minister to withdraw the bill. He 
would re-establish himself as a good thinking, unifying Prime 
Minister instead of forcing an issue like this one that we cannot 
even debate as much as we want.

great pleasure to participate as a member of the official opposition 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17593"> 17593 </A></B>
<P>
in this debate on Bill C-110, an act respecting constitutional 
amendments, and more  specifically implementing what must be 
referred to as a symbolic veto.
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
	I am very happy to participate in the debate on this bill, because I 
was immediately struck by both its form and its content. Its form is 
a beauty.
<P>
	This bill is being touted as a historic response to the Quebec 
people's democratic impulse, because, as you know, Quebec is 
mostly responsible for Canada's constitutional problem.
<P>
	This bill has six pages, including three blank ones. Including the 
front page, we end up with the equivalent of about a page and a 
quarter of text as a response or a semblance of response to the 
constitutional debate that, as you know, has been hurting Canada 
for some 30 years.
<P>
	The content of this bill is also a beauty. As for a symbolic veto, I 
am reminded of one of our greatest hockey stars, Guy Lafleur, who 
when questioned about his reasons for supporting the no side said 
in 1992-if I remember correctly-that he had interpreted the right 
of veto as meaning the right to vote. That is about the extent of it. 
Talking about symbolic, this veto will allow Quebecers to vote, and 
very soon, in favour of sovereignty.
<P>
	This bill and this exercise seem totally improvised, like the 
spontaneous show of love-albeit at bargain prices-made to 
Quebecers in the last weeks and days of the referendum campaign, 
and they also lack depth. More importantly, it seems to me that this 
is a pitiful non-event from an historical perspective.
<P>
	Let us not forget that this process by the Liberal government is 
meant to be the answer to the historical claims of the Quebec 
government and people within the Canadian confederation. As a 
Quebec voter and citizen who has had an interest in this issue for a 
number of years, I try to get a better understanding of what is going 
on by going back to 1954, when premier Duplessis led the fight 
against the federal government's unconstitutional interference in 
fields of provincial jurisdiction, eventually winning a hard fought 
battle to have the province collect a direct personal income tax.
<P>
	This is truly an historical event, following which Quebecers 
became more proud, more assertive and more determined to gain 
full dignity as a sovereign people.
<P>
	Then came the Tremblay royal inquiry commission on 
federal-provincial relations in Quebec and Canada. Then, in 1960, 
just after Duplessis died, we had the advent of a Liberal 
government, the quiet revolution, with all the good things it 
brought about, and Quebecers taking their future in their own hands 
through the government takeover of the hydro sector, the set up of 
the Caisse de dépôt, the Quebec pension plan, and so on.
<P>
	In 1964, an eye-opening event took place: the Queen's visit. I 
was there. The police force deployed was larger  than the crowd. 
That day was later described as the day of the visit of shame, in the 
city of shame, Quebec City, because the people had remained 
indifferent to this visit, which, unfortunately, led to what came to 
be known as the samedi de la matraque, or ``Billy-club Saturday'', 
of 1964.
<P>
	In 1966, still in that historical perspective-and that is what we 
on this side of the House, let alone the hon. members on the other 
side, cannot understand-there was this collective surge. As early 
as 1956, the sovereignist movement, which then became 
established in 1959, came into play. In 1966, it was represented by 
Pierre Bourgault in the riding of Duplessis. Few people know that 
39 per cent of the voters of this riding voted for Mr. Bourgault, who 
was the leader of the <I>Rassemblement pour l'indépendance 
nationale</I>, the RIN, at the time.
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
	In 1967, a prominent figure dropped by on the occasion of the 
centennial of Confederation. General de Gaulle sent out the 
message, for the whole world to hear, that the people of Quebec did 
exist when he declared: ``Vive le Québec libre''.
<P>
	The next year saw the foundation of the Parti Quebecois by René 
Lévesque. This was a turning point in our modern history. Two 
years later, with 23 per cent of popular support, the PQ won seven 
seats in the National Assembly. Three years later, in 1973, he got 
30 per cent of the votes and 6 members, because of the well-known 
incongruities of our British parliamentary system. Three years 
later, in 1976, a sovereignist party was officially and 
democratically elected in Quebec for the first time in the history of 
the province and of the country. The 1980 referendum followed, 
with, even then, 41 per cent of Quebecers giving a mandate to the 
Government of Quebec to negotiate. The majority, unfortunately, 
decided otherwise.
<P>
	At the same time, on the Canadian side, people were becoming 
aware that something was wrong. In 1963, the Laurendeau-Dunton 
commission was talking about two solitudes. We could have taken 
big chunks of the Laurendeau-Dunton report and read it here. It 
would have been extraordinarily relevant.
<P>
	So we had the Laurendeau-Dunton commission, then we had the 
Macdonald commission at the end of the 1980s and then the 
Pepin-Robarts commission, an event in constitutional terms, but a 
dead end, because Mr. Trudeau, the Prime Minister of the time, did 
not believe in their view of things. Then there was the 
constitutional bog of the 1990s with the Spicer commission and the 
Castonguay-Beaudoin-Dobbie-Edwards commission.
<P>
	As Mr. Castonguay will remember, these people were 
upset-which should give Quebec federalists food for thought-at 
the degree of willingness to recognize a Quebec people within 
Canada that they saw. Mr.  Castonguay even withdrew from the 
commission at that point, and, as you saw in the recent campaign, 
he remained true to himself and logical, warning everyone that he 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17594"> 17594 </A></B>
<P>
could not try to convince his Quebecers that Quebec should remain 
in confederation, so shaken was he in his deep convictions.
<P>
	Continuing with the major landmarks in the history of Quebec, 
we arrive at the aftermath to the no vote in the referendum, the 
great initiatives of Mr. Trudeau, the unilateral initiatives which 
were condemned by the Supreme Court. Trudeau had to call in the 
provinces. Quebecers will all remember the Night of the long 
knives, when the Constitution was patriated. One of the instigators 
of this was the Minister of Justice at the time, then and still the hon. 
member for Saint-Maurice. He cannot plead ignorance of the harm 
that has been done historically to the people of Quebec by such 
actions, yet he does not recognize-it cannot be repeated in this 
House too many times, a place where the existence of the Quebec 
people is not recognized-that Quebec as a people and a culture 
does exist, whether the Prime Minister likes it or not. The 
Quebecois culture does exist, and this must be said.
<P>
	All of the efforts now being expended represent one of the three 
little promises made by the Prime Minister, as he himself qualifies 
them, to Quebecers and to Canada in the referendum campaign. 
One of these was recognition of the distinct society, an empty shell; 
the second was a token right of veto; the third was the Minister of 
Human Resources Development's nice little present which will 
make the poor poorer and the rich richer.
<P>
	A fine country indeed to invite Quebecers to remain part of. 
Everyone in Quebec is aware, whether our federalist friends like it 
or not, that they are a people making democratic advances, a people 
marching toward collective pride, a people prepared to say yes to 
their very existence.

	<B>The Speaker:</B> I have made a mistake. I should have recognized 
the hon. member for Vancouver East before the hon. member for

Vancouver East.
<P>
<B>(1630 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Anna Terrana (Vancouver East, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to speak on Bill C-110, an act respecting constitutional 
amendments. The bill, which grants a veto to various regions of 
Canada, has been recently amended to include British Columbia as 
the fifth region that can exercise a veto to block a constitutional 
change.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This veto can only apply to a constitutional amendment 
requiring the support of seven provinces representing 50 per cent of 
the population.
<P>
	This amendment to the bill was requested by the people of 
British Columbia, who exercised a great deal of pressure to obtain 
this right.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The amendment is welcome and gives B.C. a well deserved 
autonomy in the exercise of the veto and the recognition by the 
government that B.C. is a distinct region in all aspects. B.C., which 
has a powerful economy and a strong Asia-Pacific connection, sees 
itself is a region because of its geographical location and a 
tremendous growth potential both economy and people wise.
<P>
	Furthermore, British Columbia has been called the Pacific 
region for many years in many government departments and other 
agencies. In British Columbia, beyond the Rocky Mountains, we 
have a vibrant population that is more and more requesting to be 
recognized for its distinctiveness. Its population of over 3.7 million 
people, almost 13 per cent of the Canadian population, feels more 
and more a sense of pride in its achievements and successes.
<P>
	British Columbia has been changing dramatically over the years 
and has become the home of many immigrants, a large number of 
them from the Pacific Rim, being the closest region to B.C. For a 
long time B.C. was somewhat isolated, far from Europe and from 
eastern Canada. It did not seem to attract as many people as Ontario 
and Quebec. At this point British Columbia is one of the most 
desirable places in Canada and in the world in which to live.
<P>
	The growth in population and its variety have made British 
Columbia a booming place. In 1997 Vancouver will host APEC, the 
Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation Conference, 10 years after 
Expo' 86, the time when Vancouver and B.C. seemed to be 
discovered by the world.
<P>
	Even my family members in Italy often comment on Vancouver. 
They often see it on television and read about B.C. in the papers. 
This is quite recent, and we seem to like the attention.
<P>
	I arrived in B.C. in 1966 and I have seen many changes since 
then. I saw Vancouver's skyline change dramatically. I saw the 
composition of the population constantly alter to eventually create 
a mosaic of cultures and beliefs. I saw these cultures coming 
together to celebrate a province more and more conscious of its 
great location and appeal.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I would like to thank the Prime Minister and the Minister of 
Justice for the change they made in this bill. This amendment gives 
British Columbia an important place in the history and future of our 
country.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17595"> 17595 </A></B>
<P>
	We know that Canada is a remarkable country where people 
respect each other and are unique in their understanding of one 
another.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	B.C. remains part of the west. We are in the west but there is a 
difference between being a prairie province and a province that lies 
on the Pacific Ocean and which is becoming more and more a part 
of international trade.
<P>
	The Prime Minister with his missions to the Orient has 
strengthened Canada. B.C., being the coastal province, has 
received many benefits and continues to receive them.
<P>
	This amendment will help British Columbians feel their rights 
are being respected and that their voice is being heard because they 
demanded the veto and they obtained it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cliff Breitkreuz (Yellowhead, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
commend my colleague from Okanagan Centre for being happy 
and sad at once.
<P>
<B>(1635 )</B>
<P>
	I am disgusted with Bill C-110 with its proposed constitutional 
veto. However, I am pleased as always to honour my commitment 
to represent the people of the great riding of Yellowhead. They are 
against this bill. I am against it. I am proud to denounce it here 
today on their behalf.
<P>
	The people of Yellowhead are certainly not opposed to national 
unity. They are not what some prime ministers have foolishly 
called them, enemies of Canada. A few months ago I 
commissioned a scientific poll and about 70 per cent of my 
constituents want Canada to stay together.
<P>
	What they are opposed to, which came through loud and clear in 
the poll results, is the strategy of saving Canada by appeasement, 
appeasing the separatists in Quebec. They overwhelming oppose 
the notion of Quebec as a distinct society and oppose sovereignty 
association.
<P>
	As a member of a caucus which listens to the people instead of 
lecturing them, I do more than take polls. I go on tours in my riding 
to hear what the constituents are saying and how they are saying it. 
I just finished doing that again. I want to tell everyone here what 
they said. That is my job. Some of the members opposite would do 
well to remember that is their job as well.
<P>
	My constituents told me overwhelmingly they do not 
understand, and quite frankly neither do I, why we are even talking 
about caving into Quebec, why distinct society and veto powers are 
even on the table. People in my riding are so sick of this never 
ending debate. I hear that some are wondering if there is anything 
they can do to kick Quebec out of Canada. That is how angry they 
are. That is how frustrated they are.
<P>
	It is not ordinary Quebecers they are sick of. It is this constant 
giving in to the whining and snivelling Quebec politicians, both 
separatist and federal old style politicians. This weak-kneed policy 
of giving the spoiled child of Confederation whatever it wants is 
driving my constituents to despair. I call on my colleagues opposite 
to listen to the people and stop this policy of appeasement before it 
is too late.
<P>
	My constituents want, indeed demand that a line be drawn in the 
sand. This line should signal a few things: no more favours, no 
more appeasement, 10 equal provinces, not 9 provinces and 
Quebec.
<P>
	I do not think I pay my constituents any great compliment when I 
say they are smarter than most politicians, especially when I look at 
the government side across. People are saying that 30 years of 
appeasement to Quebec has failed miserably. People are saying that 
30 years of government by politicians, of politicians and for 
politicians has left the people of Yellowhead as disgusted as the 
people of Quebec with the way things are done in this place.
<P>
	The people are saying stop already. Enough is enough. Treat 
everyone as equals. Treaty everyone as grown ups, not as some 
spoiled children. Treat everyone fairly, equally.
<P>
	The Trudeau Liberals, the Mulroney Tories and now this Liberal 
administration drifting aimlessly have virtually ruined this once 
great country. In my riding it is pretty common observation that the 
three prime ministers responsible for this disaster have all been 
from Quebec. Yes, it took them only 25 years to virtually bring the 
country to its knees, to almost wreck it, 25 years of tearing apart 
our country which took real nation builders centuries of toil and 
tears and sweat to build; 25 years thrown to the wind.
<P>
	The common thread here is that people in most parts of the 
country, the ordinary taxpaying public, the public that pays the bills 
for big oppressive governments has had it. It will not take it any 
more. People will no longer sit idly by and watch the concessions, 
the favours, the appeasements to sell out the country to the 
separatists in Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	Concessions to Quebec continue to march forward with the 
government. It is not only with the distinct society motion and the 
Quebec veto, the matters currently before the House, it is Bill C-89, 
the act that supposedly privatized Canadian National Railway; 
major concessions to Quebec by statute. CN's head office must stay 
in Montreal and by statute the heavy handed provisions of the very 
undemocratic Official Languages Act must prevail.
<P>
	I will not go into the litany of favours given to Quebec during the 
Trudeau-Mulroney years or, more aptly stated, the Trudoney years. 
One glaring example comes to  mind, and it especially sticks in the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17596"> 17596 </A></B>
<P>
craw of westerners, the CF-18 contract assigned to Winnipeg but 
which went to Quebec. Air Canada is another example.
<P>
	Bill C-110 really takes the cake. This will turn out to be the 
mother of all concessions and appeasements granted since 
Confederation. The bill enshrines in legislation, not mere 
discussion or some off the cuff remark, the ultimate in legislative 
lunacy. It even exceeds the lunacy of Bill C-68, the gun control bill.
<P>
	Bill C-110 gives the separatist government of Quebec on a silver 
platter a veto over all future constitutional change. In effect, there 
can be no change. With this bill the Constitution would be buttoned 
up in a strait-jacket because it is the intent of the Prime Minister to 
eventually entrench this loathsome legislation in the constitution.
<P>
	The Liberal government is so sadly lacking in leadership, as 
evidenced last night on the Prime Minister's town hall meeting. 
Even the $1 billion subsidized federal institution, the CBC, could 
not make the Prime Minister look good.
<P>
	The Liberals are stuck with another Chamberlain when what 
they really need is a Churchill. Look at the ranks of the Liberals. 
There is obviously no Churchill forthcoming, only little bitty 
Chamberlains.
<P>
	With this bill and a dozen or so others the Liberal government, 
come the next election, will be gone. For a lot of Canadians that 
cannot be too soon.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> It is my duty, pursuant to Standing Order 38, to 
inform the House that the questions to be raised tonight at the time 
of adjournment are as follows: the hon. member for 
Burnaby-Kingsway, Criminal Code; the hon. member for 
Edmonton East, medicare; the hon. member for Ottawa West, 
pensions.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I feel we 
have been here before as I rise in the House today to speak to Bill 
C-110, an act respecting constitutional amendments. The purpose 
is to condemn again the constitutional position taken by the 
Chrétien government.
<P>
	I sometimes have the impression I am using that well-known 
teaching technique which repeats the same message in every 
possible form, the purpose being, of course, that its content will 
eventually be understood and retained.
<P>
	Following the results of the referendum, members of the Bloc 
Quebecois unanimously decided to continue to defend the interests 
of Quebecers in the Parliament of Canada. Furthermore, since our 
members decided to continue the dialogue with the elected 
representatives of English Canada, it is important to repeat the 
message so that some day it will finally be understood and our 
Canadian friends will accept our future decision calmly,  with 
dignity and respect, and be prepared to co-operate with us, albeit 
within an entirely different framework.
<P>
	I think it is sad that the present Prime Minister still does not 
understand his fellow citizens from Quebec and especially what 
they want.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	How can we in fact not get upset at such insipid statements as 
those made last week to the effect that there was no Quebec 
culture? How can we expect our Canadian friends to understand our 
position, if the Prime Minister himself and his Quebec cohort 
cannot explain the reality of Quebec to their colleagues? On this 
level, it is really a disaster. So much time and money spent harping 
on the same ideas.
<P>
	Unlike the Prime Minister, we in the Bloc Quebecois consider 
good relations with our Canadian friends important. This is why I 
will try once again to explain Quebec's position in this House. Bill 
C-110 is unacceptable to Quebec. It is unacceptable for a number of 
reasons.
<P>
	First, the veto is not given to the provinces, it is lent to them. Has 
anyone ever heard of such a thing in constitutional matters? A veto 
that is not actually granted, but is only on loan. In everyday life, 
when we lend something, we expect to get it back. Both the lender 
and the borrower know that there is nothing definitive about the 
transaction. <I>Le Petit Larousse</I> defines the verb ``to lend'' as to give 
for a time, upon condition of restitution.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister think for one instant that Quebecers 
will be satisfied with a loan? I think this makes a mockery of 
Quebecers and resolves nothing at all. Any government can decide 
to ask for its marbles back, and the provinces have no say, because 
the marbles do not belong to them. This is totally off the wall.
<P>
	Is that what the Prime Minister had in mind when he made the 
people of Quebec the following promise, and I quote: ``Any 
changes in constitutional jurisdiction will only be made with the 
consent of Quebecers''? As we know all too well, a veto on loan 
does not give the people of Quebec any guarantee or any security. It 
is therefore totally unacceptable.
<P>
	Another problem adds itself to the first, as the federal 
government could apparently decide that this veto will be exercised 
either through the National Assembly or by referendum. I say 
apparently because there seems to be some confusion about this 
within the government. In fact, Bill C-110 only refers to the 
provinces. It is not specified whether this means their legislative 
assemblies or their people.
<P>
	Also, when he tabled his bill before this House on November 29, 
the Prime Minister said: ``This bill requires that the Government of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17597"> 17597 </A></B>
<P>
Canada first obtain the consent of Quebec, Ontario and two 
provinces from both  the western and Atlantic regions representing 
50 per cent of the population of each of those regions before 
proposing a constitutional amendment to Parliament''.
<P>
	As we can see, he did not specify either the conditions of 
approval. We took for granted that he meant the provincial 
legislatures. Surprise. If you take a look at the documents prepared 
by the Minister of Justice, in the section dealing with how the bill 
applies to constitutional amendments, you find out that, after at 
least six provinces have given their consent (through resolutions, 
referenda or government approval), the federal government will be 
released from the obligation to proceed with motions in the Senate 
and the House of Commons.
<P>
	There, it is in the bag and the cat is out of the bag. Not only does 
the federal government only lend its veto, it is set to have absolute 
control over the process, given that it plans to go directly to the 
people if it suspects that the provincial government might not take 
the direction that it, the almighty central government, thinks it 
should take. That too is taking Quebecers for fools.
<P>
	I wish to point out to this House that my suspicions were 
confirmed as recently as this morning, when the Prime Minister 
was quoted as saying that a referendum is a frustrating process held 
under provincial legislation and led by provincial politicians. The 
Prime Minister has no qualms about telling everyone that he fully 
intends to interfere in provincial matters whenever he feels like it, 
thus going over the heads of provincial politicians.
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	This is not a good sign of respect for democracy and the 
Constitution. It can be said, however, that this undemocratic 
approach is consistent, in light of the Prime Minister's repeated 
admissions that he would not abide by the results of the referendum 
should a majority of Quebecers vote for sovereignty.
<P>
	I could go on and talk about the other reasons why this veto bill 
is totally unacceptable to Quebec, but I do not have enough time.
<P>
	Although, as he himself admits, he had made only three small 
promises to Quebecers, we and all Quebecers now realize that it is 
nothing but a sham, nothing but false representations. Rhetoric and 
crocodile tears will not change anything.
<P>
	The Chrétien government still does not understand anything and 
I fear that it has no intention of changing the federal system in line 
with Quebecers' aspirations. Everyone knows that. The time for 
deception is over. I therefore urge our Canadian friends to discuss a 
new partnership that would finally accommodate the aspirations of 
Quebecers.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Dear colleague, I did not want to interrupt, but in 
the future, we ought to have ``the Liberal government'', or 
something similar, instead of ``the Chrétien government''.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley, 
Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak 
on Bill C-110 today. I was next in line when the time allocation ran 
out at second reading. It is nice to see that the time closure is not 
going to affect me today.
<P>
	Since that time the government saw fit to make an amendment to 
the bill to include British Columbia as a region and give it a veto. It 
is interesting how the Liberal government seems to be surprised at 
the reaction it has received from people in British Columbia. This 
bill and the amendment have united the people in British Columbia 
as it would appear that they are all against it.
<P>
	What the Liberal government does not seem to understand is that 
the people of British Columbia do not want any one province to 
have a veto. They do not want the veto themselves and they do not 
want any other province to have the veto either. They understand 
very clearly that the veto will entrench the status quo.
<P>
	What the people in British Columbia are looking for and fighting 
against is the establishment of the status quo and entrenching it. 
What they want is a Constitution that will evolve, change and 
recognize the changes that have taken place in this country since 
1867. What they do not want is for British Columbia to be left in 
the position that it is in right now.
<P>
	British Columbians are not happy that almost 13 per cent of 
Canada's population lives in British Columbia but it has less than 
11 per cent representation in this House and less than 6 per cent of 
the seats in the other place. Those are the things British 
Columbians want changed. They want a Constitution that will 
allow those changes. That is why they see the amendment to 
include British Columbia as a distinct region as not mattering at all 
because they do not want a veto. They do not want anybody to have 
a veto.
<P>
	What B.C. wants is to gain its rightful place in Confederation. In 
order to do that, one of the players in Confederation is going to 
have to give up something. If Bill C-110 passes and we have a veto, 
it will mean that the provinces which are required to make 
concessions by giving up something in order to give British 
Columbia its rightful place will have a veto and will prevent that 
from happening.
<P>
	This bill will deny British Columbia its rightful place in Canada. 
However, Bill C-110 has united British Columbia. The provincial 
Liberals are against it, the provincial Reformers are against it and 
the provincial NDP is against it. It is dangerous for this Liberal  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17598"> 17598 </A></B>
<P>
government to create that kind of unanimity among otherwise 
diverse political parties.
<P>
<B>(1655 )</B>
<P>
	I remind the House that in the late 1870s the British Columbia 
legislature actually voted to secede from Canada twice. I am afraid 
that this Liberal government in instituting Bill C-110 has wakened 
a sleeping giant and it does not have any idea what the results will 
be from the feelings of deep resentment that are surfacing in the 
people of British Columbia.
<P>
	By originally grouping B.C. with other western provinces, the 
government ignored our people, our history and our geography. I 
wonder why government members did not read the items in the 
book they released this past week on the symbols of Canada. I want 
to share with the Liberal government what the book that it 
published has to say:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>British Columbia was inhabited by the greatest number of distinct Indian 
tribes of any province or territory in Canada. They were not only different from 
each other, but also from the rest of the Indian tribes in Canada.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Unlike eastern Canada where the French and English disputed control of the 
land, the first two countries to contest areas of British Columbia were Spain and 
Russia.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In 1778 Captain James Cook of Great Britain became the first person to 
actually chart the land. Having firmly established her right to the area, Britain 
proceeded to settle disputes with both Spain and Russia.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>When gold was discovered in the lower Fraser Valley in 1857, thousands of 
people came in search of instant wealth. To maintain law and order, the next 
year the British government established the separate colony of British 
Columbia. The colony was cut off from the rest of British North America by 
thousands of kilometres and a ridge of mountains.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I would suggest it is very clear in the Liberals' own publication 
that B.C. is a distinct region. It was a travesty for the government to 
completely ignore that distinctiveness and to lump us in with all 
western provinces.
<P>
	Then the Minister of Human Resources Development cut $47 
million in federal transfer payments to the province of British 
Columbia. The government seems to think it is okay to fund only 
33 per cent of British Columbia's welfare bills when every other 
province gets funded up to 50 per cent. That is just one example of 
how the province of British Columbia is getting shafted.
<P>
	Last month Business and Industry Development B.C. released 
the results of a Peat Marwick study which was done on its behalf. 
The study showed that not only has B.C. not received its share of 
federal spending, but its proportion of federal spending is 
continually declining. The province of B.C. receives only 
two-thirds of federal spending when compared to a composite 
indicator of its population, GDP and amount of federal income tax 
paid. While the federal government puts in less than  two-thirds of 
the money it should, it takes out over 10 per cent more in income 
tax.
<P>
	This is the status quo the federal government wants British 
Columbia to maintain. The message I am getting from my 
constituents and from the people in British Columbia is that they 
are mad as all get out and they are not going to take it any more. 
They are going to start to fight back.
<P>
	When Bill C-110 passes, the Liberal government will be sending 
British Columbians a message. The message is that they had better 
get used to this because with all the vetoes that have have been 
spread out all over the country, especially the veto given to the 
separatist government in the province of Quebec, the constitutional 
changes, changes in Parliament and changes in the way that 
government does business will never happen.
<P>
	The people in British Columbia are being told to sit down, shut 
up and be grateful for whatever small crumbs are being thrown 
their way. Members opposite may be surprised to find out that this 
approach will no longer wash with British Columbians. We will not 
be denied our rightful place in Canada any longer.
<P>
	I join with other British Columbians who will fight to see that 
the government does not accomplish what other governments have 
tried to do. That is when the people of British Columbia will see no 
other option than to follow in the footsteps of the province of 
Quebec.
<P>

<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> It does not happen too often in Parliament that we 
get a new table officer, as they usually stay with us for decades. 
However, at this time I would like to take a moment on behalf of 
the House to welcome him.
<P>
	I would like our new table officer, Tranquillo Marrocco, to 
please stand. Welcome to the House of Commons. I wish you well 
and many years with us.
<P>

<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish to 
join you in welcoming the new staff member to the House.
<P>
	I am pleased to participate in the debate, at second reading, on 
Bill C-110, an act respecting constitutional amendments.
<P>
	This bill is meant to embody the commitments made by the 
Prime Minister during the Quebec referendum campaign, 
particularly in a speech made in Verdun, on October 27.
<P>
	The Prime Minister's answer to the results of the referendum is 
clearly less than what was proposed in the Meech Lake and 
Charlottetown accords.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17599"> 17599 </A></B>
<P>
	As for the motion tabled by the government to recognize Quebec 
as a distinct society, it merely provides a symbolic and meaningless 
recognition, with no real substance. The motion passed yesterday 
merely describes Quebec's reality: its French-speaking majority, 
its unique culture and its civil law tradition.
<P>
	However, a few days after tabling that motion, the Prime 
Minister refused to acknowledge the existence of a Quebec culture. 
This is quite the contradiction.
<P>
	Bill C-110 on an so-called veto for Quebec does not go any 
farther in terms of meeting Quebecers' expectations. This is a bad 
piece of legislation, done in a hurry and without any substance. 
Even some Quebec Liberals are starting to criticize that bill. It is 
not an acceptable proposal for Quebecers. The referendum results 
clearly show that people want real change.
<P>
	It was the government's intention with this bill to put us into an 
awkward position by forcing us to say no to the veto and to the 
distinct society. But we have the people of Quebec behind us.
<P>
	I have met many voters from my riding of Bourassa, in Montreal 
North, in recent days and I have asked what they think. The vast 
majority do not approve of the federal government's proposals. 
They ask: ``Why would we accept something that contains less than 
the Charlottetown accord turned down by 56 per cent of Quebecers 
in the 1992 referendum?''
<P>
	As I have said, the concept of a distinct society is even less than 
what was in Meech.
<P>
	First of all, neither the concept of a distinct society nor the right 
of veto will be entrenched in the Constitution. Recognition of the 
distinct society will be nothing more than a simple statement by the 
House of Commons.
<P>
	If Bill C-110 become law, it can easily be amended or repealed 
by the present government or any other in the future. The Reform 
Party has come out clearly against this bill. If they were to win the 
elections-not that I would wish it-this law would most definitely 
disappear.
<P>
	Certain provinces, such as British Columbia and Alberta, have 
already expressed their opposition to the concept of Quebec as a 
distinct society.
<P>
	As I was saying, this bill on the right to a regional veto was 
poorly drafted. Initially, the federal government was committed to 
not proposing any constitutional amendments without setting itself 
the obligation of obtaining the consent of the four major regions of 
Canada: Quebec, Ontario, two eastern provinces and two western 
provinces, provided that in each case those two provinces 
accounted for more than 50 per cent of the population in their 
region.
<P>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
	However, 24 hours after excluding such a possibility, the federal 
government has now included a veto for British Columbia. Ottawa 
seems to be improvising its  policy as it goes along. Practically 
speaking, this decision also gives Alberta a veto, since two 
provinces in the new Prairies region with at least 50 per cent of the 
population will have to give their approval for an amendment to the 
Constitution.
<P>
	According to the 1991 census, Alberta has 54.6 per cent of the 
population of the Prairies. Because of this double veto, from now 
on any amendment to the Constitution becomes virtually 
impossible. Tomorrow the federal government will give a veto to 
all the provinces including Prince Edward Island. I wonder what 
the criteria are, demographic or otherwise, for obtaining a veto. 
Does this bill have any serious purpose?
<P>
	In 35 years, successive governments in Quebec have requested 
the patriation of legislative powers essential to the economic, 
social and cultural development of the province. Since I arrived in 
Montreal in 1974, I have found that all governments, the Parti 
Quebecois as well as the Liberal Party, have demanded a real 
constitutional veto for Quebec and not a mere legislative measure 
that can be easily changed or abrogated later on.
<P>
	We can assume that in the case of a major conflict between 
English Canada and Quebec, the federal Parliament will override 
the veto given Quebec in this bill. That is why this insignificant 
veto was even rejected by many people who voted no in the 
referendum on October 30.
<P>
	Furthermore, Bill C-110 does not guarantee that the Quebec 
National Assembly will be the sole possessor of this veto, as 
demanded by all Quebec governments. The federal government 
reserves the right to seek the consent of the provinces by means of a 
national or regional referendum, as required. It will be able to 
consult citizens directly, without going through the provinces.
<P>
	The main weakness in this bill is its failure to recognize the 
Quebec people and the status and powers that would accompany 
this recognition. The bill refuses to recognize one of the founding 
peoples of Confederation.
<P>
	This bill has raised a ground swell of opposition from almost all 
parties, the Bloc Quebecois, of course, the Reform Party and even 
the Conservative Party, which was a meek ally of the federal 
government during the referendum campaign.
<P>
	The government hurriedly changed its mind to give a veto to 
British Columbia and, indirectly, to Alberta. By doing so it is trying 
to please everybody, but the effect is exactly the opposite.
<P>
	A recent poll shows that a majority of Quebecers consider 
Ottawa's proposals inadequate. The constitutional amending 
formula providing for the agreement of seven provinces with 50 
per cent of the population was already considered particularly 
restrictive. With this bill, we will need the initial consent of seven 
provinces with 92 per cent of the population.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise today to speak against Bill C-110.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Not another one.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Simcoe Centre):</B> Yes indeed.
<P>
	Ontario feels very strongly about what is happening here and I 
am pleased to be able to stand up and represent that voice. We are 
here because of a promise that was made in panic, a knee jerk 
reaction. It was a reaction to what was a dishonest question. It was 
a dishonest question that never at any time had the Canada 
response. What was Canada's response to the dishonest question 
that was being posed by the separatists?
<P>
	To indicate how much of a panic the government is operating in, 
the fact that British Columbia was originally excluded from this 
bill is unbelievable. However, it is testimony to the complete lack 
of thought and planning that went into this and attests to the fact 
that all of this has been nothing but a knee jerk reaction to the 
separatist agenda, rather than standing up to them.
<P>
	I would like to go back and cover a little of the history that has 
brought us to this point. In June 1994 Reformers wrote a letter to 
the Prime Minister asking 20 questions that needed to be answered 
in advance of a separatist referendum. The Prime Minister never 
answered those 20 questions and when we raised them in the House 
they were dismissed as hypothetical, ``it isn't going to happen, 
don't worry, be happy''.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> And it didn't.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Simcoe Centre):</B> No thanks to this government it 
did not. It was thanks to the Canadian people that it did not. Had 
those 20 questions been responded to the people in the province of 
Quebec that voted no thinking they were going to have it all ways 
would have known better.
<P>
	It was interesting that the don't worry, be happy response is still 
being used by the Prime Minister. It was used in response to my 
leader's question today about how the government is going to 
ensure that the question will be fair in the next referendum, about 
what powers the government is going to use. That question must 
have  been asked three times today with the standard response of 
don't worry, be happy. Don't worry about it.
<P>
	Canadians have had that don't worry to the point that the country 
was almost lost. I do not know when the time is to start worrying 
but I suggest that it is long overdue.
<P>
	Not only did the government not respond to the what ifs, the 
share of the debt, boundaries, dual citizenship, passports, but at no 
time did it accept Reform's challenge to put forward a positive 
agenda, to give the people in Quebec who wanted to reject the 
separatists a reason to do so and not try to fight the leader of the 
Bloc Quebecois' dream with a bunch of negatives.
<P>
	I am proud to say that we put forward 20 proposals for positive 
change that would have gone a long way to addressing the concerns 
of Canadians inside and outside of Quebec.
<P>
	The other tragedy in the referendum was the failure of the 
government to respond to the 50 per cent plus one which was first 
introduced by Mr. Johnson in Quebec. He was prepared to accept 
the democratic will of the people of Quebec and was going to 
accept 50 per cent plus one, as was the Minister of Labour, the 
government's point person in the referendum. They were both 
prepared to accept 50 per cent plus one as the democratic will of the 
voters of Quebec.
<P>
	The Prime Minister was not prepared to accept that and without 
indicating what he was prepared to accept, he made it easy for 
those people to vote no on the basis that there probably was a better 
deal coming. That was one of the tragedies of the referendum 
which the government did not address. The Prime Minister played 
right into the hands of the separatists in not drawing a line in the 
sand, in making it clear to them what the consequences of 
separation were. As a result of that failed tactic, 30 per cent or 
one-third of the people in Quebec voted thinking that they were 
going to have it all ways.
<P>
	Canada is a blessed country. That was indicated in an article in 
the <I>Globe and Mail</I> just a couple of weeks ago. The headline was 
that Canada is blessed but stressed. All Canadians are stressed both 
inside and outside of Quebec. This bill just adds to that stress. It 
does nothing to address it. It is a disunity bill and not a unity bill. 
Make no mistake about it, we must change because Canadians are 
demanding change. The 1993 election, when 205 new members 
were elected into the House, and the referendum on October 30 
were strong messages that Canadians want change. More than that, 
Canadians want a voice in what that change will be. However, this 
bill denies that Canadian voice.
<P>
	The separatists were given 30 days to spread their break-up 
Canada message. In the House because of closure the Canadian 
voice has been given three days. The separatists had 30 days. 
Because of closure, after only three days of debate the government 
is cutting off  debate and ramming it through in spite of the 
Canadian people, who have already rejected it. The Liberals tried 
this at the front door and Canadians said they do not want it. Now 
they will bring it in through the back door. So much for open

<P>
government, listening the people, freer votes in the House of 
Commons and members of Parliament who represent the people in 
their ridings.
<P>
	The majority of Canadians do not want this bill. Quebec does not 
want this bill. Who are we doing it for? The bill will not unite us. 
The bill gives a veto to a separatist government. It is unbelievable 
that the government would do this. If it is to give a veto, give it to 
the people of that province. Trust the voters. That is what has been 
missing in this place. We need to restore the level of trust that has 
been lost. This bill does nothing to restore that trust. It alienates the 
voters.

amend the National Housing Act, be read the third time and passed.
<P>
<B>(1805 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réginald Bélair (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Public Works and Government Services,  Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to have the opportunity to speak in support of Bill 
C-108, an act to amend the National Housing Act.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17605"> 17605 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I would like to point out at the outset that Bill C-108 deals with a 
purely administrative matter. It is essentially aimed at setting the 
maximum amount of all outstanding loans insured by the mortgage 
insurance fund.
<P>
	This bill will amend the National Housing Act by increasing the 
authorized ceiling of outstanding loans from $100 billion to $150 
billion, thus allowing the CHMC to continue offering mortgage 
insurance services throughout Canada.
<P>
	I want to stress that this $50 billion increase is not an 
expenditure and is not costing the government anything. The bill 
also stipulates that any future increase in the aggregate amount of 
outstanding loans is subject to parliamentary approval.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	While the amendments contained in the bill represent 
administrative matters, passage of the bill is essential to the 
continued operation of CMHC's mortgage loan insurance.
<P>
	The federal government provides mortgage loan insurance to all 
Canadians regardless of where they live in Canada, at the smallest 
feasible down payment and the lowest possible cost. Due to the 
success of mortgage loan insurance, the current ceiling needs to be 
increased to allow CMHC to continue to insure new mortgages.
<P>
	In 1994 CMHC's total mortgage insurance activity was over 
$24.7 billion, representing over 300,000 units. Approximately 40 
per cent of the mortgage stock in Canada has involved financing 
with CMHC mortgage insurance. As well, approximately one-third 
of the housing stock in Canada was built with the help of National 
Housing Act insured financing.
<P>
	Allow me to take a minute to explain why this bill is so 
important to Canadians.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Housing is a basic need. It is generally recognized that access to 
affordable and adequate housing is essential to individual 
well-being and therefore to a healthy, productive society. It goes 
without saying that a well-housed person is more inclined to 
contribute to the community.
<P>
	For these reasons, the desire to own a home remains strong 
among Canadian people.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	CMHC mortgage loan insurance allows Canadians to access 
affordable housing. Homebuyers can secure up to 95 per cent 
financing from an approved lender because CMHC insures the 
loans that are made by the approved  lender. Because CMHC will 
assume the risk should a borrower default, mortgage lenders are 
able to make available more money to finance mortgages for 
Canadians and at lower cost than would otherwise be possible, 
thereby making home ownership more affordable.
<P>
	With CMHC assuming the risk of borrower default, lenders are 
able to reduce the mortgage financing rates. Lower mortgage 
financing rates mean more affordable homes for Canadians.
<P>
	One of the most important aspects of CMHC's mortgage loan 
insurance is its public policy mandate to provide equal access to 
mortgage financing at the lowest possible cost for all Canadians 
regardless of where they live in Canada. This equal access is made 
possible through the pooling of higher risk business with lower risk 
business.
<P>
	Without access to CMHC's mortgage loan insurance, Canadians 
in some parts of the country would have to come up with the 
conventional 25 per cent of the value of the house as a down 
payment.
<P>
	Needless to say, many Canadians would hardly ever be able to 
purchase a home if this were the case. CMHC's mortgage insurance 
is therefore critical to helping Canadians access home ownership.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The CMHC's mortgage insurance fund is self-financing and 
therefore is not costing the government anything. Under CMHC 
policy, the fund must become self-financing in the long term but 
only through the premiums and fees paid by borrowers.
<P>
	Premiums are equal to a percentage of the loan, which varies 
according to the amount borrowed and the ratio between this 
amount and the value of the property. Premiums are set so that 
there is always enough money in the fund to cover any claims.
<P>
<B>(1810 )</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The government introduced the first home loan insurance 
initiative in 1992 and reduced the minimum required down 
payment to 5 per cent for first time homebuyers. This 5 per cent 
initiative has been a tremendous success in helping to increase 
home ownership in Canada.
<P>
	Since November 1993 over 235,000 Canadian households have 
taken advantage of the lower down payment to become the proud 
owners of either a new or existing home. First home loan insurance 
is an excellent example of CMHC's ability to adapt its mortgage 
loan insurance activity to ensure that Canadians can enjoy the 
benefits of home ownership.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17606"> 17606 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Some have suggested that the government should get out of the 
business of mortgage loan insurance and leave it to private 
industry. But it is important to know that, without CMHC 
providing mortgage insurance, Canadians would be forced to deal 
with a private sector monopoly, which would result in higher prices 
and fewer choices.
<P>
	We must also bear in mind that the NHA mortgage loan 
insurance provides Canadians with equal access to mortgage 
insurance in whatever part of the country they live in.
<P>
	GE Capital Mortgage Co, our competitor, does not provide 
similar services in 18 areas in the country. Competition is the best 
way to keep prices at the lowest possible level to encourage 
innovation in the mortgage industry to meet the changing needs of 
Canadian consumers.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It has been suggested that CMHC should get out of the mortgage 
loan insurance business and leave it to the provinces. I would like 
to point out that the federal government has a constitutional 
responsibility for banking and finance. CMHC mortgage insurance 
and guarantee are a demonstration that the federal government is 
fulfilling this responsibility.
<P>
	Without CMHC, there would be a federal policy vacuum in the 
system of housing finance. The result would be unequal access to 
home loans across the country. Furthermore, borrowers of modest 
means could pay more for low down payment mortgages or have no 
access to financing altogether. Housing constitutes an engine of 
economic growth responsible for creating many thousands of jobs 
and business opportunities in communities across the country.
<P>
	Housing accounts for about 7 per cent of the world's domestic 
product, over half of all construction and one out of every 12 jobs 
in Canada. House construction and renovations create jobs and 
business opportunities. For every $100 million of construction 
spending, 2,310 person-years of employment are created on site 
and in directly related supply and service industries.
<P>
	The federal government through CMHC has been providing 
national mortgage insurance for four decades in Canada. CMHC 
has remained a significant player throughout this time with a 
mandate from the federal government to provide mortgage 
insurance to support loans to all Canadian homebuyers regardless 
of where they live in Canada at the smallest feasible down payment 
and the lowest feasible cost.
<P>
	In conclusion, today the private housing market is able to meet 
the housing needs of the vast majority of Canadian households. 
There is no doubt that CMHC's mortgage loan insurance has 
played a critical role in that achievement.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
this House today to participate in this debate on Bill C-108 to 
remind the hon. members how important social housing is.
<P>
	Social housing is an issue of great concern to me because I know 
how much some of the people in my riding who are living under the 
poverty line-50 per cent of the people in my riding are living 
under the poverty line and 28 per cent are on welfare-rely on 
social housing.
<P>
	That is why, in April 1994, I presented in this House a motion 
requesting that several major measures be initiated, such as 
entering into agreements with the Government of Quebec to 
reactivate the co-operative housing program, putting in place a 
rental housing renovation assistance program and restoring the 
public housing program, and that Quebec oversee, of course, every 
aspect of these programs.
<P>
<B>(1815)</B>
<P>
	In response to that motion, government members assured me 
that social housing was a laudable and important principle. In 
particular, the parliamentary secretary to the solicitor general told 
me, with a hand on his heart, about the great co-operation between 
Quebec and its big brother, the federal government. He even 
criticized me, sardonically, for asking that the province be given 
back the moneys allocated to social housing, given the harmony 
that prevailed.
<P>
	Nothing is settled yet. Worse still, particularly for a government 
elected on the basis of its commitments to social justice and 
dignity, nothing was even done. Nothing at all. As we say, nothing 
not. Sure, the nice principles remain nice. They are still used 
occasionally to illustrate the virtues of certain policies, particularly 
federal ones. We no longer believe them. But, for my constituents, 
for other Quebecers, and even for Canadians, nothing has changed.
<P>
	Figures do not lie. They do not indulge in nice rhetoric. They do 
not wax eloquently on noble feelings. Figures are there and they 
tell the story. What do they tell us or, rather, what do they keep 
telling? They tell us that nothing has changed. Last year, the federal 
government did not build a single social housing unit. This year, it 
is a repeat performance, zero. You heard me right, zero. The federal 
government is no longer involved in building social housing units. 
It is content to express noble feelings.
<P>
	Figures also tell us that, from 1989-90 to 1993-94, Quebec 
received barely 19 per cent of the total money spent by the CMHC. 
Yet, 25 per cent of the country's population live in Quebec. 
Moreover, during that same period, Quebec accounted for close to 
30 per cent of Canadians living in inadequate dwellings.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17607"> 17607 </A></B>
<P>
	Then they tell us that the federation is good for Quebecers. They 
try to make us feel guilty to want to leave such a nice family, a 
family that is so fair to one of its children. The facts speak for 
themselves, and eloquently so. For five years, the federal 
government acted in an absolutely unfair manner towards 
Quebecers living in inadequate dwellings. Then, it totally withdrew 
its support to social housing. It did not care at all. The results are 
tragic for Quebec: an estimated $1.3 billion shortfall, taking into 
account existing needs.
<P>
	In the meantime, our Ontario neighbours, who were so fond of us 
just before the referendum, took considerable advantage of the 
federal manna. Now, let us look at figures. In 1991-92, Quebec 
received 19.3 per cent of the expenditures of the Central Mortgage 
and Housing Corporation. Ontario got 34 per cent. This is a 
difference of 14.7 per cent. I am not making it up, these are the 
figures.
<P>
	In 1992-93, the difference between Quebec and Ontario was 16.8 
per cent and, in 1993-94, it was 14.1 per cent. As I said a few 
moments ago, the figures speak very clearly. For those in my riding 
with housing problems, the figures do not count for much. What 
counts is results. In their experience, public housing is becoming a 
very rare commodity, especially in Quebec.
<P>
	My constituents know that, for many of them, public housing is 
often their only means of getting decent and affordable housing. 
The 4,300 single mothers waiting for public housing in my riding 
know this to be so and do not find the situation amusing. The 
federal government got out of public housing without transferring 
tax points in exchange. Quebec is now stuck, as is happening in 
more and more instances, with needs to fill and no money to do it. 
So much for their great federalism, we have no use for it.
<P>
<B>(1820 )</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Comox-Alberni, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to have the opportunity to speak on Bill C-108, an act to 
amend the National Housing Act.
<P>
	Bill C-108 proposes to increase the aggregate amount of 
outstanding Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, CMHC, 
loan insurance from $100 billion to $150 billion, plus any 
additional amounts that may be authorized by Parliament. Put 
simply, Bill C-108 increases CMHC's liability limit by $50 billion.
<P>
	Many members on the government side seem to think that $50 
billion in liability is not a big deal and they are affronted that 
Reform is questioning the bill. They are in such a hurry that they 
pushed clause by clause consideration of Bill C-108 through 
standing committee in a record 30 seconds, a record 30 seconds for 
$50 billion. This is hardly the fiscally responsible approach that 
Canadians expect from their government.
<P>
	Our deficit continues to be a reality that will not go away until 
something constructive is done. The debt load that each taxpayer 
has to carry is immobilizing the nation. Yet the Liberals continue to 
overspend. The Liberals are not cutting back; they are spending 
more. For example, last year alone their spending increased by $2.8 
billion.
<P>
	The national debt is presently at $566 billion and is increasing 
every second. Canadians are so strapped with debt that they cannot 
move forward. It is little wonder, given this situation, that the 
housing market has slowed to a crawl in Canada. The average 
person simply does not have the money or financial security 
required to invest in a long term mortgage. Increasing the loan 
liabilities for CMHC will not change the hard financial reality that 
many Canadians are facing today.
<P>
	The government promised jobs and it promised deficit reduction. 
Yet Canadians are facing higher unemployment and more taxes. 
Things are not getting better, and the government refuses to make 
the changes necessary to turn things around.
<P>
	The Liberals are still practising the same old politics that got 
Canada into this deficit in the first place. Liberals are spending, 
buying jobs, artificially propping up private industry and messing 
up private markets. All this does is drive us deeper into debt.
<P>
	Increasing the CMHC liability limit for insuring mortgages is 
nothing more than government speculation without money. The 
government has done this on several occasions. For example, Bill 
C-91 expanded the loan liability of the Federal Business 
Development Bank from approximately $4 billion to $22 billion.
<P>
	Bill C-75 increased government loan liability for farm 
improvement and marketing co-operative loans from $1.5 billion 
to $3 billion. Outstanding loans under the Small Business Loans 
Act rose from $3 billion to $6 billion in 1995 and is now up to $12 
billion. This is only a small segment of Liberal initiatives to 
increase federal loan liability.
<P>
	Although liabilities may not involve borrowing money, they are 
a risk that if defaulted will cost taxpayers money. The government 
has grown accustomed to handing out grants left, right and centre. 
Accordingly government liability simply increases our chances of 
going deeper into debt.
<P>
	In addition, Canadians should be particularly concerned that the 
government does not know what its outstanding liabilities are at 
this time. CMHC could not tell me its outstanding liability at this 
time or 10 or 15 years down the road. This is not acceptable.
<P>
	Liabilities are risks. When mortgages are defaulted these 
liabilities fall back on the taxpayer. When the bill was in the House 
for second reading a few weeks ago, Reform members asked the 
Liberals again and again who pays on defaulted mortgages.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17608"> 17608 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Forseth:</B> Who pays?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilmour:</B> The taxpayer pays. Let me make that perfectly 
clear to members on the government side because there was a great 
deal of confusion with government members on the Reform 
position on the bill. We are not advocating an end to CMHC 
mortgage insurance. We are saying that $100 billion worth of 
liability is enough. The government does not need to add another 
$50 billion in liabilities.
<P>
<B>(1825)</B>
<P>
	The fact that the government is asking for the additional liability 
to be retroactive to 1994 indicates that CMHC has already 
overextended its liability limits. Canadians should be concerned 
that CMHC needs to increase its liability funds, not only because 
there is no guarantee outstanding liabilities will not cost taxpayers 
but because there are obvious problems with government 
management of CMHC programs and funding.
<P>
	I mentioned earlier that CMHC does not know what its 
outstanding liabilities are. This should concern many Canadians 
because CMHC does not appear to be keeping records of its 
outstanding liabilities to the expiry of its term 10, 15 or 20 years 
into the future.
<P>
	To illustrate, access to information requests reveal, first, that 
CMHC does not have records of how much money it has forgiven 
under its residential rehabilitation assistance program. Second, it 
does not keep records of past contracts, only of current contracts. 
Third, it has no centralized records of the financial subsidy 
amounts and operating agreements for many of its programs, 
including its public housing program. Fourth, no centralized 
records were kept of moneys going into its aboriginal programs, 
which is a major component of CMHC. This is only the tip of the 
iceberg.
<P>
	If the government through CMHC is to be doling out money and 
insuring loans, surely it should keep track of what it is spending, 
how much it owes and how much it is liable for. If the corporation 
cannot keep track of its fiscal activities, we should not be 
increasing its liabilities, especially by another $50 billion. This is 
not only irresponsible. It is absolutely ridiculous, particularly when 
we consider our debt situation.
<P>
	The bill is not only a step toward deeper fiscal uncertainty. It is 
clearly a move in the wrong direction. The government should not 
be leaning toward a greater federal role in housing but rather 
toward a more decentralized government role.
<P>
	Whatever happened to the Prime Minister's promise to 
decentralize federal powers? It has obviously gone out the window 
with many other Liberal promises.
<P>
	Canadians do not want a bloated federal government. They do 
not want the federal government meddling in every level of 
provincial, municipal and private  enterprise affairs. Canadians 
want a leaner, more efficient federal government.
<P>
	The minister responsible for CMHC claims that his department 
is moving toward a smaller organization. Yet if the federal 
government is downsizing and moving away from the housing 
market, why is it asking for another $50 billion in mortgage 
money? It does not fit.
<P>
	This will not downsize federal responsibilities. On the contrary, 
it will strengthen and increase the federal role. It is time for the 
federal government to realign its responsibilities with other 
governments. Canadians are taxed beyond belief from all levels of 
government. They have simply had enough.
<P>
	The federal government is long overdue in easing out of a 
number of responsibilities duplicated at the provincial level. 
Canadians want a clear separation of responsibility between levels 
of government. They want a shift of power away from bureaucrats 
toward the people who pay for the programs in the first place. 
Canadians want an end to federal interference in the private sector. 
They do not want or need big brother meddling in their affairs, and 
Bill C-108 allows CMHC to significantly increase its presence in 
the mortgage market.
<P>
	It is time for the government to allow private industry to do what 
it does best: offer consumers competitive mortgage rates. It is time 
for the government to stop interfering in the housing industry. 
Canadians want a clear separation of responsibility between levels 
of government and they want responsibility toward the people.
<P>
<B>(1830 )</B>
<P>
	It is time for the government to get out of the face of private 
industry. Reformers are saying we do not want an increase of the 
$50 billion. We are not saying CMHC should get out of the market, 
but $50 billion is too much and because of that we will oppose this 
bill.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, many 
petitions have been submitted in the House since this government 
took office, and several of them, from all over the country, 
concerned social housing.
<P>
	I personally submitted a number of such petitions. The former 
Conservative government gradually withdrew from the social 
housing sector by adopting various measures.
<P>
	In 1989, it withdrew from the rental housing rehabilitation 
program. In 1992, it took another devastating measure in that it 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17609"> 17609 </A></B>
<P>
reduced by 21 per cent the number of new housing units. In 1993, it 
ended the long term financing of new low-cost housing units. As 
well, the RRAP, which provided assistance to repair social housing 
units, was abolished. Quebec thus sustained a major shortfall.
<P>
	This Liberal government made promises during the last election 
campaign. In October 1993, several Liberal candidates, including 
the current Minister of Foreign Affairs, attended a meeting with 
officials from the Confédération des coopératives d'habitation de 
la grande région de Montréal, and made commitments regarding 
social housing. Among other measures, they were supposed to 
unfreeze the CMHC budget, so as to make it possible to build 5,800 
new co-op housing units in Canada. They were also supposed to 
re-examine the percentage of investment required of the 
municipalities. Hooray for this wonderful platform. But after 
October 25, 1993, as if by magic, the Liberal government forgot its 
commitments.
<P>
	Let us look at what the Liberals have done since they came to 
power. They have dashed all hopes of new housing units being 
built. They have required CMHC to turn back to the government 
close to $270 million saved in current operating expenses which 
could have been ploughed back into the community.
<P>
	In 1995, this government pressured the provinces to raise rents 
in social housing. Six provinces gave in, while Quebec made it 
clear that it would not. The present government is quite simply 
continuing along the same political path as the Conservatives 
before it.
<P>
	Yet the last time they campaigned, the Liberals condemned the 
brutal cuts in subsidized housing. Even the Minister of Finance, the 
same gentleman who predicted that one million jobs would 
disappear if Quebec voted yes in the referendum, himself 
committed to ensuring secure, guaranteed funding for social 
housing. Nothing has come of this. In Quebec, the losses over the 
past five years are estimated at very close to a billion dollars.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois cannot tolerate such a situation. Social 
housing is more than a roof over people's heads. It is a vital 
element of economic and social policy. A good housing program 
must enable people to acquire a feeling of social identity and must 
provide them with the opportunity to control one of the factors 
influencing their lives.
<P>
	For example, a co-operative housing project allows its members 
to live within a co-operative framework. Often various recreational 
activities are organized. Furthermore, members have to get 
involved in running their co-operative. Without their social 
housing, many of them would live in isolation. By dropping social 
housing, the government aggravates housing conditions that in turn 
substantially increase other problems such as poverty and hunger. 
Poverty, hunger and housing are closely linked.
<P>
<B>(1835)</B>
<P>
	Consider the situation in my riding. In Chicoutimi, more than 
9,000 households or 44 per cent are tenants. Of that number, 3,000 
have to spend more than 30 per  cent of their income on housing. 
This is unacceptable. This percentage is critical. Thirty-five per 
cent of tenants face this kind of situation. And more than 16 per 
cent spend half their income on housing.
<P>
	This is a situation that has dramatic consequences and must be 
corrected. To pay the rent, an increasing number of tenants are 
obliged to cut back on essentials like food. In many households, 
even that is not enough. The statistics of the Régie du logement 
show that the number of tenants behind in their rent is increasing, 
not because they are more reluctant to pay but because the 
proportion of their income they must spend on rent is too high.
<P>
	In its health and welfare policy, the Quebec government stated in 
1992: ``The cost of housing is a major item in a family's budget. If 
the cost of housing constantly causes major cuts in the budget for 
food, clothing and recreation, the quality of physical and mental 
health will be affected''.
<P>
	In 1993, the UN committee on economic, social and cultural 
rights published a report on poverty in Canada. The report paints a 
damning picture of the housing situation. This committee was 
surprised to learn that social housing expenditures did not exceed 
1.3 per cent of public spending.
<P>
	In this era marked by a lack of permanent jobs and basic social 
rights, social housing is an important problem and will become 
increasingly so. The very health of those living in inadequate 
housing is at stake. We know who these people usually are: women 
who are the main breadwinners in their families, people who live 
alone, single parent families.
<P>
	To tackle the problem, the government must substantially 
increase investments in housing, which would result in significant 
savings in health and social services. We must also consider the 
considerable impact on employment, which would be very 
beneficial at this time.
<P>
	The government should develop an ambitious housing policy 
focused on building new social housing units by the year 2000, 
with a view to offering quality, environmentally sound housing, 
with adequate services and facilities for handicapped and mobility 
impaired people, among others.

	<B>Hon. Sheila Finestone (for the Minister of Industry)</B> moved 
that Bill C-99, an act to amend the Small Business Loans Act, be 
read the third time and passed.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Again, under the terms of the agreement, 
a member from each party will be allowed to speak to this bill for 
10 minutes.

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to speak 
on third and final reading of the amendments to the Small Business 
Loans Act.
<P>
	I will review some of the initiatives we have accomplished in the 
industry committee over the last year. It is important to do this 
because I see in the House tonight the member for Okanagan and 
the member for Trois-Rivières, the members who led the debate on 
behalf of their parties.
<P>
<B>(1840)</B>
<P>
	The industry committee in the last year was one of the most 
unique committees on Parliament Hill. When the public sees 
Members of Parliament getting together, especially in the chamber, 
all it sees is the adversarial debate. It sees by and large the 
experience of question period, which is such a misleading image of 
what the Parliament of Canada is all about.
<P>
	This will be my last speech in the House for this year on matters 
related to industry and on the whole issue of access to capital. To 
the members for Trois-Rivières and Okanagan, it was a real 
pleasure.
<P>
	When I leave the House to go back to whatever I will do when it 
is all over and reflect on my experience in Ottawa, I will say one of 
the most productive years in Ottawa was working on this 
committee when our focus was so united on the whole issue of 
access to capital for small and medium size business men and 
women.
<P>
	I believe with all of our differences on distinct society and veto 
and so on, and goodness knows there are a lot of other issues we 
have differ on, there is one common cause shared by every member 
of the House: the small business community represents the greatest 
hope for putting Canadians back to work.
<P>
	The number one issue or the number one difficulty that 
community faces is issue of access to sufficient capital to support 
its risks, to support its basic business activity. If we move the banks 
an inch, and I think we have moved them only an inch, it is because 
banking institutions have not been able to break up or divide the 
industry committee. We have worked as a team.
<P>
	I have to confess to Canadians that the best lobby system on 
Parliament Hill is the financial institutions. They have a way of 
lobbying and intimidating, but we held firm in our convictions, in 
our cause in the last year. I hope that over the next year we can keep 
that type of commitment. Whoever else is on the industry 
committee, I hope they carry on with the torch and keep that cause 
moving forward.
<P>
	I am optimistic about this. Last night I watched the Prime 
Minister in the second national town hall meeting. Canadians from 
across the country asked the Prime Minister many questions. I 
remember vividly the question from a small business entrepreneur 
who ran a grocery business. He asked the Prime Minister when he 
was going to get serious about his commitment to take on the 
banks.
<P>
<B>(1845)</B>
<P>
	I was pleased that question was put to the Prime Minister and for 
a split second it caught the Prime Minister off guard. The Prime 
Minister is well aware that we are working hard on the issue. 
Because we are working as a team one would think we would be 
moving the banks forward, but it is such a small movement that it 
has not really impacted yet. The Prime Minister said that we have 
been working on that.
<P>
	The idea was put forward by the member of Parliament for 
Trinity-Spadina. He has been pushing, debating and arguing for 
the past year and a half that all banks in Canada should have a 
target of approximately 30 per cent of their total corporate loan 
portfolio devoted to the small business sector. I was stunned that 
the Prime Minister mentioned that objective. Many members of the 
committee thought that the member for Trinity-Spadina was 
being overly aggressive in directing the banks on to whom they 
should lend money. I opposed the member's recommendation that 
these targets be put in writing.
<P>
	I am beginning to think that maybe the member for 
Trinity-Spadina was right when he told us a year ago that the 
banks were not really going to deal with the issue unless we gave 
them a specific benchmark. The member for Okanagan remembers 
how we almost ganged up on our fellow member saying that we 
cannot go quite that far, that we cannot dictate 30 per cent of the 
total loan portfolio.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order. My hon. colleague does not seem 
to realize that the agreement was said to be a maximum of 
10-minute speeches for anybody from the three parties speaking on 
the bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
summary, the bill before us tonight is a reinforcement of the 
government's commitment to support small business loan activity. 
We have accepted amendments to the bill from the Reform Party.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17611"> 17611 </A></B>
<P>
	I hope that as we head into the new year which is just around the 
corner, that the signal all members of the House have sent to all the 
financial institutions through speedy passage of bills and through 
the speedy and united recommendations in our ``Taking Care of 
Small Business'' report will be recognized.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
with pleasure that I rise to participate in the debate at third reading 
on Bill C-99, an act to amend the Small Business Loans Act.
<P>
	Before going any further, I would like to make a few comments 
about what our colleague, the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Industry, said. If I understand correctly, our colleague 
told us that he was leaving at least-unless I misunderstood-the 
Standing Committee on Industry, if not the House itself.
<P>
<B>(1850)</B>
<P>
	In any event, if he is indeed planning to leave the industry 
committee, I would like to tell him again-I say again because I 
already had the opportunity to tell him through the Speaker-how 
much I appreciated working with him and what a distinguished 
parliamentarian the hon. member for Broadview-Greenwood is. I 
was in a position to appreciate his many fine qualities and his great 
contribution to the work of the committee. As a man, I have always 
considered the hon. member to be a liberal in the noblest sense of 
the word and a humanist as well. I hope to have the pleasure of 
continuing to work with him.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> A true liberal.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rocheleau:</B> A true liberal. The personification of distinct 
society.
<P>
	I shall now turn to Bill C-99, and to make the most constructive 
criticism possible. We must bear in mind that Bill C-99 was 
introduced as a result of one the measures announced in the last 
budget speech, when the finance minister expressed hope that the 
Small Business Loans Act would become self-financing. As we 
know, in 1993, the administration of this act is said to have cost the 
public purse in terms of coverage-let us call it bad debt for the 
sake of discussion-nearly $32 million on a $4 billion small 
business envelope.
<P>
	This $32 million in lost income for the government is expected 
to grow to approximately $100 million this year on an envelope 
now totalling $12 billion; that is how much can be loaned to small 
business through lending institutions.
<P>
	We agree that this is a burden that must not be overlooked, a 
burden on the taxpayers. But at the same time, we believe that, 
before limiting in any way the scope of this bill, which is a good 
bill, the government should conduct-and this is one of the 
recommendations made by the official opposition that was almost 
approved  by the industry committee-a cost-benefit analysis of 
administering the act. Because, if the $32 million or $100 million 
in question are considered as money injected by the government in 
the economy, then we have less trouble talking about this shortfall.
<P>
	Talking not only of cost, whether it be $32 million or $100 
million, but also of benefits, would give a better idea of the jobs 
created, the direct and indirect taxes collected by the government 
because of such job creation and the survival or expansion of 
companies as a result of incentives provided by this act.
<P>
	We know the social and economic importance of jobs-there are 
consequences, we will never say it enough and this is a particularly 
good forum to do so-and of lower unemployment; it may be better 
education for children, less family violence, less violence against 
women, less violence against children. It may also lead to a 
lowering in drug consumption; it may be workers more inclined to 
do their bit to get the economy rolling, that is for sure.
<P>
	Coming back to this act, before amending it in a significant way, 
we should bear in mind all the benefits. Unfortunately, the 
government did not accept the recommendation of the official 
opposition which had been approved by the industry committee.
<P>
	Now for the particular provisions of the bill we do not agree 
with. There are three of them. The first one is the liability, whereby 
the government guarantees 90 per cent of the loan provided by a 
lending institution. This liability will be reduced from 90 per cent 
to 85 per cent. This is our first objection. The second one deals with 
the fact that we still require personal securities. Thirdly, 
administration fees will be offloaded onto borrowers through 
higher interest rates.
<P>
<B>(1855)</B>
<P>
	As I was saying, our first objection deals with the reduction in 
liability from 90 per cent to 85 per cent. We argue that it will have 
particular significance for smaller lending institutions. In Quebec, 
this means the caisses populaires you find in every village and 
which make only a few dozen loans per year and which, seeing 
their protection lowered, will be inclined to lower their risks, and 
therefore limit their loans to the most secure businesses. Therefore, 
the effect on smaller lending institutions will probably be felt 
rather quickly.
<P>
	Our second objection is even more important, because this bill 
will have particular impact on high tech businesses, which are the 
future of our economic development. These businesses are based 
on the knowledge, the expertise and the skills of the employer, the 
owner-manager, who cannot offer tangibles guarantees to the credit 
institution. All he can offer is his skills, which are impalpable, 
intangible. Therefore, there is a higher risk for the credit institu-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17612"> 17612 </A></B>
<P>
tion; the same thing is  true for businesses which are starting and 
have no background, who have nothing to offer.
<P>
	Since they have no records to show, these businesses cannot 
reassure the bank. Consequently, the banker's risk being higher, it 
is expected that it will be the high tech businesses on which we are 
counting increasingly, as well as the new businesses that will be 
mostly affected by these new provisions.
<P>
	Particularly if the government sees, in the coming years, that 
only 85 per cent coverage is still not sufficient, it may further 
reduce its risk. It will be able to reduce it to 80 or 75 or 70 per cent, 
and this, by way of regulation, without holding a debate in the 
House, without permitting us to talk about the borrowers' interests, 
without permitting us to face the executive branch and either 
applaud or condemn the government's policies. To act by way of 
regulation in such a matter is not very nice.
<P>
	The second major objection, the one which maintains the 
personal guarantee that could be required by the lender, was a 
commitment made in the red book of the Liberal Party of Canada; 
it was conveniently forgotten. This makes us sad, because we 
believe that, because of the guarantee that the lender enjoys 
through the involvement of the federal government in the 
transaction, personal guarantees could have been applied instead to 
another transaction between the banker and the borrower, who 
could have offered his home, his car or part of his personal wealth 
as a guarantee to develop another type of project that would not be 
covered by the Small Business Loans Act.
<P>
	Finally, we are concerned by the establishment of an 
administration fee the percentage of which could be set through 
regulation, again without any debate, surreptitiously, arbitrarily by 
the government, and also by the fact that the fee provided for in the 
legislation can be passed on to the borrower through interest rates, 
so that the lender can get even richer.
<P>
	Therefore, for these three reasons, we will vote against this bill.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Okanagan Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it is a pleasure to rise to debate Bill C-99, an act to amend certain 
parts of the Small Business Loans Act.
<P>
	I too was rather impressed by the parliamentary secretary's 
comments as to how the industry committee functions. From his 
description of that committee I cannot help but say I have to be one 
of the most fortunate MPs in the federal House of Parliament. My 
first experience in Ottawa was to be made a member of the best 
committee on the Hill. That is really something. My hon. colleague 
has been on other committees and if this is the best committee, that 
is great. The committee has worked well.
<P>
<B>(1900 )</B>
<P>
	What has happened with Bill C-99 is an example of what can be 
done and how Parliament should function because all members put 
aside their partisan differences, their political affiliations and came 
to an agreement on some very significant matters that are 
exemplified by the provisions of the bill.
<P>
	Members of the Reform Party are going to support this bill, 
despite the fact we have some rather grave reservations about the 
whole concept of the Small Business Loans Act. The Small 
Business Loans Act is based on the provision of a form of subsidy 
of certain kinds of financing to private enterprise. The reason we 
can support the bill is because the amendments bring about an 
accountability of that program and it is supposed to have 100 per 
cent cost recovery. If that in fact happens, then some of the our 
concerns are going to be mitigated to the point where they do not 
exist.
<P>
	We also want to support this bill because the Reform Party 
motions that were presented in committee were accepted by the 
committee and by the minister. It is necessary to recognize the 
significant role the Minister of Industry played in this decision. 
Communications went back and forth about the provisions, 
especially the one which removed the authority of Parliament and 
shifted it to the cabinet. This took authority away from the 
representatives of the people and put it in the Privy Council 
committee to make decisions behind closed doors.
<P>
	The committee, as well as the minister, saw that was probably 
not the most democratic thing to do and went so far as to say that it 
should be taken out. An amendment to that effect was presented to 
the committee by the Reform Party and it was accepted.
<P>
	Members need to recognize that these are the kinds of things that 
Parliament really should be doing. In certain instances we should 
put aside political and partisan differences and say that for the good 
of the people of Canada, for the business development of 
Canadians, we need to do something that will help all of us. In this 
instance that was accomplished and it was to the credit of all those 
who had a part in it.
<P>
	I want to talk about the concept behind the Small Business Loans 
Act. Reform Party members do not think that the government 
should take risks on behalf of the taxpayer. Those risks should be 
taken by the private sector. That is why we object to the principle 
behind the Small Business Loans Act. However, that is not our 
concern at this point. Our concern is to make the act better and the 
amendments do that. That should demonstrate to all and sundry 
that the Reform Party is a reasonable party.
<P>
	We recognize there are certain gaps that need to be filled from 
time to time and we have done that. In this instance that has 
happened. I want to credit the  committee, the Minister of Industry 
<P>

<B><A NAME="17613"> 17613 </A></B>
<P>
and the parliamentary secretary on recognizing that and getting to 
work and doing it.
<P>
	The House needs to recognize that the financial industry in 
particular is one of the most difficult industries or institutions to 
move. The parliamentary secretary suggested that maybe we have 
moved the banks an inch. I am not so sure. Almost I think that is 
optimistic.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> I was exaggerating.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Schmidt:</B> Maybe we only moved them a quarter of an inch. 
The important thing is we moved them and that is significant.
<P>
	I recall the first day I met the hon. member at the committee 
meeting. Members of the committee were deciding what to make 
our focus. I remember so clearly the absolute commitment that this 
member of Parliament had when he said: ``Mr. Chairman, there is 
only one thing that this committee should deal with and that is the 
access to capital by small business. That has to change and that has 
to be improved. If we achieve nothing else in this 35th Parliament, 
that is what we have to achieve''. He turned to the chairman and 
said: ``Mr. Chairman, that is your job as chairman, to make sure 
that this committee gets that job done''. He did not ever deviate 
from that focus. His enthusiasm infused other members of the 
committee. They too said: ``Yes, that is what we want to do''.
<P>
<B>(1905)</B>
<P>
	It has been successful. We have moved the banks maybe a 
quarter of an inch. I hope that a year from now we can say that we 
have moved them a half-inch or three-quarters of an inch. I would 
like to move them a mile. If a good idea, a new innovation, of an 
entrepreneur wishing to establish himself is supported by the 
financial institutions, that would be a great step forward.
<P>
	I know there are all kinds of words being used. One of the banks 
recently announced a $300 million venture fund which it was going 
to establish so that innovative ideas could take root and businesses 
could develop. Three hundred million dollars. That bank made 
almost $1 billion in profit last year. That is not even one-third of its 
profit. That is not a very great concession on the part of one 
institution.
<P>
	We have to go much further than that and I believe we can. If the 
financial institutions were as concerned about building small 
business and about supporting the high tech industries as they are 
about lobbying MPs, Canada would grow. Canadians would begin 
to do the kinds of things that we imagined, which the banks often 
stopped.
<P>
	When will we see the kind of co-operation from the financial 
institutions which was evident from the various parties that were 
represented in committee? Surely the  imagination of the members 
of the committee is not restricted to them. Surely the financial 
institutions can also use some imagination and say: ``If 85 per cent 
of new jobs are created by the small business sector, then we had 
better get on the ball. Then we will make even more of a profit than 
we are making now''. Sometimes the financial institutions think as 
far as the end of their noses and no farther. It leaves me 
dumbfounded.
<P>
	On the other hand, we also have to say that the banks agreed to 
do something. They actually agreed to provide to the committee on 
a quarterly basis numbers which will allow us to compare their 
performance from one quarter to the next. That is wonderful. If this 
results in them moving the next inch so that the building and 
growing process for small business can be achieved, the task and 
purpose of the committee will have been rewarded.
<P>
	This committee has demonstrated that it can be done. The 
amendments to the bill indicate that the parties can co-operate. 
Reformers support the bill, however, I would like to make it clear 
that does not mean we like the idea of subsidizing business, 
whether it is through the banks or in any other way. That being said, 
we will support the bill because of the things which I have outlined.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="PROTECTIONOFPERSONALINFORMATIONOBTAINEDBYCERTAINCORPORATIONSACT">PROTECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION 
OBTAINED BY CERTAIN CORPORATIONS ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed from November 30 consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-315, an act to complement the present laws of 
Canada that protect the privacy of individuals with respect to 
personal information about themselves obtained by certain 
corporations, be read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, Bill C-315, put 
forward by the hon. member for Cariboo-Chilcotin, proposes to 
improve the privacy of individuals with respect to personal 
information obtained by corporations. I wonder why he is 
interested in that. Is privacy important?
<P>
	As our society advances, new technologies are available to us. 
Let me talk about two of those new technologies. One I favour is a 
technology called a smart card. A smart  card is designed to have 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17614"> 17614 </A></B>
<P>
information encoded on it to prevent abuse of our health care 
system. Abuse of our health care system is something that most 
Canadians would like to see addressed. A smart card would allow 
the individual to present themselves to their physician. The card 
would be encoded, recent medical information would be accessible 
which would prevent double doctoring, double testing. In fact, it 
would prevent some overspending of significant amounts of 
money. A smart card sounds like a good idea for that purpose.
<P>
<B>(1910)</B>
<P>
	Let us take that idea one step further. I have seen cards used in 
the grocery stores where an account can be debited very quickly. I 
heard someone say that those cards could be made smaller and 
implanted under the skin. It could have a significant amount of 
personal information on it. It would be scanned, some numbers 
punched in and bills could be paid that way.
<P>
	I also heard it said that the little implanted chip would allow a 
satellite locating system to know someone's location at any time. 
Now you could never get lost. That is the final step in the use of the 
smart card for those of us who are too dumb to figure out where we 
are.
<P>
	Are there pitfalls on the issue of privacy with these new 
computer technologies which are available to us? Are people aware 
and concerned about computer technology? I believe they are. I can 
give two recent examples. Ontario is bringing out an omnibus bill 
in which one of the concerns is the issue of privacy of information. 
The omnibus bill looks as though it will make information more 
available to legislators and there is been an outcry about that issue.
<P>
	Bill C-7, recently passed in the House, had significant 
components which related to privacy. There were a number of very 
public concerns about the information being made available. I 
believe this bill has some component of public concern to it and the 
interest is reasonable.
<P>
	When can we go overboard with information that should not be 
made publicly available? That is my question. When do we go 
overboard?
<P>
	I would also like to step back a bit and say that there are times 
when I do not think information is made publicly available which 
should be made available. I would like to use two examples.
<P>
	Across from an elementary school in my riding is a house called 
the drug house. The teachers say that drugs are sold from that 
house. They have watched this going on for eight years.
<P>
	I went to meeting with the RCMP, the mayor and some 
community activists to find out what could be done about this drug 
house. Apparently people arrive at the house, quickly go in and out, 
having made their drug deal and off they go. It is known to the 
police and the  principal and it is now known to the MP. Surely this 
can be stopped. This is not a great thing to have across the street 
from an elementary school. Also the junior high school is not far 
away.
<P>
	The RCMP told me their hands were tied. My reply was that 
surely they could go to a justice of the peace and say that there are 
reasonable grounds to suspect and search this house. I was told that 
the rights of the individual in that house would be trampled on if we 
did that. I said that surely the rights of the kids in that elementary 
school would take precedence. I was told: ``No, doc, that is not the 
way it works. Our legal system has put the rights even. The kids 
and the people in that house have even rights''. I was puzzled by 
that. I do not agree with that.
<P>
<B>(1915)</B>
<P>
	I have another example. A man raped a young woman, was 
caught and sentenced to jail. She in her wisdom wondered whether 
he could have infected her with a disease. She went to the court and 
asked that the rapist have a blood test because she was living in fear 
that she may have AIDS. His reaction was: ``No chance. My rights 
of privacy say you cannot touch me''.
<P>
	I say wait a minute, if the rights of the victim collide with the 
rights of the criminal, and in this case they do and she has a 
legitimate need to know, whose rights should take precedence? The 
victim's rights take precedence over his.
<P>
	When I tell that to students in high schools, you should see how 
upset they get. I challenge members opposite to ask students in 
high schools whose rights should take precedence, his privacy or 
her need to know. They will say very quickly whose rights should 
take precedence.
<P>
	There is another side to the privacy issue, the charter of rights 
and freedoms, which today does not talk about responsibilities and 
puts those rights side by side. It needs an adjustment.
<P>
	In a previous conversation there was talk about banks. Banks 
have information that is profoundly private. Banks want to get into 
the insurance business. There has been quite a lobby in that regard. 
They have a monopoly in the banking interests. They now want to 
get into the insurance business. Since Reformers are really 
interested in free enterprise, why would I be concerned about banks 
stepping into the insurance business?
<P>
	If they are to step into the insurance business they had better be 
willing to open up the monopoly they have in other businesses. 
They had better let the insurance companies in there. They had 
better let the insurance companies have access to Interac. They had 
better let the insurance companies have access to the private 
information on an individual's account, where they spend their 
money, how they spend their money. It is a very unfair advantage if 
they are competing with the private insurance business.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17615"> 17615 </A></B>
<P>
	On the issue of privacy where the banks are concerned great 
caution needs to be exercised. There is a need for Bill C-315 by the 
member for Cariboo-Chilcotin. There is a need for a look at 
privacy in relationship to the electronic age we are in. I would like 
it considered very carefully.
<P>
	I suppose the government should bring in its own bill which 
would get the stamp of approval of the government. The member 
for Cariboo-Chilcotin might well be a little disappointed that his 
bill did not get in, but probably he would accept that change is 
needed. I will watch with interest for those changes.
<P>

consent for the following motion. I move:

	(Motion agreed to.)
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Eleni Bakopanos (Saint-Denis, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to participate in today's debate on Bill C-315. I wish to 
acknowledge the initiative put forward by the hon. member for 
Cariboo-Chilcotin in his desire to see the privacy of Canadian 
citizens protected. However, I feel there are several weaknesses 
with the bill. As a result, I will not be lending my support to its 
passage.
<P>
	The issue of privacy is perhaps a very central one in the 
technological society of today. However, we must not confuse the 
broader issue of privacy protection, an issue which we are pleased 
to see debated in the House in the context of this bill, with the 
reality of Bill C-315. While it is designed to protect privacy in the 
context of the sale of marketing lists, it will scarcely achieve that 
because it is so narrowly crafted.
<P>
<B>(1920)</B>
<P>
	Here again are some of the features of the bill. It is designed to 
stop the sale of marketing lists without the consent of individuals 
whose names are on the list. Before selling a list containing names 
and personal information of individuals, a federal corporation must 
send a notice to the individual seeking consent for the sale.
<P>
	The firm must ensure it receives consent and has not received a 
request to remove the name from the list. If it has, it must remove 
the name or particulars pertaining to the individual within 10 days.
<P>
	A firm which buys a list must also send a notice to the individual 
informing the person of what is on the list, where it came from and 
that he or she may request to have their names or data removed 
from the list. Requests  for removal of names or data must be 
processed within 10 days and corporations must send confirmation 
to the individual.
<P>
	Contraventions of the act are punishable by fines of up to $5,000 
for the first offence and up to $10,000 for subsequent offences.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I do not support Bill C-315, because I feel that it is flawed in 
several ways. The definition of ``personal information'' is not 
comprehensive and does not meet the current standards of related 
federal and provincial acts. Marketing lists are not sold, they are 
rented. In its present form, this bill would not affect customary 
business practices.
<P>
	It would be inconsistent with the Quebec privacy act, which 
includes a carefully drafted section on the use of name lists. 
Moreover, the bill only applies to a limited number of federally 
regulated corporations. It would not prevent the vast majority of 
list sales and would affect only a fraction of the problem of 
protecting personal information, which would give consumers a 
false sense of security.
<P>
	The cost to businesses would be prohibitive, and consumers 
would receive notices seeking their consent as another wave of 
intrusive advertising.
<P>
	The government is considering various aspects of the protection 
of personal information. Consumers are becoming increasingly 
concerned about what will happen to their personal information in 
the interconnected world of the information highway. They want 
the government to react and legislate.
<P>
	Canadian businesses want to enjoy the advantages of an 
electronic business environment where bureaucracy and paperwork 
can be reduced, where they can create a closer relationship with 
their customers and business partners and administrative processes 
can be simplified and computerized.
<P>
	If there are to be rules regulating the use and protection of 
personal information, businesses want those rules to be consistent 
and predictable.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The information highway advisory council presented a number 
of recommendations in its final report, including a call for the 
federal government to table flexible framework legislation based 
on the Canadian Standards Association model privacy code. This 
model privacy code is the product of a consensus committee of 
consumer representatives, key industry players such as the banks, 
telecom companies and the direct marketing association and 
provincial and federal government representatives. It makes a 
sound basis of consensus for us to start from when we are thinking 
about the protection of privacy.
<P>
	We are studying these recommendations now with a view to 
action and to presenting a much more  comprehensive approach to 
the problem. The Minister of Industry will be making an 
announce-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17616"> 17616 </A></B>
<P>
ment for the protection of personal information in the context of 
the government's response to the report of the information highway 
advisory council.
<P>
	While I agree with the spirit of Bill C-315, I believe the points 
which I have outlined clearly explain why the scope of the bill is 
too narrow and why it cannot be as effective as the hon. member 
would like it to be.
<P>
<B>(1925 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the hon. member for Caribou-Chilcotin for the 
introduction of his private member's Bill C-315.
<P>
	The bill will protect the privacy of individuals with respect to 
personal information about themselves obtained by certain 
corporations. There have been many times when my mailbox at 
home is literally stuffed with so-called addressed junk mail. We all 
get it and I think it is safe to say most of us do not like it. In most 
cases it is a request for money for an obscure organization or it is an 
ad for a product we know will not be exactly how it appears in the 
picture.
<P>
	We file this mail in the circular file, file 13, in a place where it 
rightfully belongs. However, what is it exactly that I am throwing 
out in that situation? Is it just a letter or a notice from some 
organization that happened to get my name and address out of the 
phone book? Chances are it did not come from a phone book but 
rather from some corporation that had me on its computer list and 
that corporation probably sold my name as a part of a mailing 
package to some interest group that has an interest in me as part of 
a targeted marketing scheme.
<P>
	What could it know about my personal information? It can 
include a variety of things and could be gathered from several 
different sources. It could include a home address, business 
address, unlisted telephone numbers, physical characteristics, 
health records, education, employment, financial history, social 
insurance number, the magazines we read or even what political 
party we belong to.
<P>
	Every Canadian who uses credit has their credit rating and 
related information stored in American computers and filed under 
their Canadian social insurance number.
<P>
	Members should recall what was said in the House by the 
government of the day when the social insurance number was 
introduced. The government of the day misled us. Canadians, as it 
is now commonly observed by the commentators, were lied to 
about the scope, the use and the implications of our social 
insurance number. However, we cannot now turn back the clock of 
history. However, we can remember what group broke faith with 
Canadians on this subject. It was the Liberals.
<P>
	It is an old story, the social insurance number debate in the 
House with the solemn promises made, especially in stark contrast 
to the current state of affairs. Are we any wiser now in this techno 
age? Are the Liberals? That is why we need much more protection 
in this general area. This private member's bill is a useful part of 
that developing awareness.
<P>
	Opponents might say disseminating such information is not 
serious. I point out some examples that caused me to believe the 
issue is quite serious. In a recent <I>Globe and Mail</I> article a story was 
raised about a computer company that recently sent samples of its 
Internet browsing software free to four million people. However, 
when it was used the sample software automatically dialled up the 
company's home page, gathered information about users without 
their permission, gathered Internet addresses, types of software 
being used on the computer and who knows what else.
<P>
	There are people who are geniuses with computers. They are 
capable of breaking encrypted codes and getting access to top 
government information. If they are able to get this type of 
information with ease there is no question what type of information 
they can obtain from me all without my knowledge or my 
permission yet still completely legal.
<P>
	This bothers me and I am sure that when more Canadians are 
made aware of this it will trouble them as well.
<P>
	The Internet is something completely new I am sure to most 
members of the House. Computer technology seems to be updated 
hourly, too fast for me to keep up. Last year I purchased a new 
laptop computer and at the time it was the latest technology. A 
week after I bought it a newer and better model was available. It is 
the same with the Internet. Every day someone has a new way of 
tapping into someone else's information.
<P>
	Control of access on the Internet remains an unanswered 
problem. With more and more people accessing it everyday 
concerns certainly rise. People have expressed a concern to me and 
therefore I believe something must be done. We cannot sit around 
and do nothing. If we do, the technological world will overrun us 
and could literally prevent any protectionist measures from being 
eventually implemented.
<P>
	The computer is only one of many ways of retrieving 
confidential information. I have heard of a hospital employee who 
supplied a computer disc of names of terminally ill patients to a 
local funeral home. There are no clear rules surrounding our 
privacy. The result is a clear lack of individual security.
<P>
	The largest problem with parallel provincial privacy acts is they 
do not cover any federally regulated institutions. Bill C-315 affects 
all corporations as outlined in section 2 of the Canada Labour Code 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17617"> 17617 </A></B>
<P>
such as air transportation companies, maybe a radio station or 
banks  or any other work deemed under the Canada Labour Code.
<P>
	Today I stopped by the Bank of Montreal and picked up an 
application for an air miles MasterCard to check the terms of 
application. At the bottom of the application is the fine print that 
should be read before we sign our life away, so to speak.
<P>
<B>(1930 )</B>
<P>
	I want to read what it says:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>By signing below I accept as notice in writing of and consent to you obtaining 
or exchanging any information about me at any time from any credit bureau, my 
employer or other person in connection with any relationships between us or 
those which you or I may wish to establish.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It is incredible. This disclaimer allows the financial institution to 
exchange my information, so basically other corporations may 
know what I purchased on my last trip. If any transaction has a 
name or a number attached to it, it is in the computer. The 
disclaimer does not indicate what information they can exchange. 
They simply say any information. Since most of us need a credit 
card, we sign off on the application and send it in. There is no 
getting around it. In other words, the banks have us in a catch 22. A 
credit card is needed to operate in the business world but complete 
exposure is the price of the card. Obviously all this needs to be 
changed.
<P>
	However, the banks are against any federal changes and for 
obvious reason. They have their own privacy code, so they say. 
Linda Routledge, director of consumer affairs for the Canadian 
Bankers Association, said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The association's voluntary privacy code is already used as the basis for 
rigorous safeguarding of consumer information by the banks.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The banks say why regulate. We have a code that works just fine. 
The problem is that with the code it does not allow the consumers 
the legal right or opportunity to complain. The power of banks is 
enormous and obviously they will do everything in their power to 
ward off federal regulators from intervening.
<P>
	Canadians ought to have a right to control what is done with their 
personal information. I know my constituents would be completely 
behind me in that regard. Sure there are people out there who could 
not care less if anyone in the world knows who they are, what they 
earn, who they owe and what they owe. I am confident in saying 
that an overwhelming majority of Canadians are not comfortable 
with this type of knowledge being freely disclosed. It seems our 
whole lives are stored on a chip to validate who and what we are. It 
all comes from the computer. There is a movie playing with a 
plausible premise, that personal computer information could be put 
in the wrong hands and used in a sinister manner against the 
person.
<P>
	The bill proposed by my colleague is an excellent foundation. It 
is vitally important that the bill make it  through second reading 
and on to committee. If members have problems with the bill, they 
would have the opportunity to amend it in committee. We 
understand bills are not always perfect. That is why we have 
committees in this place: to make legislation better and to have 
successive review.
<P>
	My colleague from Cariboo-Chilcotin has done his homework 
and produced a good bill. Along with my colleagues who have 
spoken before me, I too support the legislation and urge my friends 
from across the floor to do likewise, if not for themselves, then for 
the personal security of the community that has sent us here as their 
representatives.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jerry Pickard (Essex-Kent, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the hon. member for bringing the issue before the House. Even 
though I cannot support the bill at this time, the protection of 
personal information is a matter of concern for all Canadians and 
deserves a comprehensive response.
<P>
	The bill the hon. member has put forward does not do enough to 
stop the kinds of privacy invasion Canadians are complaining 
about. While I share the concerns expressed by the Reform Party 
about the abuse of personal information in the context of direct 
marketing, if Parliament is to intervene with new legislation, we 
had better be sure that we are doing that which addresses the most 
broad problem of fair information practices.
<P>
	Here are some areas where I feel we need change. The bill would 
only apply to corporations. Businesses that engage in the practices 
are often individuals or small partnerships and would not be 
covered by the legislation. It applies only to a narrow range of 
corporations engaging in the federal regulatory activity. It includes 
those in the banking, telecommunications and broadcast industries 
but not small entrepreneurs. Consumers want similar protection 
across a range of provincial and federal jurisdictions. They do not 
want to figure out who would be responsible.
<P>
	The bill does not resemble anything now available in the 
provinces. It gives us no basic model to suggest to the provinces 
and would be an odd patch on the already spotty quilt of privacy 
protection. It does nothing to solve the problem of operators setting 
up outside our jurisdiction, such as in the United States. 
Technologies are changing and developing quickly these days and 
information is being collected and massaged in new and different 
ways.
<P>
<B>(1935)</B>
<P>
	The bill addresses only the issue of peoples' names appearing on 
lists or nominative lists as the practices are referred to in Quebec 
privacy legislation which covers the private sector. With 
information management systems changing daily it may soon be 
out of date to talk about lists.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17618"> 17618 </A></B>
<P>
	Information travels everywhere and can now be vacuumed up 
automatically. It is no longer necessary to hand someone a 
computer tape to trade information. We can simply configure a 
computer system to make the required links.
<P>
	When we address the protection of personal privacy we want to 
talk about the use of personal information in the broadest possible 
ways. The rules we come up with should address every sector of the 
economy, not just the direct marketing industry. Personal 
information is a vital commodity in just about every business from 
banking to telecommunications to health care.
<P>
	We need necessary rules for all sectors tailored to meet the 
special needs of each one. Instead of working on the bill we should 
support the work that has been going on for several years at the 
Canadian Standards Association or the CSA. A consensus 
committee passed a model of privacy code in September of this 
year, the result of three years of work in the committee with 
representation of industry, consumers and federal and provincial 
governments.
<P>
	The concept behind this model code is that each sector of 
business industry would take this set of fair information practices 
and apply it to its own information holdings. They would be 
accountable for what they did with personal information but they 
would have some input into the process.
<P>
	The Standards Council of Canada will soon publish this code of 
fair information practices as a national standard for Canada. This is 
a first among developed countries that have addressed the issue of 
data protection. It is the first time that protection of personal 
information has been looked at in the context of standards. In this 
information age that is a very useful way of looking at the matter.
<P>
	The CSA privacy code has the support of a broad range of 
private sector organizations, including the Canadian Direct 
Marketing Association. On October 3 the president of the Canadian 
Direct Marketing Association called on the Minister of Industry to 
produce legislation in the House that would use the CSA standards 
as the basis for legislation federally. He suggested that the federal 
government encourage the provinces of Canada to do the same in 
their own jurisdictions.
<P>
	Much of the information that Canadians are most concerned 
about is information over which provinces have direct control. For 
instance, medical and educational records are provincial matters. 
The privacy commissioner of Ontario released a letter to the 
Minister of Health last week wherein he expressed deep concern 
regarding the provisions of the omnibus bill 26 now before the 
Ontario legislature. That bill would permit the opening of private 
medical records and release officials from liability for their 
disclosure.
<P>
	As the commissioner pointed out in his letter, 92 per cent of 
Canadians are expressing concern about the misuse of their 
personal information. It is great concern to them. Unfortunately it 
is not all protected by law. We in the federal government must do 
our part to protect consumers' personal information, but we must 
also start a much broader discussion with the provinces about the 
issue. Only Quebec, as my colleague from the Bloc has pointed out, 
has moved to protect personal information held in the private 
sector.
<P>
	Canadians deserve and want more protection for their personal 
information than is offered in the bill. I understand the issue is 
being studied by the departments of industry and justice with a 
view to developing solutions that will work for the protection of 
personal information in all sectors of the economy across the 
country.
<P>
<B>(1940 )</B>
<P>
	It is a huge and complex issue because the increasing availability 
and use of personal information and consumer files to target 
service delivery affect virtually every sector of our economy. 
Protection of personal privacy is identified as one of the 
foundations vital to the network world into which we are moving.
<P>
	The Minister of Industry established the Information Highway 
Advisory Council to advise him on how to make the most of new 
possibilities brought to us by the communications network. It 
focused on the issue and Industry Canada has produced a number of 
studies. The council consulted experts and produced the following 
recommendations on privacy.
<P>
	The federal government should act to ensure privacy protection 
on the information highway. This protection shall embody all 
principles of fair information practices contained in the Canadian 
Standards Association draft ``Model Code for the Protection of 
Personal Information''. To this end the federal government should 
continue to participate in the development and implementation of 
effective national voluntary standards based upon this model code.
<P>
	The federal government must take leadership in the 
implementation of these principles through the following actions.
<P>
	In co-operation with other levels of government that share 
responsibility for various sectors of activity on the information 
highway, it should establish a federal-provincial-territorial 
working group to implement the privacy principles in all 
jurisdictions.
<P>
	It should create a level playing field for the protection of 
personal information on the information highway by developing 
and implementing a flexible legislative framework for both public 
and private sectors. Legislation would require sectors or organiza-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17619"> 17619 </A></B>
<P>
tions to meet the standard of the CSA model code while allowing  
the flexibility to determine how they will refine their codes.
<P>
	In co-operation with the CSA working group on privacy and 
other interested parties, the government should study the 
development of effective oversight and enforcement mechanisms.
<P>
	The government should establish a working group to co-ordinate 
the development, demonstration and application of privacy 
enhancing technologies for the provision of government services 
and information.
<P>
	The government should update and harmonize appropriate 
privacy protection policies, legislation and guidelines applicable to 
its operations and to the delivery of government services and 
information.
<P>
	Industry Canada should establish a working group-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I might indicate to the member for 
Lincoln that we only have 10 minutes left. Perhaps he would wish 
to divide his time with his colleague so that both of them could 
speak.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Lincoln, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
have the opportunity to speak on the issue of the protection of 
personal privacy. It is an issue with which we are confronted every 
time we open a newspaper or turn on a television. It is entirely 
appropriate that our laws be revisited on this subject.
<P>
	When we brought in the current federal Privacy Act in 1982, it 
was decided that we should address the issue of personal 
information held by government first, so the act only applied to 
federal holdings. When the provinces passed their bills they did the 
same.
<P>
	It is now time to revisit the issue. The work is well in progress. 
When the Minister of Industry set up the Information Highway 
Advisory Council to advise him, he stipulated that privacy be 
considered as one of the four operating principles. The council was 
set up to advise the minister on how Canada should meet the 
challenge and opportunities ahead of us in the global networks of 
the future.
<P>
	Industry Canada released a discussion paper to sound out public 
opinion to see what the Canadian public and Canadian business 
wanted to see. The response was overwhelming in its recognition 
of the problem. Consumers and industry did not necessarily agree 
on the solution, with business pushing for voluntary codes, with 
most stressing the good work done on the Canadian Standards 
Association model code, and with consumers demanding that 
government act and legislate.
<P>
	The Information Highway Advisory Council combined these 
two comments and recommended framework legislation based on 
the CSA standard. The Canadian Direct Marketing Association has 
added its voice to the debate, calling on the Minister of Industry to 
table framework legislation based on the CSA standard, and urged 
the provinces to do likewise in their jurisdictions.
<P>
<B>(1945 )</B>
<P>
	This is the kind of flexible compromise position that is good for 
business and good for consumers. Business wants to be involved in 
crafting of marketplace rules and so do consumers. We should 
recognize this and work on the basis of the consensus that has been 
built around the CSA model privacy code, soon to be published as a 
national standard by the Standards Council of Canada.
<P>
	There is no way that Bill C-315 however worthy in its intentions 
could be confused as a piece of framework legislation. I am afraid 
that it falls short of what we need. However the debate that we have 
had here in the House, thanks to the hon. member of the Reform 
Party who tabled this bill and so ably defended it, has been a very 
useful introduction to what promises to be an important and 
complex issue when it comes before the House.
<P>
	I recommend that we urge the minister to return to us and report 
on the progress that has been made. I look forward to that and to the 
opportunity to bring about the kind of broad based protection for 
personal information that Canadians are expecting of this 
government.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Jean Augustine (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime 
Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to take the few minutes that 
are left in this debate to commend the member for 
Cariboo-Chilcotin for bringing Bill C-315 forward.
<P>
	I regret that I am unable to support this bill. The issue is an 
important one but the approach is far too narrow. I believe that if 
we send this bill to committee and try to correct it we would lose 
valuable time trying to redirect an approach which simply does not 
address the concerns Canadians have in regard to the protection of 
their privacy.
<P>
	Every time we open a newspaper we see another story about the 
abuse of personal information, about the potential that new 
technology has to invade our privacy and provide surveillance of 
our every movement.
<P>
	Even the chairman of Microsoft, Bill Gates, in an article which 
appeared in the Ottawa <I>Sun</I> on September 20 of this year pointed 
out the need for government action and indeed legislation to protect 
privacy in the face of new technologies. He used the example of 
software programs which would replace human travel agents and 
track customers' tastes and preferences to give the best possible 
service.
<P>
	While I applaud the hon. member for bringing the issue of 
privacy protection to the attention of Parliament, I believe that we 
could follow Mr. Gates' advice and start the process of unrushed 
debate leading to intelligent public policies, not by accepting this 
bill and fixing it, but by building on the work that has been done in 
Canada. We have among other initiatives the first data protection 
legislation in North America to cover the private sector. I am 
referring to Bill 68 in the province of Quebec as an example.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="17620"> 17620 </A></B>
<P>
	We need a far more comprehensive approach to these issues. 
This government has been doing the groundwork necessary to 
provide greater privacy protection.
<P>
	I would like to ask the hon. member to consider the work that is 
presently being done. It is important that we look at the teeth that 
have to be given to any specific bill that is in the House, who will 
be responsible to hear and act on complaints and what resources 
they will have. I am suggesting that although this bill is laudable in 
terms of its focus on the fundamental issue of free and informed 
consent of the individual as a key issue in data protection, it is not 
clear how this would work out for other types of information and 
other types of business.
<P>
	I commend the member. It is not often that the industry itself 
asks for legislation, but at this specific point in time the industry 
has been asking the minister responsible to pay some attention to 
details in this regard.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member has two or three 
minutes to sum up.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I appreciate the opportunity to do that. I would first like to thank 
those members who took part in the debate on my private 
member's bill on personal information. The debate has been most 
instructive for me as I continue to consider this very important 
issue. Out of the debate I realize there are some aspects that do 
need amendment in the bill, particularly the area regarding sales. 
Leases were not mentioned in the bill.
<P>
	With regard to the narrowness of the crafting of Bill C-315, I do 
believe if members did the same research that I did, they would 
find there are federal and provincial jurisdictions that limit how 
widely this bill can have influence. It has been purposely crafted in 
such a narrow manner so that it would not impede provincial 
influence. It is my anticipation that if this bill were passed it could 
be a model and a forerunner for the provinces in bringing in their 
own individual pieces of legislation for the protection of personal 
information.
<P>
	I would like to ask fellow members who are being asked to keep 
in mind what is fair to commercial interests also to keep in mind 
what is fair to the people whose names and personal information 
are being used for commercial gain without their knowledge, 
without their consent and frequently to their own personal 
disadvantage, if not their jeopardy. While it may seem burdensome 
for a commercial enterprise to seek the permission of every person 
whose name they record, buy, sell or lease, as the case may be, why 
should companies be able to use this information simply because 
the rightful owners cannot prevent them from doing so?
<P>
	In summary, I am asking colleagues to consider first the needs of 
the protection of their constituents as well as themselves and to 
support Bill C-315 at this second reading stage.
<P>

<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 deemed 
to have been moved.

	<B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Kingsway, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it was on February 16 of last year, four days after the death 
of Sue Rodriguez, that the Minister of Justice promised Canadians 
that this House of Commons would have an opportunity to vote in a 
free vote on the important issue of possible changes to section 241 
of the Criminal Code.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice said that he would be meeting with the 
government House leader as soon as possible to find out when he 
could arrange a debate and he said that they were not going to sit on 
it. He went on to say: ``We will find a way to put the question 
before the House so that it is not academic. It will be meaningful 
and if that involves a proposal for changing legislation with a free 
vote, then that is exactly what we will do''.
<P>
	He pointed out that the Supreme Court of Canada had 
unanimously agreed, although it was divided on the substance of 
changes 
<P>

<B><A NAME="17621"> 17621 </A></B>
<P>
to section 241, that this was a matter that elected representatives 
must deal with. The Minister of Justice said on February 16 that he 
would make sure this House had an opportunity at an early date to 
deal with this matter. Some months later at the national convention 
of the Liberal Party of Canada, delegates voted overwhelmingly in 
favour of a resolution  urging the government to allow for a free 
vote on the issue of euthanasia and physician assisted suicide.
<P>
<B>(1955 )</B>
<P>
	In September of last year the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Justice, who will be responding today on behalf of the 
government, said during the course of a debate on my private 
member's bill to change the Criminal Code: ``We have been 
assured by the Minister of Justice that all parliamentarians will be 
given the opportunity to consider these issues in a meaningful way. 
I am confident that in due course we will be presented with the 
opportunity to do so''.
<P>
	On February 16 of last year the Minister of Justice said: ``In 
emphasizing the urgency of this question, I am sure doctors could 
tell us there are a number of people right now facing terminal 
illness who want to have clarification''. He was right then and he is 
right now.
<P>
	It is unconscionable that the government, almost two years after 
having promised to allow the House to seriously deliberate on this 
issue, to vote in a free vote, is still not prepared to allow that 
decision.
<P>
	One of those who is seeking a change in the law is Austin 
Bastable. Mr. Bastable has written twice to all members of the 
House. He wrote in late September and again at the end of last 
month, pointing out that the quality of his life is continuing to 
decline. He does not wish to endure the prolonged natural death 
that awaits him.
<P>
	Mr. Bastable points out that palliative care is not a meaningful 
option for him. He pleads with the House and he pleads with the 
government to honour the commitment made to allow a free vote, 
to allow debate on this issue of fundamental conscience.
<P>
	The member for Vancouver Centre also assured Canadians and 
her own constituents there would be a free vote. I call on her to 
honour the commitment made by the Prime Minister, by the 
Minister of Justice and by the parliamentary secretary to ensure 
Canadians have a voice in this fundamental issue of life and death.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Russell MacLellan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member for Burnaby-Kingsway has not said anything 
which I would contest with respect to me or Minister of Justice. It 
is still the intention of the Minister of Justice to allow this debate.
<P>
	The hon. member has requested that the Minister of Justice 
advise the House when members will have the opportunity to 
review the issue of physician assisted suicide, including the 
provisions of section 241 of the Criminal Code.
<P>
	Both the hon. member and the Minister of Justice have referred 
to the important work undertaken by the special committee on 
euthanasia and assisted suicide  which tabled its report in June of 
last year. The terms of reference provided that it examine and 
report on the legal, social and ethical issues regarding euthanasia 
and assisted suicide.
<P>
	The report is lengthy and contains recommendations concerning 
palliative care, pain control, sedation practices, withholding and 
withdrawal of life sustaining treatment, advanced directives, 
assisted suicide and euthanasia.
<P>
	Of the recommendations presented in the report, there are a 
number of legal implications unanimously agreed on by committee 
members. This was not the case with respect to their 
recommendations concerning assisted suicide.
<P>
	While the senators were unanimous in their view that 
counselling suicide, subsection 241(a), should remain an offence, 
they were not unanimous in respect of the provision of subsection 
241(b). As the Minister of Justice has indicated, there was 
difficulty in achieving consensus with respect to some of the most 
fundamental questions that arose in the course of the committee's 
study.
<P>
	Specifically, with respect to the issue of assisted suicide, a 
majority of the committee recommended that subsection 241(b)

	<B>Ms. Judy Bethel (Edmonton East, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
discussions with people in Edmonton East over the past number of 
months, one concern keeps coming up with increasing regularity: 
where is medicare headed in Canada?
<P>
	Canadians value the system of universal health care. Medicare is 
one of the fundamental elements of our Canadian identity and of 
our shared commitment to fairness, equity and compassion.
<P>
<B>(2000 )</B>
<P>
	However, Canadians recognize that the health care system must 
adapt and evolve within the guiding principles of the Canada 
Health Act. It is not enough to say that we spend $72 billion on 
health care without knowing whether we are spending it in those 
areas where it makes the most difference to Canadians.
<P>
	Residents of Edmonton East want the government at the national 
and provincial levels to work together to ensure accessibility and 
quality in health care and to sustain a health care system that 
respects the five principles of the Canada Health Act: universality, 
accessibility, comprehensiveness, portability and public 
administration.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="17622"> 17622 </A></B>
<P>
	How do we renew our health care system to meet the needs of 
consumers in a cost effective and efficient manner? What are the 
implications of allowing greater private funding in our health care 
system?
<P>
	There is concern in Edmonton East that private funding 
competing with a public system will create a two-tier system where 
access and quality will be based on ability to pay rather than 
medical need.
<P>
	To the ideologically driven in Alberta, an increased private 
presence in the funding and delivery of health care is the answer to 
controlling costs and improving accessibility. But is it? In the 
industrialized world, the United States is the best example of a 
health care system which relies extensively on private funding.
<P>
	Let us examine the U.S. health care experience in more detail. 
More private money in the U.S health care system should result in a 
better standard of health care for Americans but clearly that is a 
myth. A significant amount of health care spending in the United 
States is to support an extensive bureaucracy that has evolved 
under a multiple player system. The average American under a 
private insurance scheme pays $150 a year in administrative costs 
alone, compared to $23 for the average Canadian.
<P>
	Respected Canadian health care economist, Robert Evans, put it 
most succinctly when he stated: ``Canadians provide care. 
Americans shuffle paper''. Not only is the U.S. health care system 
plagued by skyrocketing administrative costs and a bureaucratic 
jungle, it is also plagued by inequities and lack of access.
<P>
	For older Americans, 65 years and over, out of pocket costs 
consume 23 per cent of their household incomes. For older 
Americans with family incomes below the poverty line, out of 
pocket expenses consume 37 per cent of their incomes. Most 
telling, the number of Americans who are uninsured continues to 
grow at an alarming rate. Nearly 40 million Americans or 15.3 per 
cent of the population had no health insurance coverage at all. The 
total number of uninsured American children under the age of 18 is 
9.5 million or 24 per cent of all American children under the age of 
18. The total number of uninsured Americans earning an average 
family income of $15,700 is nearly 15 million.
<P>
	This leads me to a second element that private funding 
components have failed to address adequately: the ability to control 
health care costs. Cost containment is a necessity if health care is to 
be sustained and preserved in today's fiscal climate but cost 
containment in health care is not achieved by shifting the cost 
burden on the Canadian consumer through de-insurance, de-listing 
or user fees.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The member's time has expired.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Hedy Fry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased that the hon. 
member asked this question. As she said before,  medicare is a 
defining value of Canadians. Eight-nine per cent of Canadians 
support medicare. All the ministers of health in every province 
support medicare, with the exception of Alberta.
<P>
	Medicare is unique to this country because it is based on clinical 
need and not on the size of your wallet. It is a Liberal value. 
Medicare was brought in by a Liberal prime minister. A Liberal 
minister of health, Monique Bégin, brought in the Canada Health 
Act which defined the five principles and set a series of limits on 
how they are used.
<P>
	One of the important things about medicare is that the 
government, being a Liberal government, is committed to 
medicare. We are committed to a predictable funding of medicare 
in the new Canada health and social transfer. We are committed to 
working with provinces to ensure that we find innovation and 
creativity in dealing with some of the pressures that are now facing 
medicare.
<P>
	We will work in a consistent, cohesive and coherent manner to 
find all of the answers within the Canada Health Act.
<P>
	I want the hon. member to know that this government is the first 
since the enactment of the Canada Health Act that actually has 
taken non-refundable deductions from provinces: British 
Columbia, Manitoba, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and finally, 
Alberta.
<P>
	We have a concern about the growth of two-tier medicine. User 
fees are not on for this government. The program is based on 
clinical need. If we are going to continue to make medicare 
important, we are going to have to look at issues such as evidence 
based medicine such as moving from prevention, from life style 
based diseases and-

	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The motion to adjourn the House is now 
deemed to have been adopted. Accordingly the House is adjourned 
until tomorrow at 2 p.m.
