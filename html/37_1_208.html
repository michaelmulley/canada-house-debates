	Mr. Speaker, I move that the 10th report of the Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans presented on Tuesday, June 11, be concurred in.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is certainly a pleasure to stand and  speak to the report recently tabled by the Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans, entitled “Foreign Overfishing: Its Impacts and Solutions”. It is on the word “solutions” that I will certainly be spending a lot of my time.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, for those who are not familiar with the work of the committee or the issue, I certainly think that we have to look at the background on this major issue as it affects not only Newfoundland and Labrador but Atlantic Canada specifically and the rest of the country generally.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirty years ago, the fishery in Atlantic Canada was  what we called a golden opportunity for people to find employment. Fishers from all over were involved in harvesting at all levels, inshore, offshore and of different species. Fish plants opened all over the place and provided all kinds of employment, but gradually, as the harvesting increased, the stocks started to decrease. Several things happened simultaneously. Our own fishing effort certainly increased but the foreign effort greatly increased. Instead of the two-masters or three-masters, fully rigged,  that visited our shores, we had huge factory freezer trawlers that came over like vacuum cleaners and sucked up everything that was on the bottom.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gradually, people who were involved in the fishery, the experienced fishermen, began to express concern about the state of the stocks. Nobody paid much attention and the scientists basically said “no problem, there are lots of fish out there”. As we moved into the 1980s the conditions became worse and of course in 1990s it was history as written. In  the early 1990s, in 1992, we had the moratorium declared on a number of groundfish species, particularly the northern cod, which was really the staple product that supplied employment to so many Newfoundlanders, Labradorians and Atlantic Canadians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the moratorium, these stocks have not increased. Again we can point to a number of reasons. Scientists will discuss changes in water temperature. They are concerned about what is happening in our oceans that neither our own scientists nor scientists from any other country seem to be able to explain. On top of that we know that we have a seal herd that has ballooned from a million or a million and a half to  an estimated seven million. Seals have to eat something, and as a former member of the House, Morrissey Johnson, once said, “They don't eat turnips”. Consequently they must have an effect on the stocks, but one of the major effects is the foreign overfishing.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the report and in our discussions, members have heard us all talk. When I say “us” I am referring particularly to members of the standing committee, all of whom, as a unit, dealt with this issue. The chairman, a good P.E.I. representative, handled the issue in a non-partisan way because of his concern. Being from the maritimes he understood the situation and has done a very good job as we have gone through our hearings in enunciating to anyone who would listen the concern about the problem. Other members of the committee collectively, regardless of party, have been solidly behind the efforts to deal with this major problem.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A couple of days ago a major announcement was made in Newfoundland and Labrador about the development of the Voisey's Bay project, a major mineral discovery that will create a tremendous amount of employment in the province. Whether it is a good deal or a bad deal, we will know more about it following the three days of the debate which is underway right now in the house of assembly in Newfoundland.</p>


	<A NAME="T1010"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1010"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1015"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1005"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1010)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However the federal government put in  $150 million to kickstart a small pilot plant that will test the new Hydromet process.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minerals are finite resources.  Whether it is a small discovery or a big one will determine the longevity of any such project. Whether it is 10 years, 20 years, 30 years or 50 years, somewhere along the line the minerals will be taken out of the ground and that area will be finished in relation to providing employment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fishery has been with us for 500 years.  In 1497 John Cabot sailed to the coast of Newfoundland and reported catching fish in baskets.  Whether it was codfish, caplin or whatever, we do not know, but   fish were extremely plentiful. That is no longer the case.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague from Antigonish--Guysborough  has his plant in Canso, a plant that provided employment for hundreds of people for several years and is not operating. Why?  It simply because of a lack of resource.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During our committee hearings we heard from the mayors of two towns  in the district of  Burin-Burgeo on the south coast of Newfoundland.   That area depended entirely on the trawler fishery, boats that fished on the nose and tail of the  Grand Banks and inside the 200 mile limit in the section we control ourselves. They provided Burgeo 12 months of the year with a steady source of product which provided employment for hundreds of people.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trepassey and Fermeuse  in my own area both had deep sea plants.  Fermeuse phased into an inshore plant over the years and is now barely operating because of the lack of resource.  Trepassey  no longer exists as a processing centre. Six hundred people worked there year round.  It was a unionized plant and the wages were good.  Families did exceptionally well and students during the summer did not have to worry about programs that HRDC would fund.  They went to work in the plant and made very good money. The plant no longer exists.  Trepassey, a town of 1,500, is now a town of about 800 where all the younger families have moved elsewhere in the country and a lot of them   to Alberta. That is what declining stocks have done to Newfoundland.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However it does not end there because the hurt is still occurring. Fewer and fewer fish are being caught by our own people because just outside the boundary the foreign nations are still scooping up the product, as I mentioned before, as if they were operating vacuum cleaners.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will talk about the nose and tail of the Grand Banks.  Our continental shelf off the coast of Newfoundland extends outward beyond 200 miles.   When we brought in the 200 mile limit, and if we drew a circle around the province, we left outside that limit two projections of land, one to the north and one to the south which are referred to as the nose and tail of the Grand Banks. Just outside that limit is another shelf.  It is called the Flemish Cap, a place where a few years ago we would not find a shrimp. Today, because of the increased activity in northern waters, the fishermen, not the scientists, say that the major activity on the grounds have caused the shrimp to move with the tides, land and multiply on the Flemish Cap.  It is a lucrative shrimp fishing area to the point where several nations are now fishing shrimp, something that nobody did some years ago. They are not only fishing it, they are blatantly overfishing it by four, five and six times the allocated quotas.</p>


	<A NAME="T1015"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1015"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1020"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1010"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1015)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What complicates the whole process is the fact that inside the 200 mile limit the Canadian government, regardless of stripe, manages the stocks.  It allocates quotas whether they be individual quotas in the case of the inshore fishery, company quotas or  general quotas, but it tries to manage the stocks relatively well. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The frustrating thing for the minister of fisheries,  his scientists and advisers is  that no matter how  they manage the stocks there seems to be very little increase in many of them, especially those called straddling stocks.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we put rocks in a garden and put a fence around them, they will be there for eternity.  Fish however are not the same.  We cannot  tell them there is a 200 mile limit and that they cannot swim outside the line.  Fish move.  When they are inside the line our own fishermen can only catch certain amounts.  In certain species they cannot catch anything.  When they do catch a certain species, they are subject not only to quotas but to the type of gear  they use and  the time of year they fish because of breeding periods and whatever. However once these fish move outside the line, and sometimes we are talking inches and feet rather than miles, the foreigners are there waiting for them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many but not all of the  countries that fish on the nose and tail of the Grand Banks are members of NAFO, the Northern Atlantic Fisheries Organization, an organization that has been in place for 20 years.  For 20 years it has allocated quotas to the 18 countries involved.  Some of them, such as Canada, have adhered to those quotas.  Others, like Spain, Portugal and the Faroe Islands, have not.  The Faroe Islands has been banned from the ports of Newfoundland because of the blatant overfishing of shrimp.  Some years ago Spanish and Portuguese boats were banned because of non-adherence to rules and regulations, and that still exists today.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In speaking to the ministers of fisheries from all these countries, they will say  that they are very concerned about the stocks in their own waters and in our waters where they share quota. However the companies and the individual fishermen continue to blatantly abuse the stocks outside the limit.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, because of the attention that the committee and perhaps ourselves have drawn to the issue, people generally have become more vigilant.  Because of tips we received  and that fisheries acted on, we saw boats being checked as they entered port to transship their product.  This has been going on for years but recently a few boats were checked.  What did we find?  In the first one  we found 49 tonnes of cod, a species that we are not even allowed to catch.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a sister ship    about to arrive  at port realized that boat number one had been caught it  suddenly turned around and returned to Iceland.  It was a Russian boat fishing out of Iceland.  We are seeing a lot of      Estonian and Russian boats flying  under Iceland's flag    to catch fish that is landed in Iceland.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second boat that was checked did not breach any regulations   according to the department of fisheries.  What it did have was a tremendous amount of redfish,  for which there are no rules or regulations as to where or what can be caught  outside in 3O, the size of one's thumb.   The gear it  used was like the old hair nets that women used to wear years ago when they worked in the fish plants.  It was   smaller than caplin seine.  It had <i>X</i> number of tonnes of cod liver.  It  had fishmeal.  There was no way to explain  how it could get those amounts of product without overfishing and fishing illegal species.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no correlation between the manifest that showed what it had on board was legal and the actual catch, but no one did anything about it. </p>


	<A NAME="T1020"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1020"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1025"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1015"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1020)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happens when we catch something like boat number one where we saw a blatant abuse of a resource that is under moratorium?    Canada cannot do anything.    Canada can only  let the boat   go back home and hope the ownership nation will take action.  In many cases no action is taken.  Observers   are supposed to be on the boats.  Our observers  are excellent and   report  on time.  Other nations also follow that example and it is helping somewhat.   On many occasions the observers are employees of the companies involved.  Reports are either not tabled, tabled late or inaccurate  and the system is not working.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a nutshell,  for 20 years NAFO has not been able to handle the blatant abuses of a renewable resource.  This resource creates, as Joey Smallwood used to say, not dozens,  not hundreds, but thousands of jobs for Atlantic Canadians and improves the economy of Canada generally.  We let this resource be abused day after day  and all we say is that  when we go to the next NAFO meeting we will ask them to live by the rules.  We have done that  for 20 years and things are getting worse.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In listening to the fishermen, to the people in the towns affected, to the people who have followed it for years and to the officials of this very government, the committee members  realized there was only one thing we  could do.  We  had to manage the  resource   adjacent to our shores  to which we have every right to manage.   If we were to scrutinize  the law of the sea  regulations  we would see that we are responsible    for managing the resource. I was going to say we have to extend jurisdiction but the minister has said the government will never do that. What we asked for, which he says is the same thing but it is not, is custodial management.  The adjacent state should be the managers of the resource.  It would still allow countries that have legitimate quotas to fish them but to fish them legitimately under our supervision.  If we do our work properly I am quite sure many of those countries would agree with us.  All we are asking for is custodial management.  It would  not extend  jurisdiction, as the minister says it would.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other statement he made, which     I have to refute  because when the report was tabled  he turned it down   even, as he admitted, without reading it.   He said that we could not do it.  He did not discuss it with anyone.  He is more concerned about  the foreigners than our own Canadians.  That has to stop.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of the members on the committee were Liberals and some very good ones.  He said that the committee only gets its information from those who do presentations while he listens to scientific advice.  That was a slap at his own members who make up the majority.   </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I challenge anyone to do a poll in this country and  ask   people who they would rather depend on,  the scientists at the department of fisheries   who may be    good but because they are so underfunded and there are so few of them they cannot do a good job, or the fishermen who have fished these grounds for years and who know what is happening,  the towns  that have been affected and  the  people who have followed the decline of this resource over the years.  I would hedge my bets that the majority of the people would say that those involved in the industry know best.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summation, we have made our recommendations.   I am looking forward to the Liberal members, especially the Newfoundland members who are even more drastically affected than I am, getting up and letting the House   know how important the report is.  It is one chance to save an industry, a renewable resource that can add to the Canadian economy and   provide employment  for years.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the remarks of the hon. member opposite.  Could the hon. member outline some of the points of view Newfoundlanders and Labradorians gave to us when we were in Newfoundland? Could he give us a taste of some of the views they expressed?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To get the hon. member started I will refer to the testimony of Mr. Jim Morgan, president of the Newfoundland and Labrador Rural Rights and Boat Owners Association. Mr. Morgan felt the Government of Canada should be moving on the issue.  He said Canada must act now to stop the decimation of our stocks. He said we should use our  legislative framework to arrest ships that fish illegally outside the NAFO framework.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alastair O'Rielly, president of the Fisheries Association of Newfoundland and Labrador, outlined where Canada's lax regime was leading.  He said that prior to 1995 there were 26,000 fishing days from 71 vessels.  As the hon. member opposite stated, after 1995 when we seized the <i>Estai</i> the problem cleaned up for a few days. After 1995 there were 6,000 fishing days with 16 vessel years. There are now 10,000 fishing days with 27 fishing years.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pat Chamut, the assistant deputy minister of fisheries, clearly outlined the problems   although he did not say he was in favour of custodial management. He said the problems included: a significant increase in infringements since 1995; directed fishing for moratoria species; exceeded quotas; misreported catches of three  ounce shrimp; use of small mesh gear; and failure to provide observer reports.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could the hon. member give us a taste of what Newfoundlanders and Labradorians have been saying before the committee?  Could he expand a bit and say how we could implement custodial management from the point of view of the standing committee on fisheries? We are not talking about taking historic rights away from foreign nations.  Historic allocations should remain but we should manage the fishery the way NAFO intended. NAFO is clearly not doing this now. Canada must take strong action. </p>

	Mr. Speaker, I again  congratulate the chairperson.  Usually when an opposition member speaks we get negative comments, but the hon. member strongly  supports  the recommendations more than anyone on the committee.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The committee has heard a lot of comments from Newfoundlanders.  I will mention two or three to add to the ones the hon. member mentioned. The Liberal fisheries minister of Newfoundland, with whom I spoke this morning, said before the committee in March:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>In summary, NAFO has failed us since its inception in 1978--</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is extremely important.  It is why I am glad we are having the debate this morning. As we head into the NAFO meetings this fall,  the House generally and governments specifically should be aware of what the report says and what members are saying.  If we go to the NAFO meetings with the same frame of mind we have had at past meetings there will be no fish left next year to worry about.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister went on to say Canada had failed us as well. The political will, with the exception of a few brief moments in our history, has not existed in Ottawa to deal with foreign overfishing. Trevor Taylor, a member of the house of assembly, said:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>I suspect if a tree falls in the forest, nobody hears, and when a fish is caught on the tail or the nose of the Grand Banks, nobody hears. The people of this country are not engaged in what's happening down here.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luckily, some people  are becoming engaged through their members.  The final comment I will use is from Allister Hann, the mayor of Burgeo. His town has probably suffered more than any.  This is factual.  He said:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>Rural Newfoundland is dying, particularly my town.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is pretty hard stuff to listen to but it shows what we can do. What can we do?  We can notify NAFO that we are getting out of it.  We can notify it that with or without its help we will take custodial management of the nose and tail of the Grand Banks.  If we have the guts to do this  we will provide a resource for our people and employment for many years to come.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague from St. John's West and the hon. member for Malpeque for their comments.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is concern about how custodial management would work. Some people have contacted me to say we would kick the foreigners off the nose and tail of the Grand Banks and the Flemish Cap. That is not necessarily so. Our interpretation of custodial management means other nations would be allowed to fish in the waters but under Canadian management and enforcement. That would be a good thing for Atlantic Canada and, for that matter, all of Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could my hon. colleague elaborate a bit on that?</p>


	<A NAME="Int-289177"></A><a HREF="#Int-289179"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-289174"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Loyola Hearn: </b>

	Mr. Speaker, that is an exceptionally good question. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people including the minister do not understand what custodial management means. All it means is that the adjacent state, in this case Canada, would be the clear custodial manager with the right and duty to environmentally manage the stocks off its coast including those outside the 200 mile limit. We would declare ourselves  the manager of the resource. This could be done in consultation with other members of NAFO because they all have quotas in the area that they want to see preserved and protected.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even those who blatantly abuse the quotas admit that if we destroyed them there would be nothing left. Many countries are conscious of what is happening and of the need for someone to manage the resource. The logical manager is  the adjacent state, in this case Canada. If officials in our department of foreign affairs did something besides drink cognac and eat caviar we might get agreement to manage the stocks for the benefit of not only us but all the other countries with quotas provided they operated within the guidelines. As I have said, I think many of them would. It is not a difficult process. It is one that takes a lot of guts, and I am not sure they are there.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I congratulate my hon. colleague from St. John's West for his passionate and informed speech. He and other members of the fisheries committee have worked diligently on a problem that has plagued Atlantic Canada and other regions including the north and west coasts.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. member spoke of custodial management. He spoke  of dying villages and towns in rural Newfoundland and Nova Scotia. In my home province of Nova Scotia the towns of Canso and Mulgrave have suffered enormous losses and out-migration as a result of the hardships in the fishery.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another element about which my hon. colleague and friend is informed: the issues of historic attachment and adjacency which for many years have been the criteria. In the context of custodial management could he discuss how these two issues factor into helping rural communities control their own destinies?</p>


	<A NAME="Int-289181"></A><a HREF="#Int-289183"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-289179"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Loyola Hearn: </b>

	Mr. Speaker, those are two pointed issues which have been discussed quite often in the fishery. First, the hon. member addressed the issue of adjacency.  Over the years the people of Newfoundland and Nova Scotia, the provinces adjacent to the resource, have not been the only ones to fish it. In relation to almost every resource worldwide the principle of adjacency applies. Those adjacent to the resource are the first and main beneficiaries.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the hon. member spoke about historical attachment. This is where the Spanish, Portuguese and everyone else comes in because they have been fishing these grounds for years. We are not saying in any way that they should not be allowed to do so. All we are asking is that people abide by the rules. Someone has to be the policeman. We are satisfied to do it. It does not cost that much and everyone benefits.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope members from Newfoundland and other members will participate in this. The story must be told. It should not be cut off.</p>

Paul DeVillers (for the Minister of Canadian Heritage) </b>

	moved that Bill C-54, an act to promote physical activity and sport, be read the third time and passed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said: Mr. Speaker, it is with pleasure  that I stand in the House of Commons to debate third reading of Bill C-54, an act to promote physical activity and sport.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had the pleasure of introducing the bill to the House on April 10 on behalf of the Minister of Canadian Heritage. On April 15 the bill received second reading in the House of Commons and was referred to the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage and then to the Subcommittee on the Study of Sport in Canada. The subcommittee heard the testimony of witnesses from the sport community,  from government officials and the Official Languages Commissioner. It also received written submissions from a number of different organizations. On June 12 the member for Toronto--Danforth tabled in the House the first report of the Subcommittee on the Study of Sport in Canada of the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage. The report was debated yesterday, June 17.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased with the process that was undertaken and I am assured that the bill has had a thorough review and debate. We  worked with members of the sport community and with all parties both inside and outside the committee to reach an agreement in areas of controversy. We have respectfully considered all views and worked together to strengthen the bill. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill began with an extensive consultation.  There were exchanges with the sport community and  all levels of government. Their unanimous support have made the existence of the bill a reality and it is important that we recognize that.</p>

	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks to the  dynamism and contribution of all stakeholders in the sport community, the conditions most favourable to the advancement of sport in Canada were brought together in one place.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Henceforth, this bill  entrenches the policy of the Government of Canada regarding sport.  This policy reflecting the concerns of the sport community was adopted last April by the federal government in conjunction with all provincial and territorial governments. </p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill is consistent with the first ever Canadian sport policy. This landmark policy was the result of unprecedented consultations with the sport community. It was endorsed last April by myself as the Secretary of State for Amateur Sport and the provincial and territorial ministers responsible for sport, fitness and recreation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ministers embarked on this policy development process to create a more effective and transparent sport system to underscore the importance of sport and physical activity to the health of Canadians and to build a more harmonious environment to improve the sport experience. No government can claim on its own to change the system. Sport concerns everyone and everyone needs to participate in the process. The support of the sport community as well as the partners,  the population at large and other governments was key.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are entering a new era in Canadian sport and physical activity. We will soon have  new legislation for sport and physical activity which serves to modernize the  mandate and policies of the Government of Canada with respect to physical activity and sport. The Fitness and Amateur Sport Act of 1961 served the government well for 42 years and now we will soon be set for a new era. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The policy objectives of the Government of Canada regarding sport are threefold: to increase participation in sport, to support  the pursuit of excellence, and to build capacity in the Canadian sport system. The policy is based on the highest value of ethics in sport including: dope free sport; respectful treatment of all persons; the full and fair participation of all persons in sport; and the fair, equitable, transparent and timely resolution of disputes in sport.</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By entrenching the Government of Canada's physical activity and sport policies in this bill, the government is acknowledging that physical activity and sport are an integral part of Canadians'  lives and culture, and procur benefits in terms of  health, quality of life, economic activity, cultural diversity and social cohesion, particularly by their reinforcement of  the bilingual nature of Canada.  </p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This also demonstrates the commitment of the Government of Canada  to encourage and assist Canadians in increasing their levels of physical activity and   participation in sports.  It also recognizes its commitment to support the pursuit of excellence in sport and to build capacity in the Canadian sports system.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government through the bill does not only respond to the recommendations of the subcommittee on sport, it  also responds to commitments in the Speech from the  Throne where it indicated it would promote health and prevent disease and  strengthen its efforts to encourage fitness and participation in sports.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government of Canada is well aware that any government action with regard to sports affects a large number of Canadians.  According to the 1998 general social survey, over 8.3 million Canadians aged 15 and over participate in sport on a regular basis. According to the 2000 Statistics Canada survey, an estimated 1.8 million people are involved in sport and recreation organizations on a voluntary basis, not to mention the millions more who take part as parents, spectators, officials and administrators.</p>

	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this reason, a preamble was added to the bill demonstrating  that the government's commitment to physical activity and sport  needs to be seen as an investment in enhancing the well-being of all Canadians, and not an expense.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any investment in physical activity and sport contributes to quality of life and procures long term savings in health care.  </p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given today's challenges facing sport, the proposed legislation clarifies, along with the title and terminology, the existing ministerial mandate to adequately reflect and strengthen the role of the minister responsible for sport in fostering, promoting and developing sport in Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past 10 years the Canadian high performance sport system has experienced a large number of disputes over the selection of athletes on national teams and over doping in sport. Internal mechanisms of sport organizations have many limitations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To respond to the needs of the sport community, the bill provides for the creation of a sport dispute resolution centre of Canada.  The mission of the centre would be to provide the sport community with a national alternative dispute resolution service with expertise and assistance in this regard. The sport community will be able to use the services of the centre  to resolve sport disputes, which could include disputes regarding doping infractions, in an equitable, fair, transparent  and timely manner.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The creation of the centre through legislation demonstrates the importance given by the government to principles such as  transparency, equity and diligence.  It will place Canada at the leading edge internationally and will ensure stability, continuity and credibility to the dispute resolution process. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to concerns expressed by members of the sport community about Sport Canada being party to dispute resolutions, I would like to point out that under Bill C-54 no individual or organization would be obliged to use the centre's services, which are to be used on a consensual basis.  This also applies to Sport Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However clause 10 of the proposed legislation states that the centre's mission is to provide alternative dispute resolution services for sport disputes which include disputes among sport organizations and disagreements between sport organizations and persons affiliated with it, including its members. The notion of sport dispute is therefore broad enough for the centre to provide dispute resolution services where Sport Canada could agree to be a party.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore Sport Canada could in its policies, programs or in any specific agreement include an appeal mechanism that would refer disputes to the centre under terms and conditions of the said policy, programs or agreements as long as those disputes can be qualified as sport disputes. I think I can give the undertaking that Sport Canada will engage in such agreements. Obviously not in the policy areas but certainly in programming areas it is the intention that Sport Canada will avail itself of the services in the dispute resolution centre. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to indicate that the government's intention regarding the centre was not to create a federal institution or a governmental body but a not for profit organization at arm's length from the government.  In creating it we have tried to achieve the appropriate accountability measures in light of the arm's length nature of the centre.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important for us and the sport community that the centre be independent and have all the flexibility necessary to meet the future needs of the sport community while being accountable for public funds. I will be consulting with the sport community to ensure that individuals will be appointed to the board who have the expertise and capacity to enable the centre to fulfill its mission.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Physical inactivity is costly.  Reducing it by 10% can save $5 billion annually in health care costs. Provincial and territorial ministers responsible for sport have reiterated their commitment to reach such a target by the year 2003. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sport is about inclusion. Irrespective of age, culture, language, social status or physical or intellectual capacity, more people must be allowed access to a greater number of sports so that everyone can practise the sport of their choice.</p>

	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to discuss the Canadian sport policy, which was unanimously approved in April by the federal, provincial and territorial ministers responsible for  sport. This policy clearly demonstrates  the goodwill of the different levels of government to address the issue of official languages in the Canadian sport system.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The policy recognizes the barriers that francophones sometimes confront in sports. For example, according to Sport Canada policy, sport must be accessible to all, regardless of their language. Furthermore, the regulations and responsibilities in the sport system stipulate  that services must be provided in both official languages.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the role of the federal government, it must ensure that services will be provided in both official languages.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the different levels of government must increase the number of coaches who work in both official languages, in order to guarantee services for francophone and anglophone athletes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that these initiatives clearly demonstrate the goodwill of the different levels of government to address the issue of official languages in Canada.</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was pleased that the tabling of the proposed legislation raised the debate of the place of women in sport and physical activity. The government has made its position clear. We believe that women should be full and equal partners in Canadian sport, whether as athletes, coaches, officials, leaders or decision makers. We will work with the sport community drawing on the expertise of the Canadian Association for the Advancement of Women and Sport and Physical Activity to improve the status of women in sport and physical activity.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had communications with the executive of CAAWS.  I  have assured it that we will rely on it to provide us with the information, assistance and expertise on the compliance of the gender equity policies that are already in our funding programs now to ensure that the national sports organizations are in compliance.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Key players are also volunteers such as our coaches, officials, members in sports associations, organizers of competitions and so on. They contribute so much to sport all across the country. More than ever, sport must be regarded as an investment and not as an expense. Last year 378,000 jobs in Canada were related to sport. Sports contribution to our GNP is estimated at $8.9 billion, quite a score.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government of Canada, with the support of the sport community, provincial and territorial governments and the private sector, believes that the proposed legislation is an important step in a comprehensive strategy to affirm the key role of sport in Canadian society.</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue of sport in Canada is a social issue, an issue of goodwill and of partnership. It is an issue that affects us all.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I would seek the consent of the House for the second speaker, the hon. member for Toronto--Danforth, to have extended time. He is the chair of the subcommittee and has been involved with it since  the very beginning. I am sure members would be pleased to consent that he be allowed sufficient time to complete his remarks.</p>

However in terms of the proposition put forward by the secretary of state with regard to the hon. member for Toronto--Danforth, we might want to deal with that following the intervention of the member for Pictou--Antigonish--Guysborough and after we have gone around once. At that  time  possibly we could deal with the matter as to whether the member for Toronto--Danforth would need more time.  Is that agreed?</p>

	Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak to Bill C-54.  It is always a pleasure to speak to a bill that I agree with.  The bill is one that we have been in agreement with from the beginning.  We have  listened to the witnesses and listened to the amendments that were proposed in committee.  We headed off a couple of mistakes  within the committee amendment process but in the end we are satisfied that the bill is on the right track.  It is not a guarantee of success but it is on the right track of promoting sport and physical fitness. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recall the old   ParticipAction ads that still stay with me to this day.  I   remember the challenge that the 60 year old Swede was in better shape than the 25 year old Canadian.  I was probably about 25  when that ad was run on TV and now that I am closer to 60 than I am 25 it seems  to hit home a   bit.  However, Canadians listened to the old participation type ads that encouraged them to get physically fit. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A good friend from my riding, Doug Grimson, has  shown me over the years what value there is in a life of physical fitness, not only because one remains healthier which means fewer visits to the doctor and so on, but what an active lifestyle one can have when one is physically active and  fit. For Doug everything is  a challenge waiting to be taken on with full vigour.  That includes biking 100 miles,   running a half marathon, playing squash, tennis, or whatever,  it does not matter. Doug is up for it.  Last year he  wore out both of his knees so doctors had to scope both knees.  He was in respite care for about two weeks and then he was right back at it.  I am sure he will wear them out again.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Examples like that are encouraging to me  and  they should be encouraging to all of us who realize the benefits of physical fitness.  While it may be enjoyed by people like Doug and many others, lack of physical activity is a growing problem in Canada.  We must wrestle with this as a country. As a wealthy western country we increasingly have  a problem with inactivity and obesity.</p>

	On August 14, 2001, there was an article in the <i>National Post</i> that quoted Dr. Mackie from the British Columbia Medical Association.   It stated:</p>

<td><small>“We're seeing the kids coming into their early teens 20 to 30 pounds overweight. It's terrible, and it's happening right under our eyes,” Dr. Mackie said.  “There's a lot of sitting kids who don't do much”.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That call for a full time, full-fledged minister for sports and fitness was a call to arms from the BCMA. I am pleased to see that we are bringing together under one minister all the activities of amateur sport and physical activity.  We are taking  from different areas, some  from health, some from sport, and some from heritage, and bringing them together under one ministry.   Here we can do our best as a federal parliament to work with the provinces,  health authorities and others  to wrestle with a  growing problem in Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obesity rates have tripled in Canada since 1985 to 1998. New research in April  indicated that 57% of Canadian young people are so sedentary that they are harming their health. That is over 50% of our kids who are not getting enough physical activity. I would like to blame it all on the kids but 63% of adults were too sedentary to look after their own health. In other words we are not setting a good example and the nation as a whole is suffering for it in our health bills and in our ability to lead as productive and enjoyable lives as we can.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another Statistics Canada study points out that the participation in sports among Canadians 15 and older dropped from 45% in 1992 to 34% today. That is an incredible drop in participation rates. Doctors are warning again about the number of hours kids sit in front of TVs, and now TVs and computers, and their participation rate in sports has dropped accordingly. The Canadian Fitness and Lifestyle Research Institute reported in 2000 that the physical activity levels of Canadians increased from 1981 to 1995 but the participation rate has stalled and slipped backwards.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill is timely. Canadians understand that we must do something about this. We are a wealthy nation but with that wealth comes responsibility to look after ourselves, to do our part to be physically fit and look after our own health as best we can, and a good part of that has to do with physical activity.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One objective of Bill C-54 is to increase the opportunities for involvement in sports from the amateur to the elite athlete level. The physical activity policy in section 3  of Bill C-54 states: </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to thank the minister for identifying all Canadians as just that. We want to reduce barriers  that impede the ability of Canadians to have productive, full and enjoyable elements of physical activity  in their lives. We did not get carried away with any of the political correctness either. We just said all Canadians because that covers everyone. We all need to  find ways to be active, to reduce barriers that may be in place whether they are physical, language or cultural barriers. It is in the  interests of all Canadians to ensure we are physically active. The minister did a good job of drafting the language in the legislation to ensure that we did not pander to anyone but that we included all Canadians.</p>


	<A NAME="T1145"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1145"><!-- Hour: 11--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1150"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1140"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1145)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was interesting that some of the witnesses  before the committee pointed out that the participation rates for women were less than men in organized sports. The women who testified before the committee said that as long as we addressed this by calling for improvements  and reducing barriers for all Canadians we would not have to get gender specific because that  would include women and  they would be satisfied with the language. The minister and the committee did the right thing by adopting that inclusive language.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian sports policy is designed to   increase participation in the practice of sport, support the pursuit of excellence in sport  and  build capacity in the Canadian sport system. In order to meet these objectives Bill C-54 would give the minister power to participate in a number of activities, including:   arranging for national and regional conferences in respect of physical activity and sport, that would be the leadership role that we would expect the minister to take; working with provincial counterparts and sports organizations from coast to coast;  preparing and distributing information related to physical activity and sport;  undertaking or supporting any projects or programs related to physical activity and sport;  and providing bursaries or fellowships to assist individuals to pursue excellence in pursuit.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As always, the cream will rise to the top, but we must provide ways  to  skim  that cream off and  ensure it gets the type of assistance and leadership    for Canada to excel.  Those elite athletes become role models not just for our youth but for us all.  We become inspired.  We participate at greater rates when our elite athletes do well in any of the international and national forum.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the most moving moments in the House have been the times we have had the Olympic athletes come in on the floor of the House where we could laud them  and give them their due. To see those athletes proudly displaying their medals and showing their eagerness to promote their sport is inspiring.  Our congratulations to them is also heartfelt. Those athletes do more than just win  medals, they inspire a nation.  As we promote excellence, provide bursaries and fellowships to those individuals and coaches  I hope the minister will find increased ways  to ensure that meritorious athletes get to the top.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We  want to encourage the promotion of sport as a tool of individual and social development in Canada and in co-operation with other countries abroad.  That  should not be underestimated.  We  take national pride  in our traditional sports, whether it be men's or women's hockey, for example, or whether  we come home with Olympic medals and world championships.  We also take pride when we are  part of the community of nations showing the Canadian flag and participating in events from the Commonwealth Games to  la Francophonie, to championships large and small around the world.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is something about that participation in sport between nations  that builds rapport and creates opportunities to build into those nations some of our values as well.  For example,  every year between Christmas and New Year's in Chilliwack for the last 40 or 50 years people come from Seattle and all over the Pacific northwest to come to the peewee jamboree.     Sport is a great tool for social and individual development.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We  want to encourage, and this important,  the private sector to contribute financially to the development of sport.  Increasingly we see public-private partnerships in all levels of government activity.  Sports will  be no different.  There is a huge private component to sports.  The majority of funding and  community effort is at the private sector level and will continue to be so.  We do not pretend we will fund it all from this parliament.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand we want to find ways to laud those private sector partners.  They would help us develop sport, increase participation and   give us money to ensure that  happens at the community level. They are a great partner and we need to ensure that we do what we can to involve them at every level.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, this will encourage and support an alternative dispute resolution centre for sport.  This is an important thing. It is not a sidebar but an important part of the bill.  The mission of the centre is:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>to provide to the sport community</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>(a) a national alternative dispute resolution service for sports disputes; and</small></td>

</table>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>(b) expertise and assistance regarding alternative dispute resolution.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the establishment of this centre is a positive step forward because there are an increasing number of cases to settle on the sports dispute side. Currently there are  limited mechanisms to settle disputes and athletes have requested a centre like this, but  not just the athletes,  certainly the national organizations as well.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we think of it, athletes often are getting by on  a shoestring budget and when there is a dispute with a national body, Sports Canada or a national organization and they feel something has gone awry and they have not been treated fairly, what are they to do? There are examples even in the last year or two of where trying to settle a dispute through the courts might cost an athlete $40,000 or $50,000.  They do not have that kind of money and it is time consuming. The courts, while they will settle it, often do not have the expertise in sports dispute settlements like this so they make the best of a bad situation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This centre, while it  will be optional  for athletes and organizations to participate in it, will develop expertise  and soon, I am sure and would hope, a reputation as the go-to organization to help arbitrate and settle any disputes of a sports nature. I hope and believe that the way it is set up this will happen.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is perhaps for a good reason that all 12 directors of the  centre who will be appointed will work as volunteers. These will be people who have expertise in this area.  They will work as volunteers and bring their expertise to bear. They will hire an executive director of their choosing to put together a whole system that will help athletes and organizations across the country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill provides for the establishment of a code of ethics for directors, officers and employees of this centre as well as for arbitrators and mediators who provide dispute settlement services under the auspices of the centre.  There has been a lot of talk in this place about the need for a good ethics code and a good ethics package that everyone understands going in.  The bill would establish that right from the get-go.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill also stipulates that the board of directors shall establish an audit committee to go over the affairs of the centre.  It would:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right">
</td>
<td><small>(a)  require the Centre to implement and maintain appropriate internal control procedures;</small></td>

</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right">

<td><small>(b) review, evaluate and approve those internal control procedures;</small></td>

<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">

<td width="30" align="right">
</td>
<td><small>(e)  meet with...management to discuss the effectiveness of the internal control procedures.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, although these directors may be volunteers, and   I am sure they already are busy people,  they will have big responsibilities to make sure that the centre acts appropriately.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As well:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>The accounts and financial transactions of the Centre shall be audited annually by an independent auditor designated by the board of directors, and a written  report of the audit shall be made to that board.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that there are enough control systems in place to make sure that not only will the centre  do its work well but it will have a good reporting mechanism that we can all have a look at to make sure that things are going well.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I have pointed out in committee that there is one thing we are a little unsure of as of yet even though we agree with the mandate that is given in the bill.  We agree  with the increased role for the minister of physical fitness and sport.  He will be running more than 10 kilometres in order to prepare for this new role. However, we do want to make sure that all auspices of  sports and physical activity come under his aegis. Right now they are broken into different ministries and often get shortchanged because all bureaucrats and ministers want to hold all these things unto themselves. We end up with the health department demanding control of certain parts and the heritage  department others.  It is always a problem when conflicting ministries perhaps have the same objectives but there is no one person that can be consulted and held accountable both in the House and in the country.  </p>


	<A NAME="T1155"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1155"><!-- Hour: 11--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1200"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1150"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1155)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister of sport and physical activity is going to have an increasing amount of accountability for what is going on under his watch. We hope that he will be able to pull those components out of the different ministries and make sure that they come under his control so that we have one go-to guy on the ministry side and that  in turn he can get the job done because he will have control of both the purse strings and the programs.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a little unclear at this time exactly what the funding levels will be. Again that is something that came out in committee.   I am not sure how many dollars are involved  for the centre or for the fellowships, bursaries and so on that may come forward from this.  We will look forward to the upcoming budgets to see exactly how that will be done.  Of course we want to make sure  that it is an adequate amount, but obviously there is a limited amount that can be put to any one program. We want to make sure that there is an adequate amount for this important activity and that if it is taken out of other ministries like health  their budgets  are decreased while funds are transferred over for sports funding.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I want to  reiterate our support for the bill.  We think it is on the right track. We do encourage all levels of government to get involved and to stay involved during the consultative process.  Part of the mandate of the minister is to meet with provincial counterparts, with everyone from the BCMA to the national sports organizations, which I hope will find  a ready listener in the minister.  As the centre comes together, I am sure that the minister  will be called before committees and the House to make sure  it is done properly and  athletes and sports organizations are well served.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it not ironic that Canadians  have to wrestle with this problem of a wealthy nation that loses its ability to stay healthy because it becomes sedentary?  We simply have to grapple with this.  We could wish it were different, and I wish it were.   I saw an article the other day about  the need to send kids  to what are called fat farms.  This is a sad thing.  There is so much wealth and so much opportunity in the country to allow people to just sit back and enjoy too many Twinkies that they are ruining their health through inactivity.  We have to do what we can here at the federal level to make sure that we turn that around. Our country's population is aging, but the habits  established in our youth often affect our health right into our old age.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, I do support the bill.  I encourage the minister in his work.  I think we will find that it is one of those things where he will find broad, all party support for the need for the bill and for the need for the minister to  be not just physically active but very active politically in the realm of amateur sport and physical fitness.  I wish him well and I do hope that the centre and the activities that are described in the bill are successful in getting Canadians off the couch and into a life of activity.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, as the Bloc Quebecois critic for amateur sport, I rise today  to address Bill C-54, an act to promote physical activity and sport.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the beginning, we have felt that the objectives of this bill are worthwhile and even desirable. We said that we were in favour of the bill in principle, provided there is explicit compliance with the Official Languages Act. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It goes without saying that all Bloc Quebecois members, like all parliamentarians here, feel that physical activity is important and must be promoted through the implementation of practical and feasible measures. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stakeholders who appeared before the committee spoke about the numerous benefits of physical activity, both from a medical and social point of view. This is a legitimate goal but, more importantly, one that must be  maintained once achieved. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government measures that will result from this bill must be real, immediate, and they must be designed for the general public, without any discrimination at all.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Quebecois has insisted since the beginning that the Official Languages Act must be more than respected. Its provisions must be complied with in a real and systematic way.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the preamble to Bill C-54, it is stated that  physical activity and sport are integral parts of Canadian culture and  society and produce obvious benefits in terms of  health and social development.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We hope that the economic, structural and cultural benefits will be just the roots of the effects of this bill in the very long term. The medical benefits are numerous and significant. People who engage in a physical activity or sport tend to rely less on health care services. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From an economic point of view, there is, in addition to the spinoffs of special and international events, higher productivity for employees who engage in physical activity or sport. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that the health, social cohesion and participation objectives have been identified, we must immediately develop specific initiatives to achieve these benefits. We hope that this is what will actually come out of the implementation of the measures included in Bill C-54, considering its stated goals. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have already mentioned that this bill is aimed at two target groups. First, of course, the elite athletes and then all the rest of us ordinary folk.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On numerous occasions, we have witnessed  extraordinary and breathtaking performances by our elite athletes, but now we need to look more closely  into their situation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1999 the Bloc Quebecois filed a complaint with the Commissioner of Official Languages, asking her to investigate the problematic situation of francophone athletes. The Commissioner of Official Languages found that the allegations contained in the complaint were founded. The commissioner issued a  full report in 2000.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In her report, the Commissioner of Official Languages provided the results of extensive research on the use of French and English in the Canadian sport system. The commissioner came to the conclusion that not only did the selection process for Canadian teams constitute a serious barrier for francophone athletes, but that the problem arose well before even an athlete reached the point of competing to be selected as one of the final team members. This problem has existed for many years, and it is high time we act to ensure that the rights of francophone athletes are respected, and that they receive services and coaching in the language of their choice.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a long time now,  the Bloc Quebecois has been demanding  the implementation of the 16 recommendations contained in the official language commissioner's report, two years ago. We are still calling for their immediate implementation, as I mentioned yesterday. In fact, recognition of the problems faced by francophone athletes has been  at the heart of the demands we have made both here in the House and in the sub-committee on sport since the beginning.</p>


	<A NAME="T1205"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1205"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1210"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1200"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1205)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The official languages commissioner is clear: English and French are far from having equal status in Canadian sport.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the introduction of Bill C-54, the Bloc Quebecois  is entitled  to request that the official language commissioner's recommendations be formally implemented and, in particular, that they be explicitly included in the bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Quebecois   therefore calls for legislative recognition of the formal implementation of the Official Languages Act.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How many francophone athletes have trained for years but  not made it to international level competitions because of the language barrier? </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer, unfortunately, is far too many. From the very beginning, the Bloc Quebecois   has repeatedly called on the government to respect francophone athletes and trainers, who must master the English language, in addition to their particular sport.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our request is entirely legitimate. We want to remind the government that 12 of the 16 recommendations were supposed to be implemented by April 1, 2001. None  of the 16 recommendations has been implemented, and this is regrettable. Let us hope that all this will change as of today.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet these recommendations reflected a reality  too blatant too ignore. In her first recommendation, the official languages commissioner asked Sport Canada to review the official languages goals of the sport funding  framework. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore up to Sport Canada to require Canadian sport federations to simply eliminate the barriers facing our francophone athletes. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The commissioner's second recommendation was that Sport Canada systematically monitor implementation of the official languages goals, in a funding context, by April 1, 2001.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next recommendation was that Treasury Board review its audit methodology in order to ensure control of program compliance.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the commissioner recommended a complete and exhaustive review of the language requirements  of positions in the Athlete Assistance Program.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifth, she recommended that official languages requirements be met at major games.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sixth, the official languages commissioner recommended a review of the language requirements of management positions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The report talked about reviewing the allocation of responsibilities among program officers in order to ensure that client organizations are served in the official language of their choice. It was strongly recommended that Sport Canada work with national sport organizations to ensure that they adopt appropriate policy statements on official languages.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was also recommended that there be a review of the linguistic capability of the staff of national sport organizations, and that such capability become a Sport Canada requirement.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The commissioner also recommended that Sport Canada review   sport organizations' official languages budgets. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, it was a matter of studying the feasibility of providing centralized linguistic services such as translation to sport organizations, either through government programs or through a non-governmental organization which could  assume this mandate.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The twelfth recommendation addressed  working with national sport organizations to identify the first official language of national team coaches by April 1, 2001. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next recommendation dealt with distribution of technical manuals for  coach education   in both official languages.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourteenth is about ensuring that some members of the coaching group responsible for national teams have a knowledge of both official languages.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next COL recommendation related to these same requirements for pedagogical material. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the commissioner felt it was important that medical services be provided in both official languages.  We feel it is necessary to repeat all these recommendations because, although the report dates back to the year 2000, it has taken the government more than two years to react.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it did introduce a bill in the House of Commons, it took the insistence of the Bloc Quebecois to get  respect of both official languages to be entrenched in legislation  from now on. </p>


	<A NAME="T1210"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1210"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1215"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1205"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1210)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our athletes and coaches have to perform miracles because of the flagrant lack of resources that has gone on far too long already.  We were all proud of their performances at the latest Olympic Games, in  Salt Lake City.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just imagine what the outcome would have been if they had had the appropriate resources.  Just imagine what it would have been if francophone athletes and coaches had had decent access to services and to Canadian team selection.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are all aware of the exceptional performances by Quebec athletes in these games.  They must be multi-talented, as they need to have not only mastered their sport discipline, but the English language as well.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This vicious circle absolutely must end.  The time is past when francophone athletes and coaches had to accept this.  The time for balance is finally here.  The authorities have had ample time to react to the  official languages commissioner's report. Now is time for action.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Quebecois has called for formal respect, entrenched in law, of both official languages, for as long as is necessary.  We are pleased with the results we have observed so far. We shall be watching to ensure that implementation in future is real and tangible.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merely stating that the Official Languages Act applies is not sufficient.  This act has been in place for quite some time, and there are still far too many  Canadian sports federations that do not yet comply with it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another barrier encountered by francophone athletes and coaches is the lack of vision among Canadian broadcasters. Radio-Canada does not meet the needs and expectations of athletes, coaches or amateur sports fans.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Radio-Canada has a shameful record when it comes to broadcasting events related to amateur athlete performances. It is nonexistent. Radio-Canada does not fulfill its obligations toward Quebecers and francophones outside Quebec, and this is unacceptable.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quebecers and francophones outside Quebec recently experienced this when Radio-Canada decided to end a 50 year tradition and stop broadcasting <i>La Soirée du hockey</i>. Imagine what it must be like for  Quebecers and francophones outside Quebec. This decision only worsens an already difficult situation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The role of Radio-Canada is to promote physical activity and amateur sport, but it would rather turn its back on our athletes and coaches who are, let us acknowledge it, international in calibre. It takes years of work and concentration to train an olympic calibre athlete.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This requires more than wishful thinking. It requires money, lots of money. However, our athletes also need visibility. It is incumbent upon Radio-Canada to carry out its  broadcasting duties across Canada, and in particular in Quebec, so that Quebecers can see what is happening and watch their athletes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the government's job to ensure that the crown corporation takes its responsibilities seriously. The media coverage of the Paralympic Games or the Commonwealth Games was minimal, almost nonexistent. It is already a tough sell  attracting sedentary viewers to physical activity.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is  difficult to attract people's attention to something they are unaware of. If the public is not aware of sport events taking place here, then it should come as no surprise that they are becoming more and more sedentary, and also obese.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Quebecois believes that the promotion of physical activity must be increased, varied and more widely broadcast. Is the problem a lack of money? Yes.  Decrepit equipment? Yes.  Are training centres too far from where athletes live? Yes. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here we have before us a tool that will help correct these incomprehensible situations. The values that sport and physical activity promote are commendable, even essential.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are talking about perseverance, discipline, effort, determination and sacrifice. We know the problems. We now have a tool. So let us go forward and rectify what has deserved to be for too long. </p>


	<A NAME="T1215"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1215"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1220"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1210"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1215)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Excellence is not limited to medals, we all know that. Through the effective implementation of the objectives of Bill C-54, we will finally be able to reach summits that were becoming increasingly unreachable.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like you, Mr. Speaker, I have dreamed of an olympic medal. This is how many hopes are born among our young and not so young people. Most of us have given up on this goal, but we can now dream once again and we can finally tell our children that they too can dream about it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some were successful in achieving their goals, and they won medals. Yet, very few reach such heights. Only a very select group has reached the podium. These athletes are now our inspiration and we thank them for this. What we have learned from their feats is sportsmanship. We  thank them for this also. They have made us realize that we must provide to the new generation of athletes the necessary tools to reach this goal. These tools must be provided to the greatest number of people  possible. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I was saying,  there is no difference between sports at the grassroots and sports at the highest level.  All elite athletes began practising their sport in their back yard or  neighborhood park. This is why we must  invest right now to support athletes and coaches.    This is also why we must continue to improve the existing infrastructure and invest in new facilities. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, the government must do its utmost to promote the pleasure of competing and engaging in a physical activity, in keeping with sport values and, of course,  in compliance with the Official Languages Act.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must also redesign our sport values and purposely include members of the public as full-fledged participants. Members of the subcommittee on sport all agreed that we still have a lot to learn about physical activity. We must review our definition of participation and we must do our utmost to promote participation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every Canadian knew about  ParticipAction, but the  program was eliminated by this government last year. The Bloc Quebecois hopes that the federal government will find it appropriate to consult its Quebec counterpart to discuss the benefits of the Kino-Québec program and that it will follow its example. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also hope that the related moneys will be transferred to the Quebec government to promote Kino-Québec. It is to be noted that the objectives of this Quebec program are similar to those of Bill C-54. It would be appropriate to have consultations and initiate discussions on this issue.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have all wondered about why people lose interest in physical activity. Some say that television, video games or computer games are the main causes. But we must look further; it would be too easy to stop there. There is a lack of access to facilities. We now have the tool to correct this situation. Therefore, let us move forward and allow general access to sport facilities. This is part of promoting public participation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, there are not enough facilities. Again, let us move forward and correct this shortage. Since 1976, very few new sport facilities have been built   in Quebec and the federal government has not been involved at all. We also need more coaches. We must act now to correct this whole situation, and I think we can do so with this bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goals of this bill are commendable, but we should ensure we have specific measures to promote physical activity. For example, we should review what is going on in the media in terms of  broadcasting and promotion, because we have all seen that the coverage of the paralympics was clearly deficient, if not totally absent.</p>


	<A NAME="T1220"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1220"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1225"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1215"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1220)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-59 spells out its purpose  in several goals. These goals could be nothing but  wishful thinking, but we hope they will be achieved quickly.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We think that achieving these goals will help all athletes reach for excellence, and that they will also encourage the public to engage in sports and physical activity.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly, the government's intention is to promote physical activity and sport in order to improve the health and well-being of people. But the government should carefully avoid infringing on the jurisdictions of Quebec, the provinces and the territories.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Athletes and coaches, for a whole generation, have been the victims of drastic cuts in grants and assistance programs. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Quebecois hopes this bill signals the end of these cuts and the start of real investment in physical activity and sport.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Training an athlete or a coach takes many years of hard work. This training must be uninterrupted, with financial and structural support. The Bloc Quebecois hopes this bill will provide both forms of support.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We hope that never again will an athlete or a coach have to go through such a situation or face funding cuts. It would be too unfair for an athlete to be faced with the hardest decision of their life: pursue his or her dream and go into debt, or give it up to earn a living and survive.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This  should never happen again. As we have said, the time for studies and committees is over. It is time to put the necessary money to work for athletes and coaches, but also for the public, which wants to improve its quality of life.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Quebecois  wants to encourage the government to put in place as quickly as possible a mechanism for working together with the Government of Quebec and the provincial governments in order to promote and develop sport and physical activity.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We hope that this will be achieved by making the transfers needed to achieve these goals, with care taken not to interfere in the jurisdiction of Quebec, or of the provinces and territories.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 of the bill allows the minister to enter into agreements with the Government of Quebec, and the provincial and territorial governments for the payment of contributions in respect of costs incurred. We are confident that the government will drop any intention of promoting the Canadian identity  in implementing this clause.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Quebecois  has long requested that athletes and coaches be the core focus of any policy on sport. This is what we see in the wording of the bill. We therefore encourage the government to respect this apolitical commitment and to pursue this course.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill also gives the Minister of Canadian Heritage the mandate to encourage the private sector to contribute to the development of sport. This mandate needs to be expanded to include physical activity. It is up to the government to inform employers about their responsibilities with respect to the promotion of sport and physical activity.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employers will soon reap the benefits of participation in physical activity. The private sector's contribution to the development of sport will be to put the best interests of athletes and coaches ahead of monetary goals.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Central to the bill is the creation of the Sport Dispute Resolution Centre. The Bloc Quebecois  believes that the creation of such a centre is vital.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, this centre will be good both for Canadian sport federations and for the athletes and coaches who are members of them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were instances where an athlete has suffered  a harsh and permanent penalty because the decision on the dispute was not made in time for him or her to take part in an important competition.</p>


	<A NAME="T1225"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1225"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1230"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1220"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1225)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, the avenues for dispute resolution have been limited to common law courts. As we know,  delays  drag out because of abuse of process, resulting in athletes getting worn down.  We believe that the creation of this center will help to greatly reduce delays.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In certain cases, Canadian sport federations or athletes were forced to spend enormous amounts of money because their case  was brought before a common law court, with all the legal costs that entails. We hope that  the creation of this dispute resolution centre will provide a means of dispute resolution satisfactory to Canadian sport federations and athletes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are pleased that this  not-for-profit centre will operate at arm's length, without any king of interference from the government. We are also pleased  that the purpose of this centre will be to encourage transparency in procedures and decision making.  It should be noted that the Bloc Quebecois has called for that on numerous occasions in the House.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must stress, however, the need for an impartial and independent decision-making process. As in the case of a common law court, judicial independence is essential and of utmost importance.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties must be able to see in the centre the appearance of impartiality and independence. In other words, the parties' perception should be that the judicial and extrajudicial proceedings show freedom of action and of thought. The wording of the provisions of Bill C-54 seems to confirm this requirement for transparency and independence.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Quebecois believes that the centre must allow for rapid awards, while making appeals possible. In this way, we believe that everyone's rights will be protected. The right of appeal must be upheld.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the parties will have appeared before a mediator or an arbitrator first, they will   be able to assess whether an appeal is warranted. Moreover, we think the fact that mediators and arbitrators come from the sport community is a good idea.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only  Canadian federations and their members will have access to the centre. By operating in this way, the jurisdictions of Quebec, of the provincesl and of the territories  will not be affected. The internal rules will specify  the terms and conditions under which the centre will carry out its mission. We favour the possibility of appeal in order to protect the fundamental right of representation before the courts. This is how the arbitration boards in Quebec operate at present. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be prudent and advisable to follow the guidelines found in Quebec's code of civil procedure to establish the procedural requirements for the internal management of the centre. In fact, these provisions should have been included in the act. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under article 382 of the Code of Civil Procedure of Québec,  a case is only  referred to an arbitrator  when the parties request that the dispute be resolved. We believe that  the same should apply to the centre being established by Bill C-54. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the beginning, the Bloc Quebecois has been recommending that it be up to the athletes to resort to the Sport Dispute Resolution Centre. To respect the fundamental right  to turn to the courts, it is essential that we specify that the decision to resort to this alternative is completely voluntary. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We continue to insist  on compliance with the provisions of article 386 of the Code of Civil Procedure of Québec, which says that arbitrators must make their award in writing. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 30 day time limit set out in article 387 of the Code of Civil Procedure of Québec should be included in the centre's bylaws,  as well as the award homologation method. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We wish to reiterate the need to make every decision subject to an appeal mecanism before the common law courts. This is what article  393 of the  Code of Civil Procedure of Quebec provides for, if that is what the parties want. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This article provides that, when homologated, the award  may be appealed like any judgment of the superior court. </p>


	<A NAME="T1230"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1230"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1235"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1225"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1230)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We feel obliged to point out that we still insist  that the goals and missions provided for in this bill be achieved in a context of total respect for the jurisdictions of Quebec, the other provinces and the territories, particularly as far as training and bursaries are concerned.  We are adamant about that and will continue to be. It is a fundamental requirement which is self-evident.     We were told in committee that Quebec's jurisdictions would be respected.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The preamble states that the federal government wishes to encourage co-operation with the Government of Quebec, among the various governments, the physical activity and sport communities and the private sector. It specifies that this encouragement is for the purpose of coordinating their promotion efforts.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, we would like to point out that there needs to be more than co-operation; there must be ongoing and sustained discussions in order to succeed. In fact, we believe that the first efforts at coordination must be between the Government of Quebec and the different levels of government before involving the private sector</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure that the jurisdictions of all levels of government are respected, instead of undertaking consultations, the  Canadian heritage minister, through the Secretary of State for Amateur Sport, should  set up  issue tables in conjunction with her counterparts in Quebec and the  provinces and territories, because they are the ones who know best the needs and aspirations of  athletes and coaches.    </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through such discussions,  the stakeholders could agree on shared strategies to be followed and on the specific challenges, all this while respecting respective jurisdictions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The federal government has always recognized Quebec's responsibility as far as recreation and health are concerned. It did so back in 1987 with the National Recreation Statement. We are therefore asking for this to be continued.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Quebecois therefore recommends the transfer of the funds earmarked for this bill to the Government of Quebec.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It  will thus be able to  apply them via programs already in place. As a result, the duplication and redundancy that generally results from such overlap would be avoided.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would have been recommendable to have a specific whereas statement in the preamble to confirm  this respect of jurisdictions, with a view to avoiding needless and pointless friction between the various levels of government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also essential and vital for this bill to state explicitly that the Official Languages Act must be complied with in order to ensure that it is formally applied, and that all of its provisions are applied. This is now the case.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compliance with the act must therefore be ipart of the regular activities of the Sport Dispute Resolution Centre of Canada created by Bill C-54.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Quebecois believes that this is a good first step. We must then ensure that the bill will indeed be implemented. From now on, the Official Languages Act will be recognized in legislation. It was time that the situation was corrected.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the challenges affect the whole country, given that they are closely related to the francophone reality. The Commissioner of Official Languages stated this in her report, as I mentioned earlier.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We hope that all of her recommendations will be implemented. It is important to follow up on these recommendations to ensure that they really do get implemented in the very near future. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It only makes sense that  these recommendations  be implemented as soon as possible. Many French speaking athletes have been penalized by the lack of respect for the French fact. Another generation must not suffer the same fate.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exodus of French speaking athletes is a result of the lack of resources earmarked for sports facilities. Lacking what they need, our athletes have often been forced into exile in the west to perfect their craft. This exodus has a devastating effect on Quebec. We have been feeling the effects for much too long.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the elite athletes are concerned, some measures have been put into place, but there are still too many shortcomings. This is why young athletes and coaches who have risen to a high level end up going west when their striving for excellence goes beyond what is available to them in Quebec.</p>


	<A NAME="T1235"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1235"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1240"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1230"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1235)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Athletes who are in exile testified at regional hearings and said that we need a plan to correct the situation and train high level athletes and coaches in Quebec, and train them in French, to meet the needs of the French speaking community. Another way to correct this unfair situation is to help with major events, so that Quebec's potential gains international exposure.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The potential is there  in Quebec, but it really needs our help. As a matter of fact, all athletes and coaches  need our help now. Let us hope that the measures contained in Bill C-54 will adequately address these glaring flaws.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people are talking about a lost generation, and others of future generations that will not have  time to develop their full potential. Clearly, the training of Olympic and Paralympic athletes takes years—some ten years, actually. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the private sector, the government must ensure that all disciplines of sport are respected, as well as the diversity of physical activities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The role of the  private sector will be to support all events in all disciplines, instead of investing in the careers of a few athletes that have obtained good results. This will ensure that our athletes and coaches will get what they deserve in the end, real support, both financial and structural.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While this bill states a number of objectives, adequate financial resources are necessary to effectively meet needs and follow up on intentions. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In its brief, Sports-Québec indicated  that the resources allocated to sport by the federal government were currently  not nearly enough and that, unless they were  increased, this bill would remain a utopia. We agree with this statement. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, we support the recommendations submitted by Sports-Québec at the national sport summit, held in April 2001, in Ottawa. According to Sports-Québec, the budgets allocated to sport should be increased, with the exception of the moneys for professional sports and the organization of major games. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed budgets are as follows: in 2002, it should have been 0.15% of the government's total budget; 0.2% in 2003; 0.3% in 2005, and 0.5% in 2008. These objectives are very reasonable. All that is needed is the government's will to support these figures, so that the real objectives of the bill can be achieved. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they appeared before the committee, all the stakeholders shared their concerns about the growing needs of the sport community. Some said that there was no serious commitment on the part of the federal government regarding facilities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This shortcoming has economic and social consequences on international sport events. The situation is even more critical for winter sports equipment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Quebecois believes that the results will  be positive only if we compeltely rethink our philosophy toward athletes and coaches. It is also appropriate to review our attitude toward physical activity. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A whereas in the preamble of Bill C-54 deals with the desire to increase public awareness of the benefits of physical activity and sport. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We want to point out that this must be done only if the jurisdiction of Quebec and the various levels of government is respected. It is obvious that this implies the involvement of several departments, particularly health and education. Once again, the Bloc Quebecois recommends that there be  continuing discussions with counterparts from Quebec, the provinces and the territories. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A very important fact is that, to respond to the expectations of this bill, there will have to be increased broadcasting and greater diversity in what is broadcast.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Quebecois hopes that a real Department of Sport will be established. We moved an amendment on this. This seemed to receive unanimous support in the sub-committee. Thus, athletes and coaches, as well as the people of Canada and Quebec people, would have had a department with a real portfolio.  </p>


	<A NAME="T1240"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1240"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1245"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1235"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1240)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sports-Québec also recommends the establishment of this department. With a real Department of Sports complete with a portfolio, the objectives could probably have been applied at all levels, from the  elite down. This would probably encourage widespread promotion  of the objectives in a much more effective way than through the federations,  which are mainly concerned with fostering excellence. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that the time allotted to me is up. I therefore hope that all the necessary funding will be made available so that physical activity and sport are recognized for the benefits they yield. </p>

	Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure for me as well to   speak to Bill C-54, an act to promote physical activity and sport.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we indicated yesterday when the bill was being discussed, we are in support of the bill, as are all the opposition parties.   </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the outset I want to pay tribute to the current minister of amateur sport and the previous minister of amateur sport, both of whom are in the House today, and indeed the member for Toronto--Danforth who chaired the committee and who has contributed a lot to the point that we are at here this afternoon.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that both sport and physical activity, in whatever forms they take, are extremely important.  There is a strong connection between sports and physical activity and  good health and self-esteem.  That applies not only to all of us but to young people in particular.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an aside, I had the privilege, as the member of parliament for the district, of being at Notre Dame college in Wilcox, Saskatchewan  on Saturday where about 65 students were graduating. It was fascinating for me to see the number of   students who received both academic and athletic scholarships and bursaries totalling more than $1 million.  It is an incredible amount of money.  It is a real tradition.  However Athol Murray College  of Notre Dame   is not just a sports factory. Many students received  scholarships and bursaries   based on their academics.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a motto at the school that I think is good for the students and certainly good for everyone who was in attendance.  The motto reads as follows: </p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>What lies behind us and what lies ahead of us are far less important than what lies within us.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that is particularly true for young people.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The  proposed  legislation is an act to promote physical activity and sport. The bill is intended to replace and update the Fitness and Amateur Sport Act of 1961.  It is intended to bring people, organizations and governments together with the goal of encouraging, promoting and developing physical activity and sport in Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill would replace the old act which was passed in 1961.  It positions physical activity as a critical determinant of health, which is extremely important.  It responds to the expectations of the sporting community.  It harmonizes with other industrial countries and entrenches the government's objectives related to physical activity and sport, and facilitates alternative dispute resolutions in sport.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill recognizes the importance of physical activity, as I have indicated.  It increases the awareness of benefits of physical activity by encouraging participation and the co-operation among levels of government, people engaged in physical activity, the sporting community and   the private sector.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the vast majority of us who compete in the political arena have probably grown up competing in the sporting arenas,  as do  our children.    Unfortunately there are far too many of us who are not as physically active as we should be--</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do want to pause here to say that there are some individuals who would like to participate in sport and are unable to participate in sport because they are not in a financial situation to do that. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was listening when the minister in his address this morning said that sport is everyone's business.  It should be everyone's business but unfortunately there are people who lack the financial resources to participate in an organized sporting activity, and I think that we need to be concerned about that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now want to talk  a little about the other side of the inactivity that leads to obesity.  We are told that at least 13% of Canadians, more than 3 million people, are obese. That is defined as having more than 30% body fat. This number, as discouraging as it is,   tripled   between the period of 1985 and 1998. It is not only as a result of diet  but of a  general lack of physical activity. As we all know, this has  significant health implications. People carrying too much weight are far more likely to develop cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and cancers. It is estimated that direct medical costs attributed to obesity in our country are almost $2 billion a year at $1.8 billion. </p>


	<A NAME="T1245"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1245"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1250"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1240"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1245)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is an extremely serious problem and it is important among our young children.  The <i>International Journal of Obesity</i> indicates that about 30% of Canadian children fall into that category.  That is  a rate that is significantly higher than for children the same age in countries like  England, Scotland and Spain.  Again, the culprits appear to be diet and a lack of exercise and physical activity.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too often parents, working long hours to make ends meet, have less time for their children than perhaps my parents did or those of my generation.  Families today seem to be so harried that they often do not have the time or the energy left to cook meals in the evening and they end up taking the children to a drive-through.  Children are more often kept in doors these days because parents consider the streets to be unsafe.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have far too often become  a nation of compulsive television watchers, couch potatoes and computer junkies which has had a negative impact on our health and on the costs and stresses of our health care system.  This is something that the royal commission on health   looked at very actively in the  spring and will continue to do so into the fall.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We support any attempt to encourage and enable people, young and old, in the country to become more active.  I acknowledge that the bill moves us in that direction and that is one of the main reasons we support it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill is intended to bring people, organizations and governments together to encourage, promote and develop physical activity and sport.  The minister has told us that the bill would position physical activity as a critical determinant of health, and our caucus fully supports the goal.  We hope the legislation meets the minister's description of it. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The preamble indicates that sport and physical activity should be forces that bind Canadians together enhancing, among other things, the bilingual reality of Canada.  We were pleased to see there were amendments to that effect in the bill as it now stands.  We want to do whatever we can to ensure that there is more significance given to language   so that it is not just the French Canadian athletes who  are forced to learn English in order to participate on a team or in the sporting event at hand.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to make a few comments on the sport dispute resolution centre.  The athletes have asked for this.  There are an increasing number of disputes to be arbitrated.  Current mechanisms are  limited.  As we look at the legislation the centre appears to be at arm's length, meaning that arbitrators and mediators are not employees of the government.  The dispute resolution centre would be a not for profit centre.  Sports organizations have asked for the centre and I am pleased that the bill does create such an organization. The    board of directors would  appoint its own  executive director.  I believe this  was also a change that was made as the bill went through the committee process. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I support the bill, its actions, not its words, will be more important.  We recall, and others have alluded to it before, ParticipAction was created in 1971 to promote physical fitness in Canada.  It did a fine job over the years of encouraging ordinary Canadians to become more fit.  The federal government put up most of the money at first  but, as in so many other areas of our lives, it seems to have backed away more recently.   </p>


	<A NAME="T1250"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1250"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1255"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1245"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1250)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was federal support of more than $1 million a year in the 1970s, but by the year 2000, when it effectively ceased to exist, ParticipAction was receiving less than $385,000.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, we can stand  and debate legislation and we can pass legislation, but without the commitment from the government and  the resources to support that commitment, we will not succeed in making Canadians fitter and more healthy or have more of them stand on  international podiums.  I hope that once we pass the bill the government will show its commitment to follow up with real, significant action.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, it is very good to see you in the Chair. I know what a good sport you are and how often you have been a strong advocate for your teams in Brandon, the Wheat Kings and your national basketball championship team the Bobcats.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak at third reading to this important piece of legislation.  Given the heady times and the time constraints that parliament is under, it is encouraging to see a piece of legislation that is so positive and so unanimously endorsed by all parties in a non-partisan way.  This is exactly the type of legislation that should give Canadians food for thought and certainly cause them to pause and ponder the very nature of what can happen when this co-operative spirit exists.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enactment of this legislation will replace the Fitness and Amateur Sport Act, which was enacted in 1961, with modernized legislation that is better adapted to the contemporary realities.  That is a very good phrase that encapsulates much of what this bill would do.  It would modernize Canada's approach to sport and fitness at a time when the world is moving very quickly and at a time when sports, like business and politics, have become more sophisticated, more complex and more involved. Issues  such as those pertaining to doping, equipment, sponsorships and the money that is often involved in the promotion of sport affect many people across the spectrum. All these are encapsulated and touched upon by the provisions of this bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enactment of this legislation also establishes an important element and response to dispute and some of the controversy that sometimes is inevitable in sporting activities.  As a former referee, Mr. Speaker, you would be familiar with the occasional dispute that might break out during competition.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The resolution centre will be an independent organization.  Its mission is to provide the sports community with a national alternative dispute service for sports disputes.  I will speak a  bit more about that in my remarks.  In particular, it is aimed at offering some independence and greater credibility in getting to the very root of the dispute itself.  With infractions, impartiality and all  these charges, there has to be a very clear and transparent system that allows all the parties that might be involved, and sometimes it is more than one or two, to have faith and trust in the governing body that will ultimately decide the outcome.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also an important element of timeliness when there is international competition.  A perfect example that comes to mind was the Moscow Olympics wherein many Canadian and North American athletes were denied that once in a lifetime opportunity to compete internationally.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are other occasions when people find themselves off a national team or suspended from participating in an event.  That might have been their one opportunity in their entire lifetimes to participate at a level and to achieve their highest goal.  Therefore, these dispute resolution mechanisms and this centre  are critical to the very essence of what this bill seeks to accomplish.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just looking at some of the overall effort and direction of the bill, the objectives are clearly to promote physical activity as a fundamental element of health and well-being.  What more noble purpose than that?  Other speakers have mentioned the health implications.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The very essence of cultural diversity is found in the legislation.  Specific effort  has been made to achieve linguistic duality to promote activity and participation in both official languages and of course the very intrinsic elements of healthy, extended and joyful living on the part of Canadians. Statistics  from Health Canada and Statistics Canada clearly indicate that Canada has some distance to go to improve its record and some of the ailments, including obesity, which I think can be deemed fairly a detriment to the health of Canadians</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill is all about encouraging greater participation, simplicity of participation and doing away with some of the hurdles that might prevent those who given ideal circumstances would come forward.</p>


	<A NAME="T1255"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1255"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1300"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1250"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1255)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a very positive comment, the bill is meant to encourage Canadians themselves to take ownership over their own health issues, to integrate physical activity into their daily lives and to assist in reducing those barriers faced by Canadians that might prevent them from living more active lifestyles.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is fair to say that huge practical benefits and savings are associated with what the bill specifically is targeting. It is meant to increase participation in the practice of sport and to support the pursuit of excellence at the same time. Clearly there are those who choose to make sport their life's pursuit and greater support, both through resources and encouragement, is essential.  However there are also the other very pedestrian benefits of encouraging greater participation in daily activities, as simple as going for a walk, or attending a child's sporting match or activity or making a choice between doing an activity indoors or outdoors. This is all about building and enhancing the very foundation of the Canadian sports system.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I mentioned earlier, Statistics Canada has shown that increasing numbers of individuals  are not participating in traditional sports, which is another acknowledgment that deserves mention.  A whole new infrastructure will develop around climbing, kayaking and outdoor winter sports such as snowboarding, which has taken off exponentially in recent years,  but there is cost associated with them. Again one of the underlying factors as to the true success and measure of the legislation will be whether that infrastructure develops. I believe  the legislation is at least encouraging  that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elements that I wanted to touch upon personally also deal with the social benefits in particular for young people, where they are encouraged to participate in active sports whether they be the traditional or mainstream sports or more individual type sports,  where they make  choices in life, their intrinsic values, and where they gain the knowledge and education  from those choices.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One gentleman in my riding made a very telling comment to me one time about his son's participation in minor hockey. He described how his son was with a crowd of other youth who were engaging in the use of alcohol and drugs. They were hanging out on street corners. They were headed down a road to trouble. He sat his son down and encouraged him to spend more time on his sports and school. He said to me “I could tell the direction my young fellow was headed. It was either going to be courts or sports”. For many young people in Canada, not just young men, this is a choice. If they put their efforts into a sporting activity, it detracts  from the pull and the potential to get into trouble with the law,  with drugs and alcohol and other questionable activities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The choices that young people have to make cannot be overstated.  The availability of sports programs in communities encourages them to make the right choice. I know the RCMP in particular has been very active in pursuing sports related programs. There is a terrific program in my community in Nova Scotia that deals with literacy in sports and makes that linkage between the choices that young people make to avoid trouble with the law and the choices that will help them later in life. It also teaches them very fundamental lessons about competition and fair play and about winning and losing and how to cope with both.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These again are very fundamental principles that weave their way through this entire bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. member:</b> And make it affordable.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Peter MacKay:</b> The affordability is of course very important, as my colleague from St. John's points out, as well as ensuring, particularly in rural parts of the country, that there is not a disparity as to availability of sports programs. We know that in cities and towns the costs associated with ballparks, diamonds and equipment is ever increasing, particularly as it relates to our national sport of hockey.</p>


	<A NAME="T1300"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1300"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1305"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1255"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1300)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister, with the approval of the governor in council, may enter into agreements with provinces and territories to provide for the payment of contributions in respect of  costs   incurred in undertaking programs designed to encourage and promote the development of physical activity or sport. A process would be set up so that  we would not over-developing or over-concentrating in some areas of the country at the expense of others.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the approval of the governor in council, the minister may enter into an agreement or an arrangement with the government of any foreign state  to encourage, promote or develop sport.  Clear lines are delineated as to the direction  the minister might take.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bill would establish the sports dispute resolution centre of Canada, a  not  for profit corporation. It would not be an agent of Her Majesty, or a departmental corporation or a crown corporation within the meaning of the Financial Administration Act. It would be a unique body.  Some of the amendments which were made yesterday reflected the necessity for independence and  for the board of directors to have a larger degree of autonomy and self-control over the centre itself.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is important and is very much in keeping with the spirit of the bill because it would allow the board of directors to develop a rapport, team work and a sense of belonging  in the effort to promote sport in the country and to deal with problems when they arise.  There will no doubt  be occasions where the dispute resolution mechanism will be called into play on very important issues that could have a significant impact on the direction of a national team, or a national athlete or simply to bring about a resolution of a dispute that is getting in the way of greater participation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mission and powers of the centre are  about providing the sports community with this national alternative of a dispute resolution service.  It is clear to me that this will be a more timely resolution and better than going through a traditional court hearing or going through a alternative mechanism that might involve lengthy submissions and  mediation that in many instances could result in a greater injustice because of the delay involved. The expertise and assistance regarding this dispute resolution will no doubt be an important part in its formation. As in most teams,  businesses and parties, it is very much about  personal commitment and  quality of personnel that will determine its success.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to the overall thrust of the bill, the Progressive Conservative Party wholeheartedly supports physical participation in sport. We support legislation that will aid in the pursuit of a healthier live style for Canadians of all ages.  It is clear  from  the language in the bill that it is  aimed at encouraging Canadians of all ages, of both sexes and of all cultural origins to feel  a part of the sporting community.  Clearly  the bill encourages that participation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I talked earlier of the lessons learned. It seems to me that in a team atmosphere with individuals from all sorts of cultural backgrounds and countries of origin working together at a common goal can  foster the essential human spirit of betterment that we all seek. Turning our efforts toward the greater purpose is a very healthy reminder.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have always found that sport is a perfect vehicle to do that.  It is a perfect scenario through which young people can learn the very basic values that will help them throughout their life, such as tolerance, inclusion, co-operation and understanding.  Young people will also learn how to deal with disappointment and with  success and modesty.  Parents want to instill in their children all of these lessons in life and they can be   fostered  in a sporting atmosphere.  Let us not forget competition, for competition is one way to  bring out our best.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should turn our efforts toward the sport infrastructure itself as a part of the bill. That brings it back to the resources. It brings it back to the actual dollars that are needed to ensure that the infrastructure is there, such as the ballparks and the hockey arenas. We have to give young people in particular the ability to participate and to have the basic necessary equipment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that in Sherbrooke there was a wonderful venture undertaken by that community to build what they call the Rec-Plex, an outdoor sporting ice surface. The NHL Players' Association was instrumental in ensuring that the project was completed. Al MacInnis, a resident of Port Hood and current NHL hockey superstar, contributed greatly--</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. member:</b> Hardest shot guy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Peter MacKay:</b> With the hardest shot in the league, as I am reminded.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He contributed greatly to his community of Port Hood to build a new rink. There certainly  is support out there in the general sporting community. Many athletes, reflecting  on their lives and their joys in life, want to give something back to the sport.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is  this natural human cycle of those who benefit from sport wanting to give back to the sport. We see it daily played out in fields and parks across the country where coaches who love their sport want to give something back to the game.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. member:</b>  Like politics.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Peter MacKay:</b> It can be like politics.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Families should also be a big part of the equation in encouraging their children to participate in physical activity.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was very taken with quite recent suggestions  about tax incentives. I know that is not part of this legislation, but giving Canadians an opportunity to in essence  defer the cost of enrolment in a minor hockey program, for example, or to write off some of the expenses associated with figure skating lessons or the cost of equipment in some instances, to have that perhaps included on the income tax form, would again put a built in incentive in place for encouraging a healthy lifestyle, which is very much the spirit of this legislation. It would provide immediate and long term health benefits, and in the short term it is fair to say that physically active lifestyles do help children develop some of the very essential tools they will need as they proceed through life.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mention of childhood obesity was part of the discussion here today. The figures are somewhat disturbing when one looks at 30% of Canadian children  being categorized as  overweight and 13% of Canadians overall, a total of three million, who lack the physical activity to be considered in that range of healthy living. That, to me, sets the goal. It indicates that there is more work to be done. This legislation will hopefully put Canada on the right track and  put us in the direction we should be headed. A healthy lifestyle in the long run will save the Canadian health care system millions and millions in terms of financial costs alone. Jobs, equipment manufacturing and community pride are other intangible benefits when we look at the long term. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a tremendously positive initiative, one that I, on behalf of the Progressive Conservative Party, am proud to have played a small part in. I think that on so many levels this legislation builds on a spirit of co-operation. The teamwork displayed at the committee level  is consistent with the aims and goals of the bill, which reflects linguistic duality, is inclusive in all terms for all Canadians and should hopefully increase participation in activity throughout Canada. I would end on a note of congratulating the minister for his stewardship in bringing the bill before us today.</p>

	Mr. Speaker,  both are good hockey towns, with Halifax having one of the best attendance records for junior hockey in the country. With our own Maple Leafs, St. John's  has always been a very good hockey town.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, my question for my colleague relates to comments he made as he was closing his remarks. It has always been my firm belief that we have two choices in relation to social investment in the country. We can invest in our youth in sports and education, which will give us a fit, educated, contributing society, or we can neglect to do so, which we have done for several years, and have to pay on the far end with horrendous health and social costs. I would like the member to comment on that to see if he agrees with my statement.</p>


	<A NAME="Int-289250"></A><a HREF="#Int-289252"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-289248"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Peter MacKay: </b>

	Mr. Speaker, there is no question that the hon. member makes a very important and succinct point. The investment early on in a child's life, just as the investment in a business or in any sort of health care scenario, will pay huge benefits later on, whereas the neglect can play out over many years.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The particular point  I believe he is driving at is the need for that upfront investment. Surely we have  seen over the past number of years the costs associated with starving the provinces, for example, in terms  of transfers and the investment in social health care. That has come to fruition now in the country and is causing angst everywhere one goes.  If we visit hospitals or clinics we see that health care has been neglected and now we are paying a cost for it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the legislation hopefully will do is ensure that there is going to be a focused attempt to get the resources into the sporting community and, indirectly, I would suggest, into the health care system by prevention through greater participation. He is right. It is about the short term pain, one might say, because of the investment and taking from other areas to that ensure we have the money in this particular area versus the costs that we will pay later on.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that  perhaps nothing helps more  to make a country feel not only healthy but unified, proud and patriotic than having a very active lifestyle, successful teams and certainly a community that feels good about itself in terms of its own health and social well-being.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, this bill  we will pass today is really a testimony to the political leadership and political character on the Hill.  I think that the House, the voters and the people of Canada should know that the genesis of this exercise in taking the amateur sport file out of mothballs and creating a forum for discussion and debate started four and a half years ago, Mr. Speaker, when you were the government whip.  You approached me and a number of others and said “let's do something with this file”.  I think that the country owes you a lot for initiating that political leadership on this file.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to acknowledge the former vice-chair of our committee,  the former minister of sport for Canada, whose passion, energy and persistence  going across the country and re-igniting energy into this file will always be remembered, followed by our new secretary of state from Penetang, Ontario, who comes from a sport community that is broadly known across the country, and of course all the members from all parties.  We all came together on this file. We stand here today after 40 years with a new piece of sport legislation.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to come at it from a different point of view today.  We all support the legislation.  There is no debate about that today.  We have all listened over the last three years to the challenges that exist in this country around sport.  When I think back to some of the witnesses who came in front of our committee, men and women who have devoted their lives to sport,  I experienced men and women who did not treat this like a job. For them it was like a vocation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of our members said earlier that there are 1,800,000 volunteers in Canada  who give their time and their energy toward amateur sport. The fact is that there are almost 1,000 high schools in Canada today where the principals have a difficult time  finding teachers who want to coach the school rep team. In our day in high school, the teachers were begging to coach either the school football team or the school volleyball team or whatever it  was. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How did it happen that this sport file, which is so important to the value system of our country, and after the great work of Iona Campagnolo, first minister of sport,  drifted not just to the back burner  but went right off the radar screen?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to say to the House today that all of us were asleep at the switch when it came to sport. From 1990 up until a year ago, every year the fiscal knife just cut and cut at   the amateur sport fabric, at the physical activity budgets of the Government of Canada.</p>


	<A NAME="T1320"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1320"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1325"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1315"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1320)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a number of years until a year and a half ago some of our best high performance athletes   lived in virtual poverty while they were on the world stage performing for our country. Let us imagine that. Olympic medal winners were trying to live on $700 to $800 a month while representing our country on the world stage.  Where were we?  We were asleep at the switch when it came to this file.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we started this journey four and a half years ago some of my friends asked why I was wasting my time on the amateur sport file. They asked if tax reform and the environment were not more important. I was absolutely shocked at the number of educated people in our country, even in and around Ottawa, with no connection to or understanding of the value of sport economically,  socially and in terms of its linkage to health care.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After today the biggest challenge will be in front of us. Passing the bill is great. We are all together on the issue. However  the bill will not be worth a damn unless the resources are there to make sure its full meaning is exercised.  I will talk about this in the context of political leadership. Recommendation 17 of our sport report said: </p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>The Finance Department will create a non-refundable child sport tax credit to encourage parents to register their children in local sport and recreation programs and help alleviate the cost of sport equipment.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The yearly cost would be $64.3 million, or $321 million over five years. I pleaded with the finance department to  think of the million children in the country living below the poverty line whose mothers and fathers cannot afford to give them a sport experience.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of our members talked earlier about how proud we all felt when our Olympians came into the House at the end of February or the first part of March.  We were all cheering and shaking their hands.  It was the longest ovation I have heard in the Chamber, and so it should be. However we are supposed to be in the Chamber to speak for those in need who do not have a voice.</p>


	<A NAME="T1325"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1325"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1330"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1320"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1325)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a million kids in Canada today, on our watch, who cannot afford to buy the shoes to play soccer. They cannot afford a hockey stick let alone a full set of equipment. If the bill  is to take full force the million children who live below the poverty line should be brought into the mainstream to get the opportunities other kids enjoy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to the hon. member from the Bloc Quebecois, yes, we costed it. Over five years it would be $300 million. That is not an expense. The best surgeons in the department of health came before us and  said  only 28% of the nation exercises  for 30 minutes a day. They said if we could increase that to 38% we would save $5 billion in the health care treasury. Why would we not spend $60 million to $100 million a year or more to save multi-billions in our health care system? If we would not do this, what are we doing here? This is where I challenge the political leadership in the House.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the special features of the bill is that it would make physical activity part of the mandate of the minister responsible for sport. I hope the Privy Council Office is listening. Anyone with half a brain should realize that the piece of government machinery that looks after physical activity should be under the direction of the minister responsible for sport. Let us imagine a minister who must go to three different places to run his or her department. As members have mentioned today, another recommendation of our report was that all sport responsibilities be combined.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have moved the file a long way in the last four and a half years. However the real test of our political will is about to begin. We have listened intently to men and women who have made sport their vocation in life. We have accepted virtually all their recommendations. It has been a unanimous experience. All of us in parliament have come together. We are now at the phase where we must perform and execute. As I said before, a minister can only execute if he has the financial resources to do the job.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another facet of sport. Many members today have talked about the job creation numbers involved in sport, whether from sport manufacturing, sport tourism, sport media or the whole industry of professional sport.  While we know all about this  we do not appreciate the way sport pulls us together as a country. Sport promotes  national unity.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the Salt Lake City games the Olympians had a tremendous galvanizing effect in pulling us together from every region of the country.  Such an experience does not have to be at the Olympic level.  My first experience at a national event, and the Speaker has had a similar experience, was where we  watched our sons participate in a Quebec peewee tournament.  Kids were living and playing with each other from every part of the country and  the world.  Sport pulls people together and melts away divisions. To allow the Department of Finance to take the fiscal knife to the sport file is to be asleep at the switch.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we head into the fall season and prepare for a new budget the fiscal trajectory of the country has never been better. It is the duty of all of us   in the House of Commons to make our voices heard. We must make it known that we want to rebuild and re-establish every facet of the sport file including physical activity,  support for our high performance athletes, sport infrastructure, and making sure the volunteer system in our country is properly acknowledged and rewarded.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What if we had to pay for all the hours of the 1,800,000 volunteers a year who give of their time?  Who could afford it? We are lucky to have that kind of commitment in a country like ours.  When we prepare for the budget we should keep in mind one of our special recommendations, number 18, which would give a $1,000 sport credit to every volunteer in the country who puts in a certain number of hours certified by the local organization.  Not only is that a way to acknowledge their work. It is a way to maintain and reinvigorate a volunteer community which has been threatened in the last few years, as we know.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy we have come to the end of phase one of the first sport bill in 40 years.  It is well drafted.  The minister and his officials must be saluted.  However I would issue a challenge to every member in the House: Let us never again allow the fiscal knife to be so ruthless on the sport file. Let us start campaigning vigorously that in the new budget sport will again become a special feature of our country.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member hit the nail on the head. I will be straight up front with everyone in the Chamber today. I said earlier that  this is about political leadership.  The political leadership in the House comes from many different places.  There are ministers responsible for certain facets of this file.  The opposition has political leadership on this file.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between now and February 2003 our particular party will be going through a total policy renewal.  I intend to never let a day pass where I test all the leadership in the party as to where it stands on the whole file of amateur sport because I do not think anyone can be a leader in this country unless  that individual is passionately committed to this file.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, it is interesting to hear the member talk about the renewal going on in the Liberal Party.  I was wondering if perhaps that might include leadership renewal.  I am not sure about that. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a new finance minister, but in times past he dealt with the previous finance minister.  He knows him fairly well and perhaps supports him in certain ways.  Does he have the support of those finance ministers?   He has been  vocal about it, straight up and straightforward.  Does he think past and current finance ministers are on his wavelength or is it a battle that must be won within the caucus?</p>

	Mr. Speaker, this is where it gets interesting.  As a government we have been obsessed with the fiscal framework over the last few years.  It is no secret to anyone in the House that it has been too far obsessed for my liking but we have a moment now where there is no excuse for us to deal with this file in a financial way.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The previous minister of finance obviously did not share my view or my passion on this file.  That is too bad but that is the way it goes around here sometimes.  The current Minister of Finance has a few months left.  There will be a number of us on this side and that side who will be watching him closely on this file. Members should make no mistake.  Any person who purports to be a political leader in the House who ignores the amateur sport file will not have a long run.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I was not referring to a cabinet shuffle.  I was referring to the fact that we only have a few months left before the budget is locked in place.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am counting on the Canadian Alliance because it has been part of the problem on amateur sport over the last seven years because it has been driving this fiscal knife so deep at times that it does not even know some of the files that it has affected.  I am counting on him to be vocal in question period and other places to ensure that amateur sport is re-established as a priority.</p>


	<A NAME="Int-289270"></A><a HREF="#Int-289272"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-289268"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Chuck Strahl: </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for that clarification.  No one doubts his passion for this subject.  He has been on record through thick and thin.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However he should not mistake the demand made by the Canadian Alliance for fiscal accountability as  a lack of support for amateur sport and physical fitness.  It is like many other things in this place.  It is only when we have our financial house in order that these things become possible at a government level.  In fact, government's ever growing voracious appetite for tax dollars should be restricted to leave more money in the hands of the parents who are trying to raise kids and buy the gloves for them to play ball with and so on.  A lot of that becomes possible only when governments restrict their demand for tax dollars.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not a matter of  saying that we will develop a program that buys shin pads for every kid in Canada.  It will often come down to a case of saying that we will balance the budget in this place, but we will allow parents and families, the primary caregivers and local communities, to have the funds required to make this possible.  If there are infrastructures, programs and a co-ordination that the minister can bring to this effort that will be appreciated and that leadership must come from this House and others.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the member should not mistake fiscal responsibility for not caring about sports.  Like anything else, if we cannot pay the piper we will not have much of a tune.</p>

Robert Nault (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
	 </b>

	moved that Bill C-60, an act to establish the Canadian Centre for the Independent Resolution of First Nations Specific Claims to provide for the filing, negotiation and resolution of specific claims and to make related amendments to other acts, be read the second time and referred to a committee.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said: Mr. Speaker, I am  pleased to rise  in the House to speak about a bill respecting the specific claims resolution act. Its purpose is to establish an independent claims resolution centre to improve our ability to resolve specific claims of first nations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are proposing a centre with two components: a commission to facilitate negotiations on specific claims by first nations, and a tribunal to resolve disputes involving those claims. This is a key step among the legislative initiatives we are taking to clear the way for first nations to play a more comprehensive part in the life of this country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principle of the new system is  simple. Both the Government of Canada and first nations  would rather negotiate than litigate. By having in place this independent claims resolution centre we would speed up settlements and reduce the cost of reaching agreements. We would be able to resolve quickly a number of historic grievances, and by settling these claims, first nations and neighbouring communities could proceed with confidence in a climate of stability.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our government is fulfilling a pledge. As members will recall, in the Liberal Party of Canada's original red book and in the subsequent 1997 Liberal plan  “Securing our Future”, we recognized that delays in resolving land claims were a fundamental barrier to allowing many aboriginal people and their communities to achieve their full potential. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We pledge to have in place a claims body to render binding decisions on the acceptance or rejection of land claims for negotiation and to consult with aboriginal organizations on whether the body should facilitate, arbitrate or mediate disputes that may arise between Canada and the first nations in the negotiation process. The specific claims resolution act would legislate a system to accomplish those precise red book goals.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this proposed act we would help to fulfill the vision of Canada's aboriginal action plan that we put in place in response to the report of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples. That vision would see increasing quality of life for aboriginal people and the promotion of self-sufficiency through partnership, revenue generation, responsiveness to communities and values, and a place for aboriginal people and other Canadians. By resolving claims through this new system we would realize this vision and pave the way for greater economic development of first nation communities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The benefits for aboriginal and non-aboriginal communities alike should be obvious to all members of the House. Experience shows that partnerships between first nations, the private sector, corporations, governments and communities benefit the economic health and prosperity of the entire country. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last 10 years the number of aboriginal business start-ups has exceeded those of the rest of the Canadian population by 105%, however these businesses require access to investment and loan capital if they are to grow and prosper. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the removal of roadblocks to land claims resolutions, the climate for investment can only improve with expanded partnerships and joint ventures with non-aboriginal businesses in the private sector. The results are new markets across our nation and globally with consequent expanded employment opportunities across the board.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resources now used in settling claims in the current adversarial system can be saved and better applied to this economic development for the good of all. This is truly win-win for aboriginal and non-aboriginal sectors working together, and it benefits all Canadians. In many ways, Canada's specific claims policy, which our new independent claims body would improve, has had a significant measure of success.</p>


	<A NAME="T1350"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1350"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1355"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1345"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1350)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since it was adopted in 1973 first nations in Canada have ratified 232 agreements in every region of the country worth $1.2 billion in total.   These agreements will add over 16,000 square kilometres to the reserve land base of first nations. Recently more than double that number of claims has been added to the inventory of unsettled claims and the backlog is growing. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current system in place cannot move with the speed and independence that both my government and first nations need to see.  We must do better. We must settle the backlog of outstanding claims and have in place a new system that will support the resolution of new claims.  We must establish a process that is more independent, impartial and transparent.  This is about fairness. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First nations believe the existing process lacks fairness and transparency in the areas of research and assessment, that it does not provide a level playing field for negotiations and that it lacks independence, impartiality and accountability.  Their lack of confidence in the fairness of the process means first nations are reluctant to accept negative decisions about the validity of claims.  Costly court actions causing further delays are the result of that.  Every dollar wasted in court is a dollar less for investment in economic development,  governance and bread and butter issues.  In this atmosphere enhanced partnerships and economic development can hardly be expected to flourish.  That is the reason  we are speaking here today and moving on this initiative.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the proposed act, the commission and tribunal would be established as  neutral arm's length claim facilitation and adjudication bodies in law.  Transparency would be enhanced.  Funding of first nations to participate in the specific claims process would be managed by the commission, eliminating the current perception of conflict of interest.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing process would be simplified.  An effective alternative to litigating specific claims in the courts would be provided through negotiated settlements through the commission and authority of the tribunal to render binding decisions as a  last resort.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hand in hand with fairness goes accountability.  We as a government are accountable to first nations and other Canadians to ensure we have in place a land claims settlement system that is fair, transparent and efficient.  The specific claims resolution act contains extensive accountability provisions to help achieve those ends.  These include annual audits by the auditor general; annual reports tabled in parliament and made available to first nations and the public for scrutiny; quarterly reports on compensation; and a requirement for a full review between three and five years of its coming into effect.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have built this legislation through partnership with first nations.  In 1996 the federal government and the Assembly of First Nations established the Joint First Nations-Canada Task Force on specific claims.  This event marked the beginning of consultations on the creation of an independent claims body.  In 1998 the joint task force called for a two stage body consisting of a facilitative commission and an adjudicative tribunal in its set of recommendations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One key feature of this proposal that has been particularly well received is the emphasis on dispute resolution processes to make negotiations work better.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the act the new commission's fundamental role would  be to facilitate the resolution of negotiated settlements with authority to apply a full range of alternate dispute resolution processes: facilitation, mediation and non-binding arbitration. Even binding arbitration will be available with the consent of the parties.  All claims regardless of size, complexity or value would have access to these processes through the commission.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On June 21 we will mark National Aboriginal Day, an occasion for all Canadians to celebrate the rich contribution aboriginal people have made to Canada. There will be colourful events across our country when young and old alike from all communities and the Canadian family join together for these celebrations.   We need to  celebrate the participation of first nations in our lives for more than just one day.  In order for that to occur we need this act to resolve land claims quickly, fairly and efficiently to resolve historic grievances, to remove economic development roadblocks and to promote self-sufficiency of aboriginal people and a new climate of partnership.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the current rate we are resolving claims,  if we were to leave the system in place, we would be leaving  it to our children to deal with the grievances of the past.  With this new body and the role it would play, it is hoped that we would resolve grievances of the past  quickly and move on with building a future.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that all members would agree with me that this is the right step to take.  I look forward to their support in this new act that I am presenting today to the House.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, the Liberal government cannot be trusted.  Its incompetence and corruption is causing collateral damage. The publisher of the Ottawa <i>Citizen</i> is only the most recent casualty.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be too risky for the  CanWest empire's Southam newspapers to run articles critical of the Prime Minister because the empire's television licences might be threatened. Suspension of freedom of the press in Canada has turned into journalistic persecution.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberal government is feared in many circles because it is known to be reckless enough to waste millions if not billions of taxpayer dollars on lost reports, use untraceable verbal contracts, cause auditors to find empty files and use Liberal Party contributions as tickets to untendered government contracts.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The iron fist of the Prime Minister, desperate to keep his job, could come down on anyone, any time, anyplace, in his attempts to fend off corruption charges. How else can we explain a Canadian university honouring the Ottawa <i>Citizen</i> publisher one day for his contribution to journalism and the next day seeing him fired for criticizing the shah of Shawinigan.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, recently Yvette Spence and Peggy Pendergast, two retired Manitoba school teachers, came to me on a matter on behalf of their colleagues.  They brought to my attention an issue that needs redressing. Many retired teachers in the province of Manitoba have not been permitted to buy back their maternity leave.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This benefit has been given to active teachers but retired teachers have not been accorded the same rights.  This has resulted in them losing out on many potential years of pensionable service. For many Manitoban teachers it is of considerable value to buy back this benefit from the teacher's retirement allowance fund.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changes needed to be made.   I am pleased  the federal government has made them and taken the lead in this matter.  However the government of Manitoba has not been so quick to respond.  Retired teachers who took maternity leave are still not able to buy back these years of service because of the inaction on the part of the provincial government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is time for fairness.  It is important to urge the province of Manitoba to change this discriminatory practice and permit these women, retired teachers, the fairness and benefit that they and their families deserve.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, on June 12, 1942, in London, the Soviet Union's ambassador to the U.K. and Canada's high commissioner to Great Britain ratified the agreement confirming the official establishment of diplomatic relations between the U.S.S.R. and Canada. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For 60 years the relations between Canada and Russia reflected the general evolution of  global diplomatic relations: sometimes warm and friendly, sometimes strained. Therefore, we can define the principal stages of these relations as a close alliance during the second world war, carefulness during the cold war, and the optimism of the present.</p>

Unfortunately, the national library is now in a state of crisis.  Its collections are being destroyed, public access curtailed and Canada's written heritage and culture are at risk of being lost forever.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latest case involves a 1996 contract with Groupaction.  It received  $330,000 to publicize the gun registry, a job that nobody asked for and that nobody  can find. The government could have done something six years ago  but it did not.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have raised enough kids to know that if we have a problem, dealing with it quickly and decisively is the best way to go. The Liberal government has   yet to learn  this basic life lesson. It is clear to me it never will.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, the government has considerable potential control over the media when it comes to regulations that affect its bottom line or, as we have seen in recent weeks, lucrative advertising contracts.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday the Deputy Prime Minister dodged questions when asked about the Prime Minister's contact with one of Canada's leading media families. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent weeks did the Prime Minister or any member of his staff ever meet with the Asper family and, if so, did they discuss the Ottawa <i>Citizen's</i> editorial policy or anything that could have led to the firing of its publisher?</p>

	Mr. Speaker, the Deputy Prime Minister did not actually answer the question.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However,  through the CRTC, the government has considerable leverage over the nation's media companies. The cabinet can have final approval over all CRTC decisions involving millions of dollars.  Canadians need to know whether  the government has been abusing this leverage.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, there is evidence. It was the Milewski affair and the government silenced the CBC report.  The government has abused its power.  It has abused it in advertising and sponsorship contracts. The Prime Minister abused it in the BDC loan affair.   </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we have the case of a publisher, employed by a family that has deep ties to the Liberal Party, being fired after he approved editorials calling for the Prime Minister's resignation.</p>

There is a thorough departmental review being conducted by my department. The auditor general has indicated the scope of the work she will undertake.

By parroting the  Gray line, he seems oblivious to the fact that these contracting scandals are his government's fault. The government had the ability to call a public inquiry, or the police or the auditor general two years ago after an internal audit flagged these problems. Ethical misconduct and mismanagement of the public purse could have been reined in then, saving taxpayers millions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did he, the Prime Minister, his predecessor or his predecessor's predecessor not do something two years ago to at least act on these problems rather than try to cover them up and wait until they got caught?</p>

	Mr. Speaker, they certainly were not covered up. The summary of the internal audit was posted on the Internet. There were issues related to that which were published in the newspaper. An action plan to correct the deficiencies identified in the audit was prepared in the latter part of the year 2000, the beginning of 2001 and through 2001.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those corrective measures were in fact implemented. We went back  in the spring of this year to confirm the degree of progress that had been made. Beyond that there are a whole series of other inquiries being undertaken to ensure that we get to the bottom of this.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, the government has done absolutely nothing to offset the devastating effects of the U.S. farm subsidies. Even worse is the government's inability to deal with the devastating effects of the country of origin labelling contained in the U.S. farm bill. Country of origin labelling applies to all agricultural products, including beef and pork. Already Canadian livestock producers are losing  American markets.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the government doing to achieve a Canadian exemption to the U.S. country of origin labelling? Failing that, what is the government's contingency plan when we can no longer access American markets for our beef and cattle?</p>

	Mr. Speaker, another day and another report condemning the government for its inability to govern effectively. The military ombudsman reported today that the policies of the government are driving personnel out and away from the Canadian forces despite the millions given to Liberal friendly advertising agencies for advertising on recruiting.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When will the minister begin to clean up his department, starting with putting the needs of the military ahead of the needs of the Prime Minister and his Liberal buddies?</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I am absolutely delighted to rise today to speak on the third reading of Bill C-48. This is a piece of legislation that went to committee, was amended at report stage and received unanimous support from all parties of the House.  We are delighted to be here today at third reading. It also shows, as my dear colleague, the vice-chair, the hon. member for Toronto--Danforth, has always said, that we as parliamentarians  need to have impact on public policy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very quickly I want to tell the House why some amendments were made, why they were the right amendments and why we are pleased to have them supported today by both the Minister of Canadian Heritage and the Minister of Industry.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 31 of the Copyright Act is what Bill C-48 deals with. This is about a compulsory retransmission licence. Some people might wonder what that means and why it is important. It addresses whether or not Internet transmitters should be allowed to retransmit and rebroadcast over the air radio and television signals without properly compensating the rights holders. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legislation that was proposed was originally enabling legislation which would lead  the determination of whether there should be an exemption or whether the Internet provider should have a compulsory licence exemption as well. We as a committee decided that it was very important to put a new media exemption in the legislation. We agreed to that for many reasons. We think it is the right thing to do. It brings into  balance all the rights holders and  the broadcasters. It addresses those rights. It addresses concerns of the Americans. We feel that the committee as a whole has made good public policy by currently putting this media exemption into the act.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, let me say that both ministers also advised the committee that they would ask the CRTC to reconsider its 1999 new media exemption. The CRTC will continue to do that and will  report back to the committee, at which time both ministers have agreed that should   draft regulations and conditions be brought forward so that if Internet retransmitters such as Jump TV, or iCraveTV in the United States, want to qualify, we would be able to do so.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this legislation today, I think we have shown how all  the members of a committee  can work together for the benefit of good public policy. I want to thank the chair, the vice-chair and all the members of the committee for their hard work. I want to thank the Minister of Industry and the Minister of Canadian Heritage for their support and for listening to the committee. I know that we will continue to work together as regulations go and as the CRTC reviews its exemption order. Should we one day find that we do allow Internet retransmitters to have the benefit of a licence, I look forward to doing  so, but after we as a government have looked at those regulations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again I am delighted to be able thank all members of the committee for their great work. We look forward to passing the legislation immediately.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, this is one of those rare occasions in   parliament when there is agreement among parties.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The committee worked diligently.  We listened to a tremendous number of witnesses on the issue.  We listened to the rights holders, JumpTV, Internet providers and to the broadcasters.  We had full input.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the process of the committee work we all came to one mind.  As a consequence, I was privileged   to put forward the amendments that basically changed it from enabling legislation to legislation that had a specific purpose.  I was gratified to have the support of all members of the committee for those amendments.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It shows that when there is a common interest and when there is goodwill we as parliamentarians can work together.  This is not a partisan issue.  It is an issue of copyright.  It is a good public policy issue.  It is an issue of our place in the international community.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also would like to thank all the people who were involved, all the committee members,  and the officials, who did put up a good fight for a  perspective different from what we had, but at the end of the day I agree with the parliamentary secretary and with the member for Toronto--Danforth.    He and I were absolutely simpatico. It is up to the politicians to make public policy. It is not up to the bureaucrats to make public policy.  That is exactly what we did in the committee. If we are standing here patting ourselves on the back, we will have to find a good chiropractor.  We did a good job.  This is good public policy.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I would like to give some more context to Bill C-48, for those who are following and who want to understand the issue.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bill that we are debating at third reading would establish supplementary regulatory powers so that new distribution systems, specifically the Internet, could retransmit programs if they respect the conditions and provisions of the Copyright Act.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill would also allow distribution systems that are already in place, such as satellite and cable companies, to continue  to retransmit radio or television programs by paying royalties set by the Copyright Board and by respecting the conditions set out in the Copyright Act.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are retransmitters  subject to the Copyright Act? This was the question the committee worked very hard on.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, allow me to say that the Bloc Quebecois supports the principle of this bill, knows as Bill C-48. We heard from a number of witnesses in committee who were very concerned about the current legal  vacuum, which leaves the door wide open to various different uses of works, authors and artists, without royalties being paid to those who own the rights.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This situation, as it exists today, creates opportunities to abuse the work of artists. In Quebec and in other provinces, there have been protracted battles to protect the works of artists.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Previously, rights were purchased through negotiations between the parties. This situation was in effect until the arrival of iCrave TV, in December 1999, which began broadcasting programs on the Internet. This company gave Internet users direct access to nine Canadian television signals and eight American television signals.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These signals were captured in the Toronto area, converted to an Internet compatible format, then put on the Internet, where they were made available outside of Canada, including in the US.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This situation  called into question the various agreements signed by Canada, including the Berne convention and NAFTA. It did not take long for opponents to speak up.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alleging violation of copyright, numerous groups representing a variety of stakeholders, including the Canadian Association of Broadcasters, Disney Enterprises, Paramount Pictures, Time Warner and Universal Studios sued iCrave TV, or threatened to do so. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In February 2000, a U.S. court granted an interim injunction against iCrave TV, prohibiting it from sending signals to the United States. Unfortunately, no Canadian court has had an opportunity to rule on the matter because, in late February, the company gave in to legal pressure and ceased its activities. In return, all  charges against it were dropped. It even withdrew its application to the Canadian Copyright Board for a interim retransmission tariff. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, a Montreal company, Jump TV, tried to launch a similar service but, unlike its predecessor, it obtained all the necessary legal approvals.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did it give up on its plans? Since its applications could not be approved as is, it hoped to pay the same obligatory licence fees as pay-per-view TV, i.e. pay them after broadcasting only, pay a lower percentage for copyright, not be subject to Canadian content, and not contribute to the Canadian Television Fund.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was in this context that the company dropped its plans as presented in late 2001. It withdrew its application to the copyright board because it had understood that its business plan would not pass muster and that it could therefore not meet all the conditions required of other broadcasting copyright holders.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apparently, these two cases woke the government up to the fact that it was becoming necessary to provide a framework for this kind of activity.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basic purpose of the bill is to prevent a potential Internet retransmitter from being able to broadcast programs outside Canada or, if it is broadcasting within Canada, to make it subject to the same rules as broadcasters or cable companies.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must remember that a large share of the revenues generated by the producers of broadcasts comes from the resale of broadcasting rights abroad. The threat of the Internet is therefore real and could have a considerable negative impact, not just on authors, but also on partners of the distribution network.</p>


	<A NAME="T1510"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1510"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1515"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1505"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1510)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Canada, the CRTC excluded the Internet highway from its jurisdiction in 1999, so that only the Copyright Board can set royalties.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the law were not amended, authors or their representatives would have to engage in legal battles to get back their share of royalties.  The only ones who would get rich on this would be the lawyers and the law firms, not the authors.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the regime that applied had been compulsory licensing, what would the consequences have been for stakeholders?  Bill C-48 set out a compulsory licensing system for retransmitters. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That said, section  31 did not include any definition.  Instead,  the conditions set out in the regulations would have been what  established certain mechanisms for this compulsory licensing, which I could explain as follows: the communication was to consist in retransmission of a local or distant signal, which allowed Canadian broadcasters to charge a worthwhile rate for  commercial rights to their programs, one that was beneficial for both themselves and the authors. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was also the fact that retransmission had to be legal under the Broadcasting Act, for if it were excluded from the provisions adopted by the CRTC, how could they be asked to participate in the broadcasting system, if none of the regulations applied?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The signal was to be retransmitted simultaneously and in its entirety.  If it is not, transmitters could, for example, end up with a broadcast sponsored by Yoplait yoghurt, that is suddenly replaced by messages from Danone.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of retransmission of  a distant signal—</p>

	Mr. Speaker, in the case of the retransmission of a distant signal, the retransmitter must first have paid any royalties and complied with any terms and conditions fixed under the bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike a mandatory licence, the definition of licence refers to the authorization given to the licensee to broadcast a product that is subject to an exclusive copyright. This is a major difference.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exclusion applies to all licence holders. In light of what we have just seen, the compulsory licence regime is already an exceptional system. This is why those who represent authors, performers and beneficiaries were opposed to the creation of a new exception that would not have given them fair and equitable rights for the use of their works.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For over a year, officials from Canadian Heritage and Industry Canada co-operated with partners, authors, representatives of  the authors  and their beneficiaries to find a way to meet the stated expectations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, it was decided to include amendments in the act and not in the regulations, so that beneficiaries are better protected. This was done through the amendments presented by the Canadian Alliance critic on heritage. Clause 31 was amended by adding the exclusion  in the act. A definition of the term retransmitter was added, so that the context would be clear.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the regulations have yet to be drafted and approved, we felt that it was more important to require the retransmitter, as defined in the bill, to comply with certain obligations or conditions, and to determine  whether or not they apply to all, or just to a specific category. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why include the wording in the act and not in the regulations? Because in the act it is very clear and it will be more difficult to change this, should the need arise.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was impossible for us to create a system different from those that exist elsewhere without adversely affecting the authors and other partners in the broadcasting system, which is subject to highly regulated terms and conditions.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the international level, the information provided by officials from both Canadian Heritage  and Industry Canada shows that no other jurisdiction expressly authorizes the retransmission on the Internet under the terms and conditions of a compulsory licence.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in the United States, some have said that Internet services could take advantage of the benefits provided by the compulsory retransmission licence in that country. This view was challenged by Marybeth Peters, the U.S. copyright registrar. The U.S. Copyright Office is opposed to expanding compulsory licences to include retransmissions on the Internet. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would appear as though Australia is the only jurisdiction to have resolved this specific issue through legislation. The Copyright Amendment (Digital Agenda) Bill 2000 recently introduced a new compulsory retransmission licence which specifically excludes the Internet. This is what Australia has done.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to information on the legislation put out by the Australian government, the exclusion stems from concerns that Internet retransmissions would have a negative impact on the current conditions for granting programming licenses.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both of the departments involved, Canadian Heritage  and Industry Canada, have also noted that, with the exception of the United States, they are not aware of any other jurisdiction in which specific territorial restrictions were imposed on compulsory retransmission licences.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the United States, the compulsory licence for satellite retransmission applies only to secondary retransmissions to households on American soil.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, and this is self-evident, the new copyright legislation must be adapted to the reality of new technologies. Second, I would like to point out how vital it is for us to legislate to protect outside markets for those who hold the rights. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed,  program producers' revenues are based on the logic of geographical markets. Reselling becomes impossible in a local market, which means that in Quebec, protecting works is synonymous with  protecting its  francophone content and culture.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, we must strike a balance between protecting artistic creations and encouraging the development of a new type of economic activity. Internet  broadcasting requires that the legislation be clarified.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Internet technologies make it possible to increase the effectiveness of companies and provide new value-added services for consumers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The development of these technologies and services must be encouraged, but within a strict framework. This is what we sought in committee, through the amendment put forward by the Canadian Alliance member.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill introduced today was amended in the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage after we had heard from a number of witnesses who came to tell us how important they thought this bill was and the crux of what they were seeking.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the witnesses, with the exception of two, Jump TV and the Association of Internet Broadcasters, were in favour of exclusion.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These witnesses were mainly representatives of creators, and the Media Content Coalition, including the following associations: the Canadian Association of Broadcasters; the Canadian Broadcasters Rights Agency; the Canadian film and Television Producers Association; the Copyright Association of Canada; representatives of creators in Quebec, i.e. SOCAN, the Society of Composers, Authors and Music Publishers of Canada, and SACD, the Société des auteurs compositeurs dramatiques.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These stakeholders appeared before us to tell us that the goal pursued was important and that copyright must be preserved so that authors could be sure of being paid for the use of their works.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goal of the amendments put forward in the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage was clarity. With that in mind, the unanimous decision was to amend section 31 of the Copyright Act by including exclusion.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously,  those who drafted section 31 of the Copyright Act ten years ago could not have imagined the emergence, the scope and the impact of the Internet.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Internet must take copyright into consideration, and authors must be able to get a fair price for their rights based on the market. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;William Craig, President of iCrave TV, tried to prove to the U.S. courts that his service could be limited to Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But all the security measures he claimed to rely on were rapidly demolished by electronics experts, since hacking can easily make on-line Internet content accessible to the whole world.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No standard of reasonable security or restriction is enough. Security must be total or the content runs a serious risk of being transmitted worldwide.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These comments, and the objectives which they reflect, underscore the fact that the Internet will never be secure enough, regardless of the security measures, or firewalls, on which we now rely.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Putting in place security measures to try to restrict access to the Internet does not take into account the fact that the Internet is an open network that must be considered accessible to the public at large.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No tariff set by the Copyright Board will ever adequately compensate copyright holders.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the board might not factor into such a tariff damages to the value of Internet rights.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compensation through tariffs established by the board will never compensate copyright holders and will not allow them to realize the full value of their rights. Therefore, it would jeopardize the whole value chain from the creator to the licence holder and the distributor.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we support the principle of the bill, we see the need to stress the fact that Internet retransmitters should have the same obligations as traditional ones.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually, it would be unfair to create competition for cable companies while freeing them from the duties imposed on traditional retransmitters, namely: negotiating the purchase of copyrights; contributing to the Canadian Television Fund; abiding by the Canadian content rules; holding a licence under the Broadcasting Act. I should also remind members that the industry asked that section 31 of the Copyright Act be amended.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a matter of fact, the Canadian Association of Broadcasters, the Canadian Film and Television Production Association and the Canadian Motion Picture Distributors Association have formed the Media Content Coalition to oversee the use of Canadian television industry by Internet broadcasters. The coalition welcomed the bill.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I  would like to say that there was a consensus on the amendments put forward by the Canadian Alliance, after thoughtful reflection and consultations, because they were the best response to the concerns expressed by the industry.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Quebecois hopes that the stakeholders will find the clarity they wanted and that artists and creators will, by the same token, get fair compensation for the distribution of their work. I ask my colleagues in the House to support the bill as amended.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I will speak briefly to Bill C-48.  The NDP is in favour of the principle of the bill: Owners of copyright should be fairly compensated for their work.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-48 would be a start toward closing the loopholes in the copyright process that have been created by new technologies. It is the first in a series of copyright bills the departments of industry and heritage will be proposing to modernize our copyright laws as technology and globalization change the environment for creators of copyrighted products.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The list of issues to be tackled over the next few years is enormous. Bill C-48 is a small piece in the copyright puzzle. We must deal with: access issues; ownership of audio-visual works and photographs; database protection; digital issues; government ownership and use of copyrighted works; performers' rights; rights management in an online environment; site signal rights for broadcasters; technology enhancing learning; terms of protection; traditional knowledge and folklore; transitional periods for unpublished works; and  Internet retransmission of broadcast programs which  is what we are dealing with at present.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will be an extremely complex and time consuming process. I can assure hon. members that we will all have grey hair if we are sitting in the heritage committee after having gone through each of these areas.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. member:</b> Or no hair at all. Even worse.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms. Wendy Lill:</b> Or no hair at all.  However the process is essential if we are to protect creators' rights.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the legislation which continues to be changed and amended we must respect some of the central principles on which our   broadcasting policy, our heritage policy and the pillars of the country are based. As we move along we must make sure the legislation would continue to respect Canadian content as new technologies came onstream and became new platforms for broadcasting.  We must make sure there would be no loopholes and that the playing field would be level for all broadcasters in Canada.  This must be done to ensure all creators in the country would continue to be covered by our copyright legislation and enjoy the same rights. We must make sure their work would be valued and compensated whether it appeared on the Internet, on the radio, in the print media or wherever.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to the issue of putting money into Canadian content and such things as the Canadian broadcast fund, we must make sure environments such as the Internet or whatever follows the Internet would  not somehow be exempt from the licensing fees used to nurture Canadian content.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are important principles we in the New Democratic Party will be paying attention to as we continue to work through the copyright legislation. We will give our endorsement to Bill C-48 as a tiny step along the route of copyright protection. We will see where it goes from here.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, much has been said by the previous speakers to put into context the purpose of the legislation, namely, to amend the Copyright Act.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-48 would ensure that retransmitters who benefited from compulsory licensing regained the regime provided for in section 31 of the Copyright Act. It would ensure other retransmitters met the conditions  prescribed by regulation. It would also ensure parity and fairness throughout the regulatory regime.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were issues pertaining to  fairness. There was concern that the bill include regulations to prevent loopholes and ensure that individuals could not make use of new technologies  to rob those  who provide the service.  I am talking particularly of television stations; entities such as the NHL, CFL  and other sporting organizations;  and the movie industry.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spirit of co-operation on the committee and the amount of input  we received in a relatively short period was extraordinary.  I give kudos to the parliamentary secretary, the chair of the committee, all members of the Bloc, and a particular member who put a great deal of extraordinary effort into ensuring the proper balance was met.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in the Progressive Conservative Party support the amendments and the bill. Bill C-48 came about as a result of a great deal of co-operation and effort. Members united to do the right thing and put in place a proper regulatory regime to protect everyone and ensure all  the industry interests were met.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may echo the  sentiments of my hon. colleague from Nova Scotia, there is no doubt that we will be required to come back and re-examine  some of the issues as technology and the industry evolve.  However this is where we want to be at this point.  We in our party support the effort.  I again congratulate all fellow committee members.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to add the comments of the Canadian Alliance to the debate on Bill C-60, the specific claims resolution act. We share many of the concerns the minister spoke of earlier. I will outline some of these before the bill proceeds further.  I will also highlight our  concerns about the way  the legislation may or may not work.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I will review the basics of the bill.  The facilitation of the settlement of specific claims across the country is its stated objective, an objective the Canadian Alliance shares.  Bill C-60 would establish a centre for independent resolution of first nations specific claims.  The centre would have a commission division and a tribunal division, each with distinct functions. The commission would facilitate negotiations. The tribunal would resolve disputes.  The commission would enable the resolution of all claims regardless of value by drawing on the entire range of dispute resolution mechanisms to assist parties to specific claims in reaching final settlements.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast, the adjudicative tribunal would be available to first nations as a last recourse. It would make final binding decisions on the validity of specific claims rejected by Canada and on cash compensation for valid claims up to a maximum of $7 million.  Judging from a review of the claims on hand, the majority are below $7 million.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will share our party's position on these issues with hon. members. It is as follows: </p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>Our position in land claims negotiations will be to ensure respect for existing private property rights, affordable and conclusive settlement of all claims, and an open and transparent process involving all stakeholders.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unresolved land claims have been an issue between the aboriginal people and governments of our country for many decades.  That is too long. It is a complex issue that has been a roadblock to building economies on reserves, a roadblock to building a greater sense of shared citizenship among non-aboriginal and aboriginal Canadians,  a roadblock to individual aboriginal Canadians achieving the  goals they have for themselves and their families, and in many ways a roadblock to economic development. We are trying to tear the roadblock down.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government's intentions   are   valid.  However there has been a longstanding corporate culture in governments of Canada under various political parties to delay resolution of these claims.  Obstacles have been put in place whether bureaucratic, political or otherwise. At one time   Indian bands in Canada were not allowed to use their own resources to pursue resolution of legal claims. As a consequence there is  deep distrust between aboriginal leaders and communities and the federal government on this and other issues.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolving  these claims is in everyone's  interest.  In this year's estimates  alone the government has budgeted $122 million for grants to bands for resolution of specific claims. Let us review how this works.  The taxpayer pays taxes to the federal government. The federal government gives some of the taxes to bands in the form of grants so they can work toward the resolution of   claims.  The bands apply to get the grants. They are given the  grants. The bands then use the money to pay lawyers.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is pretty much where the money goes.  Lawyers get it. Lawyers are paid on the basis of how long they work. It is kind of like a taxi.  The longer it goes the better it is for the taxi driver. In this case the taxi driver is a lawyer. The system could be seen as a bit biased toward preserving and perpetuating cases rather than resolving them.</p>


	<A NAME="T1540"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1540"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1545"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1535"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1540)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That  is as problem because it all starts with working people across Canada paying taxes. The taxes go to the government.  The government sends them to the Indian bands, not to be used for housing, not to be used for improving the social conditions of reserve residents and  not to be used toward any significant and immediate concerns that  aboriginal people have  expressed    to me and many of my colleagues  in the many consultations we have had with them.  My    colleague,   the member for Wild Rose,   spent a couple of years of his life   meeting with aboriginal people, individuals and community leaders across the country.  He shared with me  the higher priorities  of  the aboriginal people.   If people are having trouble supporting  their  family they do not care b about tinkering legislators working to resolve these issues.   </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact of the matter is that the two things are related.  As long as these issues are not resolve, it is highly unlikely that   the  kind of economic development   we would like to see on reserves and  the   lifting of those limiting factors that plague so many people who live in isolated aboriginal communities across Canada will be achieved. The two things go together.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not just tinkering here when we talk about these things. I understand that my aboriginal friends  have higher priorities right now, like feeding their kids,  building a better community,  dealing  with some of the health problems that face their friends and neighbours,   and encouraging  their young people to avoid a life of crime and to make   better choices for themselves in the short and long term. I know they have priorities in the immediate days ahead but    this is a topic we cannot avoid dealing with.  We have avoided it for too long. We are paying the price today for the inattentiveness of our leaders to deal with these problems in the past.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I share the perspective that the minister expressed earlier.  We cannot leave these issues to be solved by our children. That is a very good and valid observation.    Our children should not be made to pay the price of our own inattentiveness to these issues today.    </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can agree with the government on the need to resolve these issues. We can agree with the government on the need to have a climate of economic   and social stability on reserves but we should also recognize that   other challenges do exist whether or not we solve these problems.  The    larger problems   must be addressed as well.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the government's urgent pursuit of aboriginal self-government, as it advances its agenda rapidly forward, what has been   the consequence of advancing that agenda? The consequence has been that many bands have been pushed into a situation where they are financially challenged.  The instability that results from that is that bands are pushed into third party management situations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I reference comments made yesterday by one of my colleagues in the NDP who said that the Alliance was excessively concerned with the problems and the failures that face some aboriginal communities.  I do not think we can be excessively concerned with serious problems.  I think we have to recognize that they exist. Though third party management is not something that affects every band in Canada, it does affect several dozen and it does have a consequence when bands have to go into third party management. To ignore that and try to do the Walt Disney thing and pretend that everything is happy, which I think is kind of naive to the maximum,   pretty much describes the agenda of the NDP on a lot of topics.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However in this case I think it is dangerous too.  The reality is that while the NDP  members are doing that Utopian and idealistic Marxist game, what they are  doing also is ignoring the very real concerns that face real people.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, when a band goes into third party management, the third party manager stops being responsible for paying the bills that were incurred before he or she became the third party manager.  Essentially that is what is happening right now.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have several constituents in my own community  who have been directly affected by that.   They own small businesses.  They have done business with the band.  Some of them have done business with that band for many years.  They are stuck now.  One owner of a hardware store is owed $60,000.  That is just one small business.  He does not have the taxpayers of Canada to depend upon.</p>


	<A NAME="T1545"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1545"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1550"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1540"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1545)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This small business person  is not able to go into the coffers of the people of Canada to pick on their tax dollars to solve his problems.     He is stuck with a $60,000 debt.  He does not blame the aboriginal people for it.  I hope his relationship with them   will continue to be good and fruitful in the future but it tests a relationship when someone gets stuck with a $60,000 bill.  He is just one of hundreds of  businessmen who  are in the same situation right now.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As opposed to some who choose to engage in a sort of class warfare agenda, I do not. We have   a situation here where small, private business people who do business with aboriginal people do so in the spirit of mutual benefit.  It has been that way for a long time.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However when we push an agenda forward, like the self-government agenda that  is being pushed forward today, and we see an increasing number of bands put into third party management  situations, there is a problem.    We have to be careful that bands have the preparatory skills and   the resources available   so they are able to handle those management responsibilities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have seen some good progress made in that respect. I know the AFN has been working with the Certified General Accountants Association of Canada to build and equip the aboriginal accounting managers, who have some serious responsibilities in terms of reserve management, to upgrade their skills   so they are able to do a better job of managing the books of the bands. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However  some bands in Manitoba believe   we are pushing  this agenda forward too rapidly. I think   10 or 12 bands right now are in third party management in Manitoba. Tens of millions of dollars are owed to people who did business with bands before they went into third party management.  Now they are stuck and cannot get paid. That does not just hurt business people.  I am not here defending small business but  I think small business is the principal engine of growth in the country and that is where we should be looking to create real long term jobs.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That being said, I am also concerned about the impact that will have     on the future business dealings of aboriginal managers.  When those bands go out of third party and come back into a situation of governance, like the minister is dealing with in another piece of legislation, there will   be some ongoing concerns about who will  supply the  bands with the goods and services they need.  Who will do that?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the reputation that the system has is one where there is much higher risk associated with small businesses doing business with bands it will    make it more difficult for band managers.  They will    have to pay more  for goods and services because of the added risks and the risk premium that will   be charged to them will be a  bloody shame. The taxpayers will pay the price for that but the aboriginal people will suffer the consequences.   </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must  recognize that with push comes shove.  Sometimes if we push too rapidly in a political agenda it can have very dangerous consequences on the other end, not just for small business people but for aboriginal communities as well. That concerns me and I think it is an issue  we should be addressing.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This particular legislation is portrayed as fulfilling a 10 year old commitment that the government made in the red book.  I guess our hope is that we can resolve most of these claims a lot faster than it took to fulfill this particular commitment. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of self-sufficiency, many underlying factors  go into promoting self-sufficiency, whether it is on an individual level or when we speak of reserve communities.  We agree with the minister's comments that promoting self-sufficiency on reserves is a noble goal.  We recognize that access to investment and business start-up money is critical to the success of aboriginal communities in building and creating future jobs.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We recognize that which is why I am addressing the concerns about third party management and the issue  of outstanding debt to business  people who have dealt with aboriginal bands   with the expectation of being paid.  There is a consequence when one defaults.  Access to investment in  business start-up capital becomes an additionally onerous requirement because more money is needed to do business on a reserve if the premium for risk is excessively high, as it is right now in many aboriginal communities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to back up and do a bit of historical referencing to   the specific claims process. I was doing some historical reading and found a 1982 publication called “Outstanding Business”.  It is a government document.  It states:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right">
</td>
<td><small>--a specific claim is one based upon a “lawful obligation” of Canada to Indians.  </small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Claims based on unextinguished Aboriginal title are expressly excluded, as were pre-Confederation claims until 1991.  A specific claim, from the government's point of view, is little more than a claim for compensation.</p>


	<A NAME="T1550"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1550"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1555"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1545"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1550)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The concept of lawful obligation is important here. Most Canadians want to see a resolution of the lawful obligations that the government has to aboriginal people because they perpetuate divisions in our society. They would also like to see them resolved in the interest  of fairness and in the interest of unlocking the potential that does exist  for the  aboriginal people and   the aboriginal communities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Department of Justice, however, assesses the validity of claims in terms of  their chances of success in court and applies technical rules of evidence. Thus, legal validity informs the government's assessment of whether a claim properly falls within the scope of federal policy. This assessment is further informed, if not defined, by the examples of lawful obligations set out in the policy itself.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does that mean? A lawful obligation can arise in any of the following circumstances  and these define what specific claims are: first, the non-fulfillment of a treaty or agreement between Indians and the crown; second, a breach of an obligation arising out of the Indian Act or other statutes pertaining to Indians and the regulations they are under; third, a breach of an obligation arising out of government administration of Indian funds or other assets; and fourth, an illegal disposition of Indian land.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to those, we have a situation where the government's determination of validity involves, in the estimation of many aboriginal people, a conflict of interest. The government's role in determining what in fact is a valid claim conflicts with the government's fiduciary obligation to aboriginal people  and that  the government itself should not be the arbiter and determiner of the nature and validity of claims. What this tries  to do is  set an arm's length mechanism in place that will assure those who participate in the process that they will  be treated fairly and that the heavy hand of government will not be excessively brought to bear on the process itself. That is the intention.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The policy interpretations and practices have created that perception for a long time. What I think the legislation tries  to do is   change that perception for the better, but the reality is, in the minds again of many who participated in this process, that they see the process as somewhat arbitrary, self-serving and operating without due regard to established law. Negotiated settlements are meant to be achieved according to a broader range of rights and obligations than those otherwise enforceable in a court of law. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we have to recognize is that federal policy has to set a clear standard by which their validity can be determined. If the Department of Justice has a problem with this, I would not be surprised because the reality is that government departments have been in conflict about how to resolve these types of issues for a good long time and probably will be for a good long time in the future. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want  to go back to that document again.  I know    it is a few years old but it gives a bit of a perspective. It states:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>Of an estimated 600 specific claims in Canada as a whole, approximately 100 have been settled under the specific claims policy.  As is often the case, however, these statistics do not reveal the full story. Most of the specific claims settlements have been made during the past five or six years....</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was written in 1986. It goes on to state that  quite a few of the claims were settled in Saskatchewan and B.C.     It also states:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>As noted by the Indian Commission of Ontario, about one settlement a year is made in central and eastern Canada; several hundred claims remain to be dealt with across the country.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a problem in Canada, not just because of the number, of the 500 or 600 claims right now, but because of the potential for many more. This is in the category of concerns that the Canadian Alliance has about this particular   legislation but we  obviously agree with the need to expedite the claims.</p>


	<A NAME="T1555"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1555"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1600"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1550"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1555)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to INAC, approximately 1,200 specific claims have been submitted since 1973 when Canada started to address such claims. Some of them have been resolved.  The minority of them have been resolved through negotiation.  Some of them have ended up in court which as we alluded to earlier is a tremendously expensive process.  It costs the taxpayers of Canada a great deal, but so does it cost the taxpayers of Canada a great deal for these issues to remain unresolved.  We have to recognize that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Alliance has serious concerns about the bill as it is proposed today.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill puts  an arbitrary cap of $7 million on the amount of the claims that could be dealt with through this process.  The Assembly of First Nations has raised a number of concerns about how that cap technically would be determined.  What would be included in it?  Would legal fees be included in that or just the amount of the claim itself?  These questions have to be addressed but certainly our concern is more fundamental than that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our concern is that the bill  has   the potential to create a  two tier system for dealing with claim settlements.  This is a view that has been expressed by a number of people.  Calgary lawyer Ron Maurice, a Metis who  has acted for bands on land claims,  feels that the tribunal's cap would severely limit the tribunal's mandate.  The bill is too narrow to deal with many of the 500 outstanding land claims.  It reduces the tribunal to the equivalent of a small claims court.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A great many claims, probably the majority of the claims across the country,  exceed, and in some cases far exceed, that amount.  What about the more than 500 outstanding claims that we know of today that exceed the cap?  Would the facilitation of the small claims result in a delay in the resolution of the larger? Would the process, by defining on the basis of size and that small goes faster, discriminate against the larger?  Would the process ignore the validity of the claims?  Would the process be able to deal with frivolous claims, expedite them  and remove them from the process quickly?  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would the process give weight to the nature of the length of time with which the claim has been dealt?  In some cases claims have been kicking around for decades.  Would those claims be dealt with expeditiously? Obviously it seems if there are over seven million they would not.  What  would this do to deal with those longstanding issues of concern many aboriginal people have?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we do not want to see are unnecessary and costly delays as a result of our attempt to facilitate the smaller claims.  In so doing, the net benefit of this change may be very little where the gross benefit appears to be large, because the loss between the gross and the net would be the fact that specific valid, longstanding and larger aboriginal claims would not be dealt with expeditiously.  That has been the case in the past.  We are concerned about fairness here.  We want to make sure that the process is fair.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another question that has  not really been addressed and which I recognize cannot be addressed in legislation   but should be  considered in  preparing legislation at least. It has to do with   the issue of resources.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How much would it  cost to resolve and run the tribunals and commissions?   What would the costs   actually be?  I have not seen anything on that.   We  would need to see that information to do a full and proper evaluation of the nature of the process. The cost consequences go far beyond  the costs of providing bureaucratic support and paying for personnel to be in these various positions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about the fact that by expediting small specific claims it  encourages other claims?  We have never made estimates.   I met with National Chief Coon Come.  He estimated 500 to 600 additional claims would come forward as a result of this process being put into place.  Others have estimated it to be over 1,000. Does the government know?  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government did not know the cost of Bill C-68 when it brought it in.  It estimated low and it was wrong.  The government did not know the cost consequences.   I do not believe it has fully evaluated the cost consequences to farmers and landowners of the species at risk legislation, or the animal cruelty act, a well established farm practice.  I do not believe the government has considered those perspectives.  It needs to consider them in the debate around this bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What would be the consequences of encouraging other claims to come forward?  They have to be dealt with. Would we have a backlog?  How long  would  it take for that backlog to be dealt with? These are questions that have to be debated and discussed.</p>


	<A NAME="T1600"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1600"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1605"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1555"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1600)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another fundamental and   difficult question which  should be addressed. It has to do with  the  problem  faced by aboriginal people on reserves whose lives all too often  are governed by hopelessness. They  believe that at some  undetermined point way off there in the distant future they are going to be the beneficiaries of one of these specific claim settlements and boy, that will solve all their problems.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to expedite the valid claims but there is a danger that we perpetuate a culture that  says to people that the problems they experience  in their home community can be solved by somebody else, that they can be solved by that big government in Ottawa and by golly, that is the way they are going to solve their problems. There is a danger with that. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not want   young people who are growing up on reserves to believe for a second that somebody here in this building will solve their future problems. We want them to understand that their problems will best be solved  by the people in their own communities, their own families, their own friends, their own leaders and their own support groups. The people at the community level are the people we want them to depend on, not somebody here in this building, not somebody in Ottawa.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That psychology of  externalizing the solutions is  dangerous. The first thing is to look within oneself. That is what I encourage my children to do and I encourage aboriginal children to do the same. Many aboriginal parents have  expressed that concern to me in meetings. They want to be sure we do not substitute the real measures that individuals can take. This is what they are saying to me. If we do not substitute those real measures they can take it home to their own communities with the solutions that Ottawa may or may not arrive at. It will benefit them  at some distant point down the road.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final point I would make is a concern  that is raised by many Canadians which is the lack of aboriginal involvement in the process. A major dispute going on right now in British Columbia is a referendum about the treaty in British Columbia. Without getting into the minutiae of the debate, the fact  is that  many people  feel they were not involved early on in the process. That lack of involvement is not something that should be addressed just on the aboriginal side. The minister has taken some flak because his consultations did not reach out in the way they should have to women, to reserve residents and to many other people. The point I would make is  the consultation in respect to the governance act has failed at least in part  because  non-aboriginal people were not involved. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are in this together. The less  we focus on what separates and divides us and the more we focus on the fact that we belong to one another in this country, the better it will be. The fact remains that non-aboriginal people view themselves as people who are in a sharing position with aboriginal people. For the most part they support the goals aboriginal people have for a better life. They want to solve these problems in partnership. They do not want to be shunted aside and just asked to pay up. Rather they would like to feel they are making a real contribution  to solving the problem. They should be consulted early. Failing to do that   creates a division and a sense of separateness that really taints the discussion.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have aboriginal friends who say it is none of my business, just pay my taxes and they will take the money because it is owed to them. Some of my friends have that attitude. On the other side, non-aboriginal friends of mine say that they do not like that attitude and  why should they  just pay their taxes and shut up? When there is that kind of divisive tone in a debate, not much gets done. The perpetuation of that kind of racial divide is dangerous to our country. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very dangerous here and we are seeing it in British Columbia with the referendum debate. If credible opportunities are not given for non-aboriginal people to be involved in the process, then the point is being missed. Aboriginal people matter in the debate as well. The key in this is fairness, a word the minister used. The government does have communications people who  I am sure  contributed greatly to the minister's speech today, but the word fairness was used. The government uses that word quite a bit.  Balance is a close second. Those are good noble word. The reality is the process has to reflect that but it  is missing here.</p>


	<A NAME="T1605"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1605"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1610"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1600"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1605)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is it missing?  Because the federal government broke its promise.  What it promised to do a decade ago in that red book was create an independent claims body.  The promise went further in the red book.  It said that it would be jointly appointed by the government and the first nations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is not what this will do.  What this does is it gives the power to appoint the counsellors and the members of the commission to the Prime Minister's Office.  It shuts out the aboriginal people from the process of determining who those people are.  We could get into a debate about the merits of that, pro and con, but the fact is that commitment was made.  A promise was made; a promise was broken.  It is not the first one but I hope, and I think most aboriginal people hope, that it will be the last that is broken.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The appointment process, according to National Chief Matthew Coon Come, is this.  He says:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>The appointment process makes the entire process open to possible patronage nominations. This will not serve Canada or First Nations well.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those are wise words.  The national chief is right to express those concerns.  We have those concerns as well.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grand chief of the Federation of Saskatchewan Indian Nations  says:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>The appointment to the tribunal must not be done unilaterally by the Crown. We want some input into the criteria of who is selected to sit on the tribunal to ensure that it is independent and the process is seen as meaningful by First Nations and all Canadians.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are legitimate concerns expressed by legitimately elected aboriginal leaders at the national level and the provincial level. We share these concerns.  The process has to be fair and it has to be seen to be fair or it will not work.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government is putting more control in its own hands, in the Prime Minister's hands, through this process despite its earlier commitments to share that control and that selection process with the aboriginal people.  That is a broken promise and is a disappointment to many aboriginal people.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, June 21 is coming up fast.  Not fast enough I expect for many of the members here.  June 21 is National Aboriginal Day.  This piece of legislation stands as an example, in words at least, of the government's intention to resolve one of the longest standing areas of dispute between aboriginal and non-aboriginal Canadians.  In that respect, it is our sincere hope that we can, with amendments, make this legislation work effectively to achieve its stated goals.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that on June 21 many of us will be joining our aboriginal friends to celebrate their great contribution to this country.  When we celebrate the uniqueness and the great contributions of aboriginal people, we will not be celebrating our differences, we will be celebrating our shared qualities.  It is those shared qualities on which  the Canadian Alliance wants to build.   We recognize that we belong to one another  and we will ensure that we  do everything possible to stand up for the rights of individual aboriginal Canadians and  for the great contribution that aboriginal societies have made and will continue to make to our country.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak to Bill C-60,  An Act to establish the Canadian Centre for the Independent Resolution of First Nations Specific Claims.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bill represents a praiseworthy initiative by the government in its relations with the first nations.   However, there are rarely roses without thorns. As the minister said in his statement to the press, shortly after tabling the bill last Thursday:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>The government made clear commitments in the Speech from the Throne to improve the lives of Aboriginal people by dealing with the grievances from the past, and to equip First Nations people with the tools for a successful future.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>This is also a Red Book commitment made by the Prime Minister, and by this government.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well now, good for them. I would, however, point out that the throne speech to which the minister refers was the one opening the 35th parliament, on January 18, 1994, more than eight  years ago.  Also, the red book he refers to was presented by the Liberals during the 1993 election campaign—not the campaign of 1997 or 2000, but the one of 1993.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister is right to be pleased, because at last, he can rise in this House and announce some government initiative for the benefit of aboriginal people, something very few of  his predecessors have been able to do.   I am thinking of the Minister of Human Resources Development or the Canadian ambassador to Ireland, Ron Irwin.  But  never mind, as they say, better late than never.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Bill C-60 will create the Canadian Centre for the Independent Resolution of First Nations Specific Claims, a measure that has become necessary, indispensable even, because the federal government has, most obviously, neglected to honour its legal obligations as required by a series of treaties ratified with the first nations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is somewhat ironic to see the government creating from scratch a body mandated to repair, or at the very least, arbitrate the injustices committed by it in connection with aboriginal nations.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a good initiative, I agree, and the first nations  have everything to gain in having an independent body, a tribunal what is more, finally able to decide on their claims, claims the government could leave unresolved as long as it wished.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the aboriginal people this represents a step forward.  Let us hope that the claims brought before this body will be settled diligently and in their best interests.  For too long, the first nations have suffered because of Ottawa's laxity and lack of leadership.  It is important now to look to the future. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I must again call attention to the wait and see attitude of this Liberal government in its relationship with first nations. Indeed, instead of taking action as it promised to do nearly ten years ago, the government preferred to wait and let things drag on, probably with the unspoken and unspeakable intention of seeing the aboriginal nations get fed up and abandon their various claims against it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fail to understand why the government would want to stretch the time frame to the limit since its inaction has considerably  hampered the development of first nations and its lindifference has made highly critical situations even worse, which is not saying much about a government run by a former Indian affairs minister. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The support of the Bloc Quebecois for the principle of this bill at the second reading stage shows our party's interest in the development of aboriginal communities and the nations to which they belong.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The openness shown by the Bloc Quebecois is based on the fundamental premise that the nations that take part in the dialogue must do it as equals. This kind of dialogue applies to the whole relationship between non aboriginal governments  and first nations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have often said, this way of thinking was evident in the negotiations that led to the ratification of the peace of the braves between the Government of Quebec and the Crees of James Bay.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quebecers know better than anyone else in Canada how important a constructive dialogue with their partners is, and I hope to see  all my colleagues in the House  adopt this attitude that does credit to Quebecers. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we discussed what the major thrusts of Bill C-60 should be, its referral to a committee after second reading will promote a most constructive discussion on this bill and, more importantly, will ensure that the bill reflects as closely as possible the fundamental objectives that were set. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among other things, we will have to give priority to the concerns raised by the Assembly of First Nations, in particular as regards the arm's length nature of the appointment process to the tribunal and the ceiling imposed on the value of the claims that can be submitted to this tribunal.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs, Northern Development and Natural Resources will have the opportunity to consult directly with aboriginal nations and with all those who take an interest in this most important issue, and it will propose amendments to the minister, so as to ensure that the legislation achieves its objectives.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since this is a new and innovative government initiative in the area of aboriginal claims, it is important to ensure that the process is as open as possible. My colleagues on the committee and I are anxious to hear what the leaders of aboriginal communities will have to say, since there are some claims that are critical to the development of their nations.   </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, I do believe and hope that the government will be truly determined to ensure that this bill is passed quickly, because the hopes of a very large number of aboriginals rest on it. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Needless to say, it would be truly be unfortunate if the government used its powers to prorogue the current session at some point during the fall and left first nations out in the cold for long months by letting them down once again with broken promises and failed commitments.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be  ironic, to say the least, to hear once again the governor general solemnly reaffirm the clear and true will of the government to promote the development of aboriginal communities. These lofty words have been used too often without leading to any action. History must not repeat itself, because this could break the fragile trust that exists between the federal government and aboriginal nations.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before concluding my remarks, I want to reiterate the support of the Bloc Quebecois for this important bill, and particularly for its impact on the development of first nations. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Quebecois is determined to do its utmost to improve this legislation and to have it passed, so as to speed up the settlement of  specific claims which, in some cases, have been dragging on for years.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to join the debate on Bill C-60.  I want to thank my colleague from the Bloc Quebecois for his thoughtful remarks.  I find I can associate myself with his points of view quite readily.  We have obviously come to similar conclusions and   apprehensions about some of the shortcomings or things yet to be explained or clarified in the bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been interesting  to research this long awaited bill that will be the impetus of the creation of the independent claims body.  We feel that this is a progressive move.  It would expedite and alleviate some of the backlog that exists in the specific claims area.  The research we have been doing has been instructive, to me at least, in many areas.  I would like to outline some of the things we found interesting, possibly to help people understand this debate.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two types of Indian land claims.  I am not sure that is  clear in the general public's mind.  I am not sure it is even clear in the minds of some of the other speakers from other parties I have heard, the Bloc Quebecois being the exception.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are comprehensive claims, which arise in areas where treaties have not been made between  Canada  and first nations to address and reconcile issues of existing aboriginal title.  Then there are specific claims that arise where Canada has failed to fulfill the terms of treaties or its  legal obligations to properly administer and protect first nations land or other assets, usually meaning finances.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specific claims come from laws and agreements respecting Indian lands dating back to 1763.  By virtue of the royal proclamation of 1763 the crown proclaimed that:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>“only the Crown could acquire land from the Indian Nations of North America”; and, “the Crown would make arrangements with Indian Nations with respect to land to protect them from great frauds and abuses...”</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These colonial laws and practices were the foundation for the crown's policy of making treaties with Indian nations for peaceful co-existence and for land for incoming immigrants.  Canada has the constitutional responsibility therefore for Indians and lands reserved for Indians, and has administered and managed Indian land and assets under the Indian Act since the 1870s.   It is important to note that the royal proclamation did not create rights.  It recognized property and land rights of Indian nations and it set up a process to acquire lands from Indian nations.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specific claims occur when Canada fails to set aside enough land under treaties.  That is one example where there might be a specific claim file.  A specific claim may be filed where reserve land was taken away illegally or in contravention of the laws or in contravention of certain treaties.  A specific claim could also occur where Canada has a responsibility for managing first nations lands and assets but fails to adequately protect those assets.  Those are the circumstances under which we find ourselves at the wrong end of a specific claim by a first nation aboriginal people.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specific claims are brought against the Government of Canada for failing to meet its legal obligations.  Specific claims are legally enforceable because they arise from duties and obligations that Canada has in relation to first nations treaty and property rights.  The claims are legal liabilities which remain until they are settled by the Government of Canada.  These are unfunded liabilities that Canada is owing.  Canada recognizes that as soon as these claims are validated it must settle them.  The conflict occurs when Canada finds itself in a conflict of interest situation.      I will speak more about that later because the very claims that are being made against the Government of Canada are being adjudicated by the Government of Canada. There  is room for conflict, as anyone can plainly see.</p>


	<A NAME="T1620"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1620"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1625"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1615"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1620)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was not until the early 1970s that first nations were able to examine why their lands and assets were lost under the administration of the federal government. Part of the reason these claims were not brought forward earlier was due to a clause in the Indian Act which prohibited Indians from making claims or seeking legal advice to make claims.  That clause was repealed in 1952. From the 1920s until 1952 aboriginal people were prohibited from this by law, and in fact lawyers were prohibited by law from taking money from aboriginal people to represent their views in a land claim issue. The practice was outlawed and aboriginal people were denied the recourse of the courts.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One might wonder how the existing specific claims policy worked to date. That is why we find ourselves here today trying to find another conflict resolution process because  the existing specific claims policy has been slow, inefficient, ineffective and costly. The costs of negotiating claims sometimes equals the cost of the settlement. Claims are taking as long as 7 to 10 years to finalize. First nations believe that the claims process should be fair and impartial first of all, and that it should  be expedited because, as the old saying goes, justice delayed is justice denied.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea of an independent body has been called for since the 1940s. In recent history it was recommended by the aboriginal justice inquiry in Manitoba and the Royal Commission on Aboriginal People in 1996. The Canadian Bar Association has been calling for this, and even the standing committee on aboriginal affairs, on which I sit, have all recommended that an impartial and independent body to deal with specific claims be established forthwith.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the Oka crisis, which revolved around a land claim, the federal government established the Indian Specific Claims Commission in 1992 as a temporary and interim body to hear appeals on claims that were rejected by Canada. However the Indian Specific Claims Commission can only make recommendations to Canada and therein lies the conflict of interest, because the Government of Canada ultimately will decide the merits of the case. A recommendation can come from the specific claims commission and the government will decide whether to pay out or not.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister of Indian and northern affairs at that time, the hon. Tom Siddon, publicly stated that the interim body would provide a degree of fairness under the existing policy. First nations of Canada sought agreement on improvements to federal policy but he expressed his concern as to how independent and how effective it could be.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First nations estimate that at the current rate of settling claims under the Indian Specific Claims Commission, it would take 150 years or more to settle the outstanding backlog. Clearly something must be done. The federal government has a backlog of claims dating back to the early 1970s. We have heard the figure of 480 outstanding claims used in the House of Commons today  and there are another 60 plus claims with the Indian Claims Commission.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Indian Claims Commission only accepts claims that have been rejected by the specific claims branch. For the past 12 years first nations have worked jointly with Canada and have waited for a collaborated effort to dialogue with the federal government to resolve these outstanding debts. The cost of settling claims increases every year. The longer it takes to settle a claim, the more it costs.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1997 the Joint First Nations-Canada Task Force, the JTF on claims policy, has been working to develop joint recommendations on claims policy reform. The JTF has developed a model for an independent claims body through positive interaction and dialogue that it believed was a fair, effective and impartial way to settle specific claims in Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government of Canada committed itself to work co-operatively with first nations in developing this kind of a fair and independent claims resolutions process. This type of process followed up on the federal government's red book promises and action policy “Gathering Strength--Canada's Aboriginal Action Plan”. The commitment then was to work with first nations to design the new independent claims body.</p>


	<A NAME="T1625"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1625"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1630"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1620"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1625)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The federal government did not respond to the joint task force report for 18 months.  When it did respond it was with a counter proposal to establish the independent claims body through legislation without any input at all from first nations. The federal counter proposal would appear to incorporate some of the basic elements of the JTF model, such as the commission and a tribunal, but there are key omissions, limitations and voids within the proposed legislation now that differ greatly from the recommendations of the joint task force which  is the fair way to put together agreements like this.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the specific differences from the joint task force and the actual legislation that concerns the parties now is the arbitrary cap of $7 million, that no claim greater than $7 million can be submitted to this process.  The problem is  that many of these claims are over $7 million.  Once  someone stipulates  this set of rules and agrees to put his or her claim  through this mediation process, that individual forgoes the right to the avenue of recourse through the courts at least while it is in the process.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unfairness comes in the following way.  What if the claim is $8 million?  There is a choice.  One could fight it through the courts for six, seven, eight, ten years or one could avail oneself of the expedited mediation process of the independent claims body and settle for a maximum of $7 million.  That first nation would have to make a judgment call and  leave money on the table because of this arbitrary ceiling of $7 million.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was not clear until  recently just how this cap would operate, whether it would apply to the ability of the tribunal to make recommendations on the validity of claims or whether the cap would include outstanding negotiation costs and loans, et cetera.  We now know  that the legal and negotiation costs would become part of that total $7 million cap. As we heard earlier  sometimes the cost of negotiation is equal to the settlement.  First nations could be working on repaying   an outstanding loan or debt who might also have $2 million, $3 million, $5 million worth of legal bills and the total maximum claim would be $7 million.  That would be deducted from their maximum claim.  That is a real concern.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are  concerned that even with an expedited process without the resources to deal with this huge backlog of claims, no real progress would be made.  We do not see any major increase in the budget for settlements.  There was concern over the operations budget and the continuance of loans funding to finance first nations participation in the process.  Do we know that first nations would still qualify for loans so that they can even represent themselves during this new independent claims process? That is yet to be determined.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one thing all parties  agree on is the appointment process.  The appointment of people to the commission or the tribunal would be a crown prerogative and not a joint process as promised.  This is one of the key recommendations of the joint task force.  To be an independent body it should not be made up of patronage appointments by the ruling party, the government.  That is what we are faced with today and that does call into question the truly independent nature of this independent claims body.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are  concerned that the fear of patronage appointments would jeopardize the effectiveness of this new body.  The cap of $7 million would exclude large claims and may force claims that are right about that level to accept the settlement at a value less than what they rightfully deserve because the claimants cannot afford to keep fighting a long and exhaustive legal battle.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are critical that there is  no significant increase in the budget for the new processing of claims and settlements.  We believe  there is a question of the true independent nature of the claims body and we believe  there is a risk of conflict of interest because we still have the Government of Canada hearing the claim against the Government of Canada.</p>


	<A NAME="T1630"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1630"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1635"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1625"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1630)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely there is a bias there. It is not independent.  There is no commitment to first nations that they will have a role to play in the three year review.  The bill calls for a three year review to measure the effectiveness of this new body, but the first nations will have no input so the government will  be auditing itself.  Again it is a problem of a conflict of interest  when the government is charged with the responsibility of measuring how well it did.  That can get  politicized.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our initial review of Bill C-60 we have identified a number of departures from the 1998 joint task force report, which may compromise the ability of the new body to assist in resolving claims in a fair and impartial manner.  Those are some of the concerns.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is worth looking at what the independent claims body will seek to replace or to act as an alternative to, and that is the Indian Claims Commission.  I was sitting in the House of Commons the last time the independent claims commission co-chairs  made a presentation of their annual report.  It was on May 29, 2001.  I would like to briefly visit that to explain some of the points   they made.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They raised the issue as background that in 1927 it was an amendment to the Indian Act that made it illegal for any person to accept payment from an aboriginal person for the pursuit of land claims.  As I have said, this provision remained in effect until 1951.  It was not until 1973 that  the decision of the supreme court in regard to Frank Calder of British Columbia confirmed   that aboriginal peoples' historic occupation of the land gave rise to legal rights that survived European settlement, thus recognizing the possibility of present day aboriginal rights to land and resources.  That ruling prompted the federal government to elaborate a policy to address unsettled land claims, both specific and comprehensive.  What a monumental supreme court ruling that was.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The co-chairs of the Indian Claims Commission stated “The specific claims policy has long been subject to criticism for establishing a system in which government rules on the validity of claims against it”. It was a clear-cut case of conflict of interest or at least the possibility and the risk of conflict of interest.  In the aftermath of the Oka crisis recommendations regarding land claim reform, the Indian Claims Commission was established by order in council.  I want to point that they also make    reference   to   this: the creation of an independent commission with broader powers has also been on the Liberal government's agenda since the 1993 pre-election red book and was a recommendation of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been promised this independent claims body at least since the government took office in 1993.  It was in their pre-election red book.  It has been a long, painful process waiting for this to take place, and as a previous speaker said, I hope  they can settle claims faster than they could live up to their red book promises.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to give an example of what types of specific claims have been  dealt with by the Indian Claims Commission  and what things succeed and what things fail.  Specific claims  are, as I have mentioned, outstanding lawful obligations owed by the Government of Canada to Indian bands. In general terms, they arise from breaches of treaty, breaches of trust and circumstances such as the theft of land, and flagrant violations of duties of the crown.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Often these are clear-cut cases and litigation should not have to be the only avenue of recourse to get satisfaction on historical facts in many cases.  We often will see a well documented historical fact that a certain air force base expanded onto reserve land.  The surveyors  staked it out and  took  200 acres   50 years ago. No one ever resolved these outstanding claims. People have been forced to go to the courts.  Surely in cases like that an independent claims body would agree that the grievance is legitimate and should succeed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the Fort McKay case in 1996 resulted in the reversal of the Government of Canada's policy position with respect to treaty land entitlement, and the prairie land surrenders of the Oliver era  are very well known.  These are landmark cases, precedent setting cases.    </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NDP welcomes the independent claims body with the reservations I have stated, which we will be raising again at committee.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to take part in the debate on Bill C-60, the specific claims resolution act, on second reading, representing the PC Party of Canada as an independent Conservative member of the House. It is rather unusual to debate two bills on aboriginal affairs back to back.  As we know, yesterday we debated the first nations governance act, Bill C-61.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I made reference during yesterday's debate on Bill C-61 to the fact that the member for Winnipeg Centre made a recommendation to the minister that aboriginal representation  be included during the hearing process of the standing committee.  I can certainly say at this time that the PC Party of Canada supports that recommendation.  In fact, we would suggest that the recommendation be extended to Bill C-60 as well.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know that the land claims issue in Canada has been longstanding and has not been easy.  Aboriginal treaties and land claims are part of Canada's history.  I believe that Canadians want these outstanding land claims to be resolved in an expedient manner. It is in the best interests of all Canadians, including aboriginal Canadians. Bill C-60, in the PC Party's opinion, is a progressive step.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first involvement with land claims was in 1995 with the Rolling River first nations band in my riding of Dauphin--Swan River.  The then chief, Dennis Whitebird, who is now the grand chief in Manitoba, was one of the leaders involved in the entitlement land claims initiative in Manitoba. As the mayor at the time I  learned a lot about land claims through the process and supported the Manitoba entitlement claim initiative.  In fact, Dauphin--Swan River is fortunate to have 13 first nation communities as well as 88 other municipalities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The land claims process, as I found out, is not as simple as it sounds.  At this point I would like to relate some of the basic information that I had to learn to understand and I believe it would be in the interest of the viewers following this debate.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First nations in Canada have signed agreements with the crown that are called treaties. There are three groups of treaties: pre-Confederation treaties, numbered treaties, and modern treaties, which we designate as land claims. In July 1817 the Selkirk Treaty in my own province of Manitoba was signed  by the Saulteaux and the Cree First Nations and the Government of Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pre-Confederation treaties include  King George III's royal proclamation of 1763.  Those treaties were negotiated in Canada before Confederation. Also included are the Robinson Treaty of 1850, Treaty No. 13, and the additions to the Robinson Treaty which are known as Treaty No. 12 and Treaty No. 14. Numbered treaties are the treaties numbered 1 to 11, which were negotiated between 1871 and 1877 with first nations people across Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third group of treaties is known as the modern treaties, or land claims as we know them today, which consist of land claims negotiated according to Canada's land claims policy established in 1973. The land claims policy recognizes two broad classes of claims: comprehensive claims and specific claims.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will explain briefly what comprehensive claims are.  Comprehensive claims are based on the assertion of continuing aboriginal title to lands and natural resources.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comprehensive claim settlements are negotiated to clarify the rights of aboriginal groups to lands and resources in a manner that will facilitate their economic growth and self-sufficiency.  Settlements are intended to ensure that the interests of aboriginal groups in resource management and environmental protection are recognized and that claimants share in the benefits of development.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These rights and benefits usually include: full ownership of certain lands in the area covered by the settlement; guaranteed wildlife harvesting rights, which I will come back to later and discuss in a little more  depth; guaranteed participation in land, water, wildlife and environmental management throughout the settlement area; financial compensation; resource revenue sharing; specific measures to stimulate economic development; and last, a role in management of heritage resources and parks in the settlement area.</p>


	<A NAME="T1645"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1645"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1650"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1640"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1645)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to speak about how  guaranteed wildlife harvesting rights has impacted  both  aboriginal and non-aboriginal individuals in Dauphin--Swan River this past winter.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one disagrees that aboriginal Canadians have the right to fish and hunt on a sustenance level.  In real terms, sustenance means putting food on the table, in the absence of aboriginal commercial rights to fish.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This past winter  in Dauphin--Swan River we saw a small group of aboriginal net fishers net fishing on an unlimited basis in stocked lakes  under the guise of sustenance.  That is wrong.  This illegal activity is not supported even by aboriginal people. Most of this illegal catch ended up on the commercial market through the Manitoba freshwater fish marketing board, which is a creature of the federal government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately this issue is still unresolved.  Manitoba has no provincial regulations pertaining to unlimited net fishing by aboriginals.  In fact, the Manitoba conservation minister is himself an aboriginal Canadian.  He wants  band bylaws on resource management to be applicable outside the boundaries of the reserve.  This goes against the Sparrow decision. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue of unlimited net fishing by aboriginals in stocked lakes will not go away unless all stakeholders in Manitoba meet and come up with a solution. The provincial minister currently picks and chooses who should sit at the table.  If humans do not agree, fish and  game will be the big losers.  We  will all lose if we lose our wildlife resources.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most specific claims are related to land  other than a loss of reserve lands without lawful surrender by the band concerned or the government's failure to pay compensation where lands were taken with legal authority. Other specific claims arise with respect to the administration of Indian moneys and other assets such as timber and mineral rights.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings me to Bill C-60 dealing with specific claims.  Before I talk about the bill I would like to put forth the Progressive Conservative position. We would respond energetically to the co-operative settlement of outstanding land and other claims with aboriginal people ensuring that they have full opportunity to grow, develop and prosper within Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position of the Progressive Conservative Party differs from the Liberals in that we would work with aboriginal people to expressly define  aboriginal rights as a matter of public policy in a non-confrontational balance and interest based negotiations. We believe that the ineffective, paternalistic, colonial approach of the Indian Act must give way to greater self-reliance through effective education, economic development, social justice and local control.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PC position is very clear.  We do not share the position of another party in the House that believes special rights for any targeted racial group is contrary to the principle of equality and that they should be indistinguishable in law and treatment from other Canadians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister said in committee that   something was wrong when legal fees outstripped settlement targets.  In principle the PC Party supports Bill C-60. On the matter of litigation we support the policy that Canada will not entertain a claim or participate in negotiations if  first nations have active litigation on the claim.</p>


	<A NAME="T1650"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1650"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1655"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1645"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1650)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing claims process has been criticized by many over the years. These are some of the criticisms.  This was a backroom process hidden from the public.  There is a  lack of fairness and transparency in the area of research and assessment.  It does not provide a level playing field for negotiations.  Finally, there is a lack of independence and partiality and accountability. The new bill, Bill C-60, hopefully will address these concerns.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada's specific claims policy was first established in 1973. Over the years this policy has been amended several times to reflect the evolving legal and policy environment. Despite its shortcomings, it has settled many claims.  In fact, 232 claims were settled, totalling $1.2 billion, averaging $5.3 million per claim and adding 16,000 square kilometres to the reserve land base. Approximately 580 claims, with an estimated contingent liability of $2 billion, have been added to the Indian and Northern Affairs Canada inventory of unsettled claims. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calls for the government to establish an independent claims body have been numerous over four decades by three parliamentary committees: the parliamentary joint committee 1946-48;  the joint committee of 1959-1961; and the Commons standing committee on aboriginal affairs in 1991. There was also  draft legislation introduced twice in the House in 1963 and 1965. They all failed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three independent reports  made similar recommendations for an independent claims body: Gérard La Forest in 1981; the Canadian Bar Association in 1987; and  the royal commission on aboriginal peoples in 1995. There are other advocates who recommended the same point of view: the Indian Specific Claims Commission in 1991 and the first nations Canada joint task force created in 1996.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All stakeholders agree that establishment of this independent body is long overdue. The centrepiece of Bill C-60 is the establishment in law of the Canadian centre for the independent resolution of first nations specific claims.  It will be comprised of a commission division to facilitate the negotiation of claims settlements between the parties by providing a range of dispute resolution processes and a tribunal division as a last recourse to adjudicate the validity of and compensation for claims where negotiations and dispute resolution processes have proved unsuccessful.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The commission and the tribunal will establish neutral arm's length claim facilitation and adjudication bodies, enhance transparency, remove the funding of first nations to participate in specific claims process from the minister's jurisdiction, simplify the existing structure and bring greater rigour to the process and provide an effective alternative to litigating specific claims, which are expensive for both parties, by actively promoting negotiated settlements and/or exercising its authority to render binding decisions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One area in Bill C-60 which calls for debate  is the fear of patronage appointments process. Why does the government get to pick all the commissioners in both divisions? How can it operate at arm's length and be impartial and away from political influence if this occurs? Does the aboriginal community have representation on those commissions?</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;June 21 is an important day as we celebrate National Aboriginal Day.  Aboriginal history is a part of this country's history.  How many Canadians know that during the war of 1812-1814 the aboriginals in central Canada, through their efforts in aiding the British, basically prevented the takeover of this country by the Americans?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two weeks ago I had the privilege to help open the first annual parkland aboriginal festival in Dauphin, Manitoba.  I am sure the festival will become an annual event and will continue for many years to come.  I applaud the Dauphin Friendship Centre for taking the initiative to organize the event, with the full support of the aboriginal community.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In closing, Bill C-60 is needed.  The PC Party supports the bill in principle.  I look forward to the upcoming hearings by the standing committee.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak for the member for Oxford in support of the bill respecting the specific claims resolution act.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The act would establish the Canadian centre for the independent resolution of first nations specific claims.  This body would be composed of a commission division to facilitate negotiations on specific claims by first nations and a tribunal division to resolve disputes involving those claims. This system would expedite disputes and save money over the long term.  It would also emphasize that both the Government of Canada and the first nations would rather negotiate than litigate.  It would allow us to quickly resolve a number of historic grievances.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By settling these claims, we would remove a roadblock to economic development.  Investors could proceed with confidence and first nations could negotiate  from positions of strength. As the title of the act indicates, resolution is the objective to provide  the certainty of a fair, equitable, transparent and just system.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The overall purpose of the new commission would be to facilitate the resolution of negotiated settlements on specific claims.  The new tribunal would make binding decisions where dispute resolution mechanisms failed, with no appeal except to the federal court. Binding decisions would avoid costly recourse to court actions that  would drag on and prevent the certainty of final resolutions, which  are very expensive and frustrating.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tribunal would determine compensation on claims to a ceiling of $7 million, ensuring access by most claims in the current inventory.  I understand that 80% of the claims would come under the $7 million ceiling.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainty would allow aboriginal people to become investors and  would encourage the investors to start new businesses and to expand opportunities. Certainty of resolution of specific claims would mean a new climate of strength and confidence for both first nations and partnering non-aboriginal communities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the legislation, first nations would be moving to a more equal footing with other Canadians, able to pursue their dreams and sure that their claims are being dealt with fairly and impartially.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On behalf of the member for Oxford, Mr. Speaker, I thank you for this opportunity to participate in this important debate on this important legislation.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, as we have agreed to send   this   important bill   to committee,      I will be brief. If my partner shows up I will be sharing some time with him.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a tremendously important bill to me.   I may be a little selfish but there is a lot of land in my constituency and there will  be claims that I will want  be able to address.   I want the opportunity to question the committee and submit questions for my own satisfaction in dealing with other governments because once a land claim is made it is not just over. We will be dealing with changes in the acquisition of land, changes in the tax bases for municipalities  and a whole set of agreements. It is not a simple thing. It is far reaching. It even goes into the tax base to fund public schools and so on.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a very difficult situation. Some of the rules and regulations in land acquisition in my province have a particular formula. I am sure it is the same formula as my colleague from Dauphin--Swan River   just  spoke about.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to  land acquisition, there is a point that  no one has mentioned  and it  concerns me a lot. If one is going to lose or take out of the agricultural industry or the base for a certain community 20 farmers from a given portion of land, and if they  move elsewhere, then we should know well in advance because the businesses  that have traditionally served those 20 people will have to change their operations in order to adjust to the loss of customers. Heaven knows, in Saskatchewan we are losing enough customers as it is and that is a very serious concern.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter what people have to do  to make their claim, I want to make absolutely sure that our position in land claims negotiations will be to ensure respect for existing property  rights, affordable and conclusive settlements of all claims, and an open, transparent process, including all stakeholders. I can assure the House and the committee that the bill will set up  that it is imperative that the committee understands the total results of what happens when land is taken over. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first question I have concerns  the independent centre. How independent will it   be? In the true sense of independence, when the government selects     the people, the chief executive officer and so on,  how independent can the centre be? To answer that question, from what I have read, it will be about as independent as one could expect from government appointees. Let us keep that in mind.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question that has bothered me somewhat concerns the fact that the bill dictates that the centre  must be located in Ottawa. That might be all right for the centre  itself  but I would suggest to those going into the committee and to the minister that it would be a lot easier to move the appointees to the area of dispute or to where the claim is being made than it would be to  bring people down here. I have no objection to the centre  being located here but I would suggest that  its  mobility    be recognized. I really believe there is a necessity for that.</p>


	<A NAME="T1705"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1705"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1710"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1700"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1705)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to point out that the centre  will be audited by the auditor general   within six months of its  operation and then it will be audited annually.  I see  nothing wrong with that. It  is a whole lot better than some of the government programs today. Some of them have not been audited for years.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like the minister to take a look at grants in lieu of. It is a very indepth study but in some cases the grants in lieu of are grants made because of loss of business.  While the transaction may be legal  other outside interests  will lose. I think the commission should be prepared to listen to that. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the federal government came into our province under the PFRA  back in the thirties   it established   huge grazing pastures. The RMs, who lost the real tax base,   were given a grant   every year   in lieu of taxation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of land claims by first nations,   a formula is in place but I think we have to re-examine that formula. Let me give the example of the RM of Golden West in my area. The amount of land that it has  lost through land claims, and I do not want to use that word lost, but lost only to taxation purposes, leaves that particular rural government in the  position, even with the formula, of no longer having the    financial  means to properly operate.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some will say that is all right, that they can be swallowed up by other local RMs, which is possible, but I would like the minister to take a look once more at that formula and  check  with the Association of Rural Municipalities in each of the provinces to see if it is working.  We need to have  everybody on side or it will not work.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My hon. colleague  from Dauphin--Swan River talked about something  that has hurt this process and will continue to hurt this process. There is a man made lake  just inside of his constituency  called the  Lake of the Prairies.   People came in   last winter,   illegally netted the fish in the entire lake, loaded the fish on  trucks and took them far away.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to say up front, that was not sustenance fishing and everybody knows that.  However in my own area we reported the massive slaughter of elk one winter. The elk were taken out in refrigerated trucks. Although this was totally against conservation and totally against the environment no one, as far as I know,   was ever apprehended  or  cited with an offence. If we want co-operation,   we   must realize  that these things can no longer take place. They  will hurt us in negotiations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The  next question I have concerns  the minimum of seven million claims. What if one group of people submitted three seven million claims? That  would amount to     21 million claims? Would they be allowed to submit three seven million claims? It is a moot question but it could be the way in which an agreement is finalized that normally could not be finalized under this group.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not on the committee but I hope the committee gives this the due attention  it needs. It is very important because we must get this over with as quickly as possible. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My final question has to do with the  time limit on the claims. Is there a time limit or do we have to wait for 20 years until another $7 million claim comes in?  I think that is important too.  </p>

	Mr. Speaker, it is my understanding that the purpose of Bill C-60    is to create an independent centre  that would  provide for the filing, negotiation and resolution of specific claims.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been a longstanding opinion of a number of people throughout the country that these claims should be dealt with in a speedy fashion and  in a fashion that will once and for all resolve the issues that surround the purpose of settling these claims.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Alliance has strongly supported getting these claims settled in the best and speediest way possible.  However I am not convinced in the slightest that this particular bill would achieve that. It seems like it is pretending to address the problems but I really wonder exactly where this will  end up in the long run if it is approved.  I am sure it will be approved because once again we have some legislation brought forward by a majority government and in this country the majority government always has its way.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope   government members have listened  and will continue to listen to the debate that is going on and that they will  take  into consideration some of the things that are concerning a number of people.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although we are moving in  a direction that is supposed to resolve long lasting problems,   problems   on reserves go on  every day according to the individual people    with whom I have met.     Again today I   received an e-mail from a fellow by the name of Keith Chiefmoon.    Keith  has written to the minister directly requesting immediate help for a flooding situation in Stand Off, Alberta. The situation has become desperate. The reserve has lost its drinking water and there are problems with sewage.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to learn to respond to these individual needs because the tragedies and grievances that these people are suffering on these reserves are absolutely pathetic in many instances.  We have continued to lag in addressing the problems that surround the reserve issues to the point where even the United Nations has recognized most of the reserves to be no better than other countries in the world that have been classified as third world conditions.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the  people on the reserves are living in squalor and are struggling with  difficulties      simply because of the lack of accountability and lack of concern for anything other than regulations that enhance the needs of a few but  do not look after the needs of the many.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish this legislation, which would create    a  centre   to deal with land claims, would address the real down to earth problems.  We need to give assurances to the many mothers and grandmothers on the reserves, who have contacted me and  who I have met with personally in my travels across the country over the years,   that their families can  grow and achieve the prosperity that so many Canadians enjoy.  They want to be part of that through whatever process or means we try to achieve.  We need to give them some hope, which they do not have today, and give them some help   which they feel is not available.  They do not know where to turn.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have met many times with ministers of Indian affairs over the years, including the present minister and the one prior to him.  It just does not seem to happen that we address the real issues at the heart of the difficulties that surround  the people who  are affected.   We seem to concentrate on the larger picture of establishing claims and  making changes to the Indian Act.</p>


	<A NAME="T1715"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1715"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1720"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1710"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1715)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the things  we must address and look to in the future.  We are  putting the cart before the horse when we do not start at the bottom where the problems  exist.  The problems are with individuals  in  many of our reserves across the country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know how many times individuals have contacted me and said that they do not know who to turn to.  If they go to their chiefs and councils regarding the issues that mean the most to them they are told to go home and that they will be looked after, but they never are.  If  they continue to make a fuss, then there are reprisals against them.  There are problems that come their way because they speak out too often. They are told to go to the indian affairs department.  I attended  many meetings with them in Edmonton.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people have pleaded with the indian affairs department to help them in their dire situations and the department's only answer is that it does not get involved with these problems.  It is an internal problem.  They are told to take it to their chief and council.  Around and around it goes.  It seems that is the way it has been going for years and years.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see  that a committee would be struck.  There would be a centre and it would create a commission or tribunal.  All the commissioners and adjudicators would be appointed by the Prime Minister.  That bothers me right from the start.  He has not had much luck in his appointments over the last few years that I could account for.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The claims process  would then proceed as follows.  There would be an intake and a preparatory stage.  The first nations would submit claims to the commission which would arrange research funding for the first nations. It would notify interested parties of the claim and would facilitate preparatory meetings. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exactly who would be involved in those preparatory meetings? Would it be the hundreds of grassroots natives who are constantly crying out to the minister and the government, who have been crying out since they were young and are now elders in their communities? Would they  have a voice?  Would they be heard with regard to where this would all lead?  Would it address the cares and problems that these mothers and grandmothers in particular are trying to point out day in and day out through their many efforts? Or would it go  to the upper echelon authorities?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I look at the validity stage where the crown would decide whether or not to accept the claim. If the crown were to refuse the claim, then the first nations could ask for a dispute resolution led by that commission. All these other people would sit on the sidelines while the elite would sort out the problems of settling these claims.  Where are the first nations voices in all of this?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about the taxpayer?  I have never met any  taxpayers in this country who are not willing to help the situation that exists in our country with regard to the livelihood and welfare of our native people.  If only they knew where their dollars were going and  what they were going to achieve.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Year after year the auditor general reports to the government about how it is failing to address the seriousness of the problems that exist in the hearts and minds of these people and their lives. Taxpayers become  disillusioned when they look at millions and billions of dollars that goes along with running the indian affairs department.  Yet they see their neighbours on reserves living in third world squalor conditions.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is all fine and wonderful. We earn triple digit figures in salaries and all the big shots throughout the country  will  come together and make these great settlements, but who will truly benefit? Will there be any guarantee from the commission that at last the people who have been suffering for years on the reserves will have some relief?  Will the taxpayers of Canada for once in a number of years say their  dollars were well spent and that the Government of Canada and first nations did a good job?  When will that day  come? Will it be because of Bill C-60 or Bill C-61?  I think not, not until there is a willingness to accept the challenge of taking care of our citizens, especially the aboriginals of Canada.</p>

	moved that Bill C-409, an act respecting a national day of remembrance of the Battle of Vimy Ridge, be read the second time and referred to a committee.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said: Mr. Speaker, it is my distinct honour to begin the debate on Bill C-409, which if enacted by parliament would set April 9 of each year as Vimy Ridge day.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This day would not be a holiday, but rather a day to recognize an important part of our national history, a World War I battle which occurred on April 9, 1917. This was a battle months in the preparation and  included for the first time since Confederation Canadian troops operating under Canadian command.  Up until that time Canadians had been part of British units under British command.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At Vimy Ridge we fought as one national team with Canadian leadership.  Our soldiers, while suffering significant casualties and loss of life, accomplished a feat that other Allied forces had failed to do up to that point in World War I.  There were about 10,000 Canadian casualties, including about 4,000 killed at Vimy Ridge that day.  It is a battle recognized by many which opened the way to the eventual victory in World War I by Allied forces.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to quote a piece of historical text. It states:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>The Canadian share of the British assault was the seizure of Vimy Ridge. The task was formidable. For the Germans it was a vital key in their defence system and they had fortified it well. The slopes which were in their favour were interlaced with an elaborate system of trenches, dugouts and tunnels heavily protected by barbed wire and machine guns, and defended from a distance by German artillery. They had even installed electric lights, a telephone exchange, and a light railway to maintain supplies of ammunition. All previous attempts to take the Ridge had failed.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>The attack began at dawn on Easter Monday, April 9. All four divisions of the Canadian Corps - moving forward together for the first time - swept up the Ridge in the midst of driving wind, snow and sleet.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A situation we could hardly imagine today. It continues:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>Preceded by a perfectly timed artillery barrage the Canadians advanced. By mid-afternoon the Canadian Divisions were in command of the whole crest of the Ridge with the exception of two features known as Hill 145 and the Pimple. Three days later these too were taken.</small></td>

</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>The victory at Vimy Ridge is celebrated as a national coming of age. For the first time Canadians attacked together and triumphed together. Four Canadians won the Victoria Cross and Major-General Arthur Currie, commander of the 1st Division, was knighted on the battlefield by King George V.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada's conquest at Vimy Ridge won Canada a place as a signatory at the treaty of Versailles.  Canadians have fought many great battles as members of other national units or under Canadian commanders over the decades and we honour all those veterans who survived and those who were lost.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To honour the battle at Vimy Ridge is to honour all battles as April 9, 1917, is the first time that Canadians fought side by side as Canadians under one Canadian commander.  Most important, there were some 100,000 Canadians from coast to coast.  There were four divisions involving brigades from every region of the country.  The four Victoria Crosses were spread  across the country including a recipient from Quebec,   British Columbia and  Ontario.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To honour Vimy Ridge is to honour all great battles involving Canadians.  Bill C-409 would accomplish two  things.  It would be a day of remembrance, a day of heritage. This day would not be a holiday, but a day where young people could be reminded each year, as part of the evolving remembrance season that we see in this country, of the tragedy, terror and heroism of war, and the necessity to move forward looking for peace at all times.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill also asks that the Peace Tower flag be flown at half-mast on that day. I will ask the committee, if the House agrees to send the bill  to committee, to accept a friendly amendment to make the flying of the flag at half-mast to be  from 11 a.m. to sunset, to be consistent with Remembrance Day.  That is something the committee could consider after the fact.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to note that the bill has the support of the Royal Canadian Legion, Dominion Command.  I also have dozens of letters from individual legion branches, private citizens, municipal councils and others offering their support for this initiative.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point I wish to explain why I initially introduced the bill.  It was thanks to a constituent of mine from Elliot Lake, Ontario, Mr. Robert Manuel , a member of the local legion branch who recognized how important the Battle of Vimy Ridge was to Canadian history, not just military history.  He wrote countless letters seeking support for this initiative and presented  the letters and petitions to me.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very appropriate and true to the intent of private members' bills that issues which arise from the grassroots of Canada come to seize the attention of Canada's parliament. It is important that the House know that this was not a late night idea brought forward by this member of parliament.  It was brought forward by a constituent who consulted with his fellow peers. He  obtained letters of support and brought the issue  forward. It is my duty and privilege to bring forward the fruits of those labours  as Bill C-409.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish also to point out that I do not intend to create a precedent with Bill C-409 by suggesting that all great battles be recognized by a special day.  Rather it is my intent to give  the Battle of Vimy Ridge a special place because as many have come to agree, it was the beginning of Canada's march toward nationhood. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appreciate the opportunity to add a  small part to the important efforts of war remembrance in Canada. I pay further respect to our veterans, their legions and those who lost their lives in battle or peacekeeping and in fact to our military today by bringing forward Bill C-409.  We owe a great debt of gratitude to our war lost and  to our veterans.  Each year,  through  what is a growing recognition of the importance of remembrance, our veterans bring us opportunities to come together in social gatherings and remembrance gatherings to make sure that the future of our nation is filled with peace.  In doing so however, we must remember the tragedy and heroism of the wars behind us.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to be sure there is  time for other members to speak.  I seek the support of the House that eventually the bill will go to the appropriate committee.  I look forward to the comments of other members who no doubt can add even more to this debate than I have been able to do in this short time.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said this morning,     I have  been around a long time.  I was a principal during the 1960s and during that time there was a battle going on. Part of that battle was that we were not getting the support nor were our veterans getting the support that they deserved.  Our national media carried all kinds of documentaries which said for example  that Billy Bishop  was not  a good flyer or that our air force was no good, that  they dumped their bombs and went home.  Everything possible was done to try to destroy things and  I had to fight it. Finally we have a book that should be in every library. I am proud to have the book <i>No Greater Glory</i> which  is signed by Barney Danson, a former minister of veterans affairs.  Every school should own a copy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like  the member who  moved the bill to imagine the impact   if all grades in every school division across Canada paused and took the  time to consider  the importance of this date. We would make sure that this was on Vimy Ridge Day.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to read what appears on the  veterans affairs website:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

<td><small>The Canadian success at Vimy marked a profound turning point for the allies.  A year and a half later, the Great War was over.  The Canadian record, crowned by the achievements at Vimy, won for Canada a separate signature on the Versailles Peace Treaty ending the war. Back home, the victory at Vimy, won by troops from every part of the country,  helped  unite many Canadians in pride at the courage of their citizen soldiers, and established a feeling of real nationhood.</small></td>

</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe Bill C-409 would have an impact .</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to the flag and naming the day,  I too have a bill,  if it ever gets drawn,  that would  put even more teeth into the present bill.  My bill would  require that not just the Peace Tower fly the flag at half-mast in November  but that  all federal government buildings from coast to coast to coast do it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest to the House that this bill will pass after it comes back from committee.   I would suggest to my colleague  and other  members opposite that if my bill ever makes it and it becomes votable, it too will pass.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Congratulations to my hon. colleague  for a bill well presented, a bill which we on this side of the House unquestionably support. We will send it to committee with our blessings.  Let us hope that it becomes part of our heritage, something that we always protect when it comes to our military successes both in World War I and World War II.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, it is with pleasure that I rise to speak to the bill introduced by the member for Algoma—Manitoulin concerning the Battle of Vimy Ridge.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, before speaking directly about this bill, I would like to take a few moments to pay tribute to the memory of Lieutenant Lucien Olivier Larocque, who died a few days ago in Sorel-Tracy and whose funeral service will be held Thursday morning of this week.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Larocque was the  co-founder of  the Sorel-Tracy branch of the Canadian legion, branch 117, in 1954. He devoted many years of his life to hosting and chairing the legion. He was a upright and honest man, dedicated and proud of his military background; he had served overseas. He was admired by all for his outstanding leadership and organizational abilities. He was the life and soul of the Sorel-Tracy branch of the Canadian legion and was its inspiration for many years. The legion's reception hall was named after him, in recognition of his talents.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to his deep involvement with the legion, he was also very proud of his family. Personally, and on behalf of all of the members of the Royal Canadian Legion of Sorel-Tracy, of which I am a member, I would like to offer my condolences to all of his family, especially to his three children. I would also like to tell them how much we owe him for preserving, for so many years,  the memory of those who shed their blood or who fought to defend peace and freedom.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the  words of the great French author, Alexandre Dumas, “Those whom we have loved and lost are no longer where they were, but they continue forever to be wherever we are”. Farewell, Lieutenant Lucien Olivier Larocque. We will always remember you.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The members of the Bloc Quebecois are happy to vote for Bill C-403, now before the House, to designate April 9 as a national day of remembrance of the Battle of Vimy Ridge.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Battle of Vimy Ridge, in France, where 60,000 Quebecers and Canadians lost their lives in 1917, was a turning point that led to the final allied victory.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vimy Ridge was central to the German defence system. One hundred thousand Quebecers and Canadians took part in this historic battle.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to salute all of the soldiers, but especially those from Quebec, the Royal Montreal  Regiment, the 22nd Regiment of Quebec City, the Victoria Rifles of Canada from Montreal, the Black Watch from Montreal and the 87th Battalion of the Grenadiers from Montreal, which were all present during the battle. Following the battle, a historian wrote:</p>

</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After more than 85 years, we still remember the heroism, the self sacrifice, the abnegation and the will to vanquish of these valiant soldiers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We therefore support this bill presented by the Liberal member, and we also hope that his government will consider the need to financially support our legions, as I asked of the parliamentary secretary a few months ago, during another debate.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What would be the use of commemorating battles if, in each region, there was no one in the legions to lead the celebrations, plan them, make people aware of these historical acts and tell them that if they are living in peace and freedom today it is because others made the ultimate sacrifice and fought  as heroes so that we could be free. </p>


	<A NAME="T1740"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1740"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1745"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1735"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1740)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need people in the legions to remind us of this event, and the legions must be financially sustainable. This is probably what Mr. Larocque had in mind when he founded our legion. Today, if he could, he would certainly tell the government “Help us carry out this mission we have been resolutely carrying out for the past 50 years.”</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We now have a  Standing Committee on Veteran Affairs. It seems to me it should deal with the issue and review the financial situation of our legions so that they can afford to remind us of our soldiers and of the battle of Vimy the Liberal member and the Canadian Alliance member just talked about. .</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our founders   are leaving us, as Mr. Larocque did, but their work must be continued. The government must support their work, namely the founding of the legions, so that they can keep alive the memory of our soldiers' heroic actions during the various wars they took part in.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I  would say that people in the various Canadian legions who are listening to this debate on the battle of Vimy and who remember and want us to remember this battle, which was a turning point in the history of the World War I, are sending an urgent appeal. Our legions are experiencing financial difficulties. They do not need millions, only a few thousand dollars a year to survive and keep on raising the awareness of young people and the population at large. I would be very happy to again take part in the consideration of this bill.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, it is a great pleasure to speak  to and endorse Bill C-409 put forward by the hon. member for Algoma--Manitoulin. The bill would institute a Vimy Ridge day to commemorate the important contributions made by the Canadian armed forces in the Battle of Vimy Ridge.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the distinguished member who spoke before me. Whenever we have a debate about recognizing the military and the people who have fought for the country we realize the importance of financially assisting the legions. I too hear constantly about the need of legions to fix leaky roofs, put in elevators, build ramps for veterans with disabilities and deal with continuous problems of infrastructure. I am sure all members in the House deal with the issue on a regular basis. Having days of commemoration and celebration is important, but it is also important to put money into the legions. They are the heartbeat of the memory of our armed forces and their contributions to world peace.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I stand here today on behalf of my hon. colleague from Sackville--Musquodoboit Valley--Eastern Shore who was not able to participate in the debate today. He had to return home to be with his daughter. She broke her hand and needs to have her dad by her side. I will be a weak replacement for the hon. member but will do my best.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In preparation for the debate tonight I came upon an account by Tom Morgan who wrote a document called “Vimy Ridge--80 Years On...”  which contains some eloquent words describing the battle. I do not think anyone could say it better. Morgan described what the battle really meant to Canadians and the people involved:</p>

The ground conditions were very bad, with slippery mud waiting to hamper the Canadians as they began their assault.  Heavily laden, the men began to cross the shattered No-Man's Land, skirting as best they could the shell-holes and craters, until they came to the muddy, slippery slopes of the Ridge itself. They advanced behind a creeping barrage--a curtain of falling shells which crept forward just ahead of them.  At key places in the advance, fresh troops took over the lead, until by the middle of the afternoon, three of the Canadian divisions had captured most of Vimy Ridge. By the next day, Hill 145 was also in Canadian hands, leaving just a few isolated outposts. By April 12th these, too had been taken and the Canadians' victory was complete.</small></td>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. member for Algoma--Manitoulin says we need a day of remembrance and heritage to mark the importance of the battle in Canadian and world history. I agree wholeheartedly. I also agree with Motion No. 409. I am honoured to be part of any measure that would recognize the great contributions of the Canadian forces at home and abroad, past and present, in maintaining peace and providing humanitarian assistance and disaster relief.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years in my riding of Dartmouth I have been honoured to be part of special days with veterans and peacekeepers, people who carry the scars of their struggle for democracy in their bodies and minds. I have been with families on the Halifax jetty as they said hello or goodbye to loved ones leaving for tours of duty in a violent world. I was honoured to be present at the funeral of Nathan Smith, one of our Princess Pats killed by friendly fire in Afghanistan. He was a young man who loved soldiering, his life, his country, and the values of freedom and justice which he held deep in his soul.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vimy Ridge day would join with Remembrance Day, D-Day and the many other days of the year on which we remember to thank these brave and selfless men and women for their love of and loyalty to this great country.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, it is  an honour and a pleasure to  take part in this important debate. My party, like all the others, will certainly be supporting the motion. We do not do enough to honour the war dead, the many people who gave their lives so that we could have the  freedom that we have.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of what I had planned to say tonight has already been said by my colleague from the NDP.  I was told not to trust those people because they will take everything I have and that is exactly what she did.  She stole my words because the description of the battle is so vivid in that piece of writing.   I am sure everyone who read it wanted to use it in their speeches.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the member  omitted part of the total presentation.  There was a lead up which, in light of her speech, if we analyze it, was earth shattering when we looked at the number of Canadians who participated and who were injured.  There were 10,000 casualties and over 3,500 dead.  That equates to the number killed on September 11.  We know how the world was affected by that great disaster. In one morning at Vimy Ridge that number of Canadians were killed in one short battle. The lead up reads:</p>

</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Minister of National Defence had been here, it would have been be very interesting to have asked him this.  If there were a major battle somewhere in the world tomorrow,  could he put together 100,000 Canadians in one battle?  I am sure we would have some problems with the support that the government presently gives the people involved in the forces.</p>

Regular reconnaissance patrols, assisted by information gathered from aerial photography, meant that records of changes to the German defences on the Ridge were always up-to-date. Tunnellers dug subterranean passages under the Ridge - a total of five kilometres in all on four levels - allowing the attacking troops to move close to their jumping-off positions in some safety. Once the battle had begun, these same tunnels allowed the wounded to be brought back under cover and also provided unseen and safe lines of communications.</small></td>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. member picked up from there and  told the rest of the story.  It is a story that showed us how the Canadian forces by uniting, when nobody else could do it,  claimed the ridge. Many of us who know the story of other war battles think of  Beaumont Hamel.  The soldiers who fought that battle were not Canadian then but their sons and daughters are  Canadian now. Newfoundland soldiers went over the top at Beaumont Hamel and many of them, in fact over 80%, were slaughtered. However the battles were won.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vimy Ridge was taken and undoubtedly that was one of the turning points in the first world war.    Members have mentioned that this battle should be remembered but we should also remember the memory of those people. Unfortunately, as we travel the country, many of the shrines that were built, the legion halls, in memory of the people who died for us are becoming dilapidated because it is very hard to get any assistance to  keep them alive.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one thing we should do when we talk about our government programs, whether it be ACOA or HRDC or whatever. We have volunteers or  sons and daughters of    the legionnaires who are still with us trying to preserve these edifices that stand as a testament to them.  These should be the first in a line of programs that we support. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our soldiers did a tremendous amount for us. Let us not forget.</p>

	Mr. Speaker,  at the outset I would like to acknowledge the efforts of my colleague from Algoma—Manitoulin for bringing this matter before the House and in particular the efforts of his constituent, Robert Manuel, who initiated this entire process.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years, hon. members have debated a wide variety of motions and bills tabled by both government and opposition members, all aimed at raising the commemorative profile of Canada's veterans. Most recently our discussions have been concerned with the funding of maintenance and repairs of local cenotaphs.  In that regard, I would draw the attention of the House to Motions Nos. 383 and 384 and the promotion of the observance of two minutes of silence on Remembrance Day, Bill C-297.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I recall correctly, the debate on these two issues expanded into a broader discussion. How we can best honour the memory of those who served and sacrificed their lives for their nation? How  do we preserve and promote their legacy for future generations of Canadians?  In many ways, the discussion on this bill is a continuation of that broader debate.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-409 deals with a very particular day in Canadian military history, April 9, 1917, when the Canadians, fighting as a cohesive unit for the first time in the Great War, fought the enemy at Vimy Ridge and did what no allied force had been able to do. They won, and in so doing affected the outcome of the war and our place on the world stage. In fact, few events in our military history have played such an important role in the development of the Canadian nation as the battle of Vimy Ridge.  It was indeed the first time that all four divisions of the Canadian corps  fought together, but it would not be the last.  Before the war ended, Canadian courage and prowess had won recognition in the Imperial War Cabinet and a seat for Canada at the peace conference at the war's end</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eighty-five  years later, it is  perhaps time to give this battle a particular significance  through the means suggested by Bill C-409, proclaiming April 9 every year as Vimy Ridge Day and lowering  to half-mast the Canadian flag  on the Peace Tower. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are pleased to offer our support to the bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would not want to give the impression with the passage of this bill that  the sacrifices made on a particular day in history are somehow more worthy than those made in any other campaign in any of the wars we have participated in.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also the possibility of setting an unintended precedent.  If Vimy Ridge, which is a specific battle in the first world war, is honoured with its own day, can we expect to receive an increased demand for recognition of days to honour battles from other campaigns and other wars?  If we do, how will we deal with them?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite these cautionary notes, we all acknowledge that there is something quite extraordinary about the action at Vimy, which led to equally extraordinary results for Canada as a nation. The participating battalions  reflected the length and breadth of our country from west to east.  Brigadier-General Ross would later talk of witnessing the birth of a nation.  General Byng described a nation tempered by the fires of that sacrifice.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In dedicating the Vimy Memorial in France in July 1936, King Edward VIII declared “We raise this memorial to Canadian warriors...It marks the scene of feats of arms which history will long remember and Canada can never forget...All the world over there are battlefields, the names of which are written indelibly on the pages of our troubled human story.  It is one of the consolations which time brings that the deeds of valour done on those battlefields long survive the quarrels which drove the opposing hosts to conflict.  Vimy will be one such name.”</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it was then. As it is now. It is with such sentiments, which still ring true, that we can say  the anniversary date of the battle of Vimy Ridge is worthy of its own special recognition, as suggested by the bill.</p>


	<A NAME="T1800"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1800"><!-- Hour: 6--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1805"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1755"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1800)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A second caveat is more technical in nature but important nonetheless. It revolves around the flag lowering part of the bill. It is critical that the protocol we follow in lowering the flag of the Peace Tower of the parliament buildings is no different from the one we use on Remembrance Day. The flag should be flown at half mast from 11 a.m. in the case of Remembrance Day to coincide with the start of the ceremony at the National War Memorial. It should remain   so lowered until sunset.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same provision should apply for a national day of remembrance for Vimy. I am not sure if this should be spelled out in the bill, dealt with by regulation or merely implemented by practice. Whatever the case, I am sure hon. members will agree that the standards for flag lowering for Vimy must not exceed those we use on Remembrance Day.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While these cautionary and common sense thoughts must be borne in mind we in our party are pleased to support Bill C-409. I will close with the words of the Minister of Veterans Affairs at the National War Memorial last April 9 in recognition of the 85th anniversary of the battle of Vimy Ridge. He said:</p>

Their deeds that day ring down through history. Their photos, now faded and yellow with age, still rest on mantels of family members across the nation. But never faded from our history will be their gallant actions. We must never forget the story of Vimy Ridge or the men who fought there. We shall continue to cherish their values of peace, freedom, tolerance and diversity.</small></td>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Battle of Vimy Ridge shall continue to inspire a nation. We will remember them always. Those sentiments say it all. Bill C-409 should be passed by the House.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, there is a conventional historical wisdom that if we do not learn from our history we will be doomed to repeat it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vimy stands out as a profound moment in Canadian history for all the reasons that have been pointed out. However I will add something to the debate.  Until Vimy the frontal attack was the characterization of the way war was fought.  Hundreds and thousands of men and women lost their lives because, as  Marshal Foch said when asked who would win the war, “The side that has the most bullets will win the war”.  It was a question of one casualty, one bullet. The frontal assault, wave after wave with machine guns pumping out bullets, was the way war was fought.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vimy was profoundly important because according to my reading of history it was the first time Canadian troops were commanded by Canadian generals.  The Canadian generals had a different attitude toward the value of their men.  As has been pointed out, they sat  with them, looked at models of Vimy and discussed the manner in which the battle should be fought.  Each and every person from lance corporal or private all the way through the corps knew exactly what the mission was. They knew what they had to do to carry it out both individually and collectively.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The characterization of Vimy in my mind is that it was a time when it became absolutely apparent that life was fundamentally important and that men were more important than bullets or cannon shells. The men had to be taken into the confidence of the generals.  They had to know why they were doing what they were doing and how they would do it together.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This says a lot about how we as Canadians approach battles and wars.  The Minister of National Defence was barraged with questions about why we were not sending our men to Afghanistan. He was asked why we were not doing this or doing that. Whether it was 1917 or 2002 it would be profoundly important to me that the country's generals and leaders be absolutely certain about the conditions they were sending my son or daughter into. That is the Canadian way.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This should be part of the debate about why Vimy is fundamentally important.  Yes, it is fundamentally important. It is the signature of what we were or are as a nation.  However what does that mean?  In today's context when we are trying to carve out our role in the world it means we are still fundamentally accountable for the manner in which we engage our citizens with respect to the critical issues of our times. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is what it means to be a nation. That is what Vimy means to me.  It should be written in the history books so that in our legions and across Canada citizens past and future can know the lessons of history. We must be our own nation, make our own policies and have our own fundamental Canadian values. Such values were instilled at Vimy.</p>

	Mr. Speaker,  I asked the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans a question quite some time ago concerning a boat that landed in Newfoundland with a tremendous amount of fish which by anybody's standards were undersize.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister made it quite clear that the boat  and the crew had not broken any regulations.  To a degree I guess the minister was right. However, what happened when the boat was brought in and the ensuing actions that were taken, or lack thereof, are what concerned everybody associated with the fishery. It should have concerned the minister and his department but they  basically sloughed it off. The minister basically said in the House that what I was saying was not true. We had a little discussion about that later on in the day but the information  put forward was true.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boat had several species, including redfish the size of one's thumb, cod livers in excess of the amount of cod that were involved, and other species that were so small they had to have been caught by undersize gear.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parliamentary secretary will undoubtedly throw into the mix the fact that outside the 200 mile limit there are species   not regulated by NAFO, 3-O redfish being one.  It is load and go and if they can be scooped  up in the capelin seine without getting caught, there is nothing wrong with it.  Even when someone does get caught, nobody can do anything about it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the species were there because of bycatch which  were allowed to be caught because they were unregulated species. Despite that,  there was enough circumstantial evidence   found in that catch to show that the manifest itself was way out of whack regardless of ensuing comments by  the department and the  skipper involved. Anybody knowing anything about fish knew that the boat was breaking the rules on the fishing grounds.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a resource giveaway.  We have heard so much about it certainly in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador.  We are resource rich but  financially poor because we have given away our resources time and again, be they  hydro,  minerals or   forest products.  We have given everybody else a great deal and have received   little from the development of the resources.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is  oil off our coast which at some time will end.  At some time all of the minerals will have been taken out of the ground. If the  forests are protected they will keep on going but they are minimal compared to the rest.   However, we can always have   the fishery  as we have had in the past, if we look after it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the  lack of concern to the giveaways it is impossible to understand the direction the department is taking. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the parliamentary secretary responds  maybe he could clear up the rumour that is floating around that tomorrow or very soon,the minister will announce another giveaway of Newfoundland shrimp to P.E.I. or perhaps others.  Again we have resources with which we should be careful.  If there is an increase it should go to those participating in the fishery who are making meagre incomes. Quite often it is not worth their while to gear up to fish these species.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The department has to be much more cognizant of what is happening in the industry. The committee is creating  awareness.  All we need are the members of the committee to stand on the principles that we brought before the House. Certainly that was not in evidence today.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has to happen.  Canadians must  stand up for Canadians and preserve our resources.  It does not matter what part of the country they come from we should always look after each other because we can be sure no one will look after us.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the member for St. John's West for his continued interest in the issue of foreign overfishing. Since he comes from Newfoundland, we understand his totally legitimate concern, giving the current situation in the fisheries. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first point out that the Canadian government is taking the problem of foreign overfishing very seriously. The recent closure of harbours demonstrates our determination. We have closed our harbours to Faroese and Estonian fleets because they did not comply with NAFO conservation measures.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also pleased to see that Russian authorities have  responded seriously to Canada's concerns by withdrawing for the rest of the year the licence allowing the<i>Olga</i> to fish in the NAFO regulated zone, and indicating that they will make further inquiries into the activities of this boat. In carrying out inspections, Canadian authorities have found that the <i>Matrioska</i> made false statements on its catch of black turbot, and a dock inspection confirmed that an offence had in fact been committed. We expect that the Russian authorities will also take action on this. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This confirms that we are aware of the fact that NAFO may have some problems in terms of control. I think that this issue was discussed on several occasions at the Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans. Nevertheless, we have to admit that there have been some improvements within NAFO. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though we realize that NAFO needs further improvements, we think that it is better to continue to defend Canada's position within NAFO rather than to withdraw, which could make the situation even worse.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This may be where we disagree with our Newfoundland colleagues. I understand that they are saying that overfishing has been going on for a long time and that if we wait any longer, there will not be any fish left. We will not be able to protect the fish because there will be none left. I do not think that withdrawing or unilaterally imposing rules on NAFO will solve the problem, and this is what the minister wants.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a good number of fisheries, the fish are small.  Redfish caught in the 3-O area by  all fleets, including Canada's, both in Canadian waters and outside, are small. Scientists consider the small size of such species when they  do a scientific assessment of stocks. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of the <i>Tynda</i>, the fish landings fully complied with Canadian legislation and with NAFO's conservation measures. As for the other species caught by the <i>Tynda</i>, it was mostly  cod from south of the Grand Banks or the 3N0 cod, and not northern cod.  3NO cod is under  a NAFO moratorium. Under these conservation measures,  a 5% bycatch is permitted. The bycatch caught by the <i>Tynda</i> was well below this limit. It  did not do anything illegal.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to some sources, the cod livers that were found onboard the ship, and my colleague mentioned this earlier, were from cod from south of the Grand Banks. However, it would appear that the cod livers that were found on the <i>Tynda</i> were already there when it stopped in the Newfoundland port on February 14 to fill up.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We may differ in opinion on the source of information. However, I think that there is a common will, particularly among committee members and the minister, to  see to it that additional pressure is brought to bear so that international rules, when there are NAFO agreements, are respected for the welfare of the people of Newfoundland, who need this support.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. parliamentary secretary for responding to my comments. I find it  hard to understand where he is coming from.  He suggested that we not withdraw from NAFO as recommended by the fisheries committee.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My hon. colleague is a  member  of that committee which  submitted a unanimous report to the House.  The main recommendation contained in the report was that we should withdraw from NAFO. Now the member is saying  we should not.  I find that hard to understand. I presume what my colleague is saying  is also what the minister is saying. If that is the case, I am okay with the member but I disagree with his minister.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For 20 years we have gone to NAFO, cap in hand, asking it to recognize what is happening on the nose and tail of the Flemish Cap.  All we have received in return is complete and utter disrespect.  The violations are getting worse.  We have listed more violations over the last few years than previous years, and we are only scratching the tip of the iceberg because of the small amount of surveillance that we have. We must take this issue into our own hands.  We have every right to control that area, and we should do so.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, let me take a few seconds to further explain my position. Concerning the first week of discussions the Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans  had on this, I do not hold this against the hon. member, but he was away on a mission abroad, including in Russia, to deal with issues quite relevant to fisheries. He did not hear my remarks in committee. I said specifically that even if we wanted to impose our regulations beyond the 200 mile limit, it was not practical to do so, internationally.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why I said in committee that we had to have a realistic approach. Having  an approach that cannot be used does not seem to me to be a good way to uphold the interests of Canadians and of Newfoundlanders.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had to make this point to let my colleague know that, if he had been present in committee, and he could not be, he would have understood my position better.</p>
