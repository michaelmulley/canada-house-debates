	The House resumed from September 27 consideration of the 
motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak today on Motion No. 30, sponsored by the 
member for Mississauga South.
<P>
	The motion reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should consider amending the 
Income Tax Act to provide a care giver tax credit for those who provide care in the 
home for preschool children, the disabled, the chronically ill or the aged.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I would like to commend the member for bringing this motion 
forward. The recognition of the problem of unfair tax treatment, in 
particular of families that choose to have one member of the family 
stay at home, is commendable. It is a good thing to bring this 
forward and to talk about it. There are, however, at least three 
questions that I would like to ask the member. I will talk about 
them in my presentation today.
<P>
	The first question is where is the cost benefit analysis, or at least 
an estimate of the cost and the benefits of the changes that this 
motion would bring about and put into law?
<P>
	My second question is why is the government's only response to 
this issue to put in place more taxpayer funded day care? I will talk 
briefly about that in my presentation.
<P>
	The third question I have is that the government of which he is a 
member has been in power for three years now. Why has the 
government not acted on the portion of the motion which would 
bring into place equal tax treatment between families that choose to 
have one parent stay at home to take care of the children and those 
families that choose to hire, either through day care or some other 
place, someone to look after their children while they are at work? 
Why has the government not dealt with this inequity in the tax 
system? Why has it not taken this unfairness out of the system?
<P>
	That is the third question for the member. I will deal with it later 
in my presentation.
<P>
	First, where is the cost benefit analysis? The member for 
Mississauga South, the sponsor of the bill, said in his presentation: 
``The viability of M-30 needs to be assessed, not from a financial 
perspective, but from a balanced perspective, taking into account 
both social and fiscal reality''. I agree with that.
<P>
	How can this member ask me and others to support this motion 
when a cost benefit analysis has not been done? How can we 
possibly support a motion when an estimate of the effect this would 
have on the finances of the country has not been completed?
<P>
	I would suggest that no member of Parliament should, in good 
conscience, vote in favour of a motion like this. We must have a 
cost benefit analysis that is at least accurate enough to give us a ball 
park figure of the costs and the benefits of this motion. The hon. 
member has failed to provide that. I certainly cannot support this 
motion on that basis.
<P>
	Second, why has the government's only response to this issue 
been a promise for more taxpayer funded day care? Of course, this 
promise was made in the red book. It is another one of those 
promises that has not been kept, by the way. In the government's 
tally, 72 per cent or some such thing of its promises have been kept. 
By my tally, 28 to 30 per cent, if someone is generous, have been 
kept. This promise for more spending on day care, which is by the 
way something I do not support, is a promise that has not been kept. 
Canadians should hold the government accountable because it 
made a promise and a promise should be kept.
<P>
<B>(1110)</B>
<P>
	It is one of the things on which the government did campaign. It 
is an issue that was talked about during the campaign. Other 
Reform candidates and I spoke out against this during the election 
campaign while the Liberals spoke out in favour, yet it is certainly 
a promise the government will not be keeping.
<P>
	Why has that been the government's only response, a promise 
which it is not going to keep, but a promise to spend more on 
publicly funded day care? It is not going to solve the problem.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6032"> 6032 </A></B>
<P>
	The third question is the most important. Why has the 
government, of which the member who has sponsored this motion 
has been a part for three years now, not deal with this unfairness 
that he points out is in our tax system. It gives an unfair tax 
advantage to people who pay others to take care of their children.
<P>
	It is not for government to tell people how they are going to care 
for their children. It is important that parents have a choice whether 
they will have their children looked after by someone else while 
they work or if they choose, to have one parent stay at home and 
look after the children without having the tax system punish them 
for making the choice to have one parent stay at home.
<P>
	That is wrong. There is no job in this country, including the job 
of Prime Minister, which is as important as having children very 
well looked after. Studies have shown that it is important for one 
parent, and it does not matter which parent, stay at home with 
children in their younger years. If a family chooses to do that 
because they believe that is their responsibility as a parent, then the 
tax system should not punish them.
<P>
	Reform has said some very specific things in the fresh start 
document which was released on October 17 and has been talking 
about and presenting across the country. This fresh start document 
says that there are two visions of how and what this country can be. 
One vision has been shared by the Liberals and federal 
Conservatives over the past many years. It is a vision of big, very 
expensive government. Higher and higher taxation is necessary to 
support this big government. That taxation has been a job killer and 
has also made it very difficult for parents to support a family with 
only one person working. It is high taxation and high payroll 
deductions that have caused this problem.
<P>
	The other vision, which is the vision that Reform and many 
Canadians share, is a vision of a Canada with a much smaller 
federal government, much less intervention in our lives, and a 
government that would cost less and so would allow less taxation.
<P>
	Our fresh start has three proposals concerning taxation which 
would make it much easier for parents to choose to have one parent 
stay at home with the family. In fact, it would make it easier for 
those parents who choose to have both work and someone else look 
after the children while they are at work.
<P>
	The first proposal which is for all families, whether both parents 
work or not, is an increase in the basic personal exemption amount 
from $6,456 to $7,900. That will lead to a tax reduction for all 
Canadian families. That is important.
<P>
	The second proposal is critical and would deal with the part of 
this motion to do with the unfair tax treatment of families, in terms 
of taking care of children. The second proposal allows for an 
increase in the spousal amount from $5,380 to $7,900. That levels 
the playing field.
<P>
	Furthermore, as part of our commitment to the family, the child 
care deduction of $3,000 to $5,000, which is currently in place and 
it is available only to parents using outsiders to take care of their 
children, will be extended to all parents, whether they choose to 
stay at home with their children or to have someone else look after 
their children. These three proposals would be far more effective in 
dealing with the concern that is expressed in this motion.
<P>
<B>(1115)</B>
<P>
	In conclusion, I would say to Canadians that they do have a 
choice. They have a choice with Reform to make things much 
better for the family with respect to taxation and with respect to 
security through changes in the justice system and other changes. 
With respect to this motion, the proposals that we have put forth in 
our fresh start platform certainly would do a much better job in 
dealing with the issue which is considered by Motion No. 30.
<P>
	Because there is no cost benefit analysis and because our 
proposal would deal with this matter in a much more complete way, 
I personally cannot support the motion.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke-Lakeshore, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I too want to add my voice to the discussion on Private 
Members' Motion No. 30.
<P>
	I am speaking as the mother of two wonderful daughters. I fully 
understand the difficulties many families face when choosing to 
work or to stay at home. This motion will help in making the 
decision easier for families. The efforts of the member for 
Mississauga South will balance the skills of equality between those 
who choose a two income household with the children in daycare 
and those families who choose to designate a parent to care for 
their children in their own home.
<P>
	These proposed changes to the Income Tax Act will ensure that 
families can make the best choice for their needs. The disabled, the 
chronically ill and the aged in the home all deserve caring 
individuals.
<P>
	The motion implies that the Income Tax Act discriminates 
against families who make the choice to provide care at home for 
the categories of people mentioned above. The motion appears to 
target the provision of the Income Tax Act which disallows the 
deduction of child care expenses by one earner couples.
<P>
	In addition to the needs of children, Motion No. 30 considers the 
welfare of families caring for elderly and chronically ill family 
members. Those of us who listen to CBC Ottawa will have heard 
this morning a discussion of an individual who is caring for a 
parent who suffers from Alzheimer's disease. They noted the cost 
of care and the need that there is, especially in this day and age 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6033"> 6033 </A></B>
<P>
when so many people are living longer and having  ailments which 
deserve the care and nurture of family members.
<P>
	Families with disabled family members face the greatest 
challenge of all. In these cases a lifelong commitment is required, 
not simply the assistance of family at the dawn or the sunset years 
of a family member. These families face a continual challenge to 
help a family member overcome their disability and to live a happy 
and productive life in Canada.
<P>
	What is good about Motion No. 30 is that it says that the 
government can help without creating a big, expensive 
bureaucratic institution or program. With a few small additions and 
changes to the Income Tax Act, this motion would empower 
individuals to choose the best way to both work and care for their 
families.
<P>
	The motion creates a policy that would recognize the value of 
work at home, provides more options for direct parental care, eases 
the demand for long term care and child care facilities, promotes 
work opportunities, promotes financial independence in the home 
and encourages a better quality of life for families.
<P>
	I want to speak about some of the things the government is 
presently doing which will connect nicely with the intent of this 
motion.
<P>
<B>(1120 )</B>
<P>
	The child care expense deduction helps parents who have modest 
incomes with child care expenses which they incur while earning 
income, attending school full time or taking an eligible vocational 
training course.
<P>
	The child care benefit supplement is another program which 
helps parents who choose to remain in the home to raise preschool 
children. This year it is $213 for each child six years of age or 
younger. This is in addition to the regular benefit of $1,020 for each 
child.
<P>
	There is also the working income supplement which helps low 
income working class families meet some of the extra costs 
relating to employment income, for example, child care and 
transportation to and from work. This relates to a non-taxable 
benefit of up to $500. Changes introduced in our 1996 budget will 
double the supplement to $1,000 by 1998. This will increase 
benefits to more than 700,000 working families by an average of 
$350 a year. While the working income supplement is available to 
two income families, it is also available to single earner families 
where one spouse stays at home as a caregiver.
<P>
	It is important to note that this motion takes into consideration 
the needs, the care and the availability for individuals to stay at 
home and provide that care and to use the tax system as an 
incentive and as a way to encourage the nurturing and give support 
to families who need the supplement.
<P>
	As indicated in the budget presented to the House on March 6, 
1996 the WIS or the income supplement will provide maximum 
annual benefit increases that will range from $500 to $715 in July 
1997 to $1,000 in July 1998.
<P>
	The motion suggests tax assistance should be made available to 
families that provide in home care for elderly relatives or relatives 
with disabilities. Again tax assistance for people with disabilities 
and for the families caring for elderly or disabled relatives at home 
is provided by a number of existing tax measures.
<P>
	I could go on to delineate the tax measures but I support the 
intent of the motion, that as a community and as Canadians we 
need to care about, think about and ensure that for individuals who 
give the care and nurturing in the home for preschoolers, people 
with disabilities and other groups that need specific care by their 
families that there is included in the tax system the necessary 
incentives and benefits.
<P>
	We can argue the notion that the income tax system and the way 
it should operate and the projections as to the impact on our budget 
needs to be taken into consideration. It is too bad that somehow 
delineating the cost of the program was not indicated in terms of 
the impact on our 1997 budget.
<P>
	There are good intentions in the motion put forward by the 
member in the care for Canadian families. I will support the intent 
of the motion and encourage that we find the ways and means by 
which we can attend to this motion in our ongoing consultations on 
what we need to do for Canadian families.
<P>
	I stand in support of the motion.
<P>
<B>(1125)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
participate in this debate on the motion put forward by the hon. 
member for Mississauga South, whom I know well as we both sit 
on the Standing Committee on Health. I have often had discussions 
with him and I know that he is a kindhearted man. This is not the 
kind of motion that can be rejected out of hand.
<P>
	I say this with certain reservations, however. The motion could 
not be approved without any amendments either, as it may involve 
changes to programs.
<P>
	Our listeners must realize that the federal government, and the 
provinces as well, may decide to go one of two ways. The first and 
more familiar one is through programs, by providing grants, 
funding public services or supporting quasi-public services for 
seniors, families and so forth, but always through funding. This is 
often the budget item that attracts the most attention.
<P>
	What the hon. member for Mississauga South is proposing today 
is a tax credit for those who provide care in the home for preschool 
children, the disabled, or the aged. There is nothing wrong with 
that.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6034"> 6034 </A></B>
<P>
	Of course the federal and provincial governments alike should 
help these people, especially if they are using incentives, a 
positive approach instead of creating obligations. Only those who 
can, and really have the means to do so, provide such care. It is 
proposed to provide tax credits, which means giving a little more 
to those who give their time to improve the well-being of 
preschool children or persons who have become incapacitated.
<P>
	I would like to focus on the disabled. I imagine most members 
have organizations dedicated to the disabled in their ridings. In my 
riding, there is one that has been around for many years-I even 
worked for them before getting elected-and its goal is to help the 
disabled get integrated into society or at least ensure that they live 
at home instead of being institutionalized.
<P>
	This involves some support from either close family members or 
anyone willing to help, be it out of friendship or kindheartedness. 
They need someone to provide some support.
<P>
	The same could be said about the aged. For some years now, it 
has been the policy, in Quebec at least, to help the aged, even those 
who are progressively more incapacitated, live at home as long as 
possible. To this end, they are provided with access to home care 
and other services. But despite these efforts, all their needs are not 
met, and that is where a family member can make a valuable 
contribution.
<P>
	Let us also take a look at the consequences of the move toward 
ambulatory care. In Quebec, some families are hit harder than 
before in the sense that limiting hospital stays acts as an incentive 
to let the patient go home as quickly as possible, but there has to be 
someone to give them a hand after they leave the hospital.
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
	So, the period in question can be very short, but it can also be 
rather long. Therefore, the tax credit formula suggested by the hon. 
member deserves consideration. Indeed, when a person requires 
regular care over a period of a few months, but only for an hour or 
two per day, we should encourage people to provide such care at 
home, instead of taking the person to the hospital.
<P>
	However, this solution poses a number of problems, and the hon. 
member for Joliette mentioned some of them at the beginning of 
the debate. We do have some reservations and concerns. Should the 
government accept the proposal made by one of its members, 
would it result in an attempt to make a change? We do not want to 
sound overly distrustful but, given this government's pattern in its 
attempts to make changes, we have learned to become distrustful of 
these attempts, and for good reason.
<P>
	Does it mean that some expenditures should be eliminated at the 
same time? This is unfortunately the case. I am referring to the 
transfers to the provinces, more specifically to the new Canada 
social transfer, which we have been hearing about since last year. 
All the moneys paid to the provinces for health, post-secondary 
education and social assistance now come out of this single fund. 
All these sectors have been grouped together, However, the 
government took this opportunity to significantly reduce the 
amounts transferred. In the case of Quebec, the shortfall will total 
billions of dollars. Those who are watching us are very familiar 
with the process: the federal government targets our provincial 
government, which then has no choice but to make cuts, including 
in the health sector. Indeed, people must realize that such cuts are 
the result of a reduction in transfer payments.
<P>
	Personally, I would find it hypocritical on the federal 
government's part to suddenly be generous by granting more tax 
deductions and credits to caregivers if, at the same time, it kept 
making cuts in transfers to the provinces. These things must be 
explained to our fellow citizens. My three years in this House have 
taught me to be suspicious and critical of the government's actions, 
which is the role of the official opposition.
<P>
	I know the hon. member who tabled the motion. He is a very 
generous person. I also know the hon. member who spoke before 
me, and I realize that government members have good intentions. 
However, what would the government do with such a motion? 
Would it use it as encouragement to continue making cuts in 
transfers to the provinces, cuts that affect precisely those people 
whom the hon. member for Mississauga South wants to help? 
These are the reservations I have.
<P>
	As for the member's intentions and the value of his proposal, one 
cannot oppose such a positive approach, whereby ordinary 
members of society, that is people close to a sick person, would 
look after this person. In fact, we must encourage it.
<P>
	Since my time is running out, I will conclude by underscoring 
this point. I do not want my speech to be interpreted as an 
unconditional acceptance of a change that would reinforce the 
government's tendency to impose cuts on the provinces, while 
maintaining very strict conditions, including the five conditions 
relating to health.
<P>
	Given these conditions, provincial governments are forced to cut 
into the health care sector, which is high profile, while the federal 
government, through a tax deduction and credit system, would do 
just the opposite. This seems hypocritical and unacceptable.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
want to express my support for the intent of Motion No. 30. I am 
pleased to see an initiative to support the family coming from the 
other side of the House. It is support to increase personal freedom 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6035"> 6035 </A></B>
<P>
and  choice and to recognize the importance of allowing 
individuals to exercise responsibility over their own affairs.
<P>
	To remind the House, Motion No. 30 reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should consider amending the 
Income Tax Act to provide a caregiver tax credit for those who provide care in the 
home for preschool children, the disabled, the chronically ill or the aged.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	One of the most important effects of this motion is its impact on 
child care. The present tax situation discriminates against parents 
who choose to stay at home with their children. We in the Reform 
Party believe that the care of children falls within the domain of 
families and that parents must have full responsibility in Canadian 
society to nurture and provide for children.
<P>
	Current federal government programs are intrusive and restrict 
the choices that parents may make in deciding on the best type of 
care for their children. The role of government, on the other hand, 
is to provide a fair tax and benefit system that provides parents with 
the opportunity to properly care for their children in the manner of 
their choosing.
<P>
	Unfortunately this motion's sponsor was right when he predicted 
that his colleagues would stand up and declare that their paltry 
subsidies to stay at home parents are sufficient. This statement in 
and of itself is ridiculous. It is even more shameful when placed in 
contrast to the amount of provision made available to parents who 
place their children in day care.
<P>
	Parents are very frustrated today in that they would like to spend 
more time with their children but they cannot. One of the reasons is 
that they cannot afford to have one parent stay at home with the 
children because they need two incomes to survive.
<P>
	An Angus Reid survey indicated that 45 per cent of women and 
55 per cent of men were in agreement with the question that if they 
could afford to, they would stay at home with their children. 
Furthermore, 57 per cent of parents with younger children said they 
would work primarily to make ends meet and would stay at home if 
they could.
<P>
	In the same survey, 25 per cent of women and 24 per cent of men 
agreed with the statement: ``I feel guilty about the amount of time I 
spend at work away from my kids''. Among parents with children 
under 12, the proportion who agree with this statement rises to 32 
per cent. Twenty-five per cent of women and twenty-two per cent 
of men agreed with the statement: ``I am too tired when I get home 
to spend quality time with the kids''.
<P>
	Our children are our future, the future of this country, and here 
we have parents lamenting about the opportunities lost for 
spending time with their kids. This government has recognized it. 
The member for Mississauga South has certainly analysed the tax 
system and his statement is clear: ``What is worse is that a  
deduction is worth more to a high income earner than a low income 
earner. For example, someone who makes $60,000 a year and pays 
$5,000 for child care space receives a refund cheque from the 
government for $2,600. However, if someone makes only $30,000 
and incurs the same $5,000 cost, their refund is only $1,800. That is 
an $800 difference when both taxpayers incurred the same expense 
for child care costs''.
<P>
<B>(1140)</B>
<P>
	In other words, I gather the intent from this member's motion 
was to alleviate the tax burden of the stay at home parents. He 
recognizes it but not everyone on that side of the House does.
<P>
	Whether this inequity was set up intentionally to discriminate 
against parents who choose to provide home care is irrelevant. It 
exists. The fact is it does discriminate. Despite evidence of this, the 
government has made no effort to develop a policy that treats all 
families equally, affording them the independence and freedom of 
choice they desire in areas of legitimate concern.
<P>
	We are hearing more and more of those concerns all the time on 
the social side, parents lamenting about not being able to spend that 
time with their children.
<P>
	It is imperative that this discrimination be ended. I would 
encourage all parliamentarians to do this by endorsing, to some 
degree, this motion. It should have some amendments to it. They 
should endorse this motion or one similar.
<P>
	The same sort of discrimination occurs in the provision of care 
for the elderly and the infirm. Once again, the government claims 
to have a system in place that is sufficient for helping families that 
want to care for their ailing members at home.
<P>
	Despite the fact that even for pragmatic economic reasons, 
Canadian governments are moving in the direction of encouraging 
more home care options, there is no evidence that the federal 
Liberals are planning to adjust the tax system to make home care an 
economically viable option for individual Canadian families. It is 
just not in the cards with this Liberal government.
<P>
	According to the government, the infirm dependent credit which 
can generate savings of up to $400 or $8 a week is sufficient to help 
the average Canadian family know its choice to care for elderly 
parents at home is not being subject to financial discrimination or 
penalty.
<P>
	That is a paltry amount when we look at the costs of home care 
and the cost to the federal government or provincial governments, 
even local governments, to care for the elderly. There should be 
greater consideration given to those people who want to look after 
their elderly parents at home through a tax break. That is not 
happening.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6036"> 6036 </A></B>
<P>
	According to the government, the present circumstances 
surrounding the medical expenses credit do not require changing. 
This is in addition to the medical expenses to the home care 
provisions.
<P>
	The 17 per cent credit for expenses in excess of the lesser of 3 
per cent of the net income is available to all Canadians, but for 
those who have employer paid health plans this benefit can be 
added to cover uninsured costs, while most Canadians have to get 
by on this paltry credit alone.
<P>
	In other words, for those who have a government health care 
program or a group health care program through one of their 
businesses compared to those who do not, the ones who have a 
group health care plan of course benefit from this and those who do 
not really have to foot the bill themselves. I do not think that has 
been covered adequately by not only government but by the health 
plans available right now.
<P>
	Having expressed support in principle for the motion, I want to 
state clearly the need for far more tax reform than the cut and paste 
approach the present system is bound to.
<P>
	The Reform Party has committed itself to real substantive tax 
reform in the form of a simple, flat and visible tax. This system will 
do away with the gross inequities that are part of the present 
system, including discrimination against home care, of preschool 
children and the disabled and elderly.
<P>
	The member for Vegreville pointed out some of those tax breaks. 
I do not believe I have to repeat them.
<P>
	Reform's final flat tax policy will start with a sizeable personal 
tax credit that will protect a larger number of low income 
individuals from income taxes. An additional credit will be 
provided for each child. We want to move that credit up from 
$3,000 to $5,000.
<P>
<B>(1145)</B>
<P>
	Reform is the only federal party today which offers a 
comprehensive fiscal alternative to the discriminatory priorities of 
the present government which clearly has no regard for millions of 
Canadian families struggling under the economic burden that is 
growing under this Liberal administration. We want to work in 
partnership with the Canadian taxpayer. That is what governments 
should do. That partnership involves providing tax relief to all 
taxpayers.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> As it would appear there are no further 
members who wish to speak, under our rules the hon. member for 
Mississauga South may sum up the debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want 
to thank all hon. members who over the last few months as we have 
had private members debate on Motion M-30 have taken the 
opportunity to discuss the motion. The motion says that we should 
consider the advisability of amending the Income Tax Act to 
provide a caregiver tax credit to those who provide care in the 
home to preschool children, the chronically ill, the aged or the 
disabled. I am very gratified that so many members spoke in favour 
of this motion.
<P>
	I want to comment briefly on the position articulated by one 
member on the concern about the costs of such a change. The 
member has raised an excellent point.
<P>
	We must always assume that there is no new money to be spent 
on new benefits or across the board tax cuts or anything like that. 
But it is incumbent on the government to look at other ways to fund 
perhaps by consolidating other tax benefits to create this caregiver 
tax credit.
<P>
	I would use as an example what was done with the seniors 
benefit which is a consolidation of the old age security and the GIS 
brought into a new credit, a new benefit for seniors outside the tax 
system. It is funded by the former envelope for OAS and GIS. I see 
that as a parallel which may be an opportunity.
<P>
	A number of members have raised the issue about how do we get 
the money. I could give a couple of examples. The previous speaker 
talked very briefly and quoted me with regard to the child care 
expense deduction. If we converted that deduction to a tax credit 
and also made it subject to an income test, that would generate 
approximately $400 million in savings to the government.
<P>
	There is the spousal non-refundable tax credit which is available 
to all where one spouse is working and one is not but it is not 
subject to having any children. If we were talking about using our 
limited resources to apply for those who really have need or are 
investing in children, having those funds diverted to being part of 
this new caregiver tax credit certainly would be an option. That 
would generate $1.2 billion of additional funding for the caregiver 
tax credit.
<P>
	The final item I would give as an example is the equivalent to 
spouse non-refundable tax credit. This is a benefit to families 
which split up. Not only do two adults get the credit but one of the 
children can be elevated to the adult status for a third credit. In my 
view it benefits families that split apart rather than those that stay 
together. If we were to rethink these kinds of things we would find 
it would generate a savings of somewhere around $200 million.
<P>
	In total those items which I have simply talked about right now 
generate somewhere upward of $2 billion of funding that could be 
directed toward the caregiver tax credit.
<P>
	This being a private member's motion, I remind all hon. 
members that it is not encumbering the government to do anything. 
A private member's motion is simply to ask the House to consider 
the advisability of looking at this and possibly some funding 
sources.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="6037"> 6037 </A></B>
<P>
	I will conclude by quoting the wife of the President of the 
United States who I thought had a very interesting comment. She 
said that we can talk about family values all we want but would 
it not be better if we looked for ways to have legislative initiatives 
that would value families.
<P>
	I thank all hon. members for participating in this debate on a 
family issue, something that is very near to me. I ask hon. members 
for their support in making Motion M-30 an issue which the 
government should give some consideration to.

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``orders for child support, including guidelines''</BLOCKQUOTE>
	She said: Mr. Speaker, the amendment proposed by the Bloc 
Quebecois has in mind the very specific context where the parents 
who are divorcing no longer live in the same province at the time 
an application for a child support order is made to the court.
<P>
	Why did we present this motion? We did so because the solution 
put forward by the Minister of Justice for determining which grid 
will apply in these cases does not strike us as the best one. The 
minister is proposing that the court use the federal grid in such a 
case.
<P>
<B>(1205)</B>
<P>
	In our opinion, however, the federal grid is inadequate because it 
makes no allowance for provincial transfer payments to families. 
The Quebec grid, on the other hand, was developed by the level of 
government closest to families, the one that sets family and social 
policy, the one that determines tax policy, the one that looks after 
day care, income security programs, family assistance programs, 
health programs, and I could go on.
<P>
	In Quebec, as in other provinces, government policies result in 
transfer payments to individuals and families. However, since the 
government approach reflects a certain vision of society, transfer 
payments made by the Quebec government differ from those made 
by other provinces.
<P>
	Accordingly, since the federal grid takes income tax alone into 
account, the amounts set out in its grid of payment levels will 
undoubtedly differ from those in a provincial grid. Therefore, if the 
federal grid is applied to parents of children living in Quebec, for 
example, the whole process is distorted.
<P>
	In addition to skewing the child support system, the imposition 
of the federal grid in cases where parents are not living in the same 
province will lead to an unfair situation within a province. What 
justification can there be for the fact that all children within a 
province will not be entitled to the same treatment, simply because 
the non-custodial parent is living in another province?
<P>
	Perhaps the minister thinks the other provinces in Canada will go 
along with the proposed grid. We have no intention of doing so. 
However, the minister must keep his word and respect the spirit of 
his bill. If, as he says, he really means to recognize provincial grids 
at some future point, he must therefore agree to uniformity within 
the provinces first. He must not impose his grid on a parent paying 
support who does not reside in the same province as his child.
<P>
	I would also like to emphasize that the custodial parent, usually 
the mother, generally changes place of residence less often than the 
father.
<P>
	Thus, in order to respect provincial autonomy, and to ensure that 
children in the same territory are treated uniformly and their 
economic stability respected, it is  very important that the grid to be 
applied be the one drawn up by the province in which the child 
resides, regardless of the place of residence of the paying parent. 
This is a matter of justice.
<P>
	Moving on immediately to Motion no. 2, I will try to explain it to 
our audience. This is a very important motion, because it reveals 
the specific intentions of the federal government concerning the 
possibility of recognizing the guidelines drawn up by the 
provinces.
<P>
	The word ``may'' confers upon the government virtually 
absolute discretionary power. I say ``virtually absolute'' because, 
as Professor Garant has stated, ``the courts have invariably decided 
that discretionary power is never absolute''. The Canada 
Interpretation Act, which applies to all legislation passed by the 
Canadian Parliament, stipulates in section 11 the difference 
between ``shall'' and ``may''. I quote: ``The expression `shall' is to 
be construed as imperative and the expression `may' as 
permissive''.
<P>
	I would point out that, in this case, the verb used in clause 1(4) of 
the bill is ``may''. The clarification of the Minister of Justice's 
intentions, which he offered during testimony before the committee 
is most revealing: ``The creation of guidelines for child support is 
something new for the Government of Canada. This is the first time 
we have done this. It is difficult to predict all of the questions that 
will arise in future. We have, therefore, used the words that were in 
the clauses before the Committee, in order to allow the government 
some degree of flexibility''.
<P>
	It is obvious, furthermore, that, despite the fact that it says it will 
recognize the provincial guidelines, the government is not too keen 
on the idea, and I again quote the Minister of Justice: ``It is the 
government's objective to have a national system, a uniform 
system. The trouble with the present system is that it is 
unpredictable. So generally speaking, we want the system for 
determining child support payments to be predictable, uniform and 
national. The government acknowledges that individual provinces 
may wish to establish the amounts and the guidelines, but it is 
important for the national objective to have some degree of 
uniformity''.
<P>
<B>(1210)</B>
<P>
	Clear and specific. To avoid upsetting the provinces by invading 
the jurisdiction they have over family matters, the government 
says: ``If have your own guidelines, we will respect them''. 
However, at the same time the government says in the legislation 
that it will decide whether and when it will recognize provincial 
guidelines. I believe there is some contradiction here.
<P>
	We do not go along with this proposal. We want the minister to 
recognize clearly the expertise of the provinces in this area and to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6039"> 6039 </A></B>
<P>
leave it all up to those provinces who take the initiative to develop 
their own guidelines. You cannot have both, that is impossible.
<P>
	The problem with all this is that the government knows perfectly 
well that the guidelines it is about to adopt will also be used 
unofficially in cases that come under the jurisdiction of the 
provinces, which is somewhat embarrassing for a government that 
keeps talking about the flexibility of the federal system and its 
intention to decentralize. There is only one honest and acceptable 
solution to this problem: let the government accept our amendment 
and promise to recognize the guidelines that are adopted by the 
provinces. That is what we want to see happen.
<P>
	On Motion No. 12: the words ``but without limiting the 
generality of the foregoing'' should be deleted in clause 11 of the 
bill. This clause creates a new section in the Divorce Act, a section 
that lists the criteria to be met by the provinces if they want the 
federal government to recognize their own guidelines.
<P>
	Why do we want this deletion? The answer is quite simple. Here 
again, the federal government is trying to establish discretionary 
powers. In fact, it is telling the provinces that it may recognize their 
guidelines, provided they meet the criteria set in section 26.1, but it 
also says, with the words we want deleted, that these criteria may 
change without prior notice and, above all, that there may be other 
requirements that are not specifically provided in the legislation.
<P>
	This is unacceptable. Why should a province rely on some future 
recognition of its guidelines if at the same time the government 
reserves the right to change at any time the criteria for such 
recognition? How can a provincial government do any proper 
planning when it does not know what the federal government is 
going to do? This is a cat and mouse game.
<P>
	The rule of thumb for legislation should be clarity: the terms, the 
objectives and the consequences of non-compliance should all be 
crystal clear. Clause 26.1 the government is proposing is not clear, 
anything but.
<P>
	To show its good faith, the government should clearly set the 
rules of the game. Obviously, the words ``but without limiting the 
generality of the foregoing'' must be deleted from the text of the 
final version of the bill. I hope my government colleagues will 
accept my amendment.
<P>
	There is still Motion No. 3. The purpose of this motion is to 
protect provinces that adopt their own guidelines, once these 
guidelines have been recognized by the government.
<P>
	This motion specifies that once they have been recognized by 
order in council, the guidelines of a province cannot be revoked by 
an act of Parliament or by any provision of this legislation.
<P>
	It was also quite clear from the minister's testimony that the 
minister was somewhat uncomfortable with the idea that provincial
<P>
rates might differ from the federal rates. He did not like this idea at 
all, to say the least.
<P>
	Bearing this in mind, we ask that the bill include a clause that 
would guarantee the continued recognition of a province's 
guidelines, once those guidelines have been recognized for the first 
time.
<P>
	Quebec is about to adopt its own guidelines. The process leading 
up to this legislation has been a long one. The Quebec government 
held extensive consultations with stakeholders. It also had to align 
this new legislation with its policies in the works and its vision of 
where it should be going in terms of family policy.
<P>
<B>(1215)</B>
<P>
	What we are asking the government is to respect the will of the 
provinces, and this bill is a case in point. Since the Quebec 
government has just reviewed its own guidelines, I see no other 
choice for the federal government but to accept and respect the 
work done by the provinces, including Quebec in this case.
<P>
	As you know, we must be careful to avoid overlap and 
duplication in this area.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to speak to the first group of 
proposed amendments to Bill C-41. I will speak briefly to the four 
motions we are presently discussing which have been submitted by 
the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
	We have five groups of amendments to discuss. Although some 
amendments were put forward in my name, they were really 
drafted by the hon. member for Mission-Coquitlam. She has done 
an incredible amount of work dealing with this bill. She has 
analysed it and gone through it with a fine tooth comb. She has 
worked to try to better the bill on behalf of Canadians. I want to pay 
tribute to her.
<P>
	Motion No. 1 deals with designating the applicable provincial 
law should both spouses or former spouses not be resident in the 
same province at the time the application for the child support 
order is made. Under the amendment the applicable law would be 
that of the province where the child is ordinarily a resident.
<P>
	The second part of the amendment put forward by the hon. 
member from the Bloc states that if there is more than one child of 
the marriage and they live in different provinces, then the federal 
guidelines would apply.
<P>
	I feel the amendments fill a hole in the bill as they describe 
situations that are left out of the bill in its present form. Therefore, 
my view is that Reform will be supporting this motion.
<P>
	Motion No. 2 which was also put forward by the Bloc changes 
the word ``may'' to ``shall'' to make it  obligatory that the governor 
in council designate a province for the purposes of the designation 
of applicable guidelines as set out in the bill. This amendment also 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6040"> 6040 </A></B>
<P>
makes sense. It should not be discretionary which provincial laws 
apply for enforcement.
<P>
	Motion No. 3 seeks to establish that the federal guidelines will 
not apply in a province where there are provincial guidelines for 
payment of support. We feel that it is very necessary to have 
national guidelines. They should be established and at least be 
present to be reviewed by the court in addition to any provincial 
guidelines. In light of that we will be opposing Motion No. 3.
<P>
	Motion No. 12 limits the power of the governor in council so that 
in making the guidelines the governor in council can only take into 
consideration the matters raised in paragraphs (a) through (h). We 
will be soon be debating Motion No. 4, a Reform amendment. We 
feel the government has this whole issue backwards as far as 
whether the court looks at the guidelines first and then looks at 
extenuating circumstances surrounding the case. We believe it 
should be the other way around.
<P>
<B>(1220 )</B>
<P>
	Reform opposes the amendments as we feel that they support 
what is already contained in the bill and would allow the guidelines 
to be used first, rather than see the court look at extenuating 
circumstances such as the ability of the non-custodial parent to pay 
and other issues that may arise. That sums up my comments on 
group No. 1 amendments as put forward by the Bloc Quebecois.

	He said: Mr. Speaker, I rise to address the amendments put 
forward by the opposition parties to Bill C-41.
<P>
	My comments are confined to the amendments in group No. 2 
put forward by the Reform Party. I note that of the eight 
amendments that have been grouped together in Group 2, six of the 
eight have been put forward by the Reform and two by the Bloc.
<P>
	Motion No. 4 establishes an order of priority so that the court 
will look first at the needs of the child and the ability of the 
non-custodial parent to pay and then at the applicable guidelines 
for child support.
<P>
	During remarks made at second reading on Bill C-41 by my hon. 
colleague for Mission-Coquitlam, she elaborated on why we view 
this as so important. We feel there is a need to look at the best 
interests of the child or children involved rather than just make 
arbitrary decisions based on the guidelines.
<P>
<B>(1225 )</B>
<P>
	In speaking to this bill, as a number of us have already, we have 
clearly endeavoured to be advocates for the children. We are not 
trying to pick sides, either on the side of the custodial parents, or 
non-custodial parents, or mothers versus fathers. Heaven knows 
enough of that already exists in the present system of dealing with 
divorce.
<P>
	The real purpose of putting forward these amendments to try to 
better the bill is to see that the interests of the child or children are 
paramount.
<P>
	While we recognize the need to have guidelines to direct and to 
guide the judgments levied in these types of cases, it does not make 
a whole lot of sense if we do not look at the ability of the 
non-custodial parent to pay. It  really does not matter what the 
support level is set at if the father, who it is in a predominant 
amount of time, is unable to meet that commitment.
<P>
	Motion No. 5 is consequential to Motion No. 4. It is a means for 
us to amend the bill to allow for Motion No. 4 if it was to be passed.
<P>
	I will move on to Motions Nos. 7 and 8. The bill was written 
when looking at awarding child support. The court is supposed to 
take into consideration and apply the guideline when awarding 
spousal support. The Reform Party believes that the court should 
look first at the abilities of the parties to pay for the welfare of the 
child and if it needs to look elsewhere, then go to the guidelines. 
Basically Motion No. 7 follows along the same lines as Motions 
Nos. 4 and 5. Again, dealing with child support, we want the court 
to look first at the party's ability to pay and the needs of the child.
<P>
	The government should be legislating in the best interests of 
people. If the court needs further evidence after looking at ability to 
pay and the welfare of the child, then the court could look to the 
guidelines and apply them if necessary.
<P>
	That basically deals with Motions Nos. 7 and 8. Motion No. 8 is 
consequential to Motion No. 7, similar to the way in which Motion 
No. 5 is to Motion No. 4.
<P>
	I will move on to the other two amendments put forward by 
Reform in this grouping, that is, Motion No. 10 and Motion No. 11. 
I know this gets quite complicated. Motion No. 10 is consequential 
to Motion No. 4. It refers back to that subsection.
<P>
	The governor in council establishes the guidelines, which are the 
main focus of the bill. In establishing these guidelines, the 
governor in council is to take into consideration a number of 
matters. Most important in the list of matters that must be taken 
into consideration in the eyes of the Reform Party is the ability to 
pay and the needs of the child. This amendment, therefore, restricts 
the governor in council in that in making guidelines, the paramount 
interests should be the needs of the child and ability to pay.
<P>
	I know I am repeating myself in referring to all these motions. It 
really comes down to the central focus to which we are trying to 
direct the government, rather than just bring down these arbitrary 
guidelines. We want the courts to look at other considerations, to 
have that as part and parcel of the bill rather than exclude them.
<P>
	Motion No. 11 refers to the same section found on page 13 of the 
bill. It refers back to a different section, section 17(6.1) which deals 
with variation order. The governor in council under this bill does 
establish the guidelines for spousal support as well as child 
support. Therefore we want to ensure that were Motion No. 7 to 
pass the courts address all the concerns that would be presented at 
the time of the case rather than, as I said earlier, to arbitrarily bring 
forth the guidelines.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6042"> 6042 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1230)</B>
<P>
	Motion No. 11 is consequential to Motion No. 7 in the same way 
in which Motion No. 10 is to our Motion No. 4.
<P>
	Perhaps to summarize why there is this need to bring forward 
these numbers of amendments that we have brought forward that 
are grouped into Group No. 2, I would like to make a couple of 
points. If one were to compare the Notice Paper or the Order Paper 
from Friday with today's, one would note that there were two 
amendments brought forward by the Bloc Quebecois obviously at 
the eleventh hour. One would have to question how that is when we 
already understood all the orders and the motion numbers, trying to 
understand exactly how they are all going to fit together, were they 
to pass, and change the bill. We have to wonder how serious the 
Bloc is about putting forward amendments to this piece of 
legislation.
<P>
	In dealing with Bill C-41, the government has once again taken 
the easy route of dealing with the support payments. We have tried 
to make the point during debate on this bill already that we are 
concerned this simply is not a comprehensive look at the whole 
issue surrounding divorce.
<P>
	The justice minister has promised for some time now that he 
would be bringing forward comprehensive legislation. We are not 
suggesting that it would have to be included in one omnibus bill. 
Heaven knows there have been times in the past when we have been 
quite critical of the government for trying to lump too much into 
one bill. But we have not seen any indication from the government 
other than vague promises by the justice minister that he will 
indeed be bringing forward legislation to address the other side of 
the equation which is dealing with perhaps mandatory mediation 
prior to the disputing couple's ending up in court and a bigger issue 
of access and custody.
<P>
	I have brought forward a private member's bill, Bill C-242, 
which would endeavour to bring into effect joint custody being the 
rule instead of the exception. Very clearly we can look at statistics 
and we can see that the whole business of the ability and the 
willingness of non-custodial parents to pay their child support 
payments is contingent on access to their children.
<P>
	As access increases and shared custody increases for the 
non-custodial parent, then equally so statistics show that 
willingness to pay that support also increases.
<P>
	The hon. member for Mission-Coquitlam, when she brought 
forward a private member's bill dealing with grandparents' rights 
and the need to have grandparents have access to the courts during 
divorce proceedings, once again she was looking at what is in the 
best interest of the children. That is what we are dealing with here.
<P>
	At that time she was told by the justice minister that the reason 
that the government voted that down was the government would be 
bringing in more comprehensive legislation.
<P>
<B>(1235 )</B>
<P>
	Despite our best efforts to amend the bill by bringing in a 
number of amendments which are in all five of the groups, what we 
perceive is a general unwillingness on the part of the government to 
look at the other side. It seems to be totally focused on something 
which is a quick fix, something which would be the easiest to 
address, to get tough with fathers who are unwilling to meet their 
obligations and who in many cases are unable to make their 
payments.
<P>
	As we have pointed out in our speeches, the simple fact of the 
matter is in many cases when the non-custodial parent, usually the 
father, withholds support payments it is simply because it is the 
only to get back at the fact that they do not have access to their 
children. I believe that the government is really missing the boat by 
not addressing the whole issue by not bringing forward companion 
legislation so that the opposition parties and Canadians can view 
the entire package rather than just piecemeal, which is easier.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, for the benefit of Canadians who are watching this debate 
on television, we are dealing with amendment at report stage of 
deliberations. That means the bill has gone to committee and was 
returned to the House with recommendations. We are now debating 
the recommendations from the various parties to alter the bill. 
These changes are grouped in blocks for ease of voting and also to 
ensure that in our speeches we address the topic at hand.
<P>
	The group of amendments we are speaking to now has to do with 
maintenance and a grid which was established by the federal 
government. For instance, someone who is living in Alberta and 
has an income of $35,000, with one child, would be paying $314 
per month; $520 for two children; $685 for three; $820 for four 
children, and so on. It established a guideline, which begs the 
question that if that is the minimum payment, what is the 
maximum. There are no maximums; there are merely minimum 
payment guidelines.
<P>
	The guidelines vary from province to province. They do not vary 
a great deal, but they do vary. Some of these amendments speak to 
the variance.
<P>
	However, I would like to speak in general terms to the notion of a 
guideline and what is likely going to happen in the case of the strict 
application of guidelines. I would like to ask whether the 
guidelines are going to have the initial beneficial intent.
<P>
	When the guidelines were first introduced I thought they were a 
good idea. Many members know through previous debates that I 
have some experience in these  matters. It is not something I am 
proud of but I have some considerable experience. It has been my 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6043"> 6043 </A></B>
<P>
experience that no amount of legislation will ever replace common 
sense. If parents are divorcing, are bitter and fighting, no amount of 
legislation will impose common sense on them.
<P>
	We cannot accomplish through legislation what cannot be done 
through goodwill on the part of both parents and extended families.
<P>
	I thought the notion of guidelines was not a bad idea. I was quite 
surprised when I investigated this further, particularly in my 
constituency when I held a town hall meeting attended by 
approximately 200 people. The new Divorce Act was a central part 
of that meeting. After having conducted a third party independent 
poll by tele-research I was amazed to find that although I thought it 
was a good idea, the establishment of guidelines was not widely 
appreciated by people as being a good idea. As I reflected on it I 
realized that our court system and the judges involved in the court 
system are there for good reason. We have trust and we have 
respect for our court system.
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
	Judges in cases of family disputes are able to weigh all of the 
factors having anything to do with custody or with maintenance 
payments. Using the wisdom of Solomon, judges are able to look at 
every situation as a distinct situation and not apply a common rule 
or a broad brush which will affect everyone in the same way. It is 
this removal of informed advice that upsets most people. It results 
in the suggestion that perhaps a guideline is not a particularly good 
thing.
<P>
	In the constituency of Edmonton Southwest members would be 
interested to know that fully 75 per cent of the people polled feel 
judges should retain some discretion over the terms of child 
support. Only 9 per cent disagree and the remainder are undecided. 
Eighty-seven per cent say that the financial resources of the 
custodial parent should be considered when setting the level of 
child support. The guidelines make no mention whatsoever of the 
financial condition of custodial parents. What happens is that the 
custodial parent could end up being in a vastly superior financial 
position as a result of the divorce, for whatever reason, and yet the 
non-custodial parent is forced to pay a disproportionate amount of 
his or her income based solely on the condition that they are no 
longer married.
<P>
	It is the removal of the judicial discretion which concerns most 
Canadians.
<P>
	The town hall meeting brought up a particularly poignant and 
interesting consideration. Why is it in this legislation that we are 
forcing divorced parents to have a legal responsibility to children 
that they do not have before they are divorced? Think about that. 
This legislation will force non-custodial parents to continue to  pay 
after the age of majority for such things as schooling. I am sure the 
vast majority of people would do it anyway, but we do not force 
intact families to pay for anything, let alone pay for anything after 
the age of majority.
<P>
	Why should there be one set of rules for children of divorced 
parents and another set of rules for children of non-divorced 
parents?
<P>
	A group in Edmonton, the Equitable Child Maintenance and 
Access Society, has put together a number of particularly good 
papers concerning rearing children when their parents have 
divorced. The central argument that the group brings to the case is 
just because parents divorce does not mean they divorce 
themselves from their children. It is the litigation system which 
creates and causes more problems than were there in the first place.
<P>
<B>(1245 )</B>
<P>
	We should have a default position not of custody one way or the 
other but joint custody and co-parenting responsibilities. 
Responsibilities for nurturing children do not end at divorce; the 
responsibility for nurturing children remains constant. It also 
remains a responsibility, an obligation and an opportunity for the 
extended family.
<P>
	The question of fair access and maintenance support are not 
mutually exclusive. They are inextricably bound to each other. 
People who do not have fair access to their children do not feel a 
moral justification for paying maintenance. We cannot unlink the 
two and say that if people are not being afforded access to their 
children why should they feel the obligation in one direction only 
to make maintenance payments. Regardless of the problems people 
have in their domestic relationship, their obligation to their 
children continues and should not be part of it. The reality however 
is as human beings, it is part of it so it must be considered.
<P>
	As companion legislation to the responsibility to pay and as 
companion legislation to the fact that we would deny people 
passports or garnishee their wages, we must also have legislation 
that would enforce judgments of the court regarding access. At this 
time it is entirely in one direction.
<P>
	We must as a society understand the absolutely critical role of 
nurturing children. This critical role extends beyond marriage and 
divorce; it extends beyond the mother and father.
<P>
	I will read from <I>The Economist</I> dated September 28, a short 
paragraph which describes the reason for nurturing: ``Men tend to 
commit most crimes. In America they commit 81 per cent of all 
crimes and 87 per cent of violent crimes. Adolescent boys are the 
most volatile and violent of all. Those under 24 are responsible for 
half of America's violent crimes. Those under 18 commit 
one-quarter''.

expired.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to 
address Motions Nos. 6 and 9 put forward by the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
	These motions would strike out the provisions allowing a court, 
when there is agreement by the spouses, to award an amount that is 
different from the amount set out in the guidelines. Now, since 
provisions already exist in the legislation allowing a court to award 
a different amount, when there is proof that the child already has an 
advantage in relation to the amounts set out in the guidelines, 
meaning that the child already gets more than what the guidelines 
provide for, it has to be inferred that these provisions deal with 
cases where the parents have negotiated and reached an agreement 
whereby the child would get less that what is set out in the 
guidelines.
<P>
	Therefore this motion, as the text indicates, would strike out new 
subclauses (7) and (8) of new clause 15.1 of the Divorce Act. 
Indeed, these new subclauses show an intent to allow the court to 
set aside the application of the guidelines when two conditions are 
met: first, when there is agreement between the spouses and, 
second, when the court feels that the amount proposed for child 
support is reasonable.
<P>
	We cannot accept these provisions. The main reason we 
supported the bill, even though we proposed amendments to 
improve it, is that we felt that the principle of guidelines is 
desirable for a vast majority of families, be it for spousal support or 
for child support.
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	Almost all of those who have examined the issues of corollary 
relief, visiting rights, custody, and alimony support the 
implementation of guidelines. Let me give a few examples.
<P>
	The now defunct Canadian Advisory Council on the Status of 
Women wrote in March 1994: ``As participants in consultation 
hearings have indicated, parents and children who are involved in 
litigation over custody and visiting rights experience a great deal of 
emotional, physical and financial stress that is costly for the 
publicly financed judicial system, social programs and education.''
<P>
	A lawyer in private practice, who sat on the Canadian bar 
committee, has emphasized also that the interesting thing with 
guidelines is their coherence, and coherence makes for 
predictability, and predictability avoids going to court.
<P>
	Mrs. Lavigne, then president of the CACSW, wrote this: ``The 
setting of the level of support is also a source of conflict and 
resentment. Some think it is too little, and others think it is too 
much.''
<P>
	As a matter of fact, courts, lawyers and parents themselves find 
it hard to make a fair assessment of costs incurred for children, and 
they lack benchmarks to set a fair and just level of support.
<P>
	If binding rules do not seem desirable, guidelines are 
nonetheless to be made available to parties in order to make the 
process easier.
<P>
	So, the guidelines will contribute first to standardizing the 
amounts awarded, which should reduce the incidence of poverty 
for women and children. Another benefit, however, and a major 
one at that, is that this new way of doing things will greatly reduce 
negotiations between parents on the amount of child support.
<P>
	This amendment is quite significant, since we know that 
although a woman is represented by her lawyer, she can still fall 
victim to threats, blackmail and physical or moral weariness, and 
tell her lawyer to accept an otherwise unacceptable proposal.
<P>
	The only way to reduce tensions and unsuccessful negotiations, 
which penalize children in the end, is for the guidelines to be as 
widely applied as possible. That is why subclauses (7) and (8) are 
unacceptable and contrary to the principles underlying the 
guidelines.
<P>
	Indeed, this would take us back to the current situation where 
one parent, usually the father, is in a strong bargaining position, 
since he is usually better off, and can negotiate a settlement that is 
to his own advantage, but only to his own advantage. In the 
interests of all concerned, the amount of child support must not be 
determined in the context of preliminary negotiations.
<P>
	Finally, we must not forget that women have been demanding 
guidelines for a long time now precisely to avoid the pressure, 
threats, and blackmail that often come with the negotiation of 
corollary relief provisions in divorce proceedings.
<P>
	In enacting guidelines, governments are trying to set out a more 
neutral process for former spouses and their children. Thus, it is not 
recommended to favour provisions that go counter to these 
guidelines and, unfortunately in too many cases, force women to 
accept settlements that are unfair for them and their children.
<P>
	So, this is the purpose of the motion I brought forward. I want to 
have struck out the provisions allowing a judge, with the consent of 
both spouses, to make a child support order different from what is 
set out in the guidelines. We find these provisions somewhat risky. 
On the one hand, in the proposed child support guidelines to be 
used as the draft regulations, clause 5 provides for a court, on 
application by one of the spouses, to award an amount different 
from what is set out in the guidelines, if the order causes excessive 
hardship to the spouse making the application or to the child in 
respect of whom the order was made.

<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
	Therefore, Parliament is allowing the guidelines to be set aside 
in some special cases. We in the Bloc Quebecois would like the 
government to support our amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened to the remarks made by the members who have 
taken part in this debate so far, and the only conclusion that can be 
drawn is that the system in which we live is very complex.
<P>
	Let us take as an example people who live in Quebec. They get 
married in Quebec and they have children in Quebec. If the 
marriage does not work, they separate in Quebec. But if they want a 
divorce, then they fall under Ottawa's jurisdiction.
<P>
	You will understand that, as a member of the Bloc, I would be 
inclined to tell you without any hesitation that the federal 
government should completely withdraw from this area. However, 
as we have said many times before, as long as we are part of this 
system, we will try to improve it as best we can under the 
Constitution.
<P>
	And unfortunately, under the Constitution as it is now, the 
Divorce Act is a federal statute. Therefore, as good members of 
Parliament and as responsible people, since the Bloc Quebecois is 
the official opposition, we must try to improve this legislation to 
respond to the concerns I personally heard when I sat on the 
Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs, concerns 
expressed by women's groups and also by the provinces, because 
this bill has indeed several major flaws. That is why the Bloc 
Quebecois, as a responsible party and as the official opposition, is 
trying to improve this legislation.
<P>
	However, it seems that the members opposite do not understand 
what we want even though it is simple. Our goal, which should also 
be the goal of the government, is to protect the children. I heard the 
minister of Justice himself say that Bill C-41 aimed at correcting 
injustices against children.
<P>
	I believe that all motions introduced by the Bloc Quebecois aim 
precisely in that direction and are in response to requests made by 
people, women and interest groups heard by the committee.
<P>
	This government does not seem to listen much to what we say. 
Yet, it is crystal clear that we want is for the good of children. The 
government should understand that. We introduced a motion 
proposing that the place of residence for guideline purposes be the 
child's residence. It must be clear that support payments are to be 
paid to women or men who are taking care of their children, 
whatever province they come from, including Quebec. They must 
know in advance, whatever may happen, that the place of residence 
will be the place where the children are living.
<P>
	We have introduced a motion but I am pretty sure the 
government will oppose it. Why? Because it is proposed  by the 
Bloc Quebecois. Yet, it is precisely within the same line and goal. 
We have also introduced an amendment to take all discretionary 
powers away from the federal government, because we want 
Quebec and the National Assembly to decide on guidelines. If the 
National Assembly presents guidelines, we want the federal 
government to have no other choice but to accept them.
<P>
	How will the government react to this motion? It will reject it. 
Why? Probably because it was proposed by the Bloc and not by it. 
Yet, this proposal follows along the lines of other proposals heard 
before. I know that this is what the National Assembly very much 
wants. We want government to have no choice.
<P>
	We also moved a motion regarding vested rights. We do not want 
the federal government to change the rules on us. We do not want 
things to go one way under the Liberals and another way under the 
Conservatives. We want to reassure people and we only have one 
purpose in mind, protecting children. What is the government 
going to do about it? It is going to vote against it, I am quite sure of 
it.
<P>
	Furthermore, we moved a motion to delete the infamous ``or 
other cause'' in one clause. What does ``or other cause'' mean? 
This means that any given day the government might decide, by 
order in council, to add to the eligibility criteria. Or, depending on 
its mood, it might just as well decide to eliminate some of them. 
All we want is to protect the children. We want to know exactly 
where we are going, how the courts are going to apply the 
applicable guidelines to all concerned.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	Finally, we moved two of the motions in this group, Motions Nos 
6 and 9, which are aimed at protecting children. Is it right-I see 
the member for Québec is nodding in agreement, I believe she 
agrees with me-to set guidelines and to provide, as does Bill 
C-41, that with the parents' consent the amount of support might be 
below that set in the guidelines? Is it right? Does it protect 
children? No, it does not.
<P>
	Suppose that, according to the guidelines, the children of a 
divorced couple are entitled to $150 a week in support payment, is 
it right for the judge to award the children, with the spouses' 
consent, $75 a week? Is it right to go to the trouble of developing 
guidelines, and then, after negotiations in the court's back rooms, 
sometimes under pressure or even duress, to have a ruling which 
does not respect them?
<P>
	I have witnessed women being threatened. It is mostly women 
and children we want to protect. On occasion, I saw women coming 
to court in the morning, their mind made up. They had come there 
that day determined to get so much in support payments, fully 
intending to fight for their children's sake.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6046"> 6046 </A></B>
<P>
	Following negotiations and after extremely long delays, 
sometimes you get to the court house in the morning and you 
cannot tell when you will leave because of emotions and all sorts 
of considerations; sometimes the lawyers and the spouses agree 
and the amount finally granted is considerably lower than what 
the party seeking alimony had decided to ask for in the morning. 
Those are the rules.
<P>
	Also, it is often the squeaky wheel, the most forceful lawyer who 
will win. As you know, all sorts of things happen in the court house. 
Is it usual to approve all that? This is what the government is 
proposing with Bill C-41 and the clauses we want to delete. We 
want to remedy that situation with Motions Nos. 6 and 9. Is it usual, 
as I have just said, to condone the actions of lawyers?
<P>
	What I want to say is, is it usual to perpetuate that way of doing 
things? This is what the government is doing. If the spouses agree, 
the court can determine an amount different from the one which 
would apply according to pertinent guidelines. We know quite well 
that the bill already says there will be no problem if the amount is 
higher than what would be determined with the guidelines. The 
goal is simple: to help the children.
<P>
	The guidelines say $150 a week; the husband and wife agree on 
$200 a week. Who will benefit? The children. Then the goal is 
reached. The judge has no say. He can only go along with the 
agreement. But, the reverse is also true. These clauses we want to 
delete would allow the judge to make a ruling along the lines of an 
agreement whereby children would receive less than what the 
guidelines provide. That is unacceptable.
<P>
	I see the justice minister is listening. I think he realizes there is a 
flaw in this bill. I hope that when the time comes to vote on Bill 
C-41, and on Motions Nos 6 and 9 presented by my colleague the 
member for Quebec, the government will change its mind and 
decide to support these motions whose ultimate purpose is to 
protect children.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Margaret Bridgman (Surrey North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to add a few comments to the debate on Bill C-41 and 
the motions in Group No. 2.
<P>
	Bill C-41 in itself has some strong points and some weak areas. 
Viewing the overall bill we certainly feel there are some 
amendments necessary. In Group No. 2 there are eight motions 
specifically addressing the ability to pay or the grid payment aspect 
of a divorce. Of the eight motions there are two that we have some 
difficulty with, Motions Nos. 6 and 9.
<P>
	Part of that reason is that if we go with Motions Nos. 6 and 9 
there does not seem to be sort of a starting base, an expectation that 
people can have as to what may happen if they choose to divorce.
<P>
	With the grid aspect at least they know before they go into the 
courtroom that there is a certain area that they are going to have to 
look at; they are going to have to pay this or they are going to have 
to pay that depending on what happens on their day in court.
<P>
	What we argue is they have that grid, that guideline and then we 
look at their ability to pay and of course the needs of the child or 
children. At that point if they do not meet basic essentials of the 
grid, then they go into mediation or these kinds of things that would 
be applicable to the individual situation of the family involved.
<P>
	The point is we must have somewhere to start. We must give the 
citizens some direction as to what it would mean or could mean if 
they went into the divorce court. The first priority of course is the 
needs of the child based on the ability to pay.
<P>
	It has been mentioned in previous debate that within a family 
structure that is not divorcing we do not expect the same type of 
financial commitment. I would tend to suggest that we do in a 
different sort of way. I am sure that when people decide to have a 
family they obviously look at their present family income situation 
and whether they can support the family in the manner in which 
they choose, i.e. their lifestyle. The courts can do the same kind of 
thing when that partnership breaks up, that they would look at that 
family according to their lifestyle and assess the needs of the 
children according to the ability to pay. There must be a certain 
level that one who has to raise those children can expect from a 
financial point of view.
<P>
	That is what we are talking about with having the guidelines for 
the judge and for the people involved in the divorce to at least start 
somewhere and then from there bring it into their own individual 
circumstances.
<P>
	We tend to think when we say ability to pay of the lower income 
person and whether they can actually meet that basic standard. Of 
course, if they cannot we get into all these different penalties we 
are going to impose on somebody who cannot pay. Obviously we 
have to look at the ability to pay.
<P>
	Also there is the other end of this scale where the money is not 
necessarily the problem from the point of view of having to support 
children. Then we get into value systems and lifestyles, which is 
another debate.
<P>
	A previous speaker from the Bloc made reference to negotiating 
benefits different from the rules. I am assuming the rules would be 
the payment grid. I suggest this could be very precedent setting. 
When there are no parameters from which to work in we open a 
Pandora's box. If we had some parameters to work within and then 
allow the judges to assess the individual situation and go outside 
those parameters if necessary through a mediation of ability to pay 
and the needs of the child, I could see nothing wrong with that.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6047"> 6047 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1310 )</B>
<P>
	However, to start there puts a great onus on the judge with 
respect to the value system. There are no applicable guidelines. It 
would open up ongoing cases. We would probably get into the 
situation of judge shopping. If a person did not get a good deal with 
one judge, they might want to try again. This may not necessarily 
happen if the person is satisfied with the end result, but it could 
happen.
<P>
	I am suggesting we should have the payment grid available but it 
should be flexible based on the ability to pay, the needs of the child 
and the individual situation.
<P>
	In addressing these motions, the lack of flexibility in two of the 
motions with respect to the grid payment is our main concern. We 
would like to see that flexibility. The other six motions we have no 
particular difficulty with because we proposed them.
<P>
	That is all I have to add at this point on Group No. 2.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is with 
great pleasure and with the sense of some responsibility that I 
speak to Bill C-41 this morning.
<P>
	At the outset, it is important to say, and it cannot be said often 
enough, it will be said and repeated until everyone knows, 
especially in Quebec. With divorce being under federal 
jurisdiction, while marriage is, as we know-the civil code in 
general is different in Quebec-under provincial jurisdiction, in the 
area of child support, there is a risk of finding ourselves in a 
situation where the Quebec and the Canadian models as expressed 
by the federal guidelines risk running into each other.
<P>
	It is important to note that about 40 per cent of child support 
cases do not depend, because of the factor that I just mentioned, 
that is, that divorce is under federal jurisdiction. So, there would be 
about 40 per cent of child support cases that would elude the 
federal guidelines. That is undoubtedly one of the reasons why it is 
proposed in the bill that the application of the definition of 
guidelines be given to the provinces.
<P>
	However, we do not want to take any chance that federal 
arbitrariness applies. The hon. member for Québec, who worked 
particularly hard on this issue, has proposed a series of 
amendments, including an amendment asking that the province be 
designated if it meets-and it is required to do so because, once 
again, of the federal jurisdiction-the requirements provided by 
the act at section 26.1 in order to meet the requirements provided in 
this bill by the federal government.
<P>
	The federal government would have no choice but to designate 
Quebec, if Quebec so wanted, and we know that this is the case. 
Some provinces may want to, but others may not. We in the Bloc 
Quebecois have noted that even in other areas of federal 
jurisdiction, some  provinces that do not fear for their identity in 
putting themselves in the hands of the central government may not 
want these provisions. This is not the case in Quebec, with its 
different civil code which it cares about as much as it does about 
language and which explains the kind of different, not to say 
distinct, society Quebec has set up. It is therefore essential that the 
central government understand the need to exclude any possibility 
of arbitrary decisions.
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	It must also be pointed out that other provinces may wish to 
define their own guidelines, for example because of the differences 
in the labour market and average income levels among the various 
provinces.
<P>
	I should remind the House that the federal government has just 
introduced in this House a bill aligning the federal minimum wage 
rate with that in effect in each province. Well, in some provinces 
the minimum wage is $4.75, compared to $7 in others. This says a 
lot about the differences in the labour market and income levels 
among Canada's provinces. If a province takes the trouble of 
fulfilling all its obligations and wants to define and implement its 
own guidelines, it should be able to do so.
<P>
	This demand for guidelines, which comes through all the 
amendments tabled by the Bloc, and in a way by the Reform Party, 
was put forward by women a long time ago. Why?
<P>
	Although some divorces are amicable, others are not, 
unfortunately, in this society where love is not eternal. The child's 
interests should be paramount, but some parents may not be able to 
reach an agreement in this regard. Unfortunately, legal intervention 
becomes necessary when the relationship between the people 
involved prevents them from striking a balance and giving priority 
to the children.
<P>
	When divorces are not amicable, women-because they are 
generally the ones affected-must be able to count on some real 
support. These guidelines are designed so that women will not have 
to face undue pressure. As we know, this undue pressure can be 
brought to bear in a trial. A trial does not guarantee there will be no 
pressure, far from it.
<P>
	So it is quite disturbing to see in this bill two clauses that seem to 
contradict each other. One stipulates that the judge may recognize 
agreements or orders giving one or more children more than 
provided for in the guidelines. That is okay, except that, according 
to another clause, the judge may agree that an agreement outside 
the guidelines is not unreasonable.
<P>
	Of course, if we put these two clauses side by side, the second 
one means an agreement was reached for less than what is specified 
in the guidelines. This would go against the repeated demand for 
clear, universal guidelines, because it could be assumed from the 
outset  that some judges may not feel bound by the guidelines. If 
the child is to get more, we can understand that such an agreement 
can be recognized. However, if the child is to get less, then we 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6048"> 6048 </A></B>
<P>
cannot understand because this provision brings back into play all 
the pressures that women can be subjected to during a trial.
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	Despite what my colleague said, I hope members opposite will 
soon realize that they are destroying what they have just 
accomplished belatedly after so many women experienced so many 
problems.
<P>
	I would also like to mention how important it is to base the 
decision as to which guidelines will apply on the child's place of 
residence. Here again we feel that the amendment we have brought 
forward should be accepted to avoid problems that would cause 
excessive and inexcusable delays.
<P>
	We think it is absolutely essential that decisions be made without 
delay so that women who have custody of their children can have 
access to the money to which they are entitled for the happiness and 
the standard of living of the children.
<P>
	In closing, I would like to mention that the central government 
must make moderate use of its power in this area. Family policies, 
as shown by Quebec last week, must be modelled on society. In the 
case of Quebec, it is extremely clear that the guidelines regarding 
family support obligations in case of divorce or separation must be 
modelled on our society's values and way of living.
<P>
	The amendments brought forward by my colleague make sense, 
and the government would be well advised to accept them.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, following 
on my colleague, I am pleased to rise today and give my opinion on 
Bill C-41, and particularly on all the motions tabled this morning. 
It is clear, from the number of motions and amendments now on the 
table that this bill must be overhauled.
<P>
	If it had been drafted in such a way as to meet with unanimous 
approval, we would not be faced with so many amendments and 
motions. This points up the federal government's vision on child 
support payments. When I say vision, unfortunately the federal 
government has once again forgotten that this is a vast country. 
Regardless of what members across the way think, we are not all 
alike.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Augustine:</B> Very good.
<P>
<B>(1325)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fillion:</B> As I said, this is a vast country. I did not say it was 
the best country in which to live. I said that it covered a wide area.
<P>
	We are completely distinct. We are not alike. What works in 
British Columbia does not work in Quebec. What works in Toronto 
does not necessarily work in Montreal. There are therefore 
distinctions to be made.
<P>
	Members will recall that the discussions concerning child 
support payments arose from the Thibaudeau case. This case forced 
the government to throw together a bill that, as we see today, is in 
need of amendment. The bill before us, with all its amendments, 
includes a number of measures to ensure that children's interests 
are respected. However, most of these measures are unsatisfactory.
<P>
	The guidelines respecting the determination and amount of child 
support orders make no sense at all to me. This part alone should be 
completely overhauled. I do not think it meets the expectations of 
the people concerned. In reality, judges will now have guidelines to 
follow in determining the amount of child support. They will no 
longer be able to exercise discretion. They will no longer be called 
upon to make a decision, but merely to approve what the 
government wishes to enforce. This, in my view, is very different 
from allowing them to exercise discretion, and so on.
<P>
	Where is the happy medium that will respect the rights of 
children? With these guidelines, the government is on the wrong 
track. I will not be revealing any great secret when I say that the 
federal model before us is inconsistent with the Quebec model.
<P>
	Furthermore, the criteria governing the guidelines are very 
different. In order to see this difference, perhaps we could take the 
concrete example of a non-custodial parent who is an income 
security recipient. In Quebec, this person does not have to pay 
support. It is very easy to understand why. He or she barely has 
enough to live on as it is. Yet, in what is being proposed to us, this 
individual might have to pay child support.
<P>
	Is this really realistic? When that question is asked, even if the 
individual has the best of intentions, he or she will not be able to 
meet obligations. This bill also assumes that the parents' incomes 
are equal for purposes of paying child support. Only the income of 
the non-custodial parent will be taken into account.
<P>
	This loses sight of whom the support payments are for. They are 
for the children. In Quebec, support payments are based on both 
parents' ability to pay, which, as you will agree, means shared 
responsibility for the children. There is, therefore, a world of 
difference, a vital difference between what they want to apply here 
and what is done in Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1330)</B>
<P>
	Moreover, this system has been tested, and the latest measures 
adopted in Quebec are satisfactory to everyone, at this point. With 
this bill, the federal government can, with a sweep of its hand, 
completely do away with everything that is being done in one 
province, compared to another.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6049"> 6049 </A></B>
<P>
	Moreover, it is also stated that the Governor in Council may, 
by order, designate a province for purposes of the definition of 
``applicable guidelines''.
<P>
	The verb ``may'' is used just about everywhere. This has just 
been discussed. It means that, if a province issues guidelines, it 
absolutely must obtain the blessings of the federal government for 
these to be applicable.
<P>
	The same federal paternalism as always. The federal government 
is, therefore, imposing its view on the provinces, but it is a view 
that does not always take reality into consideration. Let me tell 
you, I personally can do without this centralizing paternalism, 
which is the trademark of this government, moreover. If a province 
finds the guidelines it has set being refused, this could lead to 
absurd situations.
<P>
	The most striking example is one where a separation is governed 
by the grid of a province, while the divorce would be under the 
federal guideline. A mother of two who separates could be awarded 
$1,500 under the provincial grid, while another who divorces could 
get $1,000 under the federal one. Where does the problem lie?
<P>
	Let us identify this problem. Such a rule must be done away 
with. This is why we must take away all the discretionary power 
that this bill gives the federal government and, therefore, the 
amendment proposed by my colleague from Quebec must be 
seriously taken into consideration.
<P>
	This amendment provides that once a province has satisfied 
federal criteria, its own guidelines will automatically be recognized 
in replacement of federal guidelines. This would eliminate the 
possibility of facing situations out of control like the one I referred 
to earlier.
<P>
	Another aspect of the bill which concerns me a lot is the 
provision which takes into consideration the place of residence of 
the payer instead of that of the child for purposes of the award. 
Once again, they forget that this legislation must serve children 
exclusively, yet it tends to forget them too easily.
<P>
	However, children should be at the core of this measure. This bill 
must be improved for the protection of those children. We hope and 
I eagerly hope that the members opposite will take into 
consideration each of the amendments proposed by the Bloc 
Quebecois in order to improve the protection for our children, and I 
stress the word protection.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have a few quick words dealing with the concerns in the 
amendments brought forward by members from the Reform Party 
and the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
<B>(1335 )</B>
<P>
	The answer as to why the issue of custody and access as raised 
by the Reform Party is not being dealt with at this time is very 
quick and simple. Maintenance and enforcement of maintenance 
orders is a separate and distinct issue from that of custody and 
access. There are no experts within the land who would suggest a 
linkage of the two issues.
<P>
	The work done on maintenance and the enforcement of 
maintenance has been completed and legislation has been drafted. 
The legislation has been brought forward. At this time work is 
ongoing on the issue of custody and access. When the work is 
completed, when our provincial counterparts have been consulted 
and the consultations are complete and the legislation dealing with 
custody and access is drafted, it will be brought forward.
<P>
	With respect to the amendments that have been brought forward 
by the Reform Party, we must consider the problems the 
government was seeking to deal with and to cure by bringing 
forward this bill. We are dealing with a system of maintenance 
enforcement that is in excess of 50 years old. Certainly after that 
time and the amount of experience we have had with these 
provisions, we should be able to see what the problems are with the 
type of legislation that has existed.
<P>
	It does not take very much observation to note that real problems 
exist with the present legislation. For instance, saying that people 
ask for their day in court is not really accurate. When people are 
dealing with divorce proceedings, they may be asking for their 
years in court.
<P>
	Part of the problem the government is seeking to solve is to bring 
forward legislation that will reduce the amount of conflict through 
the court system by creating a system that brings greater certainty 
as a result, that is, by introducing tables. When there are tables 
there are fewer things for the litigant parties to be fighting over. It 
will reduce some of the litigation and tension that goes along with 
divorce. That is one of the things we seek to reduce.
<P>
	In addition, if we look at the court decisions within provincial 
jurisdictions themselves and across the nation, support payments 
are varied. There is little consistency to them. That is another thing. 
By bringing forward the guidelines and asking the courts to look at 
the guidelines first and foremost, we would seek to reduce this 
disparity of award.
<P>
	What is very important in this is that over the years we have seen 
who suffers when divorce happens. It is the custodial parent and the 
children. In many cases it is usually the mother and the children 
who are forced to live in poverty. The government and the Minister 
of Justice believe that women and children should not be forced to 
live in poverty.
<P>
	The children should be the last parties who suffer when divorce 
unfortunately occurs. We must do our best to ensure that this 
country's children, our future, our hope for a brighter future, do not 
live in poverty and suffer the indignities, misfortunes and
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6050"> 6050 </A></B>
<P>
unfair results of poverty that they have in the past. This is another 
thing the government is doing to alleviate those problems.
<P>
	What does the Reform Party seek to do by its amendments? It 
seeks to put all this uncertainty back into the system. All of their 
amendments seek to reintroduce the concept of the needs of the 
child and the ability of the payer to pay. It is opening up the whole 
range of present options.
<P>
	We have seen what the problems are with the present range of 
options, the inconsistency of the awards, the low quantum of 
awards which forces many of our young people and custodial 
parents, mostly women, to live in poverty. This is not acceptable in 
this country. That is why the federal government is bringing 
forward these guidelines to alleviate that problem.
<P>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
	I will deal with the concerns brought forward by the Bloc 
Quebecois. We hear the usual rhetoric about the paternalistic 
federal government imposing its will. Let us look at the facts. This 
is an area of federal jurisdiction from beginning to end. It is not an 
area of provincial jurisdiction. The federal government certainly 
not only has the right but the obligation to put forward legislation 
within its areas of jurisdiction.
<P>
	This federal government in general and the Minister of Justice in 
particular are very concerned about ensuring that this legislation 
shows great regional sensitivity. If we look at the guidelines, they 
vary from province to province based on certain differences that 
exist within the provinces. That in and of itself shows the 
sensitivity and understanding of the central government to ensure 
that regional variations are taken into account.
<P>
	In addition to that, under certain circumstances and in certain 
cases the provincial guidelines may be accepted. Where there is an 
area of federal jurisdiction there does need to be by law a degree of 
federal control over the ultimate applicability of the provisions. 
Again the Minister of Justice has gone a step further in 
acknowledging that where appropriate, provincial guidelines may 
be allowed in the field.
<P>
	The government has made progress in many, many areas 
allowing the provincial governments to assume their rightful 
jurisdiction in many instances, to involve greater consultation even 
in areas of complete federal jurisdiction. The government has 
ensured that when it enacts legislation, its provincial partners are 
consulted. This legislation is no different. First, it very distinctly 
recognizes regional differences and second, in appropriate cases 
allows the possibility that regional guidelines may be accepted.
<P>
	That is very important and it is what this country is all about. It is 
all about working together and doing things that make sense. It is 
not about saying that one party whether it is a province or the 
federal government just because one or the other is doing it makes 
sense. That road leads absolutely nowhere.
<P>
	Ideology about who can do the job better is not helpful. Each of 
these issues must be decided on a case by case basis in dealing with 
a particular issue and particular circumstances which could be 
brought to bear on it. The government is doing an excellent job to 
ensure that we do have regional sensitivity.
<P>
	In wrapping up, I would say that those issues brought forward by 
the Reform Party only lead once again to the possibility that the 
children of this nation and the custodial parents, mostly women, 
will be left in a state of poverty. Those are the very problems this 
legislation seeks to cure.
<P>
<B>(1345)</B>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is now my turn 
to speak to this important topic which demonstrates-and I shall, if 
I may, start my speech by recalling this fact-that in this area, 
Canadian federalism is hardly the ideal model.
<P>
	We get married under provincial jurisdiction and we get 
divorced under federal jurisdiction. The result, in the course of this 
debate on the motions, on federal guidelines, is that a large part of 
the population has been overlooked. There is an increasingly 
widespread phenomenon in our society and I am referring to the 
increase in common law marriages, common law spouses who are 
not married. If these people have children, they are not subject to 
these provisions, which creates a third group. This is rather 
incredible.
<P>
	As we keep reminding the House, all this should be placed under 
the jurisdiction of a single government, the one that is closest to us. 
Because this is a very vital part of the social fabric, it should under 
provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	People will say: That is the way it is. The fact remains that the 
situation is there. And just because it is there does not mean we 
should not try to change it. We wish it would change, except that 
meanwhile, we cannot object and ask for guidelines that would take 
into account these different situations.
<P>
	More and more frequently, people are moving, either from 
province to province or even out of the country. Today, it would be 
unacceptable to have standards that would be so different that 
children who are supposed to benefit under the new system would 
be penalized with respect to their vital needs because support 
payments would not follow the same guidelines.
<P>
	This set of amendments can be interpreted any way you like. In 
any case, we in the Bloc Quebecois object because this goes against 
the amendments we proposed previously, those in Group No. 1. We 
see words like ``including'' used in the bill to get around the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6051"> 6051 </A></B>
<P>
guidelines. Parties in this House who are against our position are 
trying to water down the debate, to restrict the benefits and, in the 
final instance, to penalize those we want to help, in this case the 
children.
<P>
	I am not an expert on the topic, but as a parliamentarian who is 
concerned about the well-being of his fellow citizens and as a 
former member of the Standing Committee on Human Resources 
Development, I am very disturbed by all the poverty that exists in 
our communities. We can never repeat often enough that one child 
out of five in Canada lives in poverty. This happens most often in 
single parent families where the mother has to manage the family 
budget. Unfortunately, throughout the world today, and in Canada 
as well, the gap between rich and poor is broadening. The incomes 
of the poorest and the most vulnerable among us are going down, 
not up. There are children who lack the necessities of life.
<P>
	Studies, including some major analyses and studies, clearly 
show that during the first years of his or her life, a child requires 
not only proper nutrition, but must also the proper emotional 
environment-not only maternal but also paternal. My opinion as a 
man is that, when it comes to child support, men must continue to 
assume their responsibilities. This is more than a financial matter.
<P>
	However, finances remain an important aspect because when 
those responsible for managing the family budget do not have the 
necessary resources, the absolute minimum, the future of our 
children becomes a concern. This can have serious consequences, 
not only on their health, but also on the way they trust society.
<P>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
	They may grow up with feelings of frustration, which is not 
healthy for a society. It is not healthy for the equality of 
opportunities.
<P>
	This is why I wanted to address this issue. We can never stress 
enough that those who must benefit, those who must get our 
attention, are the children. If we want them to be healthy, to be 
involved in a healthy way in the future of society, whether it be in 
Quebec or Canada, social measures are required to ensure them of 
equal opportunities.

<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, Group No. 3 consists of one motion 
proposed by the Reform Party. This amendment deals with clause 
11 on page 14. It would add a whole new subsection, 26.2, to Bill 
C-41. It states in part:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>26.2 (1) The Minister of Justice shall have each proposed guideline laid before the 
House of Commons.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(2) Each proposed guideline that is laid before the House of Commons shall, on the

established on the expiration of thirty sitting days after it was laid.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(4) For the purpose of this section, ``sitting day'' means a day on which the House 
of Commons sits.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	What does that mean? Very simply put, Reform has been saying 
the same thing over and over again in this place for the past three 
years, ever since almost all Reformers have been in the House of 
Commons. We feel very strongly that the committees and the 
House should be allowed to look at these guidelines.
<P>
	We are very uncomfortable with the fact that here is another 
instance-similar to the guidelines for Bill C-68, the gun control 
legislation-where the government wants to take care of things 
behind closed doors. It wants the cabinet to make the decision by 
order in council. The House and the committees of the House will 
not have the opportunity to debate or to look at the guidelines. The 
House and committees will not have the opportunity to find out 
what the guidelines are until they are actually cemented into place. 
To be quite frank, we find that type of behaviour inexcusable even 
though it goes on and on as more bills are brought into this place by 
this Liberal government.
<P>
<B>(1355)</B>
<P>
	This is just the latest example of the Liberals superseding the 
authority of the House and its committees. They will draft the 
guidelines which will be imposed on the citizens of the country 
without those citizens having their elected representatives be given 
the opportunity to properly debate them and propose potential 
amendments. We cannot bring up issues of concern that we feel 
would make sense and are concerns of a lot of our constituents.
<P>
	That is why the Reform Party brought forward Motion No. 13. 
Perhaps at this point in time we will just leave it go at that.

get in an extra statement or two before the end of that period. I

	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this week is Crime Prevention Week. How does this case 
help prevent crime?
<P>
	In April 1995, 58-year-old James Baldwin was viciously kicked 
to death by six youths in Dawson Creek who were aged 15 to 17 at 
the time. All of these young offenders were known to local police. 
Only the 15-year-old was raised to adult court.
<P>
	Their malicious murder of Baldwin as he lay sleeping in his tent 
was plea bargained down from second degree murder to 
manslaughter.
<P>
	On Friday three of the youths were sentenced. Two have been in 
jail since the crime. They got another six months in jail, plus one 
year's probation. The third youth got one year in jail, plus two 
year's probation and 180 hours of community service.
<P>
	This is justice? How does this deter crime? Why was this cold 
blooded murder plea bargained to manslaughter?
<P>
	An 80-year-old constituent walked into my office just a matter of 
an hour ago and said it best: ``This sentence is a disgrace''.

the Department of Canadian Heritage of acting in bad faith in the

	The coalition is accusing the Department of, among other things, 
trying to blackmail groups by unduly delaying the payment of their 
subsidy until the full payment of the money due on tabling of a 
final offer which is definitely lower than what is required.
<P>
	The coalition also condemns the fact that, under pretence of 
improving the deal, the government includes in it certain sums 
having no relation to the community, such as the salary of the 
federal public servant in charge of managing the agreement. The 
agreements between Canada and the communities do not fool

crime legal system, a legal bureaucracy which is growing by leaps 
and bounds at tremendous cost to victims and taxpayers of this 
country, a legal system where, as characterized by Ottawa <I>Sun</I> 
columnist Ron Corbett, dodging justice is now the norm.
<P>
	Mr. Corbett's commentary was the result of the application last

<P>
	In accordance with the YOA, Raymond was to be transferred to

remains in a youth detention centre, dodging justice until his

Battersby are still unable to put their lives back together.

<P>
	While this commemoration is fitting, it does not address the

treated as equals on the battlefield but suffered neglect and unfair 
treatment at the hands of the federal government when they

1950s. Benefits such as pensions, health care and educational 
training were available, but many native veterans were never 
informed that they were available.
<P>
	They suffered discrimination. For example, to collect normal 
benefits, a returning native veteran from the second world war was 
asked to renounce his or her status under the Indian Act and live off 
reserve. If they chose to stay on the reserve they were no longer 
under the administration of the Department of Veterans Affairs. 
They were not offered the $6,000 loan available for land to 
non-Indians under the Veterans Land Act but received  only $2,330

	World War I was a defining moment in the evolution of our

Veterans Week. I encourage all members of the House to help bring 
together veterans organizations and schools so that veterans can tell 
their stories to people too young to have firsthand knowledge of 
wars.
<P>
	Today Canadians live in a land untouched by war. We enjoy a 
quality of life that has been built on the dedication and sacrifice of 
those who fought oppression and tyranny in decades past.
<P>
	Let us use Veterans Week to rededicate ourselves to the cause of 
serving Canada, freedom and democracy.

	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on behalf of the Bloc Quebecois, I want to mark a sad 
event, namely the assassination a year ago of Israel's Prime 
Minister, Mr. Rabin, who was killed on November 4, 1995.
<P>
	A winner of the Nobel peace prize, Mr. Rabin believed in the 
reconciliation of the Israeli and Palestinian peoples, and he worked 
hard to find ways to bring them closer to each other.
<P>
	Despite his violent death, everyone hoped that the efforts to 
implement the peace plan in that region would be pursued. 
Unfortunately, we now fear the worse. Indeed, the behaviour of Mr. 
Rabin's successor at the head of the state of Israeli makes us 
wonder.
<P>
	Today, on this sad anniversary, we can only hope that the values 
promoted through the peace process put forth by Messrs. Rabin and 
Arafat will prevail over the radicals that scorn democratic values 
and condone violence.
<P>
	Today, the hope for a lasting peace must be revived by Mr. 
Rabin's memory.

	There are some solutions. First, our UN rapid reaction force

civilian populations. Second, humanitarian assistance must be 
organized to ensure that the basic needs of the evacuees are met. 
Third, all arms shipments to the region should be blocked. Fourth,

management and a ceasefire brokered. Last, they should consider

	<B>Mr. Benoît Serré (Timiskaming-French River, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, today, we are celebrating the third anniversary of our 
government's taking office.
<P>
	The people of Canada realize that the Liberal government they 
have elected is fulfilling its election commitments. As our Prime 
Minister stated last week, we have already fulfilled 78 per cent of 
our campaign promises. And we still have a year left in our 
mandate.
<P>
	To achieve these results, our government has opted for rigour 
and integrity and ignored the blanket solutions that help no one and 
unfairly upset everyone. Our government has chosen to redefine 
the role of the federal government instead of undermining the 
whole machinery of government.

with government expenditures on  criminal justice almost $10 
billion a year. Crime costs us more than education.
<P>
	Why has this national disaster come about? A main contributing 
factor is the decline in the foundational role the family plays in 
child development and the transmitting of spiritual and social 
values. Mothers and fathers in the home foster the necessary 
emotional development during a child's formative years.

changes would take 1 million low income families off the tax roles 
and increase child tax benefits a whopping 80 per cent. Families

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister has made a disastrous decision in 
deciding to appoint Jean-Louis Roux as Quebec's 
lieutenant-governor. We have just learned that not only did Mr. 
Roux proudly wear the swastika in the second world war, but that 
he also engaged in anti-Semitic behaviour by vandalizing 
businesses belonging to members of Montreal's Jewish 
community. These troubling revelations have just been made by the 
lieutenant-governor himself to a journalist writing for <I>L'Actualité</I>.
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister. When he appointed 
Jean-Louis Roux to this position, because it was the Prime Minister 
who appointed him, was he aware of Mr. Roux's openly 
anti-Semitic behaviour?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the claims made by the 
Leader of the Opposition regarding vandalism are not true.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, I know that the Deputy Prime Minister is not accustomed 
to giving answers that stand up, but I would like her to make an 
effort, just this once.
<P>
	Quebec's lieutenant-governor himself, in case she is unaware, 
stated that he had taken part in demonstrations and set out to 
vandalize businesses belonging to the Jewish community. He came 
right out and said so and is now trying to downplay his remarks.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6057"> 6057 </A></B>
<P>
	My question to the Deputy Prime Minister, who is here to reply 
on behalf of the government, is this: Did the Prime Minister know, 
when he appointed Jean-Louis Roux, that Mr. Roux had behaved 
in such a reprehensible manner? That is the question.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the lieutenant-governor 
said that he had taken part in anti-conscription demonstrations, as 
most people were doing. He denied having taken part in any 
vandalism, and I think that when the Leader of the Opposition 
makes statements in this House, they should at least be true.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Dear colleagues, it must be assumed that 
when we rise in the House the truth is never in question. I now 
recognize the hon. Leader of the Opposition.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, all those watching today, members of the public, voted for 
members in this House, for members of the Bloc Quebecois as 
well, a stronger majority in Quebec, I might add, and that is why 
we are asking these questions on their behalf. Jean-Louis Roux 
himself stated that he remembered heading through the streets, in 
1942, at the age of 20, with a crowd of anti-conscription protesters 
to wreck the offices of <I>The Gazette</I> on St. Catherine Street and the 
windows of any shops whose name had a foreign flavour, 
particularly Jewish, he said.
<P>
	My question is for the Deputy Prime Minister, who speaks on 
behalf of the government and the Prime Minister. I ask her for the 
third time, and I am hoping for an answer: Did the Prime Minister 
know, when he appointed Jean-Louis Roux, that Mr. Roux had 
behaved in such an unacceptable, unjustifiable and unspeakable 
manner?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I think that when we see 
who the lieutenant-governor is, it behooves us to point out what he 
has done in his life.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	This afternoon, during a statement he made in response to the 
misrepresentations made by a number of people, which now 
includes the Leader of the Opposition, and I quote him, he never 
denied taking part in the demonstration, but said that during that 
same period he did take part in an anti-conscription demonstration 
that ended ``with a parade during which demonstrators, whom I 
was not among, broke windows'' in Mr. Roux's words.
<P>
	What was said about his participation in anti-conscription 
activities could in fact have been said about all Quebecers at the 
time. It is also true that the remarks reported in the article in 
<I>L'Actualité</I> are sufficiently troubling that the lieutenant-governor 
himself issued a release today stating the facts.
<P>
	I think that what is important is to judge the lieutenant-governor 
on his political career, during the 50 years of which he has opposed
<P>
fascism and anti-democratic forces. He must be judged today on 
what he has accomplished over the last half century.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, do not 
the Deputy Prime Minister's responses, in her attempt to 
whitewash the behaviour of Jean-Louis Roux-highly 
reprehensible behaviour for a man in a public position-make her 
an accomplice of Liberal buddies Pierre Elliott Trudeau, Jacques 
Hébert and Gérard Pelletier, in trying to make the actions of their 
friend Jean-Louis Roux seem unimportant?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, we are not here to 
whitewash any facts. Nor are we here to make false statements like 
the ones made by the Leader of the Opposition.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Copps:</B> It is certain that the Lieutenant Governor took part 
in demonstrations against conscription when he was young, and it 
is also certain that he was not involved in any vandalism.
<P>
	What we need to do now is to reflect on Jean-Louis Roux' half 
century-long career in which he has always fought, and continues 
to fight, against fascism, regardless of its form.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, to take 
a different tack, was the Prime Minister aware of these facts when 
he appointed Jean-Louis Roux? Was his background included in the 
RCMP security check, which the Prime Minister surely ordered 
done, and which he surely read, before appointing Jean-Louis Roux 
lieutenant-governor?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I wish to consolidate the 
facts.
<P>
	I would like to see the Leader of the Opposition, instead of 
playing politics, accept the fact that the claims he has just made in 
this House are false.
<P>
	Mr. Jean-Louis Roux was never involved in vandalism. Yes, he 
did take part in demonstrations against conscription, but these were 
supported by the majority of Quebecers during the 1940s. He never 
took part in any vandalism, however, and when the Leader of the 
Opposition makes comments like this in the House, he ought to 
apologize.

	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, last 
week the youth minister said that her accounting was not a problem 
because she paid the money back within  days and she actually had 
a cheque stapled to the form. According to the ethics counsellor, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6058"> 6058 </A></B>
<P>
the youth minister waited up to four months to pay these bills. 
There is a discrepancy here. It must be really nice. I will bet the 
Canadian taxpayers did not know they were bankrolling the 
Government of Canada's ``don't pay a cent event''.
<P>
	Can the Deputy Prime Minister explain why the youth minister 
was allowed up to four months to pay back money owed to the 
taxpayers of Canada?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I think these questions 
were answered by the Prime Minister, by the minister herself and 
by the President of the Treasury Board. I believe only three days 
ago the acting leader of the third party accepted her explanation.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in fact 
what we said three or four days ago when those documents were 
tabled is that we would have a look at them and there seem to be 
some pretty serious discrepancies. It would be easy just to say nice 
try and to pass everything off as okay now, but if a public servant 
did this, they would be out on their ear just as simple as that.
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
	Instead of going to a bank teller, the youth minister turned to the 
taxpayers for her government credit card bills. I am sure thousands 
of Canadians would love to have the option of an interest free loan 
from the Government of Canada just to make ends meet.
<P>
	Why the double standard? Why is it that the youth minister and 
Bombardier get interest free loans while every other taxpayer has 
to pay the going rate?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I believe the Secretary of 
State for Youth answered the questions in the House and furnished 
all the documentation. She put forth the proof through the Speaker 
to the deputy leader of the third party. I believe last Thursday the 
member for Beaver River said that she would take the hon. member 
at her word.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in fact I 
think my exact words were that she admitted her mistake and I 
appreciated the fact that she had done that. Then she said further to 
that that she had not really made a mistake and everything was 
okay and the Prime Minister agreed. We have uncovered 
documents through access to information that are quite clearly 
contradictory to what she tabled. The bottom line is far deeper than 
that.
<P>
	The ethics guidelines that are supposed to be in place for all the 
cabinet ministers should be made completely public and 
documented for the Canadian public to see. The government 
promised integrity in action but all we see is integrity in hiding. 
The Prime Minister is fond of saying that the buck stops with him. 
What he does not seem to understand is that the buck stays with the 
Canadian public. They are the taxpayers.
<P>
	I ask the Deputy Prime Minister: Why does the Prime Minister 
stubbornly refuse to let the taxpayers see these phantom guidelines 
for the ministers when in fact they are their ministers and it is their 
money?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister has 
always said that the person who is accountable for the integrity of 
his ministers is the Prime Minister himself. The Prime Minister is 
the person who names the ministers. He is also capable of 
removing the ministers.
<P>
	If we were to ask the Canadian people whose integrity they have 
confidence in right now, the Prime Minister or the third party, I 
think the exodus of members from the third party speaks for itself.

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Deputy 
Prime Minister, answering on behalf of the Prime Minister and the 
government, said earlier that the Leader of the Opposition should 
apologize to the House because he referred to statements made by 
the lieutenant-governor of Quebec and these statements led us to 
question the government.
<P>
	This is my question for the Deputy Prime Minister. She is trying 
to downplay the participation of the lieutenant-governor in an 
anti-Semitic march which took place in the streets of Montreal at a 
time when the Jews were experiencing the worse genocide in 
history, but does she think the lieutenant-governor was well 
advised to walk around with a swastika on his lab coat at the 
university's medical school?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, this gesture by the 
lieutenant-governor as a young man was a reflection of what other 
people were doing. His participation in an anti-conscription 
demonstration was a democratic act that was supported by most 
Quebecers.
<P>
	That being said, if we want to judge the actions of Jean-Louis 
Roux, a man who for almost half a century of his life has fought for 
truth and democracy, and against fascism, we should judge the 
person he has become 50 years later.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, are we to 
conclude from what the Deputy Prime Minister said that she 
condones the fact that for 50 years, although others apologized for 
such actions, Jean-Louis Roux kept the fact that he wore a swastika 
and was anti-Semitic in his behaviour a secret?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6059"> 6059 </A></B>
<P>
	Are we to conclude that the Deputy Prime Minister feels it is 
perfectly all right to have kept quiet about all this for 50 years 
and then let it filter out after his appointment as 
lieutenant-governor, to ward off any negative fallout, according 
to the journalist for <I>L'Actualité</I> and to what all Quebecers are 
thinking?
<P>
<B>(1430)</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of

	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Prime 
Minister has promised Canadians more honest and open 
government and better accountability.
<P>
	In seeking the forgiveness of the House and Canadians, the 
Secretary of State for Training and Youth tabled documents last 
Thursday that she said would support her words but the numbers do 
not add up. I have gone over 10 credit card statements that we were 
able to obtain and have found over $9,700 in the six months 
covered that has been whited out ostensibly because these were 
personal.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister direct her to table the full documents, all 
expense forms, credit card statements and cheques showing clearly 
all the dates, all the amounts charged and repaid?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the deposition of the 
Secretary of State for Youth and Training last week answered all 
these questions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, if the questions 
had been answered would I be standing here again?
<P>
	The object here is that the truth be demonstrated. If everything 
has been done as the Prime Minister and the President of the 
Treasury Board claim, full disclosure will answer the unanswered 
questions.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister direct her to table the full and unaltered 
expense forms, credit card statements, processed cheques and any 
other documentation that will support her words with no missing 
documents and no whiteout?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Secretary of State for 
Youth and Training has voluntarily furnished everything that has 
been asked for here in the House.
<P>
	I would refer to a statement made by the member for Beaver 
River last Thursday when she came into the House upon the 
presentation of the statement by the hon. member. She said: ``She 
admitted today in the House of Commons that it was a mistake and 
we appreciate that''.
<P>
	The member involved has admitted that she made a mistake. She 
has tabled all the documents. It has not cost the taxpayers of 
Canada a penny. If the member is truly serious about pursuing this 
issue, maybe she should ask her leader to be as forthcoming about 
his expenses in Hawaii and the other trips that he has taken at the 
taxpayers' expense.

taking part in a demonstration against conscription on his way to 
ransack the <I>Gazette</I>'s offices on St. Catherine Street, the windows 
of all the stores with foreign-sounding names-especially Hebrew 
names-were shattered. During the confrontation, he was hit so 
hard in the mouth that his jaw was fractured and he suffered from 
temporary amnesia, which, I should add, lasted 50 years.
<P>
	I ask the Deputy Prime Minister if Jean-Louis Roux informed 
the Prime Minister of his involvement in these events, of his 
wearing a disguise and sporting a swastika at the University of 
Montreal laboratories, before accepting his appointment as 
Lieutenant Governor?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, many people do things in 
their youth they regret later. For example, the new member for 
Laurier-Sainte-Marie used to belong to the Marxist-Leninist 
Workers' Communist Party.
<P>
	When asked, he said that it had lain heavy on his conscience for 
several years, that he wore it like a wound. Certainly, when people 
are young, they do things they may regret later. What is important 
today is to think about Jean-Louis Roux's 50 years of public work

does him credit. But Jean-Louis Roux is still a victim of the punch 
to his jaw that caused his temporary, 50-year amnesia. That makes 
all the difference.

	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it has come 
to my attention that a couple of weeks ago somebody in 
Mississauga, Ontario walked into a government surplus store and 
purchased a filing cabinet. Lo and behold when the individual 
opened the filing cabinet six or seven files of individual Canadian 
taxpayers that should never have been there were found. The filing 
cabinet should have been looked at before it got out. This is scary 
stuff. Who is responsible for this incompetence?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the Department of National Revenue takes very seriously its 
responsibility to protect the confidentiality of taxpayer 
information. Departmental security officials are in the process of 
investigating how these documents were made available. The 
department has a very clear cut procedure to deal with these kinds 
of things. There may have been a defect but I can assure the House 
that the department is on the issue.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> On the file, right Mr. 
Speaker?
<P>
	The issue is accountability and competence as the finance 
minister has mentioned. We even have a hard time finding out the 
secret ethics guidelines from the government that would be helping 
cabinet ministers and would be telling the Canadian public how 
they have to deal with cabinet ministers. The Prime Minister will 
not even make them available. He keeps them a secret.
<P>
	These files could have ended up in the hands of some 
unscrupulous individuals. In this case they did not. Those files 
were sent to me. They are in a sealed envelope and I will send them 
to Revenue Canada.
<P>
	When the finance minister finds out what did happen, will he 
inform the House what steps were taken to remedy the situation and 
what kind of discipline was meted out? The Liberals brag about

	<B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs.
<P>
	As eastern Zaire faces an unprecedented human disaster, there 
are rumours of Tutsi rebels having announced today a three-week 
unilateral ceasefire to allow those refugees who wish to flee to 
Rwanda to do so. However, emergency humanitarian relief still 
cannot get through. A dramatic plea has been made for the creation 
of humanitarian corridors to prevent thousands if not hundreds of 
thousands of persons from being killed.
<P>
<B>(1440)</B>
<P>
	Could the minister give us an update on the situation in eastern 
Zaire, where there are more than one million civilians affected by 
the fighting, and on the steps taken so far to establish corridors so 
that humanitarian relief can reach the refugees?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, first of all, I would like to say that the Government of 
Canada strongly supports ambassador Chrétien's efforts to find a 
solution and make recommendations to bring about reconciliation 
in the African great lakes region.
<P>
	Second, we have indicated that, through our colleague, the 
Minister of State responsible for Africa, we are considering ways 
of providing assistance to African groups proposing that a 
humanitarian corridor be established in Africa. Also, my colleague, 
the Minister of International Co-operation, is considering 
providing  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6061"> 6061 </A></B>
<P>
humanitarian aid, in response to calls from groups and other 
organizations.
<P>
	Generally speaking, we have responded by making an active 
effort on behalf of Canadians, and I hope that the diplomatic efforts 
will lead to a successful ceasefire.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in the context of the regional summit scheduled for 
tomorrow in Nairobi, strong pressure is being brought to bear on 
South Africa to stop selling weapons to Rwanda.
<P>
	On the basis of the special ties that Canada maintains with South 
Africa, will the minister undertake to join in asking South Africa to 
freeze all arms shipments to Rwanda?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we have expressed our deep concern about the sale of 
arms, not just by South Africa but by many western countries that 
are also engaged in the sale of arms in that region. It is something 
that I think has contributed substantially to the problem and we will 
follow through with our efforts.
<P>
	We are also undertaking very strong efforts with the government 
of Rwanda to begin to more actively prosecute the war criminal 
trials. Until that particular problem is met, the return of the 
refugees from Zaire becomes increasingly difficult. A number of 
efforts have to take place.
<P>
	I give the House full assurance that we are fully engaged in this 
file. The secretary of state has just returned from Africa. We will 
continue to use all our efforts to try to find some solution and 
particularly to help the approximately one million people who are 
now being faced with this enormous disruption to their lives.
<P>
	As Canadians we want to do the best we possibly can for that 
region.

	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on September 3, the conditional sentencing provisions of 
the government's legislation went into effect. The very next day an 
Ontario judge gave a conditional sentence to a man who had uttered 
death threats against his estranged spouse. She lives in fear and he 
walks.
<P>
	In October an Alberta man convicted of pointing a gun at his 
wife, and firing, it also got a conditional sentence. His sentence: no 
drugs or firearms and he is supposed to attend treatment programs.
<P>
<B>(1445 )</B>
<P>
	Bearing in mind that someone gets a minimum of four years for 
holding up a corner store with a toy gun, can the Minister of Justice 
explain to the victims of domestic violence why men who threaten 
their wives with real guns walk away with conditional sentences?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, first of all, the hon. member is not 
right about using a toy gun to hold up a store. That does not attract 
four years. That attracts one year under section 85.
<P>
	More to the point, the conditional sentence is part of Bill C-41. It 
was made part of the Criminal Code by the House of Commons last 
year because it provides the courts, in appropriate cases, with an 
alternative to incarceration where sentences are two years less a 
day or less.
<P>
	In those instances it is recognized that sometimes merely putting 
somebody in jail and locking the door is not necessarily the best 
approach. Maybe there are other steps which can be taken that are 
less costly and more effective in protecting the victim and in 
ensuring that the person does not commit another crime.
<P>
	We have provided, through the conditional sentence, another 
tool for the courts to use in determining the appropriate sentence. It 
is then up to the courts to decide whether, on the facts of any 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6062"> 6062 </A></B>
<P>
particular case, the conditional sentence is the appropriate 
disposition. We have done the right thing.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, at one time in Canada someone convicted of rape was 
subject to very severe penalties. Now with conditional sentencing 
their life does not seem to change much.
<P>
	A man in B.C. was just convicted of sexual assault. What was his 
punishment? He is on conditional release, scot free.
<P>
	These lenient decisions in three different provinces have set 
dangerous precedents. Section 742 states that a conditional 
sentence is not an option when there is a danger to the community. 
Are women not part of the community?
<P>
	Will the minister responsible for the legislation clarify this for 
women and, more important, for judges? He talks about a tool for 
the courts. He talks about appropriate cases. Will he clarify 
whether a conditional sentence is appropriate for rape?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 10 years ago Professor Anthony 
Doob of the University of Toronto did a study. He showed 
newspaper reports of sentences, in particular of criminal cases, to 
members of the public and asked them if they felt the sentences 
were strong enough. The vast majority felt they were not.
<P>
	He took the same people, the same cases, and provided all the 
information about the cases, all the facts involving the offender and 
the offences. After they had read all the facts a clear majority 
thought the sentences were too harsh.
<P>
	The reality is that when the court looks at the offender and the 
offence and takes all the circumstances into account, the court does 
a pretty fair job of determining appropriate punishment.
<P>
	Obviously, the business of this member is not to worry about the 
facts or the reality but to use fearmongering to make his squalid 
point. That is very regrettable and it is bad public policy.

	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the example

alternative measures being used in cases of domestic assault 
demonstrates the absolute hypocrisy of our justice system.
<P>
	Did the justice minister intend that alternative measures be used 
in cases of serious personal injury as in the cases cited by my

spouses to walk free by allowing them access to alternative

<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, part of the problem is illustrated by 
the hon. member's question. We are not discussing alternative 
measures. We are discussing, according to the former question, 
conditional sentences. They are very different.
<P>
	Alternative measures occur when a province decides to avail 
itself of those provisions in the code that allow it to take people out 
of the criminal law stream before they are dealt with by the courts. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6063"> 6063 </A></B>
<P>
That is only for non-violent crimes where the crown attorney 
agrees it is in the public interest to do so and where the person in 
question has acknowledged responsibility. That is, on the one hand, 
dealing with non-violent matters.
<P>
	Conditional sentences, on the other hand, occur after the charge 
and after the trial and where the court decides that a sentence of two 
years less a day or less is appropriate. Then people are permitted to 
serve their jail term in the community so to speak, subject to strict 
conditions. If they do not comply with them, they are 
reincarcerated.
<P>
	If the hon. member would take that definition of the terms and 
put his question, perhaps I could understand and respond to it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it was 
displayed very clearly in debates on Bill C-41 that alternative 
measures are offered to violent offenders.
<P>
	Would the Minister of Justice plug that loophole in Bill C-41 by 
amending it and denying violent offenders access to alternative 
measures? Will he, or will he not?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, Bill C-41 presented alternative 
measures as an option for provinces and is provided clearly on the 
basis that it is only to be used where it is consistent with public 
safety or it has the agreement of the crown attorney and where the 
offender acknowledges responsibility for the offence.
<P>
	I have written to the provincial attorneys general and asked them 
for their assurances that these would not be used specifically for 
domestic violence and other acts of violence, but only for 
appropriate cases where violence is not involved.
<P>
	That is exactly what these measures were intended to achieve.

	<B>Mr. Stan Dromisky (Thunder Bay-Atikokan, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister for International Trade.
<P>
	Recently the Canadian and United States governments signed a 
lumber agreement in which the Canadian government had to set 
quotas for those Canadian companies that are exporting softwood 
lumber to the United States.
<P>
	What is the government doing to ensure that the Canadian 
companies that have exceeded their quotas do not have to close 
their mills or lay off their employees?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ron MacDonald (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
for International Trade, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the member is right. 
The Canadian government entered into an agreement with the 
United States called the softwood lumber agreement in which 14.7 
billion board feet of lumber would be allowed to cross into the 
United States free of any fees for the next five years.
<P>
	Over the last two quarters, the price of Canadian lumber on the 
U.S. market has skyrocketed. One year ago today the price was 
about $233 U.S. It is now trading at about $505 U.S.
<P>
	As a result, many companies have decided to use more of their 
quotas in the first two quarters than what they would otherwise 
normally do because of the high price.
<P>
	Because the government has always maintained that it is 
concerned about jobs in that very important sector, the minister has 
put a number of options into the program that will allow for 
companies that find themselves at the quota wall and unable to ship 
as of Friday, to make a request to the government and be able to get 
some quota for future years so that the jobs in those mills will 
continue.

<P>
	Recently, during a meeting of the UN task force on indigenous 
people, a Canadian delegation recognized the right of the 
indigenous people to self-determination. The grand chief of the 
Cree, Matthew Coon Come, claims that this means that the 
Canadian government would allow the native people to separate 
from a sovereign Quebec.
<P>
	Could the Minister of Foreign Affairs clarify the nature and the 
extent of the government's position in this matter?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, the statement made in Geneva by the Canadian 
spokesperson on indigenous people's rights concerned 
international law and the right to self-determination. There was no 
reference to Quebec or Canada's internal situation. This was a 
matter under the UN-negotiated convention on indigenous people.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ): </B>Mr. Speaker, the 
minister might want to clarify this once and for all. I am asking him 
to set the record straight with regard to what the grand chief of the

referring to the business of the House should be introduced by the Government 
House Leader.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Speaker's rulings to this effect can be found in <I>Journals</I> from 
May 30, 1928, May 11, 1944 and May 2, 1961. Madam Speaker 
Sauvé ruled very clearly against such a motion's being proposed by 
a private member on April 21, 1982, as seen at pages 16701-2 of 
<I>Debates</I> for that date.
<P>
	On July 13, 1988 Mr. Speaker Fraser gave a more adventurous 
opinion, saying with regard to such motions: ``It is not the 
exclusive purview of the government despite the government's 
unquestioned prerogative to determine the agenda of business 
before the House''.
<P>
	On September 23 our present Speaker went one step further 
when he said: ``Under our current practices the Chair may well 
accept after due notice such a motion on the condition that it is very 
strictly limited to the terms of the committal of a bill to a 
committee and that it is not an attempt to interfere with the 
committee's proceedings thereon''.
<P>
<B>(1510)</B>
<P>
	The Speaker has said that such a motion may be in order but that 
if the motion sought to interfere with the committee's work on the 
bill other than to oblige the committee to complete its work by a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6066"> 6066 </A></B>
<P>
specified time, it would not be possible to admit such a motion 
under Routine Proceedings.
<P>
	If one reads the motion in question, one sees that the motion 
would not only order the committee to complete its study of the bill 
by a certain time, but it would also propose to instruct the 
committee that it cannot make any amendments to the proposed 
bill. This clearly and explicitly violates the conditions set down by 
Mr. Speaker on September 23 last.
<P>
	The motion is clearly an attempt to interfere improperly with the 
committee's proceedings on the bill in question and I submit that 
even if the motion were otherwise acceptable the inclusion of the 
words ``without amendment'' violates the conditions set down by 
the Speaker and makes this motion inadmissible under the rubric 
Routine Proceedings to propose a motion of this nature under 
Routine Proceedings.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, while this 
motion is in no way, shape or form intended to restrict the 
committee in doing its work, it only asks that the committee report 
back here and if it has not done so, that it be deemed to have done 
so by a certain date.
<P>
	Reform raised this point of privilege some weeks ago when the 
House reconvened. On September 23, 1996 you ruled, Mr. Speaker, 
that the matter was not a matter of privilege:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Since hon. members and the House have a remedy to their grievance I cannot find 
that the decision taken by the committee has prevented members from expressing 
their opinions or attending to their parliamentary functions.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Instead, Mr. Speaker, you viewed this as a substantial grievance 
and you pointed to a mechanism to resolve this matter:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>However, should the House be of the opinion that the bill has remained with the 
committee too long it can look into the matter.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	With respect to the committal of the bill a motion can be placed 
under the rubric motions. That is your ruling, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	This is precisely what the hon. member for Crowfoot has done. 
He did so because private members need to resolve this particular 
matter. This matter is important to the private member because it 
represents the larger question of whether a private member can 
present an alternative when faced with the disapproval of the 
government leadership.
<P>
	If this motion is not pursued at this time and, for example, is 
transferred to Government Orders, the answer to the above 
question would therefore be no.
<P>
	If it is to become a government order then only a cabinet 
minister will be able to continue the debate on this matter of a 
private member's business, and that would be a dangerous 
precedent. We, as private members, sent Bill C-234 to committee. 
We, as private members, should be able to cause a vote to take 
place on this motion.
<P>
	A thorough majority of the private members of this House have 
had no real input into the discussion. This does not necessarily 
mean that the majority wants the motion to be taken away and 
buried. We, as private members, may want to continue the debate 
on another day. If this issue is transferred, for example, to 
Government Orders, we allow the government to hide behind a 
technicality as raised by the chief government whip, which is how 
we got into this mess in the first place, and the government has now 
become involved in Private Members' business and impeded the 
process through a procedural trick. We cannot allow that to happen 
in this House.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I refer you to Standing Order No. 1:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In all cases not provided for hereinafter, or by other Order of the House, 
procedural questions shall be decided by the Speaker or Chairman-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I would also refer you to Beauchesne's sixth edition, citation 
1002 and 1006. These citations explain how it is the responsibility 
of the Speaker to carry out and arrange for scheduling as well as to 
determine priorities for Private Members' Business.
<P>
	This is the first time that we have had such a motion in this 
House with regard to this issue. Mr. Speaker, not only is it within 
your power to set a practice but it is your responsibility to ensure 
that a matter of Private Members' Business remains a matter of 
Private Members' Business.
<P>
<B>(1515 )</B>
<P>
	This motion must be allowed to remain before the House under 
motions so that a private member can resume that we can continue 
the debate. Another option is to consider transferring the motion to 
Private Members' Business as a votable item. In any event, we 
voted freely to have Bill C-234 referred to committee and we 
should vote freely to have Bill C-234 reported to the House.
<P>
	As private members and particularly as private members in a 
minority situation, we must be protected by the rules and we must 
be protected from government domination.
<P>
	The responsibility of deciding this issue rests with you, Mr. 
Speaker. I urge you to rule once again on the side of the private 
member.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ramsay:</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish to assure you that the motion I 
have placed before the House will in no way impede the work of 
the Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs. The 
committee has completely dealt with the bill. It decided by way of 
motion not to move the bill forward. The only alternative that I 
have to bring the bill back before the House to be dealt with by 
members  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6067"> 6067 </A></B>
<P>
of the House is to bring forward this motion as you indicated, Mr. 
Speaker, in your decision on the earlier motion.
<P>
	I wish to assure you that this motion does not interfere at all with 
the workings of the committee regarding the bill because the work 
of the committee has been absolutely finalized and completed. I 
place my remarks on the record for your purpose.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleagues, I do take a great interest in this 
motion and I am fully aware of the decision which I rendered on 
September 23.
<P>
	I have of course listened to the advice of the chief government 
whip. He raises one or two points that I wish to consider.
<P>
	I would like to take some time to once again go over the decision 
in light of the circumstances which have been brought forth and I 
will return to the House with a decision. In the meantime, this 
motion will remain on the Order Paper under Motions under 
Routine Business until I do render my decision. That will be as 
soon as I can get to it.

taxation of reading materials and that education and literacy are 
critical to the development of our country and a regressive tax on

	The House resumed consideration of Bill C-41 an act to amend 
the Divorce Act, the Family Orders and Agreements Enforcement 
Assistance Act, the Garnishment, Attachment and Pension 
Diversion Act and the Canada Shipping Act, as reported with 
amendments from the committee; and of Motion No. 13.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, are we 
considering the motion put forward by the Reform Party, Motion 
No. 13, from Group No. 3?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> Yes, the hon. member is 
right.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Gagnon (Québec):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to 
speak today on the motion put forward by my Reform colleagues. 
We cannot support this motion from the Reform member. Why? 
Because it provides for the Minister of Justice to lay before the 
House of Commons each proposed guideline and to refer it to a 
standing committee of the House.
<P>
	If the amendment were only to apply to the federal guidelines, it 
might be interesting, since hon. members would then have an 
opportunity to take part in this review. However, we find the 
amendment unacceptable because it says ``each proposed 
guideline'', and that would include all provincial guidelines.
<P>
	If we are to be consistent with the amendments we brought 
forward this morning, then we cannot support this motion. Pursuant 
to clause 1(3) of the bill, once the federal government has 
recognized the guidelines set by a province, these provincial 
guidelines are what is referred to as the applicable guidelines in the 
bill. The provincial guidelines replace the federal ones. We cannot 
let the guidelines set by Quebec, for instance, be reviewed and/or 
amended by a standing committee of the House of Commons, it is 
absolutely out of the question. This is why we are against this 
amendment.
<P>
	Earlier this morning, we explained some of our demands 
concerning the changes to be made to Bill C-41. Why? Because the 
province of Quebec is currently developing guidelines that will 
take into account Quebec's particular characteristics. These 
guidelines will take into consideration the interests of the child and 
all the transfers to both parents and children.
<P>
	The provinces should have an opportunity to explain the 
guidelines they developed based on the model most appropriate to 
their particular case, the province's social realities and the 
expectations of their residents, just like the guidelines soon to be 
approved in the province of Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1530)</B>
<P>
	We know how important it is that Quebec put its own guidelines 
forward and that they be adopted. With the discretionary power 
provided in Bill C-41, it is important that these guidelines be 
accepted by the federal government. We in the Bloc Quebec are not 
in favour of the discretionary power accorded the governor in 
council.
<P>
	Moreover, a set of criteria is introduced in the bill to define the 
guidelines. Right before the criteria, we can see the little word 
``including''.
<P>
	We propose that this word ``including'' be deleted so that, when 
the guidelines are accepted by the federal government, we will not 
have to reopen the bill or to introduce another one. I think that 
Quebec wants more freedom to act. We know how complex the 
situation is in matters of divorce and separation.
<P>
	Divorce falls within federal jurisdiction and separation within 
Quebec jurisdiction. As we all know, the guidelines have to be the 
same across the board. This is provided in the bill at the federal 
level but not at the provincial level. Thus, this motion by the 
Reform Party is not acceptable.
<P>
	However, I want to tell you about some privileges Quebec wants 
to gain from the guidelines. When I say privileges, I mean respect. 
Not so much a privilege as a respect of Quebec's will.
<P>
	It is clear in this bill that the federal government goes one way 
and Quebec another. This bill is very revealing. Quebec wants the 
guidelines to apply where children reside and not where the 
non-custodial parent resides. If the criteria for developing the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6070"> 6070 </A></B>
<P>
guidelines in one province favour the non-custodial parent, we 
know very well that the non-custodial parent will compare the 
benefits in various provinces.
<P>
	That is why the child's well-being is paramount and the bill as 
introduced by the minister does not take into account first and 
foremost the needs of the child. We know that the guidelines put 
forward by the federal government take into account only the 
income tax to be paid. This is not the case for Quebec. Quebec 
takes a  number of considerations into account, including family 
and social issues and the needs of the child.
<P>
	I wish the government would rethink certain aspects of the bill. 
The government is asking the provinces to propose guidelines, but I 
think this bill does not show any respect for the work that the 
provinces will do when it says that the governor in council may, by 
order, designate a province for the purposes of the definition of 
``applicable guidelines''. I do not see how the wishes of a province 
can be respected.
<P>
	We know that there are many inconsistencies between the federal 
and the provincial guidelines. I wonder how it will be possible to 
satisfy both Quebec's and Ottawa's wishes.
<P>
	I would also like to talk about another aspect of the bill.
<P>
<B>(1535)</B>
<P>
	There is no question of an agreement between spouses to change 
the amount or some other aspect of the guidelines. The needs and 
the welfare of the child must come first.
<P>
	Therefore, we are against this motion brought forward by the 
Reform Party and we hope the government will follow up on the 
various motions we proposed to improve this bill in order to respect 
the provinces' wishes, because the provinces are closer to the 
people and their concerns and our motions take into account 
various legislative provisions that are already in force in Quebec.
<P>
	If the Minister of Justice wanted this bill to serve the child's 
interest first and foremost, the Liberals would have to accept a few 
modifications proposed by the Bloc Quebecois, with every respect 
for the provinces and the federal legislation. We might have liked 
to have seen a single orientation concerning divorces and 
separations, with the same guidelines, but we know that the federal 
level has full jurisdiction over divorces.
<P>
	I will close my speech here, with the hope that my colleagues 
will also be able to make this government listen to making some 
changes for the better to this bill, and that these changes will be 
more respectful of the will of the provinces, as Quebec is working 
on this too at the moment. Why then duplicate the analyses done in 
Quebec? It is clear to me, however, that the analyses done in 
Quebec are not the same as those done by the federal level. This is 
why we were elected. We were elected to speak for the specific 
nature of Quebec, to ensure that it is respected far more than it is 
today. Unfortunately, we must bring this to your attention, and we 
trust that this government will make an effort to understand the 
Quebec reality, because it is not all that obvious that it is.
<P>
	We speak up about numerous bills, inviting the government to 
respect the wishes of Quebec, but the message falls on deaf ears 
every time.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
will respond very briefly to the motion put forward by the Reform 
Party.
<P>
	It is interesting to note the consistent theme that runs through the 
amendments put forward by the Reform Party. First, the motions 
seek to render ineffective the guidelines that have been put forward 
for a very distinct and proper purpose, that is, to provide 
consistency to maintenance awards for children, to provide that the 
custodial spouse and the children will receive adequate support and 
the support awards will be consistent within provinces and across 
the country.
<P>
	In addition to that theme, hearkening back to a process that is 50 
years old, we also see what seems to be another consistent thread. 
The motions put forward would have the effect of delaying the 
implementation of the bill. Quite frankly if the suggestion put 
forward in Motion No. 13 was accepted by the federal government, 
the process of implementation would be delayed.
<P>
	Justice delayed is justice denied. The government will do 
everything in its power to ensure that the guidelines and legislation 
will be able to go ahead on March 1, 1997.
<P>
<B>(1540 )</B>
<P>
	Members of the Bloc are suggesting that somehow this deals 
with provincial authority in an inappropriate fashion. Once again I 
remind the House of my answer to similar statements made by the 
Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
	First, this is an area of sole federal jurisdiction. Second, the 
guidelines which have been put in place are different from province 
to province, respecting and reflecting the various differences that 
exist within the provinces. Third, provisions within the bill state 
that where provincial guidelines are found to be acceptable, they 
would be allowed to function as the guidelines for the purposes of 
this bill.
<P>
	The government is opposed to this motion because it would 
delay the implementation of the bill. It would like to see the system 
move ahead so that greater consistency, predictability and the 
enforceability of awards can all be improved as we work on a 
system that has been functioning for 50 years and is desperately in 
need of modernization and update.

<P>
	It is all very clear, however. We made a series of proposals, a 
series of motions this morning to amend the government's position 
on the very important concept of residence, in other words, that this 
should mean the child's place of residence to prevent any 
ambiguity in interpreting the guidelines.
<P>
	We tabled motions on the federal government's discretionary 
powers to adopt or not to adopt the guidelines of a province. Here 
again, the government turned a deaf ear.
<P>
	We presented a motion on vested rights, to tell the government 
that if Quebec, for instance, establishes guidelines according to the 
present rules of the game, we would not want a subsequent 
Conservative, Reform Party or even Liberal government, under 
another prime minister, to be able to change these guidelines at 
will. We presented a motion for vested rights, and here again, the 
government seems to turn a deaf ear.
<P>
	We also presented a motion to prevent the application of certain 
national standards. We definitely want the guidelines presented by 
Quebec to apply in cases of divorce and separation.
<P>
	I heard the parliamentary secretary say in reply to the Bloc 
Quebecois that the Divorce Act was a federal statute. We do not 
challenge that fact. We know that the Divorce Act is a federal 
statute. We know that according to the Constitution, the federal 
government has jurisdiction over the Divorce Act. What we are 
saying is that this is unacceptable.
<P>
	In Quebec, people get married under the laws of Quebec. They 
have children under the laws of Quebec. The children are registered 
with the registrar for births, deaths and marriages under the laws of 
Quebec. In a family, people make purchases, buy a house and cars. 
The family property comes under Quebec's jurisdiction. If things 
do not work out, people separate under the laws of Quebec. But 
divorce is a federal matter.
<P>
	That is what is wrong and why everything is so complicated. On 
the weekend we saw that Quebec wanted to adopt a family policy. 
There is a consensus on this in Quebec. That was clear, and I think 
that my friends opposite-not my friends, because they are not 
really my friends-I am sure that hon. members opposite saw there 
was a consensus in Quebec on family policy this past weekend.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	But they are turning a deaf ear to it. To translate this consensus 
into concrete action, they could give a helping hand and start 
changing some things. But no. We have seen, through justice 
parliamentary secretary for justice, that the government seems 
adamant in its refusal to consider any amendment, any proposal 
from the official  opposition, the Bloc Quebecois, in keeping with 
the general consensus and the will at large to see things change; but 
the government in Ottawa has decided in its ivory tower, in a 
characteristically paternalistic fashion, as one of my colleagues 
said, not to budge.
<P>
	I am happy, however, that the Reform Party is not in power 
because the motion it presented says a lot on the way English 
Canada sees things and on its intentions. Somehow, the Reform 
Party has a lot in common with the way the Liberals think and act.
<P>
	With regard to Motion No. 13 presented by the Reform Party, 
which appears innocuous, ordinary enough, one might think that, 
after all, Reform has good intentions, it wants the federal 
government to support it, to look at it, it wants the elected 
representatives to have a look at the guidelines.
<P>
	The Reform Party's motion asks that Bill C-41, in clause 11, be 
amended by adding the following:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``26.2(1) The Minister of Justice shall have each proposed guideline laid before 
the House of Commons.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(2) Each proposed guideline that is laid before the House of Commons shall, on 
the day it is laid, be referred by that House to an appropriate committee of that 
House, as determined by the rules of that House, and that committee shall report its 
findings to that House.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(3) A proposed guideline that has been laid pursuant to subsection (1) may be 
established on the expiration of thirty sitting days after it was laid.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(4) For the purpose of this section, ``sitting day'' means a day on which the House 
of Commons sits.''</BLOCKQUOTE>
	If one looks at this amendment, it does not seem that bad. But 
what is really hiding behind it? What is hiding is English Canada's 
desire to centralize even further an issue Quebec believes should be 
decentralized, to the extent that it should be an area of exclusive 
jurisdiction for Quebec.
<P>
	Sometimes the Liberals and the Reform Party question the 
necessity of having Bloc Quebecois members in this House. I think 
we have another opportunity to show how important it is for 
Quebec to have Bloc Quebecois members in this House, to prevent 
the Reform Party from proposing very centralizing measures and 
the government from proposing centralizing bills.
<P>
	This motion shows the true philosophy of English Canada, which 
wants to centralize everything in Ottawa.
<P>
	What does that mean in practice? It means that, if the motion is 
carries without amendment, all guidelines adopted by Quebec will 
have to be submitted to the justice minister who will, in turn, 
submit them to the Standing Committee on Justice and Legal 
Affairs for further study.
<P>
	We all know that Quebec intends to implement such guidelines. 
We even have some information concerning those guidelines. The 
justice minister would simply submit those guidelines to the 
committee for its consideration. For example, if Quebec considers 
that it is important for the guidelines to be based on the real cost of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6072"> 6072 </A></B>
<P>
a child's needs, we, in Quebec, will find it crucial that the 
guidelines be determined accordingly. However, if we submit them 
to the committee, it could decide that, at the federal level, this is 
not important and that Quebec will have to change its guidelines so 
that they are based in part on a legal obligation to maintain the 
standard of living. Quebec would not have a say in this.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	This is what the Reform Party motion could mean for Quebec. 
There are a series of guidelines which Quebec examined and, if the 
motion is carried, these could be reviewed by the Standing 
Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs. You will surely 
understand that it would be unacceptable for the federal 
government to dictate the rules and determine the procedures in an 
area like family policy which is so important for the future of 
Quebec.
<P>
	I must say that, when I speak about family and family policy, 
unfortunately, this also includes separation and divorce. After a 
divorce, the children are still there and they must be supervised and 
protected, because they are the ones who are the most vulnerable in 
a separation. Our role, as members of Parliament here, is to pass 
legislation that would best protect these children.
<P>
	Bill C-41 that the government proposes to us is, as a whole, a 
step forward, but there are several little points that are disturbing, 
that are not in line with Quebec's claims, among others, of course, 
the points that I mentioned at the very beginning of my speech 
concerning residence, at the government's discretion.
<P>
	More specifically, Quebec's position, the position defended by 
the Bloc Quebecois, goes against Motion No. 13 proposed by the 
Reform Party. You will understand that we will vote against this 
motion.
<P>
	In concluding, I would also like to say that, while we seem to 
challenge or argue several of the points in Bill C-41, as a whole, 
this bill seems favourable to us. That must be kept in mind. As a 
whole, Bill C-41 was asked for repeatedly by the official 
opposition. We wanted a legislative measure, but not one with 
these points that are not favourable to Quebec. I will have the 
opportunity to come back to Bill C-41, since there are other 
motions, because I have so many things to say about this bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> First of all, I would like 
to congratulate you, Mr. Speaker, on your appointment, since this is 
the first opportunity I have had to speak since then. I had the 
pleasure of sitting with you on the joint committee on regulation, 
where I appreciated your contribution to each of the debates we had 
in the other place.
<P>
	Today, we are once again inundated, literally inundated with 
motions put forward by the Reform Party that do little if anything 
to improve the bill before us.
<P>
	The latest proposal would require the Minister of Justice to table 
every proposed guideline before this House for referral to a 
standing committee of the House of Commons.
<P>
	We in the Bloc Quebecois have a problem living with the 
proposed amendment, and particularly with the word ``each''. This 
would have the effect of including provincial guidelines. Basically, 
what this amendment tells us is that provincial guidelines 
recognized by the federal government will be those referred to by 
the term guideline in the legislation.
<P>
	All this is is a switch between provincial and federal guidelines. 
And that is unacceptable to us in the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	In fact, there is consensus around this issue in Quebec. Our 
system, the one currently used in Quebec, works just fine. The 
measures approved and adopted last year for the collection of out 
of province support have pleased almost everyone.
<P>
	These guidelines met the needs of Quebecers. They also met the 
needs of children. To the extent possible, these guidelines have 
done the most to ensure the well-being of children, although this is 
an area where there is always room for improvement. Not every 
case is the same. Almost all decisions have to be made on a 
case-by-case basis.
<P>
	The amendment put forward by the Reform Party does not 
improve the bill in any way. It still gives the federal government 
the right to replace the whole Quebec system with its own. In fact, 
clause 1(4) provides that the governor in council may, by order, 
designate a province for the purposes of the definition ``applicable 
guidelines''. That is interference.
<P>
	The verb ``may'' is used. Let us consider its meaning. Any 
guidelines issued by a province must be approved by the federal 
government to become applicable. This is another example of 
centralization, of paternalism. They are not withdrawing but 
centralizing even further. The federal government imposes its 
vision on the provinces, although this vision is not always in line 
with reality.
<P>
	Which government is better able to meet these needs? Federal 
rejection of the guidelines established by a province could give rise 
to some absurd situations. The most striking example is that of a 
separation handled according to provincial guidelines, while the 
divorce would have to follow federal guidelines. This could make a 
huge difference in the ruling, in the amount of support for each 
child.
<P>
	The Quebec legislation on separation is more generous than the 
federal law on divorce. This clause must disappear. Such iniquities 
are unacceptable. The discretionary power given by the verb 
``may'' must be taken away from the federal government.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6073"> 6073 </A></B>
<P>
	This is what gives the amendment proposed by my colleague 
from Québec its whole meaning. This amendment is aimed at 
limiting the list of criteria the provinces must comply with to have 
their guidelines recognized by the federal government as 
superseding its own.
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	I ask government members to reflect on the amendment 
proposed by the Bloc Quebecois, so that the provinces' guidelines 
are approved by this government. In fact, the amendment provides 
that, once a province has complied with federal criteria, its own 
guidelines will automatically replace those of the federal 
government. This would prevent strange situations where children, 
whom the act is supposed to protect, would suffer from a measure 
that would have become unfair.
<P>
	I will conclude by pointing out that selecting the payer's address 
as the place of residence, instead of the child's domicile, for 
support purposes, creates an enormous problem. Those who avoid 
their responsibilities in this regard often do so simply by virtue of 
the fact that the payer's place of residence was chosen, instead of 
the child's domicile.
<P>
	We have a lot before us. The Bloc Quebecois tabled its 
amendments. I ask members opposite to carefully review each of 
the proposed amendments, not in our interests, but in the interests 
of our children.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is my turn to 
congratulate you on your appointment, since this is the first time I 
have risen in this House while you are in the chair.
<P>
	The public must have realized by now that the official opposition 
has been spending a lot of time adding subtlety and drawing 
attention to one important factor: the famous guidelines. Whether 
they are called guidelines, national standards or national goals, 
they are all the same to me. They reflect the federal government's 
intention, its one constant goal, which is to set criteria and to 
impose them on the provinces. The Reform Party's proposal goes 
in the same direction. The Reform Party goes even further than the 
Liberal Party. It wants the guidelines to be tabled in the House of 
Commons. Therefore, the federal government would reign 
supreme.
<P>
	I am not a former history professor like my hon. colleague from 
Mercier, but I have read a lot of books on this topic, as I imagine 
many Canadians and Quebecers have done.
<P>
	Recently, I was rereading Mr. Lacoursière. What is Canada made 
of? What is Canada? What is the Canadian Confederation? What is 
the Act of 1867? It was the unification of Upper Canada and Lower 
Canada to form Confederation. Then two former British colonies 
joined in, and that gave us the four founding provinces of the 
Canadian Confederation.
<P>
	At the time, according to the spirit and the letter of the 
agreement, there was to have been not only a federal Parliament, 
but also provinces that would work together to try to forecast and 
structure the future of the country, its social climate and that of its 
member states.
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
	But then, we have to recognize that the current government 
continues a heavy practice. No need to list all the bills that have 
been passed here, but what do we see in most of them, in the major 
ones? There were national standards concerning post-secondary 
education. There were also national standards concerning student 
loans. Concerning health care, we all know the five famous 
guidelines which the federal government insists that we follow in 
spite of cuts in the provincial spending and in the transfers to the 
provinces.
<P>
	What is the impact of all these measures? The provinces are 
obliged to cut health care. Free education and access to education 
are called into question. Apart from the cuts to unemployment 
insurance, certain vested rights of the provinces, including Quebec, 
are called into question.
<P>
	And always these same guidelines. Sometimes, it is a question of 
principle, but we must be cautious with matters of principle. The 
Bloc Quebecois, the official opposition, has a responsibility to 
criticize, to see to it that words really say what they mean to say in 
the bill and to anticipate applications down the road.
<P>
	Obviously, the concept of federalism of the members opposite 
and the third party is very different from the one Quebecers have 
always had. The federal government always prevail over the 
powers and responsibilities of the provinces, while, as I said, there 
was originally a spirit of equality, a balance of powers.
<P>
	Unfortunately, this Prime Minister's Liberal government 
increasingly takes advantage of all opportunities to monitor, limit 
the powers and dictate the guidelines of the provinces. This touches 
upon the most distinct elements of the Quebec society, since 
families and children are its future, because we do not want to 
remain silent each time the current federal government tries to put 
the Quebec government in its place.
<P>
	The hon. member for Berthier-Montcalm rightly reminded us 
that we get married under the civil code and that Quebec is the only 
province to have a distinct civil code. And we divorce under the 
federal system? That is completely nonsensical. However, I can 
understand why members from other provinces do not see any 
problem in that. They are not in the same situation as Quebec 
because they have no civil code, they have the same system as the 
federal government.
<P>
	To them, it does not make any difference if you get married 
under the provincial system and you get divorced under the federal 
system. I understand. That is one of the problems of federalism as 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6074"> 6074 </A></B>
<P>
it exists now. I have  travelled a lot outside Quebec, and we are 
always faced with the same misunderstanding. Even the most 
fair-minded people do not understand our situation. One day, you 
will have to recognize that our system in Quebec is different from 
that of the other provinces. That is what we have been telling you 
and that is why many of us are taking part in this debate today, to 
show you once again that we are different. You have to understand 
that.
<P>
	We are different and we want to stay that way. We understand 
what is good and what is not. There are extraordinary principles in 
this bill, but the problem is in the way they are applied.
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	That is the area where, suspicious as we are, we are concerned 
about inequities. And with good reason. Bill after bill, we keep 
proposing amendments that would help Quebec feel more 
comfortable in the federal system, but the government keeps 
rejecting them each and every time. We were showered with love a 
few days before the referendum, but we can see that, one year later, 
those sentiments have cooled off somewhat.
<P>
	So we have to repeat over and over again, as we are doing today, 
that we are different. From now on, we want laws that reflect our 
differences, our culture, our special way of doing things. It is as 
simple as that. It is not an aggressive message. We are not saying 
that the other provinces are wrong not to attach that much 
importance to this issue. But, to us, it is very important.
<P>
	And it is not only for us. Since we are talking about children 
here, we are talking about the future, and when we talk about the 
future, we must take all the necessary precautions to make sure that 
those who will come after us recognize the important work we are 
doing today. That is why, once again, we must explain to our 
colleagues from the two other parties in this House that we are 
indeed different.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
important that this amendment not be passed. This amendment was 
presented by a Reform Party member and says:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>26.2 (1) The Minister of Justice shall have each proposed guideline laid before the 
House of Commons.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(2) Each proposed guideline that is laid before the House of Commons shall, on 
the day it is laid, be referred by the House to an appropriate committee of that House, 
as determined by the rules of that House, and that committee shall report its findings 
to that House.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(3) A proposed guideline that has been laid pursuant to subsection (1) may be 
established on the expiration of thirty day sitting days after it is laid.-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This morning, the members of the Bloc said many times that the 
law should confirm that Quebec is, in fact, responsible for defining 
and formulating the guidelines if it meets the conditions stated in 
clause 26.1.
<P>
	I would remind the viewers who are watching today's debates 
that, if the issue of child support and treatment of children in child 
support is discussed here in the House of Commons even though it 
seems clearly to be a matter of civil law, it is because there is a 
strange separation of powers between the provinces and the federal 
government in the Constitution.
<P>
	On the one side, marriage is a provincial matter, and divorce, a 
federal matter. I remind you that in Quebec, the people who 
separate without divorcing-and there are many of them-or leave 
one another in some other way represent 40 per cent of those who 
are involved in the allocation of child support.
<P>
	Quebec has a distinct civil code. Just as distinct as its society. 
The Civil Code has been in effect since Quebec was a French 
colony. It has been revised, but it is still completely different in 
spirit from British common law.
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	In this context, Quebec has developed its own family policy and 
has shown again last week that it intends to apply its own principles 
in this area. It must be said that Quebec has to have complete 
control over the guidelines that will apply to the people who decide 
to separate or to get a divorce to ensure that all children who are 
affected are treated in the same way.
<P>
	If it were adopted, this amendment proposed by the members of 
the third party would force the government to refer to the 
appropriate committee the guidelines proposed by Quebec to see if 
they are compatible with the federal guidelines. What we are 
saying is that this is absolutely not the way to go.
<P>
	In Quebec, we do not want two kinds of children, that is those 
whose parents are separated under the provincial system and those 
whose parents are divorced under the federal system. It would 
make no sense. It would show that the situation has become 
unbearable.
<P>
	We think the government should accept the amendment in which 
the Bloc proposes that the governor in council recognize the right 
of a province to formulate and enforce its own guidelines, provided 
they meet all the necessary requirements.
<P>
	It is hard to imagine that a committee would study Quebec's or 
another province's guidelines to compare them to those of the 
federal government. If my colleague's amendment was to ensure 
that the federal government would table its own guidelines, which 
several other provinces would follow since they would not mind 
having guidelines established by the central government, then I 
would understand the purpose of this amendment. The committee 
would study these guidelines that would apply to all provinces 
except Quebec.
<P>
	We are often in this situation. Obviously, and this bears 
repeating, many provinces in Canada do not feel the way Quebec 
feels about the central government, and  that is normal. Canada is 
one people and one nation, and Quebec is one people and one 
nation. It 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6075"> 6075 </A></B>
<P>
is fine by us if nobody in Canada minds if the central government 
determines the guidelines, but, if that is the case, we think it only 
right that the government be required to table its planned 
guidelines.
<P>
	But what we simply cannot agree with, and this is important, is 
that if colleagues do not intend this amendment to include Quebec, 
then they should spell this out, because otherwise, we are very 
much against the amendment, which would mean comparing 
Quebec's guidelines to the federal guidelines, for we know not 
what purpose.
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
	The draft guidelines tabled on June 28, 1996 give an idea of the 
major differences between a so-called Quebec model that would be 
used to determine child support payments and a federal model.
<P>
	In Quebec, we say that one of the criteria must be that support 
payments must be based on the real cost of raising a child. The 
federal government says they should be based on the partial 
equalization of standards of living. These are two different points 
of view that can be explained by the fact that in Quebec we are 
looking at income and standard of living in Quebec, while it is 
obvious that different standards of living are being considered for 
the rest of Canada.
<P>
	This morning, I was recalling that, last week, the federal 
government decided that the minimum wage for institutions 
dependent on the federal government would be in line with the 
provincial minimum wage. The minimum wage is $4.75 in 
Newfoundland, and $7.00 in British Columbia, which shows the 
marked difference in the general standard of living. We can 
understand that the differences are explained by the population, the 
labour market and the differing social and economic conditions 
across Canada.
<P>
	There is another principle as well. Quebec says ``based on both 
parents' ability to pay''. Financial responsibility is shared between 
the two parents, prorated according to their resources. We know 
that the husband often earns more. The federal model assumes that 
the incomes of both parents are equal, even if in reality this is not 
the case. Only the gross revenue of the non-custodial parent is 
considered.
<P>
	I could continue to show you the significant differences.
<P>
	With your permission, Mr. Speaker, I would like to propose an 
amendment to the amendment.
<P>
	I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the words ``each proposed guideline'' be deleted and replaced by ``every 
proposed guideline'' and that, at the end of the first sentence, the following be 
added:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``when subsection 1(3) has not been enforced.''</BLOCKQUOTE>
	My speech has addressed the intent of this amendment.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> The Chair will consider 
the motion tabled by the hon. member for Mercier and will render 
its decision to the House.
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
	The motion by the hon. member for Mercier is in order.
<P>
	Is the House ready for the question?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Question.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> The vote is on the 
amendment to the amendment. Is it the pleasure of the House to 
adopt the amendment to the amendment?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> All those in favour will 
please say yea.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Yea.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> All those opposed will 
please say nay.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Nay.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> In my opinion the nays 
have it.
<P>
	<I>And more than five members having risen:</I>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> A recorded division on the 
proposed motion stands deferred.
<P>
	Next before the House is report stage Motion No. 14, the next 
grouping in the debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Motion No. 14</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-41, in Clause 22, be amended by replacing line 2 on page 21 with the 
following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``fifty days have expired after the notice''</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, just to clarify, were we to vote on Group 
No. 3 as well as the Bloc subamendment, in other words, my 
amendment, Motion No. 13?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> The hon. member is quite 
correct. The question was put to the House on the subamendment. 
A recorded division was demanded and therefore it was deferred.
<P>
	At the conclusion of the vote on the subamendment, the question 
will be put on the amendment that the hon. member has put before 
the House.
<P>
	The debate is now on Motion No. 14, Group No. 4.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> Mr. Speaker, very 
simply this amendment extends the period for a non-custodial 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6076"> 6076 </A></B>
<P>
spouse to react to the receipt of the notice  that their passport may 
be suspended or a federal licence withdrawn.
<P>
<B>(1630)</B>
<P>
	This particular clause found on page 21 of Bill C-41 states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(4) An application may be made only after thirty days have expired after the 
notice referred to in subsection (3) was received by the debtor.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Basically what this amendment does is extend that notice from 
30 days to 50 days. We feel that in some cases where the individual 
may be out of the country or, goodness knows, we have even seen 
to get a letter across Canada can take a considerable period of time, 
it is in the best interests of all concerned to ensure that the 
individual has sufficient notice in order to respond. We just want to 
be reasonably sure that will happen.
<P>
	Basically that clarifies our position for putting this amendment 
forward. However, I would like to use the remaining time I have to 
clarify our positions on a number of other issues raised by the hon. 
Parliament Secretary to the Minister of Justice, the member for 
Prince Albert-Churchill River, during his intervention.
<P>
	The points put forward by the hon. parliamentary secretary are 
absolutely ridiculous. Let us just have a quick look at what exactly 
he said during his intervention. He said that maintenance payments 
are not linked to access, custody or mediation issues. I think the 
statistics prove, as I said during my remarks, that the exact opposite 
is the case. I do not know what statistics or evidence he has to 
support that nonsensical response, but I am quite appalled that he 
says they are not linked. I would suggest that he talk to anyone who 
has gone through a divorce and who has children involved to see 
that the two subjects are very clearly linked.
<P>
	As I pointed out during my remarks, what we have seen is that 
where access and custody of the children in question by the 
non-custodial parent was more usual in the arrangement and was 
quite freely given, what invariably happened was compliance with 
support payments for those same children also increased in direct 
proportion to access.
<P>
	There are clearly enough statistics around to show that. 
Therefore I would certainly dispute the hon. parliamentary 
secretary's position that the two things are to be dealt with quite 
separately and are not linked.
<P>
	He also asked who suffers. He said, as <I>Hansard</I> would clearly 
show, that it is the women and children. Very clearly the women 
and children do suffer. We are all well aware of that. However, the 
fact is that when a marriage breaks down and when some parents 
are de-parented because of the process there are many people who 
suffer. Grandparents suffer and fathers suffer as well.
<P>
	As I said during my remarks and during my speech on Bill C-41 
about a month ago, I believe October 3, I very  clearly stated that I 
am not an advocate for non-custodial parents. I am not an advocate 
for the fathers, nor am I for the mothers in this situation. I am an 
advocate for the children. I believe it is in the children's best 
interest to have access to both parents. I have said it before and I 
will say it again. I do not understand how it is that when a marriage 
and a relationship is intact both parents are considered good 
parents, acting in a manner consistent with the best interests of 
their children, and yet somehow immediately upon the disillusion 
of their relationship this is no longer the case.
<P>
	We see time and time again where the non-custodial parent is 
denied access to their children. If they are considered a good parent 
when their relationship was intact, why in heaven's name are they 
not when they are separated? When a relationship ends the fathers, 
in most cases, still want to be involved and active in performing the 
role of a parent. In many cases, unfortunately, that is denied.
<P>
<B>(1635)</B>
<P>
	The other point the parliamentary secretary made was that our 
amendments would return the system to complete uncertainty. We 
talk about fear mongering. We talk about the usual Liberal diatribe 
where they attack Reform every time we try to improve their 
legislation. He went on to say that our amendments would render 
guidelines ineffective. That is more fear mongering. It is clearly 
not the case.
<P>
	What we have said is that this is a complex issue. We cannot 
impose arbitrary guidelines and then say to the courts that this is 
how it is going to be. Even in his intervention what he went on to 
say was that we need to do it on a case by case basis. That is a clear 
contradiction. On the one hand he attacks Reform because we say 
that before the court imposes these arbitrary guidelines, we have 
agreed there is a need for national consensus, national standards to 
apply, but before the court looks at that, Reform we would like it to 
take into consideration mediation. We would like it to take into 
consideration the best interests of the child, what is in the best 
interest of the child or the children, and also to take into 
consideration the non-custodial parent's ability to pay.
<P>
	As I said earlier during this debate, prior to question period, the 
reality is it makes absolutely no sense to impose some arbitrary 
guideline, some arbitrary standard, only to find out later that the 
non-custodial parent simply cannot afford that and no matter how 
much he would like to, he cannot pay that amount.
<P>
	As the parliamentary secretary said very clearly, we have to look 
at this on a case by case basis. That is the one thing that he said that 
I heartily agree with. His other points are, as I said, very clearly 
fear mongering and trying to suggest that Reform is somehow 
against the women and children who very clearly need more 
certainty.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6077"> 6077 </A></B>
<P>
	We are not denying that something has to be done with the 
Divorce Act and something has to be done with this subject. What 
we are saying is we believe we need a comprehensive look at this 
subject. The hon. justice minister has promised Canadians a 
comprehensive review of this whole subject matter. 
Comprehensive to us deals with much more than just the tax 
implications or getting tough on non-custodial parents' 
non-payment of support or maintenance.
<P>
	Comprehensive means looking at the access and custody issues, 
looking at having mandatory mediation as a necessary step. What 
may happen with that is that some lawyers would not get as much 
work as they would like. That is not necessarily a bad thing.
<P>
	I believe in balance if people will look at what Reform has been 
doing on this bill, look at the amendments that we have been 
bringing forward, they will understand that we are trying to address 
a lot of issues, not just putting blinders on and looking at the 
maintenance payment issue by itself.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
amendment, proposed by the hon. member for the Reform Party, 
deals with the denial of schedule licences to debtors when the latter 
are in persistent arrears. When we read the definition of this 
expression, we see that this is about extreme cases where debtors 
have failed to make in full the payments required in respect of any 
three payment periods, usually three months, or who owe the child 
at least $3,000.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	The bill is clear, and we agree with what the bill proposes to do. 
We agree because licence denials are explained in detail in 
interpretation section 62. So, licence means ``a licence, a permit, a 
certificate or an authorization of any kind, and includes a passport 
in the meaning of section 2''; ``schedule licence means a licence of 
a type or class set out in the schedule''; and ``provincial 
enforcement service has the meaning assigned by section 2''.
<P>
	The resources available are clearly defined in this section of the 
bill. These are means of dealing with debtors who, despite every 
reasonable attempt to make them do so, will not make their 
payments to the custodial parent-the wife, in many cases-or to 
creditors who have a stake in the payment of support payments.
<P>
	So when the province applies to the federal government, this is 
after it has made every attempt to force payments. In this case, the 
Reform proposal would extend the period to 50 days from the 
prescribed 30 days. So the bill is clear. It provides that a provincial 
government may ask the federal government to refuse the issue of, 
suspend or not renew a licence for these debtors, once the 
provincial government has made every attempt to enforce the 
support order, but to no avail. To no avail means that every possible 
measure has been taken by the province. And even if a debtor were 
to say he had not been contacted by the province, I believe there 
would be enough evidence to prove that such contacts were made 
and that the debtor failed to respond to a provincial request.
<P>
	So I see no need for proposing such an amendment when we 
realize that the present period provided by the federal government 
is 30 days after notice was sent by the province to the debtor before 
an application for licence denial may be filed.
<P>
	We all know that women are often penalized, when we consider 
that in 1990, 67 per cent of individuals who received support 
payments were women.
<P>
	So we do not think we should support this kind of amendment to 
the bill. We know very well that huge amounts are often at stake 
when one is waiting for overdue support payments. For instance, a 
deadbeat parent is not someone who wakes up one morning 
thinking he is not going to pay support for a couple of months; we 
believe that these are people who do it repeatedly, not innocently, 
over a period of three payments, and that the amounts involved are 
evaluated at over $3,000. Therefore, the time frame is very realistic 
and we do not believe that this motion should go ahead.
<P>
	I am in favour of payments being made as soon as possible, this 
is desirable. What the bill is proposing is very clear and promises 
that deadbeat parents be, once and for all, with their back to the 
wall, and that the government be able to act by way of a piece of 
legislation making it very clear how to quickly obtain payment of 
the amounts owed.
<P>
	To think that Bill C-41 was introduced by the government to 
really improve the situation for children. This is exactly what we 
want. This was at our request, we want this bill to be enforceable 
and we want no more delays, no more wait for the parents owed 
support, who often must face such delays.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	Unfortunately, too often they are women; as we know they hold 
part time jobs, their job situation is precarious, and often they are 
the ones who have to provide for their children. We know that more 
often than not support payments are well below what it takes to 
raise a child nowadays.
<P>
	In any case, I believe we have the responsibility to take care of 
our children, and therefore it is the responsibility of the non 
custodial parent to make support payments, often to the detriment 
of the parent who has custody of the child.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak to the next batch of amendments. 
With the indulgence of the members present I will refresh their 
memories.
<P>
	When I was speaking on the last batch of amendments I was 
quoting from an article in the September 28 issue of <I>The 
Economist</I>. It discussed the notion of crime, particularly violent 
crime, by youth. The article dealt with crime in western Europe and 
America.
<P>
	It was interesting to note from the article that 50 per cent of 
violent crime was caused by males under the age of 24. About 24 
per cent was caused by males under the age of 18. Males compared 
to females are far more involved in crime and in particular violent 
crime. The article went on to make the case that the one overriding 
consideration which affects those statistics is the two parent family.
<P>
	I will read a sentence or two: ``Ask yourself: What restrains such 
behaviour?'' We are talking about the violent behaviour of 
adolescents. ``The short answer is a two parent home. Without 
belabouring the complexity of family policies, two parent families 
are demonstrably better at raising trouble-free children than one 
parent homes. Fatherless boys commit more crimes than those with 
a father at home. A study of repeat juvenile offenders by the Los 
Angeles probation department found that they were much more 
likely to come from one parent backgrounds than either the average 
child or juvenile criminals who offended once only''.
<P>
	That is a particularly disheartening statistic. The heartening 
statistic in Canada is that, much to the surprise of many people, 
according to Statistics Canada only 13 per cent of children are 
being raised in single parent homes.
<P>
	The point I am coming to is this: We know statistically that 
children who come from two parent homes, particularly young 
males and adolescent males, are at far less risk of misbehaviour and 
violent behaviour.
<P>
	I want to make sure that those people who are watching this 
debate on television do not think I am coming at this from a holier 
than thou approach. I am not. I am making a statement of fact. The 
statement of fact is that even if parents divorce, they do not divorce 
their children.
<P>
	As a society we must ensure when parents regrettably divorce, 
that custody does not go to one or the other. They do not stop being 
parents. There is no magical dissolution of parenthood; it is a 
dissolution of the marriage. The laws we promulgate have to 
promote joint custody. They should not promote disassociation. 
For the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice to 
suggest that there is no link between access to children and 
maintenance and the continuity of maintenance is so patently 
absurd that it defies reality. How anyone  proposing to represent the 
government of our country could make such an absurd statement so 
devoid of reality is mind boggling.
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	On a more positive note we should be doing something that was 
suggested at a recent town hall meeting on the Divorce Act which 
was attended by around 200 people in my constituency of 
Edmonton Southwest. Perhaps we should be putting far more 
emphasis on reconciliation. This was the overriding positive theme 
which came out of that town hall meeting.
<P>
	We should understand the importance of a two parent home. 
Even when divorce is the unfortunate final decision in a case of 
marital unhappiness, we must protect and nurture the child. We do 
that best by not severing the cord between the mother, father and 
child.
<P>
	Through reconciliation and perhaps by carrying reconciliation a 
step further, we should deal with divorce in a unified family court 
situation. Rather than involving the adversarial nature of lawyers, 
one trying to outdo the other, I propose a better idea, although it is 
not a specific part of this amendment and I appreciate the 
indulgence of members for allowing me to continue with this 
thought.
<P>
	Would we not be better off as a society if we used arbitration in a 
unified family court as the basis of family law? The purpose would 
be to deal with this kind of relationship. This involves so many 
different aspects of law, of contract law and of God knows what 
comes to the table. We are dealing with people who are at times 
mad, at times hurt, at times vengeful, at times just brokenhearted. 
We are dealing with people at a time of marital distress, at a most 
difficult point in their lives. When people are in this terrible 
situation, that is the time to bring in mediation. That is the time to 
bring in arbitration. It is the time potentially to bring reconciliation 
to the fore.
<P>
	These suggestions have come from a wide range of people 
including those people who counsel others who are going through 
divorce. I recognize it is impossible to legislate common sense. We 
cannot legislate people to have a sense of responsibility for the 
children they bring into the world but we can develop the attitude. 
We can develop the culture that says if their marriage is going to 
break down and they are going to divorce, they cannot absolve 
themselves of the responsibility they have as parents to nurture 
their children. No matter how bad the relationship is between the 
spouses, the children are the innocent victims. The children have to 
be accorded the decency of both parents being concerned first for 
their welfare and then for their own.
<P>
	I am thankful for the opportunity to put these thoughts into 
<I>Hansard</I> as part of the record of this debate. I cannot think of any 
single debate that has taken place in this House in the time I have 
been here that is  more important to the future of our nation. I 
cannot think of anything that is more important to us as a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6079"> 6079 </A></B>
<P>
community of human beings than nurturing the future generations 
of our country as embodied by our children and their children.
<P>
	Too often much of what we do here is concerned with the past in 
that we have our eyes firmly fixed behind us with our feet in the 
cement of whatever is going on today. We need to look beyond 
today into tomorrow and we have to do that through the eyes of our 
children and our grandchildren.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we must understand what the impact of the Reform Party 
motion would be. I will not repeat the arguments offered by my 
colleague, the member for Québec, because she did a very good job 
of presenting the nuts and bolts of this amendment compared to 
Bill C-41 in its present form.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	However, I would like to give further explanations, so that 
everybody, including members from the other side, will understand 
quite well what this is all about. Personally, I would have gone 
much further than the minister. The person who does his best to 
avoid paying child support has not earned the right to a further 30 
day extension.
<P>
	I have children for whom I pay daily. I think one should assume 
one's responsibilities. The father or mother, because the payer can 
be either one, the person who has to pay child support and who does 
not should not get any sympathy from the government. Personally, 
I have no sympathy whatsoever for those people.
<P>
	Bill C-41 proposes a complete system under which the 
government can take action. The minister responsible must submit 
a request, there is a complete process. We must understand the 
context of what persistent arrears means, under Bill C-41. We find 
the definition in clause 62, which describes what it means to be in 
``persistent arrears''.
<P>
	What does it mean? According to the legislation, that expression 
refers to a debtor who has, in respect of a support order or support 
provision, arrears in any amount due to the failure to make 
payments for any three payment periods-depending on the order, 
a period can be a week, a month, two months or six months-or one 
who has accumulated arrears of $3,000 or more.
<P>
	Let me give you a very precise example. Let us say the man is 
paying support. Following a ruling, he must give his child or 
children the sum of $500 a month. According to C-41, the 
judgment takes effect on January 1st, 1997. He pays child support 
in the amount of $500 on January 1st, 1997. In the month of 
February, he does not pay. In the month of March, he does not pay. 
In the  month of April, he pays $500. Until now, the provisions of 
the law do not apply because this does not amount to three 
consecutive periods or a total of $3,000 in non-payments.
<P>
	He continues. In the month of May, he does not pay. In the month 
of June, he does not pay. In the month of July, he decides to pay. In 
such a case, it takes exactly nine months to reach $3,000 in arrears. 
For nine months, the husband will apply pressure, how could I say, 
he will annoy his spouse. I think that is the best and the most 
explicit term. But who suffers? It is the children.
<P>
	It takes nine months to arrive at the total of $3,000 in unpaid 
child support. What does Bill C-41 provide for after nine months? 
It provides that the minister will send the debtor a notice informing 
him that he is $3,000 in arrears. In law, there is a very clear 
principle saying that ignorance of the law is no excuse. It is even 
truer that no one is supposed to ignore a court judgment or order.
<P>
	The debtor does not pay on purpose and the government will 
send him a notice informing him that he has not paid child support 
for X number of months, for a total of $3,000, according to the 
example I gave. He is given an extra extension of 10 days before 
the minister files an application to withhold certain licences or 
freeze certain applications for licences the debtor has made to the 
federal government. And he is given another 30 day extension.
<P>
<B>(1700)</B>
<P>
	So, after about 10 to 11 months, sanctions are applied to the 
debtor. Between you and me, I think this is very permissive. 
Personally, I would not have given 30 days to this repeat deadbeat 
father, who does it on purpose.
<P>
	However, Bill C-41 gives him these 30 days after a 10 day 
advance notice. We, of the Bloc Quebecois, decided, after 
examining all this, that we would not put forward an amendment on 
that. We will accept this approach the government has taken.
<P>
	You will understand that I do not agree with the motion put 
forward by the Reform Party to give him 50 days instead of 30. 
That is 50 days after the 10 days, so that, in the example I gave, it is 
not after 11 months that sanctions are applied to the debtor, but 
after 12 months, after one year. The person receiving child support, 
the $3,000, has been waiting 12 months for it.
<P>
	You will understand that Motion No. 14 put forward by the 
Reform Parti is unacceptable to the Bloc Quebecois, and that is 
why we will vote against it.

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Motion No. 15</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-41, in Clause 22, be amended by replacing line 6 on page 21 with the 
following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``deemed to have been received by a debtor twenty''</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, it has been a long day. It is a pleasure to 
rise to speak to the last amendment we put forward to endeavour to 
improve Bill C-41.
<P>
	This amendment, like Motion No. 14, or Group No. 4, serves to 
extend the period of time. The existing clause found on page 21 of 
the bill states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(5) A notice referred to in subsection (3) is deemed to have been received by a 
debtor ten days after it is sent to the debtor.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	What we would like to see done with Motion No. 15 is to extend 
that period from 10 days to 20. It is a relatively simple amendment 
that would allow for sufficient time to be reasonably assured that 
the individual in question has time to respond. That is the point of 
trying to extend that period of time.
<P>
	Earlier the hon. parliamentary secretary said that a number of 
our amendments were put forward in the interest of delaying the 
passage of the bill or to delay the implementation of the guidelines 
or to delay certain sections of the bill.
<P>
	I can assure members that is not the case, as I have stated on 
numerous occasions today. The thrust of why we are bringing 
forward this number of amendments to this piece of legislation is in 
the honest hope of improving it and making it work better. I do not 
see how any of these amendments that the Reform has proposed 
today will delay the bill or delay certain sections of it or indeed 
delay the guidelines.
<P>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
	With regard to the Reform amendment that would have the 
guidelines come back to the House, perhaps it would delay that 
portion for a certain period of time. I think it is in the best interests 
of Canadians to ensure that the House or the standing committee 
have the chance to  view the guidelines rather than simply have it 
shuffled through cabinet and foisted on the Canadian people as a 
done deal. It is always a concern of opposition parties.
<P>
	When the Liberals were in opposition in the previous Parliament 
they spoke out against this type of manoeuvring by a majority 
government. It did not allow the opposition parties the option or the 
chance to truly represent their constituents both in the House of 
Commons and in committee where they would be allowed to put 
forward some suggestions or at least voice the concerns of certain 
groups, individuals and constituents who would approach the 
opposition parties with concerns about the guidelines in question.
<P>
	If these amendments pass when we vote there may be a minor 
delay with that process being put in place. It is in the best interests 
of Canadians to ensure their views can be heard and are represented 
by their duly elected members of Parliament. After all, that is the 
whole point of why we are here, to represent their views.
<P>
	If we are not given an opportunity to view the guidelines and 
raise concerns, then why do we have Parliament existing as it does 
today? Is the whole thrust the government seems intent to operate 
with orders in council and just have the cabinet make those types of 
decisions as it has on a number of bills? Over the past three years 
Reform has consistently spoken out against that because we do not 
believe that is the way a truly democratic government should be 
operating.
<P>
	When those people over there were on this side of the House in 
the 34th Parliament we saw some terrific indignation that the 
Tories were ramming through legislation, guidelines and 
regulations with orders in council. Now that the Liberals are 
ensconced-temporarily I might add-on the other side of the 
House, they are doing exactly the same thing that they criticised the 
Conservatives for.
<P>
	It is no wonder as we travel across the country and throughout 
our ridings we hear ``Liberal-Tory, same old story''. That chant has 
been picked up from coast to coast because people are seeing the 
reality that there is no difference between not only the policies of 
those two old parties but the way in which they operate as 
governments as well.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in short, 
we are against this amendment because the presumption is that if 
the debtor says he did not receive the provincial notice, the 30 days 
the province must wait before submitting the licence denial 
application to the federal government will start 10 days after the 
date the notice was actually sent. This just gives the debtor more 
time. There is really no reason to extend this period by another 10 
days.

this motion.

<B>(1710)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will be very brief since this supports what I said earlier. I 
gave the example of Reform Motion No. 14, which adds 30 days to 
the period proposed by the government. This would give a 
defaulting debtor up to 11 months, plus Reform's 30 days, for a 
total of 12 months. I am somewhat taken aback by the fact that 
even this is not enough for the Reform Party.
<P>
	I do not know what Reform's goal is in favouring defaulting 
debtors, but it gives 10 days more than the period specified in the 
notice. According to the legislator, the purpose of the 10-day period 
provided in Bill C-41 after the notice is sent to the debtor is to 
prove it has been received. The Reform motion provides for a 
20-day period. It gives another 10 days.
<P>
	Given the reasons I mentioned earlier, I personally would not 
give a defaulting debtor a single day. After nine months, he must 
know he owes at least $3,000 in unpaid child support. In any case, 
his wife and children probably called to remind him to send his 
cheque for $500, so there is no reason to give him more time. For 
all these reasons, all members of the Bloc Quebecois will vote 
against this motion.

brought forward for the purpose of extending a time period. As I 
have indicated on previous occasion with respect to a number of 
amendments that have been brought forward by the Reform Party, 
it seems that many of these amendments are designed to delay or 
put off the remedies which are contained in the bill.
<P>
	It is our view that we must put in timeframes that are consistent 
with other provisions within other acts, that is to say, to have time 
periods which reflect the norm for service, for notice and the like 
rather than extending them and simply inordinately delaying the 
remedies that are available to the custodial spouse and children.
<P>
	We should not support this motion because we need to ensure 
that delays are not inordinate.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is the House ready for the question?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Question.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The question is on Motion No. 15. Is it 
the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> All those in favour of the motion will 
please say yea.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Yea.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> All those opposed will please say nay.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Nay.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> In my opinion the nays have it.
<P>
	<I>And more than five members having risen:</I>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The recorded division on the motion 
stands deferred.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
believe you will find unanimous consent, after having consulted 
with the other parties, to introduce the following motion.
<P>
	I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-41, in clause 5(2), be amended by replacing lines 13 to 15 on page 8 
with ``judgment or a written agreement respecting the financial obligations of''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, we will 
give our consent to this motion, while deploring the fact that the 
hon. member introduced it at the very last minute, claiming this 
was an oversight, that it should have been presented in committee.
<P>
<B>(1715)</B>
<P>
	While we would have liked to subject the proposal made by the 
hon. member to a comprehensive analysis, among other things, we 
will nonetheless give our consent.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we will give unanimous consent to allow the government 
this procedure as well. However, like my hon. colleague from the 
Bloc Quebecois, I do not see the need for this type of shenanigans 
from the government. If this is how seriously it takes its own 
legislation, it only points to the reason why Canada is in the shape 
that it is today.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The House has heard the terms of the 
motion. The House has also given unanimous consent to this 
motion. I must point out to my hon. colleagues that this is a 
debatable motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak briefly on this  amendment, and 
not on the approach per se, whereby we examine a motion 
introduced by the government at the very last minute, as the hon. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6082"> 6082 </A></B>
<P>
member for Québec indicated. On the whole, this is an amendment 
that does not affect the substance of the clause in any real way.
<P>
	Where I am concerned however is when the parliamentary 
secretary brings in a motion under such circumstances, claiming 
this was an oversight on the part of the government. If that is so, 
how many more oversights have they made in this bill? As far as 
we in the Bloc Quebecois are concerned, the five or six motions we 
have put forward also addressed oversights. Why did they not act 
on these motions?
<P>
	It is disturbing when the Liberal Party, the overly self-confident 
governing party that puts forward just about anything and refuses 
to see reason, because of its arrogance, on very important points 
made by the official opposition, through its parliamentary 
secretary, tables a motion in this House at the very last minute, 
claiming it was an oversight. I think this is an unforgivable 
oversight, one that we in the Bloc Quebecois cannot forgive, 
because we are convinced that there are more oversights in this bill 
and some more striking than those raised today in motions put 
forward by Bloc members, which the government chose to ignore.
<P>
	We in the official opposition are quite worried about this 
government's administration. Bill C-41 is a very important bill in 
that it affects the future of our children, including children of 
Quebec, an emerging nation.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, while the hon. member from the Bloc was making his 
intervention just now, a couple of my colleagues were bantering 
back and forth across the House with the hon. parliamentary 
secretary. They asked him what exactly this 11th hour amendment 
does to this bill. He said that it does not do anything.
<P>
	One has to wonder, if it does not do anything, why bother 
bringing it in and having to run around in the opposition lobby at 
the last possible moment and approach both the Bloc and Reform to 
try to get unanimous consent to put it. If the Liberals have an 11th 
hour amendment it should do something very compelling and 
comprehensive, instead of bringing forward something that clearly 
is so inconsequential that it makes one wonder why it was brought 
forward at all.
<P>
	To sum up Bill C-41 today, the subject of divorce, support 
payments, maintenance payments, custody and access to children 
is of interest to all Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1720 )</B>
<P>
	I have three children and as a parent I cannot foresee anything as 
horrendous as losing access to my children. For many 
non-custodial parents the reality is that the de-parenting process of 
divorce is the same as if the child  or the children have died. Every 
member, regardless of which side of the House they are on, will 
appreciate that if they are a parent.
<P>
	I believe this issue has not been adequately dealt with by the 
government. As I said earlier, it has chosen to deal with one small 
portion of it.
<P>
	I would argue with the parliamentary secretary when he said that 
these issues are not linked. All of these issues are linked together. 
We cannot possibly tell parents, custodial and non-custodial alike, 
that we can deal with one section and ignore the rest. That is simply 
not the case. We must bring forward serious amendments and 
serious legislation to deal with the subjects of mediation, custody 
and access to children. That has to be done. Canadians from coast 
to coast are asking the government to do that.
<P>
	We have a commitment from the justice minister and the Liberal 
government that they will bring in comprehensive legislation to 
deal with all of those issues, but we have yet to see that happen.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kirkby:</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish to thank very sincerely 
members of the two parties opposite for agreeing to the motion and 
for the grace with which they done that. With respect to the Reform 
Party, all I can say is that it is not that the amendment does not do 
anything, it is that its members probably would not understand the 
amendment if I explained it to them.
<P>
	In any event, the purpose of the bill is to enhance maintenance 
for children. We appreciate, once again, the co-operation of the 
opposition parties in bringing this amendment forward.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have one question for the parliamentary secretary.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> No questions are permitted at this time 
unless members wish to give their unanimous consent.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a 
very brief comment that I would like to make.
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary said that he would not give an 
explanation why this is necessary because the Reform Party would 
not understand it. The arrogance displayed by that is 
unconscionable. The people of Canada deserve an explanation. 
There has to be something on the record to explain why at the 11th 
hour the government introduced an amendment without any 
explanation of why it is necessary. That has to be on the record. 
Otherwise, why should we approve it?
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
also like to say that I was insulted by the parliamentary secretary. 
He asked us for unanimous consent. We have been listening to him 
all day talking about his position on Reform amendments. He said 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6083"> 6083 </A></B>
<P>
that we were trying to slow down the process, that it would be 
detrimental to the administration of justice and so on.
<P>
	The amendments which we put before the House were serious, 
well thought out amendments, which we felt would help improve 
the bill. That is the spirit in which we enter debate in this House. 
Then, at the very last minute, as my colleague for 
Yorkton-Melville said, the Liberals asked for our permission to 
introduce an amendment. The Liberals knew the bill was being 
debated in the House. They followed it all the way through 
committee. It is now back here. We have done our homework and 
then we get this insult that I would even dare to say is 
unparliamentary in the terms in which it was presented.
<P>
<B>(1725)</B>
<P>
	Therefore, I would request a retraction from the parliamentary 
secretary for insulting the Reform Party by saying that we would 
not understand his amendment. I felt it was totally unparliamentary 
and disgraceful.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The Chair has been put in a very difficult 
position because a member cannot speak twice to an amendment. 
In light of what has been said, I wonder if there would be 
unanimous consent to give the parliamentary secretary the right to 
explain the purposes of the amendment?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not have a problem with giving 
the parliamentary secretary unanimous consent to explain his 
motion if at the same time he will withdraw the accusation that he 
levelled at the Reform Party.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kirkby:</B> Mr. Speaker, if I said anything unparliamentary, I 
withdraw it.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I understand from comments in the House 
that there will not be unanimous consent to let the parliamentary 
secretary speak twice on the bill so he can explain his amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Gagnon (Québec):</B> No. No.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Very well. The question is on the 
amendment. All those in favour of the amendment will please say 
yea.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Yea.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> All those opposed will please say nay.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Nay.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> In my opinion the yeas have it.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> On division.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="HUMANREPRODUCTIVEANDGENETICTECHNOLOGIESACT">HUMAN REPRODUCTIVE AND GENETIC 
TECHNOLOGIES ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed from October 31, 1996 consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-47, an act respecting human reproductive 
technologies and commercial transactions relating to human 
reproduction, be read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, Bill C-37, 
an act respecting human reproductive technologies and commercial 
transactions relating to human reproduction, is very important.
<P>
	This bill has been the subject of research and studies which 
seemed, in a way, to go on forever because for many years women 
in Canada, in Quebec, have been asking for government action. 
Unfortunately, the only government that can act in this matter in 
this country we still are part of is the federal government, because 
the issue is under federal jurisdiction, matters of life and death, as 
we know, being under federal jurisdiction.
<P>
	The very first reaction of the federal government was to create 
the Baird Commission in 1989. This commission generated some 
controversy, and so did the fate of some of its conclusions. Its 
mandate was to review current and anticipated scientific and 
medical progress regarding reproductive technologies, their 
repercussions on health and research, as well as their moral, social, 
economic and legal consequences. The commission also gave the 
general public an opportunity to recommend policies and safety 
measures.
<P>
	Obviously, this was a mandate whose scope was very wide. After 
four years of review, after hearing 40,000 witnesses, and after 
spending $28 million, the Baird commission finally tabled its 
report in November 1993. It must be pointed out that the 
commission's main conclusions and recommendations were 
essentially the same as those of other similar bodies abroad.
<P>
	Let me say from the outset that some of these recommendations 
went way beyond the initial mandate, which was already very wide 
in scope, and dealt with issues as varied as the effect of tobacco and 
drug use,  health and safety in the workplace, and family law. In 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6084"> 6084 </A></B>
<P>
short, the commission also made recommendations in areas that 
come under the exclusive jurisdiction of the provinces, namely 
those relating to health.
<P>
	The Liberal government, elected on October 25, 1993, was slow 
to react. By contrast, the minute the Bloc arrived in this House, it 
repeatedly asked, first through its critic on health and the status of 
women and then its critic responsible for this specific issue, the 
tabling of a bill to criminalize certain practices relating to new 
reproductive technologies, NRTs.
<P>
<B>(1735)</B>
<P>
	It was not until July 1995 that the Liberals finally took concrete 
action. However, it was not the measure hoped for, far from it. 
Indeed, after all this time, the Liberals asked the professionals 
concerned to comply with a voluntary moratorium that more or less 
prohibited the use of certain reproductive technologies.
<P>
	Here are some of these prohibitions: preconception contracts 
under which a woman is paid to act as a surrogate mother; the sale 
or purchase of human ova, sperm or embryos; choosing the sex of 
the child without medical justification; providing free in vitro 
insemination in exchange for ova from women who cannot afford 
this service, and so on.
<P>
	Declaring a voluntary moratorium means that the people and the 
professionals who did not care about the moral, scientific or largely 
human aspects of these acts kept doing them. Needless to say, all 
the groups that had long been clamouring for action in the area 
have been greatly disappointed and have made it known to the 
government.
<P>
	Last January, the government announced the creation of a 
temporary advisory committee with a mandate to monitor the 
enforcement of the voluntary moratorium. Can we imagine a policy 
as flexible or that corresponds so little to what we call a policy? In 
other words, the government wanted to look like it was doing 
something whereas in fact it was doing nothing.
<P>
	A lot of information found in everyday life confirmed that 
nothing was happening. Whether it was advertisements published 
in all sorts of ways, and we refer here to the example of 
advertisements placed in university student newspapers offering to 
buy ova from young women on behalf of infertile couples, or the 
fact that institutions keep paying sperm donors, and I could go on. 
This voluntary moratorium certainly did not change conditions in 
this regard.
<P>
	The federal government finally tabled a bill on June 14, 1996. 
This bill is the one I am addressing today. It bears the number C-47. 
Once again, the government is planning to act in two steps. First, it 
wants to pass this Bill C-47, which prohibits certain acts, with the 
intent of criminalizing them, and I will get back to that. The bill 
would also provide for a subsequent step: regulations that would be 
enforced by a national agency whose action we now already feel is 
not only disturbing but warrants criticism.
<P>
	Let us talk about Bill C-47, which proposes to criminalize 
certain action. I will say right away that we are not really talking 
about criminalization.
<P>
<B>(1740)</B>
<P>
	If this were an amendment to the Criminal Code, the 
implementation would be left to the provinces. But that is not what 
is happening right now. The government is setting up a policy that 
would criminalize certain arrangements through a separate act 
which will be enforced by a national agency responsible for the 
monitoring and enforcing the act. That would be part of a second 
phase.
<P>
	This situation is totally unacceptable. We are now in the first 
phase. We-and I say we meaning women-in Quebec are calling 
for action in this area because it is not under Quebec's jurisdiction, 
even though, ultimately, it is Quebec that will be enforcing the act. 
In this situation, not only is criminalization counterproductive, but 
we are also quite sure that this new national agency that would 
control and monitor new reproductive technologies would only be 
one more jurisdictional encroachment, one more case of 
duplication with what has already been done by the Quebec 
government and its health department, which is the agency that 
should be enforcing this act.
<P>
	This new federal agency would have to get the resources to be 
able to deliver licenses, inspect clinics, monitor the enforcement of 
regulations, and oversee the development of new reproductive 
technologies-not in itself a trivial scientific undertaking-and 
give advice to the federal department in this matter.
<P>
	Do they have any notion of what setting up of such an agency 
implies? To what end? Take licensing for example. I am just going 
down the list. As I said before, we have to see what it entails for 
such an agency to deliver licences, inspect clinics and enforce 
regulations.
<P>
	Again, the activities that will be prohibited and criminalized, but 
not through the regular means, that is not pursuant to the Criminal 
Code, would include in-vitro fertilization, insemination by a donor, 
the use of foetal tissue, the preservation, manipulation and 
donation of ova, sperm and human embryos, research on embryos, 
pre-implantation diagnostic, and postmenopausal pregnancy. The 
proposed agency would also set up a data bank on donors and 
children of donors in order to allow future meetings in certain 
special cases.
<P>
	When you think about creating an agency responsible for issuing 
licences, inspecting clinics, enforcing regulations and also for 
monitoring scientific developments and advising the minister, you 
are thinking about something big, very big, that would revamp and 
reorganize the health assessment systems, instead of integrating 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6085"> 6085 </A></B>
<P>
into the assessment and monitoring systems the dimensions we 
have been criticizing for some time now.
<P>
<B>(1745)</B>
<P>
	We want some kind of instrument that would let us say: ``This 
procedure is prohibited''. We want to be able to prohibit these 
procedures wherever they are performed, in hospitals, in research 
centres. But for that we need the only instrument the federal 
government can give us, prohibitions.
<P>
	However, the federal government had delayed prohibiting and 
criminalizing such procedures. What would it rather do? It wants to 
supersede and take the place of the whole health network, the 
women's network and the conference of health ministers.
<P>
	This is totally unacceptable and at some level even outrageous. 
We know how many cuts were made in the Canada social transfer 
payments, particularly in health care. The federal government has 
taken means away from the provinces, in particular from Quebec, 
and now it wants to establish this big national agency to do what 
would be better done by others who are asking for an instrument 
that the federal government has been reluctant to give.
<P>
	The Bloc has repeatedly asked the federal government to do 
something. And now, three years after a commission finally made 
recommendations in 1993, we are still studying a bill, which will 
not solve problems but create new ones.
<P>
	In every other field, it is said that the players must speak to each 
other. It is said that one must be efficient and synergistic. But in 
this field of reproduction, which is most important for the human 
race, for Quebec and for Canada, which touches upon the very 
nature of the human being, we cannot act without creating this 
costly, inefficient, slow and inadequate national agency.
<P>
	The federal government did not amend the Criminal Code as it 
should have, and the only action it takes is to try to dictate to the 
provinces after cutting their Canada social transfer payments. This 
is enough reason to be furious, because it is an important matter. 
There are scientists with dubious motives who clone human beings 
using semen that young people sell to be able to eat. This is a fact, 
not a bad movie.
<P>
	It seems to me that in this case the inaction of the central 
government is tantamount to carelessness. This debate clearly 
concerns our future and values and it is disturbing to see that 
instead of deciding in its jurisdiction and providing instruments, 
the government wants to dictate to the provinces.
<P>
<B>(1750)</B>
<P>
	It will not even let the provinces do their work as is usually the 
case with the Criminal Code. Bill C-47 and the inaction of the 
central government on this dramatic  question of new reproductive 
technologies is a perfect example of the aberration of the Canadian 
federalism.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have been listening attentively to 
the hon. member's remarks. I would like to make some comments 
and then pose a question. The hon. member of the Bloc speaks 
passionately and asks the question: ``Has this been thoroughly 
thought out?''
<P>
	The government's plan for managing new reproductive and 
genetic technologies is based not on some kind of whim. It has not 
drawn something out of the air and created legislation. Its plan is 
based on extensive research and consultations with the Royal 
Commission on New Reproductive Technologies and the 
examination of management practices in other countries around the 
world. Most important, the government has also consulted with no 
less than 50 stakeholder groups following the release of the royal 
commission's report on what direction should be taken.
<P>
	This is something very big, says the hon. member for the Bloc. 
Yes, it will be. She questions the federal government's role. She 
called it ``intervening''. Her concern for parties talking together, as 
she put it, is being addressed by the federal government.
<P>
	Given the complexity of these issues, it is inevitable that there 
will be differences of opinion among the many stakeholder groups 
involved in these issues. The medical profession will have an 
opportunity to present its views when Bill C-47 goes before the 
Standing Committee on Health.
<P>
	The hon. member for the Bloc says she and her party are angry 
with the federal government's role in this area. However, let us 
remind the Bloc that it was her party that demanded not 
amendments to the Criminal Code but initially demanded 
legislation. The member cannot deny this. On October 7, 1994 the 
member for Laval Centre called for the government to table a bill 
to regulate practices connected with new reproductive 
technologies. As late as June 5, 1996 the member for Drummond 
said: ``This area is in urgent need of legislation''. It is legislation 
Bloc members want, not amendments to the Criminal Code, so it is 
legislation we produce.
<P>
	This legislation will have its detractors but they are welcome to 
come before the Standing Committee on Health. They are welcome 
to make their presentations and views.
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary for health and myself are cognizant 
of the fact that we do not have all the answers. That is why we have 
a committee system and why we invite members of the Bloc, the 
Reform and the public at large to come before the committee. The 
government wants them to examine this bill thoroughly and give 
their input to ensure its objectives, which are to protect the health 
and safety of Canadians, to ensure the appropriate use of human 
reproductive materials outside the body and to protect the dignity 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6086"> 6086 </A></B>
<P>
and security of all persons, especially, I say to the hon. member for 
the Bloc, women and children, are reached.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Lalonde:</B> Mr. Speaker, there is something I do not 
understand. I would like the hon. member to tell me how he thinks 
we can change the Criminal Code other than through legislation.
<P>
<B>(1755)</B>
<P>
	Members on this side of the House are not that stupid, as my 
colleague says. When we called for legislation, we were calling for 
the government to take action. Why did we ask him to take action 
here in Ottawa, instead of doing something in Quebec? Because the 
Criminal Code is a federal statute, and because a good federal 
government should take responsibility for what comes under its 
jurisdiction. Yes, legislation was required. I think my hon. 
colleague will agree that the only way to amend the Criminal Code 
is through legislation. Honestly!
<P>
	Second, what he did not tell me was why, now that the central 
government is finally deigning to do its job, it does not occur to it 
that it must do what it is its job to do, that is make amendments. 
The provinces, which have jurisdiction over health, will then use 
this instrument. Subsidiarity is all very interesting, but it seems to 
me that in this case the government does its job under the 
Constitution and lets the provinces do their job.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, listening to the 
hon. member for Mercier, one can see that she has gotten a reaction 
from the other side, the government side. When there is that kind of 
reaction, it is because there is some uncertainty as to what is being 
advanced.
<P>
	As a member of the Standing Committee on Health, I am pleased 
to speak during this debate on the new reproductive technologies, 
and the commercial operations-I must call them for what they 
are-commercial operations relating to human reproduction.
<P>
	Before going any further, I would like to call attention to the 
work of the two official opposition critics who have spoken out in 
turn against the Liberal government in this matter. I refer, of 
course, to the work of the present critic, the hon. member for 
Drummond, and that of the hon. member for Laval-Centre. Since 
our arrival here, this has been a part of the debate in the House of 
Commons.
<P>
	Let us recall what the hon. member for Mercier has already 
mentioned: that this amendment to the Criminal Code has been 
wished for and called for since 1977. There was the Baird 
Commission, created in 1989. The commission members produced 
four years worth of studies, deliberations and reports. Perhaps we 
ought to  point out that there were some little problems within this 
commission, some resignations by commission members. It was 
pretty costly, I will not say very costly, but pretty costly, at $28 
million.
<P>
	Mind you, the commission heard 40,000 witnesses; there are not 
a lot of precedents for this. No provincial government, at least none 
in Quebec, has ever heard so many witnesses. They heard many, 
many people. The commission eventually delivered close to 300 
recommendations and finally, in the fall of 1993, a huge, 
1,435-page report.
<P>
	Two years passed between 1993 and July 1995. The fall of 1993 
coincided with the election of the Liberal Party, which now forms 
the government. During those two years, nothing much happened. 
Some statements were made but nothing of any consequence 
happened. In the summer of 1995, there was this so-called 
voluntary moratorium. A voluntary moratorium.
<P>
<B>(1800)</B>
<P>
	When a problem is as important as this one, the word 
``voluntary'' raises a number of questions.
<P>
	In fact, a number of questions were raised in the House, and two 
ministers provided a response. To illustrate what the hon. member 
for Mercier just mentioned, for a while, it was the Minister of 
Justice who answered the questions. We know that at the time, the 
Minister of Justice considered amending the Criminal Code. 
Opposition members like the hon. member for Drummond and the 
hon. member for Laval-Centre were in favour of this kind of 
intervention. They were in favour of a bill that would amend the 
Criminal Code.
<P>
	Unfortunately, that did not happen. The government took a 
different approach, and it was the Minister of Health who 
introduced the present bill which is legislative in nature but, in 
addition, creates a federal agency, and I may recall the proceedings 
of the committee and the debate around these proceedings.
<P>
	We in the opposition are aware of the importance of the 
problems affected by this bill. So much so that we wanted a bill that 
would amend the Criminal Code. We agree there were a lot of 
problems with this bill. It is a bill that could be very complex 
because the problems are complex. The bill touches on ethical, 
moral, medical and scientific considerations. Many other areas are 
affected by this bill, but there is also the whole question of the 
problems of infertile couples who want children.
<P>
	This issue is not trivial; it is extremely important. In spite of a 
voluntary moratorium, we were still seeing ads in papers, mostly 
university papers, promoting trading in ova and sperm and dealing 
with every aspect of human reproduction, which shows that this 
voluntary moratorium did not work. This is why we, in the 
opposition, want to see the Criminal Code amended.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6087"> 6087 </A></B>
<P>
	When reviewing a bill, each member has his or her way of 
assessing things. For my part, I always try to answer the following 
five questions: Does the bill clarify matters? I will answer this 
later. Second, is the bill all encompassing? Does it cover all the 
issues? When you first look at a bill with only 13 clauses and a 
few pages, you might wonder, on a primary level, if it is all 
encompassing. I will get back to this later.
<P>
	Third, will this bill be effective? Because a bill which is not 
effective and is unenforceable is nothing more than wishful 
thinking. I must certainly ask myself this question.
<P>
	Fourth, does this bill respect jurisdictions? I will say more on 
this later. I point out that, under the Constitution, health is an area 
of exclusive provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	Fifth, does the bill respect individual rights? We have a charter 
of rights and freedoms. It is former Prime Minister Trudeau who 
developed it and enshrined it in the Constitution. This question 
must be asked from this perspective.
<P>
	I will try to answer all five questions.
<P>
	First, does it clarify matters?
<P>
<B>(1805)</B>
<P>
	No. On some aspects, yes, on some others, no.
<P>
	First, let us look at the definitions. Earlier, I did more research in 
addition to the research I had done previously by looking in the two 
dictionaries available to us. Some people we consulted, for 
example, the physicians tell us that some definitions correspond, 
that they are correct. Others tell us that the definitions used present 
a problem.
<P>
	When, at the start of a bill, the definitions are problematic in 
terms of medical research, of medicine or of sciences, there is a 
slight problem. This means that it is not very clear.
<P>
	Another striking problem is the inconsistency between the 
French and the English titles. In one language, it is called 
``manipulation génétique'', in the other, genetic technologies. 
``Manipulation'', technologies, in the case of such a crucial subject, 
I wonder if particular attention should not be paid to those terms. 
Of course, as members of the Standing Committee on Health, we 
shall be in a position to ask questions and suggest some 
clarifications at the proper time. This is not a trivial issue.
<P>
	Also, there is no distinction made between assisted reproduction 
and fundamental research. Those are two different things. The first 
one refers to care and treatment, the second one to medical research 
in genetics. Those are two distinct areas and to treat them without 
distinction is dangerous.
<P>
	Another question is: Is this bill complete? After so much study 
and so many pages of committee reports, we would think that it 
should be complete, but it is not  because, first, it leaves a lot of 
room to rules and, second, it also leaves a lot of room for 
interpretation by the new federal agency that will be created of new 
rules.
<P>
	Bill C-47 is an incomplete legislation that is far from meeting 
the expectations raised by the government. Even in the information 
paper, the government tried to set limits and protect health.
<P>
	On page 48 of this document, we see that the government intends 
to start the third and most complex phase of its plan to manage new 
reproductive technologies, that is, the development of regulations. 
This clearly indicates that the biggest part remains to be done, 
because the 13 clauses of the present bill are not enough to give it 
its full dimensions.
<P>
	I have here a letter from the Canadian Fertility and Andrology 
Society, which wrote to all members of the Standing Committee on 
Health, to say:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>If this bill is approved without any amendment, it will have very bad 
consequences for medical and scientific communities-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I can understand its point. It concluded that: ``-this legislation 
did not receive all the consideration that is usually given to bills as 
important as this one''.
<P>
	When a bill is said to be complete, one should feel that opinions 
have been heard from every angle. I will stop here.
<P>
	Is the bill in question effective? We answer no. If the 
government had wanted this bill to be effective, as the hon. 
member for Mercier said earlier, as the hon. member for 
Drummond asked for many times, this bill would have had to 
change the Criminal Code.
<P>
	This is not what it does. It purports to create an agency and 
leaves a lot of room for interpretation and for regulations that will 
elude this House and the legislators.
<P>
	The bill also brings other legislation that is parallel to the 
Criminal Code, that is being added to the rest.
<P>
<B>(1810)</B>
<P>
	Already, it is not simple for the federal government and the 
provinces to operate together in this country, especially in 
sometimes shared, sometimes exclusive jurisdictions. The federal 
government is adding a new dimension, another agency to further 
complicate things.
<P>
	We realize the trend is always the same. We saw it in the motions 
put forward by the hon. member for Mississauga-South today and 
on many occasions. Essentially, what we feel is a willingness to 
centralize the federal authority. Speaking about jurisdictions, this 
perpetuates a federal interference in an area belonging to Quebec 
and the provinces.
<P>
	The announced creation of a national agency is unacceptable. 
Yet another agency. Recently, an agency was created to inspect 
food. We are talking about all areas. Every time the government 
has legislated in the past three years, its first reaction was to 
intervene  through national standards or guidelines or, more subtly, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6088"> 6088 </A></B>
<P>
through a federal agency responsible for implementing the rules set 
by a minister. It does not always do so, but it very often does.
<P>
	This agency could take advantage of the rather vague provisions 
and definitions in the bill to extend its activities to areas other than 
new reproductive technologies. This supposedly independent 
agency would in fact have to comply with the standards set by the 
Minister of Health.
<P>
	Fifth, there are individual rights. In an article published in <I>Le 
Devoir</I>, Josée Legault raised some questions:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In this context, would it not be preferable to better monitor current practices 
instead of taking the risk of making them impractical, if not criminal?</BLOCKQUOTE>
She asked this question. It is not necessarily our opinion, but it is an 
opinion that must be heard.
<P>
	She went on to say:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In addition, the first time an infertile woman or couple is fined or sued, Ottawa 
may well find itself trapped in its own charter of rights.</BLOCKQUOTE>
We on this side of the House are not sure this review was done 
properly. What Josée Legault says is her own opinion.
<P>
	In any case, it is about time the Liberal government legislated in 
this area, although we would have preferred that it do so by 
amending the Criminal Code. We do not understand why this is not 
the case and we are very disappointed. This bill, which the 
Standing Orders prevent me from showing you, is quite thin, only 
13 clauses for such an important, multidimensional problem in 
terms of values.
<P>
	I do not know if my female colleagues in the official opposition 
would allow me to use this phrase, but I will take the risk; I feel 
that, as far as the new reproductive technologies are concerned, the 
elephant has just given birth to a mouse.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is the House ready for the question?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Question.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="FISHERIESACT">FISHERIES ACT</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Fred Mifflin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.)</B> 
moved that Bill C-62, an act respecting fisheries, be read the 
second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, in rising to lead off the debate on a 
completely contemporary and thoroughly new fisheries act, I 
cannot help but start by reflecting on how profoundly all Canadians 
have come to appreciate the importance of the issues facing our 
nation's fishing communities.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	When I was first elected to the House of Commons eight years 
ago, those families who depended on the seas for their livelihood 
clearly understood the major challenges facing our stocks and 
fleets.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In just a few years, however, the challenges facing Canada's 
coastal communities have gripped the attention of citizens right 
across the country. Those of us who come from the communities 
that dot our coastlines are grateful for the empathy and the 
collective commitment shown by all Canadians in dealing firmly 
with foreign overfishing and to rebuilding an essential resource.
<P>
	It is fair to say that as a nation we have come to realize the need 
for our fisheries to be economically viable, environmentally 
sustainable and efficiently managed. There is broad agreement on 
the outlines of what a viable, sustainable and efficiently managed 
fishery would look like.
<P>
	It would include independent, professional owner-operators and 
employees, men and women who would make a good living year in 
and year out. It would include economically healthy communities 
along the country's coastlines. It would include a flexible, versatile 
and self-reliant industry, largely self-regulating and operating 
without subsidies.
<P>
	These are the straightforward principles on which we must build 
a renewed fishery. These are the values that will allow our fishing 
communities to flourish in the next century.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="6089"> 6089 </A></B>
<P>
	This government has articulated its commitment to the pursuit of 
the economy, environmentalism and efficiency. This government 
has also pledged to carve out a role for constituents to have a 
greater say in the policies that affect them. These are in line with 
our red book objectives.
<P>
	In proposing a modern fisheries act to Parliament, I would like to 
build upon these themes and this policy of participation by talking 
about the equality and the equally vital and related themes of 
freedom, flexibility, frugality and fairness.
<P>
	Freedom for individuals and communities to have more say over 
decisions affecting their lives. Freedom for fishers to become the 
authors of their own destiny. Freedom from outdated regulations 
and from plain overregulation.
<P>
	Flexibility through more self-regulation and local sanction 
guidelines. Flexibility to form new partnering agreements on 
research and on methods to achieve conservation objectives. 
Flexibility to use local knowledge and experience to address local 
problems. Flexibility through providing expert, local, 
administrative tribunals for the Atlantic and the Pacific fisheries.
<P>
	Frugality by having the federal government focus on core 
responsibilities. Frugality through consolidation of statutes and 
through caution in setting fish harvesting levels. Frugality through 
the removal of overlap and duplication. Frugality by cutting cost 
and complexity.
<P>
	Fairness in finding the balance between meeting the needs of our 
generation and the needs of future generations. Fairness in ensuring 
that everyone plays by the rules. Fairness through an open, decision 
making process. Fairness in ensuring that all stakeholders have a 
seat at the decision making table.
<P>
	The new fisheries act will provide more freedom, offer more 
flexibility, emphasize more frugality and ensure more fairness. 
That is why the government is proposing this legislation.
<P>
	The simple fact is that we have not had a comprehensive 
overhaul of the fisheries act since 1868 in the days of Queen 
Victoria. The world has changed dramatically since Canada was 
one year old.
<P>
	In 1868 Canadians did not have to worry about the fisheries 
issues on the Grand Banks since my home province was not then a 
part of Confederation. Our ancestors did not have to consider the 
Pacific salmon fishery since British Columbia was not part of 
Canada in those days.
<P>
<B>(1820 )</B>
<P>
	In 1996 we must adapt to the modern notions of citizens' rights 
and responsibilities. We must adapt to new wisdom about the 
importance of sustainable development and about the power of 
technology. We must adapt to the reality of linking the harvesting 
capacity to the resources available to be harvested. We must create 
ways to develop newly emerging species such  as skate, monkfish 
and non-traditional crab species. We must meet the challenges of 
fiscal realities, federal, provincial and territorial realities and the 
reality that our natural resources are not inexhaustible as they once 
may have seemed.
<P>
	We must create opportunities for tapping the knowledge and the 
skills and the hopes of all sectors of the Canadian fishing industry. 
We must guarantee that we will meet global challenges through the 
development of a professional fishery. We must guarantee that we 
will meet our stewardship responsibility through effective 
measures to protect fish habitat.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We must simplify, streamline and reinforce the Fisheries Act in 
order to sustain and strengthen coastal communities and build 
sustainable fisheries that will see us through this century and the 
ones to come.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The bill before the House of Commons proposes a new 
partnering approach to fisheries management, a new system of 
sanctions, a streamlining of regulations and rules, improved habitat 
protection and the creation of a single legislative framework for all 
fishing on coastal and adjacent waters.
<P>
	I am particularly enthusiastic about this bill because it will allow 
the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, whomever he or she may be, 
to enter into legally binding, long term partnering agreements with 
commercial licence holders, aboriginal organizations, the 
recreational fishing sector and other organizations representing the 
voices of the Canadian fishing industry. Time and time again we 
have been told to get out of the day to day management of fisheries. 
Industries large and small have told us they do not need to be led by 
the hand and that they are ready, indeed eager to row their own 
boat.
<P>
	We have listened and we are ready to put in place fisheries 
management agreements that will provide tangible benefits for the 
industry's men and women by sharing responsibility with them. 
The very people who are affected by fisheries and by the 
management decisions will have a direct say in making those 
decisions. The fact that these partnering agreements can be valid 
over the long term will enable fishers and their fishing 
communities to plan for and to achieve longer term stability. By 
establishing formal partnering agreements we create this stability.
<P>
	We also create a level playing field in which everyone is aware 
of the rules which govern the management of the resource. At 
present there is far too much of a gold rush mentality in the fishing 
industry. When all members of a group are involved in making 
decisions they can stop the beggar thy neighbour mentality which 
sees people rushing to beat their competitors before a season ends 
or a quota is reached.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="6090"> 6090 </A></B>
<P>
	Right now the federal government is micro managing decisions 
that are best made locally. Clearly the Government of Canada must 
retain ultimate responsibility for conservation and the proper 
management of the resource base in so far as those matters affect 
the national interest, fiduciary rights, international obligation and 
the preservation of a biologically sustainable resource. We have 
retained this capacity, make no mistake.
<P>
	Partnering is not about privatization. Rather it is an opportunity 
for representative organizations and the industry to have a direct 
voice in fisheries management, developing ways to manage the 
fishery more efficiently and providing a more stable climate for 
long term business planning. It is a process that is open to all 
sectors of the industry, be they rich or poor, large or small. 
Fisheries associations too may participate in these agreements 
where individual fishers are satisfied that they represent their 
interests.
<P>
	Partnering will allow the Department of Fisheries and Oceans to 
concentrate its core responsibilities related to setting policies for 
fisheries conservation and protection of the resource. I do not 
pretend that partnering will end all the ups and downs of the fishing 
industry, but it will be able to ease some of the cyclical pressures. It 
can permit greater consistency of approach and greater consistency 
of income. The proof of course is in the pudding.
<P>
	I am seeking authority from Parliament to enter into long term 
partnering because of the very real success we have achieved 
through the limited number of current, short term co-management 
agreements. These agreements are precursors to partnering. They 
are not the sweetheart secret deals that some of our friends in the 
House and elsewhere would make them out to be. They are 
voluntary public agreements open to all fishers who opt to enter 
into them in a specific area in relation to a particular stock of fish. 
In fact this legislation would allow a much more open process with 
input from a wide range of participants. Let me provide a few 
concrete examples of how I have seen a better process in effect.
<P>
	In the snow crab fishery area in Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, 
fishers have collectively and in a calculated and businesslike 
manner based on their own experience, judgment, expertise and 
local knowledge entered into a multi-year co-management 
agreement. As part of this agreement they have collectively 
consented to share access to the valuable resource with additional 
fishers. In short they have decided to become co-managers in 
setting conservation and management objectives and in sharing the 
results of those decisions.
<P>
	Likewise on the Pacific coast fishers in the prawn trap fishery in 
British Columbia have collectively agreed to limit the number of 
traps used in their fishery. This decision was taken as a result of a 
marked increase in the number of traps being used and the 
recognition that this  resulted in a market glut and declining prices 
while failing to meet conservation objectives.
<P>
	It is this type of collective work and accountability that I want to 
build on. It is accountability based on an acknowledgement that
<P>
given the opportunity, fishers such as those in Nova Scotia and 
British Columbia will make good and responsible decisions.
<P>
	Quite frankly though, short term projects do not give the long 
term assurances that are required for the sound investment of 
money, commitment to stewardship of the resource and the 
dedication to self-monitoring. That is why I encourage Parliament 
to establish the legal basis for long term partnering in passing this 
bill in due course.
<P>
	Let me be clear that while partnering makes eminent sense, there 
is opposition out there. Some think that I am going to give away my 
constitutionally protected conservation authority. I can assure the 
House and anybody who wants to talk that way that I am not 
delegating my statutory responsibility to any private sector group.
<P>
	The same principles of flexibility, freedom, frugality and 
fairness are the foundations of this act. Whether we are talking 
about sanctions to deal with illegal fishing, whether we are talking 
about tribunals to deal more expeditiously with problems that 
occur, whether we are talking about fisheries management orders, 
they are based on those principles.
<P>
	As the House of Commons commences study on this bill, our 
challenge is to keep focused on securing an economically strong 
fishing industry, an ecologically sustainable fishery and an 
efficient and effective federal law.
<P>
	As this bill goes through second reading and proceeds to study 
by the Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans, I hope hon. 
members will help me to make this an even stronger law. Members 
of the standing committee have made a commitment to give this 
bill the thorough review complete with the public hearings it 
deserves. I support them in that task and look forward to hearing 
their views and through them the views of the stakeholders and all 
those involved in the industry.
<P>
	In bringing this bill to Parliament, the government has attempted 
to meet those ends based upon the shared Canadian values of 
freedom, flexibility, frugality and fairness. I look forward with all 
members of the House I am sure to moving this legislation forward 
guided by those very same principles that have always anchored 
our real success in Parliament and in our country.
