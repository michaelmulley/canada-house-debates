	<B>The Speaker:</B> Colleagues, this is the ruling for the groups of 
motions for report stage of Bill C-71, an act to regulate the 
manufacture, sale, labelling and promotion of tobacco products, to 
make consequential amendments to another act and to repeal 
certain acts.
<P>
	There are 34 motions in amendment standing on the Notice 
Paper for the report stage of Bill C-71. The motions will be 
grouped for debate as follows:

<P>
	I shall now propose Motions Nos. 1, 3, 8, 26 and 29 to the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kilger:</B> Mr. Speaker, following your ruling in terms of the 
groupings at report stage of Bill C-71, I wonder if there might be a 
disposition in the House among our colleagues that all the motions 
be deemed moved, read and seconded.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Does the hon. government whip have permission 
to put the motion to the House?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.

	I would like to remind everyone that Bill C-71 first, foremost 
and almost completely is a health bill. It is important to reflect on 
that because everyone in this House is aware of the human and 
economic costs associated with tobacco use.
<P>
	In Canada each and every year some 40,000 people suffer 
premature death as a result of tobacco use. There is a direct 
economic impact associated with that and an indirect cost as well. 
The direct economic impact is the cost of some $3.5 billion to the 
health care system, with an additional $11.5 billion in indirect costs 
associated with related illnesses that come with tobacco use.
<P>
	I am sure there is not anyone in this House who has not had a 
relative or a friend negatively impacted as a result of tobacco use or 
environmental smoke. Those losses cannot be measured or 
quantified. The emotional attachment we have to our loved ones 
who suffer as a result of the use of tobacco impacts each and every 
one of us. We all have family members and constituents who feel it 
is important to deal with this issue.
<P>
	Most important, tobacco use is a preventable source of much 
health damage. I want to underscore the word preventable. Behind 
the glossy advertising and a carefree lifestyle that sponsorships 
feed off, there is a record of disease and lives ended too soon.
<P>
	Protecting the health of Canadians in general and especially 
young people deserves special consideration. Some 85 per cent of 
all smokers started to smoke before the age of 16. Those who will 
suggest in the course of the debate that this issue is about adult 
choices should keep that in mind.
<P>
	I would like to speak to each of the motions and very briefly give 
an indication as to why they are where they are and what the 
government position is on each one.
<P>
	Motions Nos. 1, 3, 8, 26 and 29 have been proposed by the 
Minister of Health to give greater clarity to Bill C-71. The 
objective of the bill is to protect the health of Canadians. Therefore 
it focuses primarily on matters which touch the public rather than 
the internal business of the tobacco industry.
<P>
	To further illustrate this point, Motion No. 1 removes the word 
``seeds'' from the definition of tobacco products in clause 2.
<P>
	Clause 10 deals with the number of tobacco products in a 
package in the interest of providing small packages of tobacco 
products, like smokeless tobacco or cigarillos, that can be more 
affordable to underage youth. Motion No. 3 will allow the 
government to control the package size of tobacco products that are 
sold by weight rather than by unit. An example of this is the loose 
smokeless tobacco.
<P>
	With Motion No. 8 we are making an editorial change to remove 
the word ``the'' prior to the term ``health effects'' in clause 20.
<P>
	Motion No. 26 is also an editorial change to incorporate the word 
``within'' rather than the word ``in'' at clause 40.
<P>
	Finally, Motion No. 29 is an amendment to the French version of 
clause 45. It too is an editorial change to correct an error in the 
wording.
<P>
	I urge all members to keep this in mind as we vote on these 
motions.
<P>

<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, to begin with, I 
was almost going to say ``finally'', but I am not sure it is the right 
word to describe the report stage of this bill, which rightly 
infuriated hundreds of people and organizers of cultural and 
sporting events, primarily in Quebec.
<P>
	Organizers of such major events as the Festival du jazz, the Just 
for Laughs festival, the Montreal Grand Prix and many other events 
are concerned about the future of these events, as are many 
individuals. Basically, they are concerned about the future of 
Quebec culture. There is also the economic aspect to be considered, 
which represents millions of dollars.
<P>
	Here we are at report stage. The first group of motions contains 
amendments Nos. 1, 3, 8, 26 and 29. I will abide by the Speaker's 
decision. I must say the opposition cannot be opposed, since, in 
certain cases, the amendments involve changes in the definitions of 
words and, in others, the definition of tobacco products is 
broadened somewhat. The official opposition agrees with these 
changes.
<P>
	As this is my first speech, I must recall certain events. In 
December, the Liberal government wanted to fast track the bill 
through. Accordingly, only one speaker was permitted from each 
party. I was the only member of the official opposition to be able to 
speak in the House at second reading. One single speaker.
<P>
	Then, when the bill was being examined in committee, they tried 
to bulldoze the work of the committee. They wanted to hurry our 
work along. And this was done with the complicity of the third 
party, the Reform Party. What a scam, even before reading the bill, 
the Reform critic agreed to rush it through the House before 
Christmas.
<P>
	We are more serious than that. We read bills, we read them 
clause by clause. Although we share the objectives of the Minister 
of Health, we do not agree with his methods.
<P>
	This bill is vague, it will not be enforceable, and it may be 
challenged before the courts. More time is needed to review it and 
to determine the very important impact it  will have. The Minister 
resorts to such tactics as reversing the burden of proof; we think we 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8435"> 8435 </A></B>
<P>
should proceed with caution and take our time. We think the 
minister should be careful not to jeopardize cultural and sporting 
events.
<P>
	We worked, we took the time to hear all the witnesses, including 
representatives of the Chamber of Commerce of Montreal and 
spokespersons for major events.
<P>
	Finally, the official opposition, the Bloc Quebecois, was the only 
party to study and criticize this bill. We asked for explanations and 
clarifications, which were given in some cases. We also proposed 
amendments during the clause by clause study. Most of these 
amendments were rejected. However, we eventually succeeded in 
convincing the parliamentary secretary to accept one of them. To 
everything else, the government and its representative on the 
committee turned a deaf ear.
<P>
	We were successful in impeding the passage of this bill before 
the holiday season, as the government intended. It wanted to have 
this bill adopted during the holidays, when everybody is partying, 
so it would go unnoticed.
<P>
	What are they doing at report stage? Using the same kind of 
strategy. They schedule it on a Friday, hoping that members of the 
official opposition will not be numerous enough to defend 
Quebec's interests, cultural and sports events, and Quebec culture. 
They hoped that we would not be here, in the House, but here we 
are.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> Indeed, here we are.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dubé:</B> We will not let the government ram this bill through. 
We will not let the Minister of Health show off and make believe 
that he can play tough. This Minister of Health-who is not here, 
but I cannot say that-told the anti-smoking lobby that if he did not 
get this bill passed, people should not vote Liberal.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> You did not say that.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Volpe:</B> Mr. Speaker, a point of order. We know that we are 
all present in this House, some of us through our rhetoric and others 
by our spirit and by our intent. I think it is important for the 
member opposite to recognize the rules of this House and to 
acknowledge that the presence of the minister is here all the time, 
especially in this bill.
<P>
<B>(1020)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dubé:</B> Mr. Speaker, truth is hard to accept as we can see. 
The Liberals do not like it when an opposition party does its work 
properly in this House. Members of this government would like us 
to sleep on the job, but we will wake them up.
<P>
	If they agree with the bill, I suggest that the Minister of Health 
and his parliamentary secretary become the Don Quixote of health. 
I suggest they take real measures and tell people about it through 
adequate prevention and information programs. I suggest they 
invest funds to inform the people that tobacco is a dangerous 
product, harmful to health, and to convince them they should not 
smoke instead of introduing a hypocritical bill which will solve 
nothing, which is unenforceable and which will not be enforced.
<P>
	The best proof of this is the law forbidding the sale of tobacco 
products to young people under 18 in Canada. Do you know that 25 
per cent of all convenience stores in Canada do not respect that 
law? Do you know how many federal inspectors there are to ensure 
enforcement of that law all over Canada? Forty. It is totally 
hypocritical.
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary accuses us of using rhetoric. Those 
who use rhetoric are on the other side of the House. They are the 
ones who write equivocal and obscure bills. I almost feel I could 
use words like misleading or deceptive because in fact this bill will 
solve nothing at all. The government shows no compassion, no 
willingness whatsoever to deal with the issue of sponsorships.
<P>
	Please excuse me Mr. Speaker, I am furious, but I will calm 
down.
<P>
	In Quebec, organisers of cultural and sports events are raving 
mad. This government does not realize it is heading in the wrong 
direction. We invited it to take its time. Instead, it is forging ahead, 
using the steamroller approach, ramming this down our throats to 
expedite it before the election. They had better be careful, they are 
going to hear about this during the election campaign. The Bloc 
Quebecois will harp on the issue day in and day out. This is the 
wrong way to go and it is unacceptable. This way of doing things is 
far from transparent. Yes, these are words, but they have no 
meaning. Any one can challenge them. They create uncertainty for 
everybody.
<P>
	This morning people are wondering if the Grand Prix de 
Montreal is going to go ahead anyway. The government is 
proposing amendments to subclauses 24(2) and 24(3). But all they 
do is restrict publicity to the site of the event.
<P>
	Our question is simple: Will it be possible to broadcast the Grand 
Prix de Montreal on TV? Will it still be possible to show a car 
sponsored by a tobacco company? No, it will not. Clause 31 says 
no. Clause 31 goes as far as saying that as of this year, not within 
two years, not within 18 months, it will no longer be possible to 
film cars coming to the Grand Prix from outside. But they did not 
say anything about that.
<P>
	If this is not true, they should say so, and move amendments in 
the House to this effect.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8436"> 8436 </A></B>
<P>
	I believe the bill is badly flawed on two accounts. On one hand, 
its avowed objective is to ban this and that, but it leaves it to the 
regulations. However, the minister has not said what will be in 
his regulations. To defuse the controversy, this blustering health 
minister could let us know clearly what will be allowed and what 
will not. But he is doing nothing of the sort.
<P>
	All he wants to do is to look tough, to project the image of 
someone brave enough to get a controversial bill passed. But in 
fact, without the regulations, nothing in this bill can be 
implemented.
<P>
	This is why I have something to suggest to the parliamentary 
secretary who, through the whole process I must say, has listened 
more than the others to the arguments presented by the opposition. 
He has been very attentive.
<P>
<B>(1025)</B>
<P>
	I suggest he goes back to the drawing board before it is too late, 
and I urge that this bill be not rammed through the House before its 
disastrous impact on cultural and sports events has been reviewed.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to take a 
minute and clarify for all Canadians the position of the Reform 
Party on the procedural issues on which we decided to expedite this 
bill. One of the things my constituents approached me about was 
that sometimes a bill should be supportable. They said that 
sometimes things should be done in a non-partisan way.
<P>
	The Reform Party decided on this issue that we would try to do 
everything we could to prevent procedural delays. For that reason, 
when I made my speech at second reading I asked for the question 
to be now put. That prevented any amendments being put. It was 
fascinating to watch what happened because mistakes were made 
by both the official opposition and the government side. 
Individuals wanted to speak, stood in their place and were not 
recognized.
<P>
	A furore developed that was directed at Grant Hill, the 
non-partisan individual who moved that motion. It was done for 
only one reason, to prevent procedural delays. It was not meant to 
stifle debate. It was not meant to stop individuals who have strong 
positions on this bill from speaking. I want that to be clearly 
understood, especially by my colleagues in the Bloc who have 
chosen to say that this was inappropriate. I believe in the long term, 
a non-partisan approach to this bill will see us well served.
<P>
	Also I want to comment on the sponsorship issue. I am very 
interested in the Grand Prix and in the future of sponsorship events 
for Canada. I have looked at the international realm for what is 
happening with Grand Prix sponsorship across the world. I have 
found that sponsorship by tobacco companies is literally being 
withdrawn in the rest of the world.
<P>
	I listened to some of my colleagues. As a car racer myself, I have 
colleagues in this field who say that their careers will be cut short. I 
have listened to individuals say that there will no longer be cart 
races in Canada. I have listened to people say that the Grand Prix 
will be gone. I ask those individuals to be very frank and open 
because the Grand Prix in Britain no longer carries tobacco 
advertising on the cars. Britain is literally the heart of much of 
Grand Prix activity.
<P>
	Cart racing is primarily in the U.S. We have two races in Canada. 
Cart racers in one year's time will no longer be able to carry 
tobacco logos on the cars in the States. In other words, the U.S. will 
be banning sponsorship as well. The argument is specious.
<P>
	It is fascinating that the big event in my riding, the Spruce 
Meadows Masters, originally said that this bill would have a big 
impact on the event. After looking around other sponsorship was 
found. This bill will not kill the event, an event that was sponsored 
heavily by a tobacco company.
<P>
	I will not categorize what I want to say as a criticism of the 
minister for the year's grace period. However, I make a prediction 
during this year's grace period that there will be battle lines drawn 
by powerful forces to try to put this legislation in the garbage can. 
The next year will see, twice in the other place, a huge advertising 
campaign launched that will talk about freedom, that will talk 
about individuals unable to make choices that Canadians should be 
able to make.
<P>
	I am very sensitive to that. I do not think governments should 
intrude in areas where governments should not intrude.
<P>
<B>(1030 )</B>
<P>
	On this issue for the sake of youth, for the sake of our kids, for 
the sake of those individuals I have had personal experience with in 
my medical practice, I believe this bill, imperfect though it may be 
and even though I believe it could have gone a different road, it is 
better than the vacuum we have before us.
<P>
	I and my colleagues will try and make certain that we do nothing 
which can be misconstrued as a roadblock. We will try to criticize 
specific areas that could be altered. We will try to make 
improvements to the bill in a non-partisan way. That is the 
approach that Reformers have taken on this important health issue.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as always, I remind myself that it is 
a privilege for me to speak in the House on behalf of the 
constituents of Hamilton West, more specifically, the constituents, 
Ms. Smith, Mr. Sullivan, Harper's Wholesale, Food Fare Variety 
and others who have expressed concerns that measures contained in 
Bill C-71 could, if passed, as presently written do a number of 
things.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8437"> 8437 </A></B>
<P>
	First, increase a company's operations costs by requiring 
extensive monthly sales reports by brand and by customer. Second, 
further increase costs by forcing them to replace staff under 18 
years of age who will be prohibited from handling tobacco 
products. Third, prevent a company from doing business by 
putting a gag on sales reps who will not be allowed to comment 
on tobacco products. Fourth, force many retailers to close their 
doors because of loss of revenue from increased costs of 
redesigning their stores to comply with display regulations.
<P>
	I have done a little homework on these concerns and I am happy 
to say that this moment I can dispel these myths. So let us deal with 
the last question first.
<P>
	In the government's consultative document ``Tobacco Control: A 
Blueprint to Protect the Health of Canadians'', it was proposed that 
only one pack of cigarettes per brand be exposed for sale at retail. 
The purpose of the proposal was to reduce the inducement youth to 
purchase tobacco products while at the same time providing adult 
customers with information regarding brand availability.
<P>
	During consultations with the retail sector on the blueprint, it 
became apparent that this proposal would not be practical and 
would involve additional expenses for retailers. Because of the 
concerns expressed by them during consultations, the blueprint 
proposal was not carried forward into Bill C-72, the tobacco act. So 
retailers can continue to display products for sale. Retailers along 
with other interested parties will be consulted regarding the 
development of any regulations or policy guidelines concerning 
product display.
<P>
	On the subject of display, my constituents are concerned that 
once the legislation comes into effect retailers will have to lock up 
the tobacco products they sell. While Bill C-71 does not require 
retailers to lock up tobacco products for sale in their stores, it 
prohibits, except in duty free stores, self-serve displays which 
allow the customers to handle the tobacco product before paying 
for it.
<P>
	In addition self-serve displays create the impression that tobacco 
products are as harmless and ordinary as other consumer goods 
offered for sale in the same manner. So we have to balance that 
particular scenario.
<P>
	Let us address the myth that Bill C-71 is a massive and 
unwarranted assault on retailers who will lose money and may have 
to fire every employee under 18. The federal government's 
objective is to reduce the demand for tobacco products and to 
restrict youth access to tobacco. The government does not intend to 
licence retailers who can or cannot sell tobacco products. Each and 
every retailer who now sells tobacco products will be able to 
continue to sell those products. There is no provision in Bill C-71 
restricting the age of persons selling or handling tobacco products 
and there is no offence for possessing tobacco products.
<P>
	Retailers will continue to be able to hire persons under the age of 
18 to sell or deliver tobacco products. The government's objective 
is to prevent the sale of tobacco products to minors.
<P>
	With respect to the point about requiring extensive monthly sales 
reports, reporting requirements will be the same. They will be the 
same as they were under the previous tobacco control legislation, 
the Tobacco Products Control Act, which was in effect from 1988 
to 1995.
<P>
<B>(1035)</B>
<P>
	I will discuss the myth that there would be a gag on sales 
representatives. In his wisdom, the Minister of Health has amended 
clause 18 in Bill C-71 by replacing lines 18 to 20 on page 7 with the 
following:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-a promotion by a tobacco grower or a manufacturer that is directed at tobacco 
growers, manufacturers, persons who distribute tobacco products or retailers but 
not, either directly or indirectly, at consumers.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In short, Bill C-71 restricts tobacco advertising and promotions 
that affect the public, not communications within the tobacco 
industry. This change to the application clause of the bill will 
provide a greater certainty that internal business communications 
are not caught by the bill.
<P>
	On behalf of these constituents and many other constituents of 
my colleagues I have spoken to on this matter, I hope their serious 
concerns have been addressed in Bill C-71.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Speller (Haldimand-Norfolk, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
want to briefly clarify one point on Motion No. 1, which reads that 
the Minister of Health will amend Bill C-71 in clause 2 by 
replacing lines 24 and 25 on page 2 with the following: ``tobacco 
leaves and any extract of tobacco leaves''.
<P>
	I thank the Minister of Health and the parliamentary secretary 
for including that section. It was a concern of tobacco producers in 
my area of Haldimand-Norfolk because ``seeds'' was previously 
included in the bill. There was a concern that their work within the 
tobacco industry to produce that tobacco might be impacted by this 
bill.
<P>
	On behalf of the tobacco board I have had discussions with the 
Minister of Health, the parliamentary secretary and their staff on 
this issue. For the tobacco producers in my riding, they have made 
sure the bill does not impact on them.
<P>
	The intent of the bill was not to impact on the growers. The 
intent of the bill, as the minister has stated, is to impact on the 
manufacturers of tobacco. Through this amendment, Motion No. 1, 
and subsequent amendments the minister has ensured that tobacco 
growers are not impacted by the legislation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8438"> 8438 </A></B>
<P>
	On behalf of the Ontario Flue-Cured Tobacco Growers' 
Marketing Board, I want to thank the minister and his staff for 
doing that.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, we are 
talking this morning about Bill C-71, regarding tobacco 
advertising, which has angered a good many people. I would like to 
put this bill into perspective and explain why so many people are 
furious about this measure.
<P>
	In September 1995, in its judgment in the case of 
RJR-MacDonald Inc. vs. the Solicitor General of Canada, the 
Supreme Court of Canada declared ultra vires some parts of the law 
on tobacco products dealing with advertising. In December 1995, 
following this decision, the previous minister, Diane Marleau, 
tabled a framework on the approach the government intended to 
use in its anti-tobacco strategy.
<P>
	On December 2, 1996, after several postponements, from Spring 
to early Fall and then from early Fall to late Fall, the present 
Minister of Health, David Dingwall, introduced Bill C-71, an act to 
regulate the manufacture, sale, labelling and promotion of tobacco 
products, to make consequential amendments to another act and to 
repeal certain acts. Since then, the procedure used to get this bill 
through has been questionable, in our opinion. The bill was 
introduced and, before we even had a chance to debate it, referred 
to committee.
<P>
<B>(1040)</B>
<P>
	We were given the permission, through a procedure that does not 
normally happen in the House, to have a single speaker, and then 
the bill was sent to committee for a clause by clause study. The 
Bloc Quebecois had to force the government to agree to hear a 
minimum of witnesses.
<P>
	This morning, this bill is back in the House after the minister's 
office in Ottawa quietly moved some amendments, at two o'clock 
in the morning, while the general public was concerned with the 
budget. No wonder we are angry. This is hypocritical, it is 
appalling to see how the government is in a rush to get this bill 
passed. It is probably because the minister has staked his life on it.
<P>
	I know that some members of the government also are angry at 
the procedure and the amendments that the government has just 
moved. These amendments mostly affect sponsorship and the 
economy in Quebec; we are talking 50 per cent of the economic 
benefits for cultural and sports organizations, for Montreal and the 
surrounding area. This means $133 million multiplied by 50 per 
cent, that is, half of that amount. No wonder we are angry, at a time 
when the government is cutting transfers to the provinces, when it 
has been reducing transfer payments for a very long time, always at 
the expense of the province of Quebec.
<P>
	Consequently, we will debate this bill today to show the people 
that we are able to defend Quebec's interests. We voted for this bill 
at second reading for the sake of people's health. But now, we are 
up against an amendment on sponsorship and we are unable to see 
whether it will be effective. How can a poster from a tobacco 
company for the Just for Laughs festival deter young people from 
starting to smoke? There is absolutely no opinion poll. All the 
opinion polls that were done show us that it is not an effective 
measure.
<P>
	Instead of spending $100 million on propaganda for the flag, 
perhaps we would be better off to put $100 million in educational 
kits to deter our young people from smoking.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to say a few words on this bill as well. I would like to say from 
the outset that I support our party's position on this bill in trying to 
encourage young people not to smoke and enhance the public 
awareness of the dangers of smoking.
<P>
	But I find myself at odds with a few facts. The one thing wrong 
with this bill that I feel Canadians should know is that it gives the 
government exceptionally strong powers in making changes.
<P>
	The regulation making powers that are given are extremely 
broad. It is done through orders in council, governor in council. It 
has far reaching powers and it is all throughout the bill. It is 
pervasive throughout the bill.
<P>
	What is wrong with that is if there are some objections or some 
concerns by the Canadian public then cabinet can just do what it 
wants without coming back to this House. This House is a place 
where laws are made. This House is where politicians should stand 
up and argue in favour or against certain bills. With this one 
particular aspect of the bill flawed the government nevertheless is 
proceeding.
<P>
	We do support the intent of the bill but we are vehemently 
opposed to the manner in which the government has worded the bill 
and the powers that it gives the cabinet.
<P>
	The reason the government has done that is it feels that if there is 
a challenge in the courts about the legality or illegality of any 
aspect of this bill, then it can quickly huddle together, make 
changes, make amendments and then proceed with life.
<P>
<B>(1045 )</B>
<P>
	I do not think that is how governments should be run. I do not 
think that is how our laws should be made. Our laws should be 
made subject to scrutiny by members of Parliament all across 
Canada who can debate ideas back and forth. That is a serious flaw 
in this bill.
<P>
	This bill, when we really think about it, is all about money. It is 
about money for the government from the revenues it makes from 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8439"> 8439 </A></B>
<P>
the taxes it charges on tobacco, for the tobacco companies 
themselves which make money by manufacturing, selling and 
distributing the product and the promoters of sporting events who 
ask the tobacco companies to sponsor their car events, tennis 
events, horse riding events so they can present something to the 
sporting public as if they are doing some honourable and wonderful 
thing.
<P>
	Is smoking legal or illegal? If it is legal, what the heck is 
government trying to do? It is walking a fine line by saying: ``It is 
legal. We will let you sell it but we will tax the heck out of you. We 
know it is bad for you. We know it causes cancer. We know it kills. 
We know that 70 per cent or 80 per cent of youth who smoke 
become addicted, unlike alcohol where only 15 per cent of the 
people become addicted''. Why do we not have a debate on 
whether we should make smoking legal or illegal or restrict 
tobacco? Is it a drug or is it not a drug?
<P>
	Let us get up here and talk about that. The government should 
not try to walk a fine line as if it is a sharing, caring Liberal 
government and it will look after the Canadian public. It knows 
smoking is bad for Canadians but it it will let tobacco companies 
sponsor events, and then again maybe it will not. The government 
will let the tobacco companies sell their products but it will not let 
them label them, they cannot put them in a vending machine. This 
is ridiculous.
<P>
	Is smoking legal or illegal? Why do people not stand up and 
debate that in the first place? If it is legal, do tobacco companies 
not have rights according to the charter of rights and freedoms? I 
am not supporting or condoning smoking. It is a personal choice. If 
it is legal and it is a personal choice why does government not butt 
out? Why does it have to spend hours and days and millions of 
dollars in hearings trying to walk that fine line pretending that it 
knows better than the Canadian public what is good for them?
<P>
	Is smoking legal or illegal? If it is legal, individuals have rights 
and companies have rights. Tobacco is a product that can be sold. 
Why is government interfering? If <I>x</I> number of people want to 
smoke, let them smoke. If <I>x</I> number of people want to kill 
themselves, let them kill themselves.
<P>
	Why does government have to look after the youth and child 
poverty? Why do parents not take some responsibility in looking 
after the babies they bring into this world? Do they not have a 
responsibility? Should they not be telling them that smoking is not 
good for them, that certain foods are not good for them and alcohol 
is not good for them? Why is it that government has to do all these 
things all the time? It is pathetic.
<P>
	I find myself at conflict over this bill. I find myself not liking 
smoking. I will speak out against smoking. I will say that it is bad. I 
do not like to go into a smoke filled room. I do not like the smell of 
my clothes after I have been some place where a lot of people 
smoke. I am a non-smoker.
<P>
	Why is it that this government is now telling tobacco companies 
which are growing, manufacturing and distributing something that 
is legal what they can and cannot do? Why is government getting 
into our lives in such a regulatory fashion? It imposes everything 
on us: it knows better; if somebody comes up with a study, then that 
is it, that is the law and that is what the government is going to do.
<P>
	I do not like that and I do not like the position it puts me in as a 
politician. When I think about it, why do I have to argue against the 
rights of a company to sell something that is legal? How can 
anyone argue both ways? How can government have it both ways? 
How can the government say it is looking after young people? Is it 
not looking after adults and the older people? To heck with them. 
They can smoke and they can die but the government will look 
after the young people. It is going to prevent smoking for youth.
<P>
	It is hypocritical. If smoking is legal, it is legal. If the 
government wants to control it, then control it, but control it in a 
way that does not infringe upon the rights of the manufacturers.
<P>
<B>(1050 )</B>
<P>
	This brings me back to my point about regulatory decision 
making by orders in council. The cabinet can do whatever it wants 
to shift with the changing times, to change with the mood of the 
people and whoever is suing someone or whatever the case may be.
<P>
	That is not right. I would like to have an intelligent person on the 
other side who is in favour of this bill tell the Canadian public why 
the government cannot make a law which is black and white: Here 
it is, baby; you either follow it or you do not. Then if there are 
objections, it either stands the test of legality or it does not. Why 
can we not do that? I have had conversations with members of the 
health department. They say it is because they are worried that 
when they are challenged by the tobacco companies it will get 
kicked out of court and they will be two or three years behind the 
times and all the young people will start to smoke again and 
become addicted.
<P>
	Why can the government not pass a law by saying here it is, this 
is the way it is, this is the way it is going to be, and it is legal. Is 
there not a problem? Is there not an issue on legality or illegality? 
What are we trying to do?
<P>
	To skirt the issue the government introduces something which 
will set a bad precedent. It is a bad precedent to set because it will 
allow public officials when they become cabinet minister, to 
change the laws and rules without reporting to the House, without 
being held accountable and without allowing themselves to come 
under scrutiny.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="8440"> 8440 </A></B>
<P>
	My main point is that we support the government in its attempt 
to enhance public awareness of the health hazards of tobacco. We 
recognize the impact which it has on youth who are easily 
influenced and like to rebel and do their own thing. We should 
spend some time pointing out to them that tobacco is very 
addictive and they should be careful with it. We know it is not 
healthy, but it is their choice.
<P>
	I have a problem with the legality or illegality and I have a 
problem with Bill C-71 in terms of how certain measures in the bill 
can be changed. That is my criticism of the bill. I want it to be 
clearly understood that we support everything which is in the bill, 
but that is one area which the government should be willing to 
delete. It should be willing to say: ``Here is the law. Here is what 
we would like to do, and all hon. members of Parliament can either 
approve it or not approve it''.
<P>
	The government should not be playing games with advertising 
and how this product can or cannot be promoted. We are infringing 
upon the rights of others in trying to defend the health of 
Canadians. We are at odds; we are in conflict.
<P>
	I wish the government would discuss that a bit so that at least I 
could understand it. If I am the only member of the House who 
does not understand it, I would still like to have the indulgence of 
the government. I would really appreciate the indulgence of the 
government to explain it to me.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, as the 
member of Parliament representing Trois-Rivières, I am very 
pleased to finally speak on Bill C-71, the Tobacco Act, which is an 
act to regulate the manufacture, sale, labelling and promotion of 
tobacco products, to make consequential amendments to another 
act and to repeal certain acts. The purpose of this bill is to protect 
Canadians and Quebecers, young persons in particular, from 
inducements to use tobacco products and to restrict access to 
tobacco products.
<P>
	In this case as in others, no one can stand against what is good 
and right. Essentially, it is obvious that, in response to legitimate 
public concern, the government is acting with good intentions in 
wanting to protect public health, and the health of young persons in 
particular, and to restrict access to tobacco products. There is 
nothing wrong with that, but there is a limit. As you know we must 
not lose touch with reality, especially economic reality as it relates 
to cultural and sports events.
<P>
<B>(1055)</B>
<P>
	Cultural as well as sports events rely on sponsorship and, in this 
particular instance, this support comes from the private sector.
<P>
	For once that the private sector is genuinely philanthropic in its 
actions, in the name of doing what is right, we are putting 
roadblocks in the way of those at the receiving end of the 
sponsorship, the organizers who, painstakingly, year after year, 
from coast to coast, in Vancouver, Toronto, Montreal-and 
Trois-Rivières, of course-in particular, put together major 
cultural and sports events with the help of hundreds and thousands 
of volunteers. With its good intentions, this government is 
seriously compromising the future of these events.
<P>
	We are talking about $60 million a year in sponsorships from the 
private sector across Canada, $30 million or 50 per cent for 
Quebec. That is how we can enjoy great events like the Just for 
Laughs festival, the Benson and Hedges Symphony of Fire, the 
Montreal Grand Prix and the Players Grand Prix in Trois-Rivières.
<P>
	That is what is at stake here. Such events are being compromised 
deliberately. Next summer, Trois-Rivières will host the 28th 
edition of its Grand Prix. The event means $8 to $10 million in 
investments for the region. Hotel rooms have been reserved at least 
a year in advance throughout the Mauricie region. From an 
economic point of view, this is the region's main event.
<P>
	Lacking vision and having all but lost its grip, the government 
dispenses with consultation, shrugs off people's legitimate 
representations, and keeps trying to have its own way, by slyly 
rushing things through the day after the budget speech, as well as 
today, which was supposed to be set aside for the reply to the 
budget speech. The government is flouting all the rules and 
muzzling the opposition at second reading.
<P>
	Once again, as my colleague from Drummond pointed out a 
moment ago, amendments were proposed late at night to try and 
keep public pressure to a minimum.
<P>
	I still have five minutes, I think, so I will continue later, after 
oral question period.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Yes, you still have at least five minutes. You will 
have the floor when we come back after oral question period.

<HR>

<P>
	His ties to the YWCA date back to the late 1930s when the 
organization saw a need in Chinatown for social services and 
bridges to help its Chinese Canadian residents overcome hostility 
and racism.
<P>
	Mr. Wong came from a small village in Toi-San county in 1913. 
Like other Chinese immigrants, he had to pay a $500 head tax in 
order to enter Canada.
<P>
	In 1931 he founded the Jong Wah Drug Store which he and his 
wife Esther ran for 47 years in the heart of Vancouver's Chinatown.

	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, today we 
welcome VIA Rail's decision to impose a moratorium on the 
abandonment of the railway tracks at the Lévis station, to the 
benefit of the Charny-Sainte-Foy line. The representations made 
by the Bloc Quebecois, the Government of Quebec and local 
stakeholders have paid off. This project could have resulted in 
serious safety problems.
<P>
	Passenger trains serving eastern Canada were to go through 
Charny's Joffre yard, cross four railway crossings, and even back 
up over the Quebec City bridge, toward the Sainte-Foy station. 
These dangerous manoeuvres by passenger trains must be reviewed 
more thoroughly.
<P>
	Thanks to the moratorium, all the parties concerned by the 
abandonment of this rail line will have the time to look at the 
various alternatives and to make the best decision in the interest of 
the region and of train users.

weeks premature but nevertheless perfect little bundles of joy.
<P>
	Claudia Diane Sprau weighed in at 4 pounds, 6 ounces and was 
17 inches long with lots of dark hair. Jackson Karl Sprau weighed 
in at 5 pounds, 2 ounces and was 18 inches long with a little less 
hair. Both babies and mother are healthy and doing well.
<P>
	That is the good news that I bring today. What news do we have 
to give Claudia and Jackson for their future? I am sad to say that 
they already have a debt to pay of least $20,000 each because of 30 
years of financial mismanagement by Liberal and Conservative 
politicians.
<P>
	Since I allowed some of this to happen by not paying attention to 
who I voted for in the past, I will probably have to help them out 
with my greatly reduced senior's pension that the finance minister 
has promised me.

rising in late 1996 to about 45 per cent above the mid-1995 lows.

	This is tremendous news for realtors and builders in 
Etobicoke-Lakeshore. New residential developments like Mystic 
Point, Greystone Manor and Grand Harbour Phase IV have all 
sprung up in my riding.

were up by 8 per cent in the last quarter of 1996. This is marvellous

	<B>Mr. John Finlay (Oxford, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 125 years ago in

incorporated by the province of Ontario at the request of South 
Oxford's MPP Adam Oliver and Tillsonburg's premier citizen, Mr. 
E. D. Tillson.
<P>
	Although the town has changed a great deal in 125 years, the 
spirit of the people of Tillsonburg has not. The resourcefulness and 
enthusiasm of the town's founders are still present in all areas of 
the town's life today.
<P>
	Tillsonburg abounds with volunteers who are assisting in sports, 
arts, service clubs and church groups. To live in Tillsonburg is to be 
part of a family that looks out for each other and cares about each 
other. It has everything that a city does with the charm and safety of 
a small town.

	Tillsonburg would like to invite all Canadians to the festivities 
scheduled for its 125th anniversary in 1997, the year in which its 
past touches its future.

	From May to November of this year, several hundred rural 
young people who have completed at least two years of high school 
have the opportunity to learn new skills by staffing Government of 
Canada rural exhibit booths at local fairs and exhibitions under the 
direction of booth supervisors provided by Agriculture and

	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, two

	These two women clearly showed that English is the true official

	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Liberals campaigned in 1993 on a promise of jobs, 
jobs, jobs. That promise has never materialized for my constituents 
in Kootenay West-Revelstoke or, for that matter, anywhere else in 
Canada.
<P>
	The Liberals latest tax grab, a 70 per cent increase in the Canada 
pension plan payroll tax, is the latest example of how the Liberals 
are killing jobs instead of creating them. This outrageous payroll 
tax increase will cost the workers in my riding $652 a year. In a 
small company of only 10 people, this amounts to almost $7,000 
for the employees and another $7,000 for the employer. That is 
nearly $14,000 from one small company.
<P>
	The government keeps claiming that there are no new taxes. 
Why has the average Canadian family seen its real disposable 
income shrink by $3,000 since 1993?
<P>
	For every $1 the government rips out of the pockets of my 
constituents it gives back 23 cents. Twenty-three cents cannot

	While there will be more money for flags and the

support artists will continue to see massive cuts over the next two

department will result in core programs being entirely eliminated. 
CBC will get $10 million back for radio from the over $400 million

North America, serving an audience steeped in the rich Canadian 
traditions and culture of the sport.
<P>
	Over 60 per cent of players playing the league come from 
Canada. The NHL has prospered from the contribution of Canadian 
fans, players and teams and particularly from the north-south 
rivalry.
<P>
	It will be a long road to future prosperity as fans are invited to 
watch Oklahoma versus Columbus. Hockey still ranks as the 
number one sport by fans in Canada. In turning down Hamilton's

pastime.

	Economic benefits exceeding $130 million and more than 2,000 
jobs mean absolutely nothing to the Liberals.

	The coalition for freedom of sponsorship is not asking for the

sponsorship. What is even worse, the proposed bill is leading us 
straight to a legal challenge that will probably end up before the 
Supreme Court, at taxpayers' expense, of course.

for innovation and research. The $800 million start-up investment 
in the Canadian Foundation for Innovation targets post-secondary 
institutions, research hospitals, the business community, the 
volunteer sector and individuals.
<P>
	For the world class high technology industry in my riding of 
Cambridge the government's initial investment and its annual $180 
million contribution will provide a tremendous boost.
<P>
	This support will not only expand research but will keep Canada 
on the cutting edge of technology and lead to job opportunities for 
young Canadians.

	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday, the Minister of Human Resources 
Development said in the House that the new program to deal with 
child poverty was a permanent program.
<P>
	However, the Prime Minister said something else. I will quote 
him, and you will realize why: ``Permanent? I do not know. I do not 
know how long I will be around myself. We said that when we 
adopt a program like this one, it is a first step''. His statement is 
somewhat enigmatic, worthy of Yogi Berra: it is permanent as long 
it is permanent, and when it is no longer permanent, it is not.
<P>
	I wish the minister would explain how he can say this program is 
permanent, when the Prime Minister says he does not know how 
long it will be permanent.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the hon. member 
for asking this question and giving me an opportunity to again 
confirm our government's commitment to a federal platform that 
will be renewed annually, for the benefit of children in low income 
families.
<P>
	We feel this is a very attractive approach because it will be done 
in partnership with the provinces, which also support the objective 
of fighting child poverty in poor and low income families.
<P>
	The Prime Minister was also referring to other programs, under 
the authority of the Minister of Health-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pettigrew:</B> No, he was distinctly referring to both. I can 
confirm that the national child benefit is a permanent program, 
something people can rely on for the future. This is a very 
attractive program.
<P>
	However, there are other programs in which this government 
will invest, so that the provinces can start pilot projects, but this 
will be in consultation with the provinces.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8445"> 8445 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, like the Prime Minister, we have a pretty good idea what 
permanent means. In 1944, income tax was supposed to be 
temporary, and we have seen how permanent it has become. 
Conversely, what is supposed to be permanent becomes temporary. 
In their case, it is pretty complicated.
<P>
	Let me get this straight: are the Minister of Human Resources 
Development and the Prime Minister in fact telling us that, 
basically, the federal standards and federal control are permanent 
and the funding is more likely to be temporary, because any 
government can change its mind? How can he talk about permanent 
today, unless he is referring to standards and control, when the 
funding, and we see this in their budget, can disappear at any time?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for 
Laurier-Sainte-Marie has trouble getting used to our new 
federalism which is not authoritarian and does not impose 
standards. He is surprised that we succeeded where he thought we 
would fail. That is what bothers the opposition.
<P>
	This is a national project which we discussed with the provinces 
of this country, and the provinces have agreed to reinvest the 
money according to certain priorities we will establish together this 
spring. What bothers him is that modern federalism works. This is 
not about standards but about partnership.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I must say I admire the Minister of Human Resources 
Development and his ability to understand his leader's statements. 
It must have taken a long time to understand statements as crystal 
clear as this one by the Prime Minister.
<P>
	The figures show that $4.5 billion has been cut in health care and 
social services, $1.3 billion in the case of Quebec. Another $50 
million is to be injected into the system, with only $12 million for 
Quebec.
<P>
	Here is my question for the minister. Is this his idea of 
compassion? How can he talk about compassion and give only $12 
million to Quebec and $50 million to Canada as a whole, when this 
government made all Canadians poorer by cutting $4.5 billion in 
health, social services and post-secondary education? How can this 
government give us only $12 million, when $1.3 billion was cut in 
payments to Quebec alone?
<P>
<B>(1120)</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the 
purpose of the government's cuts was to preserve our social 
programs, and we did that. Reducing the deficit means we can now 
guarantee that the minimum level of funding for social programs 
will be $11 billion.
<P>
	Furthermore, when the government decided to cut, it cut 40 per 
cent more in its own house than it cut in transfers to the provinces. 
The cuts in transfers to the provinces represent only 3 per cent of 
their revenue. Consequently, we made far greater sacrifices 
ourselves than we imposed on the provinces. And we did it to save 
our social programs.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human Resources 
Development.
<P>
	After hearing for several months that it was getting ready to 
introduce a marvellous program to fight child poverty, now we 
learn that this government has set aside a measly $50 million this 
year to fund its supposedly impressive program. At the same time, 
we learn that the government is going to spend over $20 million to 
finance its propaganda activities.
<P>
	Which is more important to this government: fighting child 
poverty or stepping up the number of flags and propaganda 
activities, using every means possible?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the opposition is generous to 
give us an opportunity to set the record straight.
<P>
	Once again, more money will be invested, including another $70 
million in addition to what was set aside this year, for a total of 
$195 million since last year. We will be putting another $850 
million into the child tax benefit in 1998. We are giving ourselves 
one year because we want to do this in partnership with the 
provinces.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pettigrew:</B> Rather than setting up the program unilaterally, 
the federal government wanted to set it up in partnership with the 
provinces, making sure that it meets their objectives as far as 
income support goes.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if the government is giving itself an additional year, there 
is an election somewhere in between. What this government must 
be made to understand is the importance of having the flag appear 
not only on the hood, but on the cheque as well.
<P>
	If the government truly had the interests of Canadian children 
living in poverty at heart, it would get out of this provincial area of 
jurisdiction.
<P>
	Why does the government not transfer the tax points to the 
provinces which, like Quebec, have asked for them, so that they 
can administer a genuine family policy? Which does the 
government really want to help: poor children or its next election 
campaign?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the 
role of the Government of Canada is precisely to redistribute 
wealth throughout the country and to balance the ability of the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8446"> 8446 </A></B>
<P>
provinces to pay. In this particular case, it is a role that obviously 
cannot be played by a province and it is a role that the federal 
government is not only prepared to accept, but one that it is 
assuming.
<P>
	When we come to the conclusion that, in order to help Canadian 
children living in poverty, there must be a transfer from better off 
regions or individuals, we are doing our duty and giving the 
provinces, with their agreement, the base that will then allow them 
to use their money to put together programs more suited to their 
particular needs.
<P>
	This is one of the roles of the federal government, to redistribute 
wealth, a role that, once again, the provinces cannot play and that 
the federal government is going to assume fully and with complete 
justification.

	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, once upon a time the finance minister rightly called 
payroll taxes a cancer on job creation. His department called CPP 
premiums a payroll tax and every sane thinking economist in the 
country agrees with that.
<P>
<B>(1125 )</B>
<P>
	The fact is CPP premiums are a payroll tax and the finance 
minister has just hiked them by 70 per cent.
<P>
	How many jobs will the Liberals kill with this $10 billion tax 
grab? Is it 50,000? Is it 100,000? Is it 150,000? How many jobs do 
they plan on killing with this $10 billion tax hike?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Canada pension plan is an investment fund that is there to ensure 
that older people will be able to get money after they are 65 in order 
to have a reasonable income for years to come. In order to fund this 
investment fund, we have to put premiums into it. What we did was 
ensure the sustainability of that fund. That is what the provinces 
wanted. It is what Canadians want.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it seems that for some 30 years it has been a good 
investment or a bad investment. Now it seems to be a good 
investment. If it was such a good investment back then, why is it in 
so much trouble?
<P>
	Here are the facts. Canadians used to pay around 5 per cent of 
their salary for a $9,000 annual pension. Now the Liberals are 
going to charge them double for less pension. That is Liberal 
economics.
<P>
	If young Canadians invested their pension premiums into even 
the most conservative RRSP, they could retire with an annual 
pension salary of $45,000 a year. That is five times as much as the 
Liberals are offering.
<P>
	How does the government have the audacity to ask young 
Canadians to pay more for less while their own MPs' feet are 
firmly planted at the MP pension trough?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
find it hard to understand why members of the Reform Party do not 
understand. After decades of ignoring the problem we finally had 
the audacity-the guts-to tackle it. We have tackled it in the right 
way. We have tackled it in partnership with the provinces, 
including Conservative provinces like Alberta and Ontario. We 
have tackled it in a way that will permit older people to be sure they 
will get their pensions. And we have tackled it when a number of 
analyses indicated that it would be empty by the year 2015.
<P>
	The way we did it, we are ensuring that it is sustainable. 
Canadians can count on us.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, now we know that there has been a problem and that the 
Liberals have been ignoring it for decades.
<P>
	Canadians can do the math. They know that 10 per cent of their 
salary for a $9,000 pension is a pathetic investment. Ten per cent 
can get them $45,000. Twelve per cent can get them $65,000. 
Fifteen per cent can get them $85,000.
<P>
	Once again, how does the government have the audacity to force 
young Canadians to accept this incredibly bad investment when 
they can do five times better by investing on their own? How does 
it have the nerve to force young Canadians to accept that pathetic 
pension plan? How does it do it?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Canada pension plan is run on a long actuarial basis, like most 
other pension funds.
<P>
	What is important to remember is that mandatory RRSPs may be 
good for the rich, but they are not that good for every working 
Canadian. We are working for every Canadian, whether rich or 
poor. Our reform deals with the needs of Canadians.

	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, what the official opposition feared has come to pass: the 
UI fund surplus accumulated over two years will reach $12 billion 
in 1998.
<P>
	Instead of concrete assistance with job creation, the government 
is announcing only a ridiculous decrease in contributions, 10 cents, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8447"> 8447 </A></B>
<P>
10 months from now, thus continuing to pay off its deficit by taxing 
workers, employers and the unemployed.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Human Resources 
Development. Does the minister realize that this scandalous way of 
diverting money from the unemployment insurance fund totally 
compromises job creation and that, in addition, it will be stealing 
bread from the mouths of those already suffering from the scourge 
of unemployment, because the reform will be taking $1 billion in 
benefits away from them this year?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the 
finance critic must realize that employment insurance is itself a 
fund in which there are deficits some years, which have to be 
balanced out by surpluses.
<P>
	A few years ago, the unemployment insurance fund deficit was 
over $10 billion. Now we have to make sure that we will not be 
obliged to penalize Canadian workers and employers in a few years 
by again raising rates to where they were before.
<P>
	The contribution rate will fall from $3.30 to $2.80 at the 
beginning of 1998. It is because we are taking into consideration 
the needs of workers and employers that we are administering this 
fund as what it is: an employment insurance fund.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there are two inaccuracies in what we have just been told. 
First, the surplus accumulated in the unemployment insurance fund 
is not put aside for a rainy day, to help the growing ranks of the 
unemployed in a recession. Rather, it is being spent by the Minister 
of Finance to reduce his deficit. A bit of exaggeration is fine, but let 
us not get carried away here.
<P>
	Second, the new employment insurance program in place since 
January will take $1 billion in benefits away from the unemployed. 
Is that what you call helping the unemployed through bad times? 
My foot. Normally, the response ought to come from the Minister 
of Human Resources Development. We can see, however, that they 
bring in a supposedly senior minister when there are real questions.
<P>
	Since they are wasting the unemployment insurance surplus on 
deficit reduction, what exactly are they going to do to show the 
Minister of Finance in a good light? What are they going to do 
when there is a recession, and the number of unemployed workers 
is even higher than today? Are they going to increase the deficit? 
Are they going to dump responsibilities onto the provinces or 
increase-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I am sorry to interrupt the hon. member.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, if 
the employment insurance fund is nothing but a source of revenue, 
why would the Conservative government have increased 
unemployment insurance contributions from $1.95 to $2.25 in 
1990? Because the deficit at that time was $12 billion.
<P>
	Even if the opposition critic were right, what would the 
unemployment insurance contributions be replaced with? With 
higher income tax? Is that what he is asking for? Does he want to 
raise the other taxes on Canadians?

	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the government

CPP is the crappiest investment in the country.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.

I would ask him please to withdraw the word crappiest. Would he 
do that?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Epp:</B> Mr. Speaker, I withdraw that word and I ask you 
substitute the worst adjective that is permissible for this pension 
plan.
<P>
	This is double the premium for a smaller return. It is nothing but 
a job killing $10 billion tax grab to cover the gross miscalculations 
of the Liberal and Conservative governments of the past 30 years.
<P>
	How can the minister justify foisting this tax grab on Canadian 
workers and businesses, killing jobs and putting tremendous 
economic hardship on Canadian families?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
investing in seniors is never a bad investment. It is clear that we 
have reformed, together with the provinces, the Canada pension 
plan. In order to make it sustainable in the long run we have, 
together with the provinces, changed the benefits and changed the 
rates at which people contribute to the fund so that people in the 
future can count on it.
<P>
	Our role as a government is not to help only the rich, but to help 
everybody in this society.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, no matter how 
the government tries to avoid the issue, the fact remains that this 
scheme will kill jobs and it will provide a lower rate of investment 
return than any other scheme in the country.
<P>
	I invite the government and the finance officials to check it out 
with anybody selling RRSPs these days and they will find out the 
truth. The rule with this plan seems to be that the lowest return is 
the law.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8448"> 8448 </A></B>
<P>
	Why should Canadians trust their retirement dollars to this 
Liberal government where the lowest return is the law, and not 
even any points?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
since when does the creation of investment funds kill jobs? It is the 
contrary. Look at what the government has done. We have created 
the lowest interest rates in 35 years. Is there anything that creates 
more jobs than lowering interest rates, therefore helping 
investment, therefore creating jobs?
<P>
	For 20 years we had short term rates that were two points more 
than they were in the United States. Now they are two and a quarter 
points below the United States. That is what we have done.

Speaker, I was going to put my question to the Minister of Human

Treasury Board.
<P>
	Last March, the Department of Human Resources Development 
agreed to extend until March 31, 1997 the Program for Older 
Workers Adjustment, better known as POWA. In a letter to his 
Quebec counterpart, the current minister indicated his intent to set 
aside $16 million for this program. However, that amount is not 
enough to cover the workers who will lose their jobs up until the 
end of the program.
<P>
	Can the minister tell the House if he will approve the request 
made by his Quebec counterpart and grant the $20.7 million needed 
to maintain POWA until March 31, 1997?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, it will be a pleasure to answer 
the question put by the member opposite, since it concerns my 
department.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> Unemployment insurance does not concern 
you?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pettigrew:</B> The opposition seems surprised that the 
President of the Treasury Board and the Minister of Human 
Resources Development are working as a team, because, on this 
side, we are a team. Of course, when we see what is going on in 
their own party, we understand why they are so surprised.
<P>
	I want to point out that the Government of Canada is looking for 
other ways to help older workers affected by the changes on the 
labour market. That is why we have initiated discussions with 
several of the main people concerned. In March of 1996, the 
provinces and the territories were informed that, on March 31, 
1997, our government was putting an end to the program as we 
know it.
<P>
<B>(1140)</B>
<P>
	I must tell you that, on December 9, 1996, I decided to increase 
by $12.5 million the POWA budget up until March of 1997, which 
brings the federal budget to $40 million.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am glad to see that the minister is asserting himself and 
holding his own.
<P>
	Will the minister undertake to maintain POWA until an 
agreement is reached with the province of Quebec on the labour 
issue?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, on the issue of labour, 
everything is going well. We are working hard to address several 
issues. We have undertaken several negotiations with the 
government of Quebec, which are going very well.
<P>
	I want to say that we, as government, are very concerned about 
the situation of older workers, as we have shown in the past. We 
will continue our consultations with the provinces.

job creation. The higher the tax, the lower the employment growth 
and that is an economic fact.
<P>
	The new Liberal job killing Canada pension plan payroll tax 
increase will result in the loss of at least 160,000 jobs. If this is the 
way Liberals keep their jobs, jobs, jobs promise, why should

<P>

not know how many times I will have to repeat that the fund is now 
giving financial security to a large number of people for when they 
reach age 65.
<P>
	We have reformed the plan. We have made it sustainable. We 
have prevented it from going broke in or by the year 2015. What we 
have done is helping the government to lower interest rates because 
people now know that we can afford to support our various 
programs at rates that make sense, at rates that actuaries will agree 
with, at rates the provinces support and at rates that the Canadian 
population supports.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, a bad investment by the government on behalf of seniors 
is especially unconscionable, especially when it hits younger 
Canadians disproportionately hard. The most vulnerable 
Canadians, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8449"> 8449 </A></B>
<P>
employers and employees alike, will be badly hurt by this massive 
tax increase.
<P>
	How can the Liberal government ask Canadians to pay 10 per 
cent of their income for a pension returning less than $9,000 which 
will be taxed back at 50 per cent, when Liberal politicians pay the 
same amount for MP pensions worth at least five times more?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, how 
would the hon. member know that it is a bad investment? Is it 
because it is an investment in senior citizens who will now have 
security for their future? Is it because it guarantees to the people in 
the Canadian population who are not that rich that they will be 
taken care of when they reach the age of 65? Is it a bad investment 
because it shows that we care in terms of the Canadian population, 
that we are ready to invest in their future?
<P>
	It is a bad investment only if we are thinking of the rich people 
who can afford to pay more. It is not a bad investment if we are 
thinking in terms of common Canadians, of seniors, of those who 
want to live their old age in peace and security.

government was elected in 1993, it proceeded with a number of 
reforms.
<P>
	A special reform took place in transportation, the Canadian 
transportation reform, which transferred airport facilities to local 
organizations or municipal governments, which would then be able 
to manage them according to their local priorities.
<P>
	In fact, the program covers all airports. If I remember correctly, 
in Quebec there are four or five airports that require further 
assistance. Before the Christmas break, I had the opportunity to 
meet with all the players, particularly the mayors who told me how 
important these airports are to the local economy. For now, we are 
examining the issue very seriously. We will proceed when the 
government is ready.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, 
BQ):</B> Indeed, Mr. Speaker, the secretary of state has been repeating 
the same things for several months. I am wondering if I should not 
address my question to the President of the Treasury Board. I will 
take a chance anyway.
<P>
	Why does the government not go ahead and announce the grant? 
Is it waiting for the election, placing its election minded interests 
over the interests of the people in the Eastern Townships?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Martin Cauchon (Secretary of State (Federal Office of 
Regional Development-Quebec), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as for 
election minded interests, there is a marked difference between the 
opposition and the government.
<P>
	The opposition has acted adopted a purely doctrinaire stance, 
that is to say that opposition members regularly act according to 
their party doctrine rather than in the best interests of the people.
<P>
	As far as we are concerned, we insist on properly managing all 
the funds entrusted to us by the Canadian taxpayers. That is what 
we have been doing since 1993.
<P>
	That is what we are doing on this issue. The position we will take 
will be in the best interests of the people, as always.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of

	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, listen to 
this. Yesterday in this House the Liberal member for Oxford said: 
``I pay so much income tax on what I earn that I cannot survive 
without my teacher's pension''. The member is sitting over there, 
the Liberal member for Oxford. We do not have to go outside this 
House to find out what Canadians think, we can ask those people 
over there. They do not like high taxes. They cannot live on high 
taxes.
<P>
	My question is for the President of the Treasury Board. If high 
taxes are killing that member's quality of life, what does the 
minister say to his colleague and every other Canadian who is 
going to have a 70 per cent increase in the CPP tax? It is going to 
reduce his income and theirs even more.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, with 
the reforms we have made, in about 10 years from now there will 
be an additional $100 billion invested in the Canadian markets in 
order to produce growth and jobs.
<P>
	The Canada pension fund will be brought to stand on a firm and 
sustainable basis and will give security to people who knew that the 
pension fund was slowly going to dry up. Those among you who 
believe that this is wrong should perhaps go to see Mr. Klein during 
his present campaign and ask him what he and Albertans think 
about it. You will see that they are in favour.

President of the Treasury Board may be one of those rich people he

put money into $100 billion programs.
<P>
	We do know that high taxes kill jobs, high taxes kill businesses, 
high taxes send people to the bankruptcy court in record numbers 
and high taxes extinguish the dreams of our children. Will the

Liberal from  Oxford, to help the poor fellow pay his taxes and vote 
for a CPP tax increase at the same time?

government has now put together the tools to be able to choose.

	Four years ago we were in a fiscal hole. There was nothing we 
could do but pay the interest on an increasing debt. Now we have 
finally stopped that. Within two years our borrowing requirements 
will be zero. At that point we will have our own money to deal 
with. We will be able to make the choice of reducing the debt or 
increasing spending on whatever priorities the Canadian people

Speaker, my question is for the Solicitor General.
<P>
	On December 12, 1996, RCMP Sergeant Delisle learned that the 
Clerk of the Privy Council had invoked section 39 of the Evidence 
Act to make sure no vital information would be submitted before 
the RCMP disciplinary court, which held a hearing on January 20 
on the violation of regulation 57 concerning the holding of a public 
office by Mr. Delisle.
<P>
	How does the minister explain that section 39 was used in this 
specific case, since it had the effect of preventing Sergeant Delisle 
from submitting, for his defence, documents that had been public 
for at least two years?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
the issue is before the court. A majority decision supported the 
federal government's position. Mr. Delisle wishes to appeal to the 
higher court. We should wait for the outcome of these legal 
proceedings.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this reply does not answer the question, but the official 
opposition is getting used to that.
<P>
	In June 1996, the Employment Insurance Commission, which is 
an administrative federal tribunal, recognized that Mr. Delisle's 
suspension had more to do with his attempt to unionize than with a 
violation of regulation 57.
<P>
	Will the minister confirm that the real reason the government is 
after Mr. Delisle is because the RCMP is trying to ``break'' his 
attempts to unionize the force's members?

I believe the Quebec Court of Appeal is a higher court than the

Leadership is probably the most important factor in an efficient, 
effective, disciplined and happy military.

the minister has no hesitation in prejudging the inquiry. His 
comments last Friday are a blatant example of his jumping to the

	Clearly, the minister does not know what really happened in 
Somalia. Furthermore, he certainly does not know what really 
happened at national defence headquarters and seems determined 
not to find out.

<P>
	The budget speech delivered earlier this week could have come 
straight from George Orwell's <I>1984</I>. Small extra expenditures are 
touted as new money while massive cuts to social and cultural 
programs continue. For example, the government claims $600 
million is new money for poor families with children.
<P>
	The government knows however that the new rules for the 
taxation of child support that resulted from the Thibaudeau court 
case will give a windfall of $120 million in the third year and more 
in subsequent years.

contribution pensions for the public service, the Canadian forces

invested by a private sector manager, and to amend the Income Tax 
Act and certain other acts in consequence thereof.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, briefly the bill I have introduced will 
replace the public service, the RCMP and the Canadian forces 
pension plan by allowing it to put real money into a real pension 
account, managed by a professional manager at arm's length from 
the government.
<P>
	This would mean that rather than deductions being taken from 
your pay and put into the general revenue account matched by a 
fictitious paper transaction, there would be real money in a real 
account. The best equivalent I can think of is the Ontario teachers 
pension plan which as we know is very healthy and well managed.
<P>
	The people involved would have the choice of who manages the 
plan. They would have the option, if necessary, of contributing a 
little more, although the government is not obligated for more. I 
think this would put our pension plan on firm footing and take the 
taxpayer out of the game of supporting it.

	The House resumed consideration of Bill C-71, an act to regulate 
the manufacture, sale, labelling and promotion of tobacco 
products, to make consequential amendments to another Act and to 
repeal certain Acts, as reported (with amendments) from a 
committee.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I believe the hon. member for 
Trois-Rivières still has five minutes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will 
continue in the few minutes I have left to tell you how important 
the Grand Prix de Trois-Rivières mentioned earlier is for jobs. It 
generates 150 jobs, including 80 directly. It is an event of 
considerable economic importance for the Trois-Rivières region. It 
is an international event, because it is broadcast throughout North 
America. It is televised because it is permitted.
<P>
	Clause 31 clearly provides, and I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>31.(1) No person shall, on behalf of another person, with or without 
consideration, publish, broadcast or otherwise disseminate any promotion that is 
prohibited by this Part.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It will no longer be permitted to televise a sporting event of the 
size of the Players Trois-Rivières Grand Prix, because the law will 
prohibit it.
<P>
	Oddly enough, clause 31(2) permits the same sort of events 
when they come from outside the country, and I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>31.(2) Subsection (1) does not apply to the distribution for sale of an imported 
publication or the retransmission of radio or television broadcasts that originate 
outside Canada.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1210)</B>
<P>
	This means that, when it comes from Quebec or Trois-Rivières, 
it is serious and promotes smoking and when it originates 
elsewhere, it does not. Or does it mean that, when a European 
Grand Prix is being broadcast and the word Valvoline appears 
behind a car it is OK to televise, but if the world Marlboro appears, 
the transmission will be jammed? Where are we going with this?
<P>
	This does not make any sense. It goes to show how out of touch 
this government is, with its gurus and the kind  of ayatollahs who 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8454"> 8454 </A></B>
<P>
advise the Minister of Health of Canada, who has completely lost 
touch with common sense and growing public pressure across 
Canada for preserving cultural and sports events by maintaining 
sponsorships from the private sector.
<P>
	We must realize that this ban on television advertising would 
take effect immediately and not later, as suggested by the chair of 
the Liberal caucus in an interview to the CBC, when he said that the 
amendments will delay implementation. In fact, the amendments 
that apply concern clause 24, and are set out in clause 60, which 
states that clauses 24(2) and 24(3) will come into force on October 
1, 1998, or at an earlier date set in an order.
<P>
	This affects the 10 per cent rule, whereby cigarette advertising 
shall not take up more than 10 per cent of the billboards or ads. 
That provision will take effect on October 1, 1998. But the ban on 
the broadcasting of events, where sponsors or philanthropists are 
paid back for investing hundreds of thousands of dollars in such or 
such an event, will be effective immediately, which means the 
Grand Prix de Trois-Rivières will be affected as early as next 
summer. That is totally unacceptable, because no real consultation 
has taken place.
<P>
	It is especially annoying since it has not been demonstrated in 
any way that looking at billboard advertising or watching television 
ads is an inducement to use tobacco products. There are no studies 
showing that. The only evidence available is that a smoker, which 
means someone who already uses tobacco products, may switch 
brands after attending the Du Maurier tennis tournament, seeing 
the Bendon and Hedges Symphony of Fire or travelling to 
Trois-Rivières for the Grand Prix sponsored by Players. He may 
prefer a Players cigarette over a Du Maurier.
<P>
	But that is his own choice, it is not a matter of public policy. 
What could be interesting and fundamental to prove is that 
someone who sees these billboards could decide to start smoking. 
But that is laughable.
<P>
	I will conclude by quoting this morning's editorial in the daily <I>Le 
Nouvelliste</I>, which addresses the issue of sponsorship and 
billboards. It says: ``We have a hard time believing that a teenager 
from Trois-Rivières would take up smoking just because he was 
exposed to a Players billboard ten days a year''.
<P>
	It is that simple, there is nothing complicated about this issue, 
that is common sense. It just goes to show that the government is 
out of touch and so hypocritical that it wants it both ways. We know 
how much tax revenue smoking brings in. If the government was 
consistent, would it not completely prohibit tobacco and cigarettes 
production? If smoking is so bad for our health that no ads can be 
broadcast, should we not stand up and have a real debate on the 
issue and think about prohibiting the production and importation of 
tobacco products? Then, we would be addressing the real issues 
instead of dealing  once again with the government's hypocritical 
and stealthy behaviour.

of what I have heard about Bill C-71 in the House today.
<P>
	One of the things I have heard is that the bill goes too far. No, the 
bill contains only a partial ban on tobacco advertising even though 
total bans have been adopted by some countries including 
Australia, New Zealand, France, Portugal, Sweden, Norway, 
Finland and Italy.
<P>
	The bill does not ban tobacco sponsorships even though the 
United States has adopted a law that will ban all tobacco 
sponsorship advertising effective August 28, 1998.
<P>
	Then we hear the regulatory authority in the bill is too broad. 
The regulatory authority created by the bill is less than for products 
covered by the Hazardous Products Act, yet tobacco is much more 
dangerous. The nicotine patch is more strictly regulated under the 
Food and Drug Act than cigarettes will be under Bill C-71.
<P>
	Then we hear events now sponsored by tobacco companies will 
have to be cancelled. The bill does not ban sponsorships, it only 
regulates the use of tobacco brand elements in sponsoring 
advertising.
<P>
	Prominent former tobacco sponsorship recipients now have 
non-tobacco sponsors. In 1988, for example, the Royal Canadian 
Golf Association testified before a parliamentary committee that 
du Maurier could not be replaced as a sponsor of the men's 
Canadian open. The event is now sponsored by Bell Canada.
<P>
	It is often said the bill will cost jobs in the tobacco industry. In 
some ways Bill C-71 protects jobs in the Canadian tobacco industry 
because advertising restrictions make it difficult for foreign 
companies to penetrate the Canadian market.
<P>
	Even if there would even be some job impact, public health must 
take precedence and priority. To argue otherwise is something like 
arguing that World War II should have continued to prevent job 
losses in the munitions factory. That is the same kind of logic.
<P>
	Then we hear there will be a significant adverse impact on 
retailers. In 1987-88 the tobacco industry claimed that Bill C-51, 
the Tobacco Products Control Act, which was eventually passed by 
Parliament banning tobacco advertising, would cost thousands of 
jobs. It just did not happen.
<P>
	Then we hear the bill amounts to a de facto total ban on 
advertising. No, the bill permits tobacco advertising in publications 
read primarily by adults, in direct mail to adults and in places 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8455"> 8455 </A></B>
<P>
where minors are prohibited by law.  The scope remains ample for 
advertising, much to the chagrin of the health committee.
<P>
	It is also said that the bill infringes on provincial jurisdiction. 
Restricting tobacco marketing was strongly upheld by the Supreme 
Court of Canada in 1996 as being within the federal jurisdiction.
<P>
	Then we hear tobacco is a legal product. There are other legal 
products or activities the advertising of which is restricted. 
Prescription drugs are legal but consumer advertising of 
prescription drugs, including the nicotine patch, is illegal. There is 
no such thing as the prozac tennis championship or the valium arts 
festival. Prostitution is legal but soliciting for prostitution is 
illegal. My example is clear.
<P>
	The bill, it is said, infringes on the charter of rights and 
freedoms. The government has gone to great lengths to respond to 
the Supreme Court's majority judgment. Bill C-71 contains a 
partial ban on advertising, not a total ban. Lifestyle advertising is 
banned but product information can still be communicated to 
consumers in a manner directed primarily to adults.
<P>
	Then we hear education is the complete answer. Education alone 
is not enough to reduce smoking. We need effective education and 
money spent on it, but educational interventions cannot compete 
with the multi-million dollar advertising campaigns of the tobacco 
industry.
<P>
	Then we hear there is no evidence that advertising increases 
smoking. I would like to say that a House of Commons committee 
in the United Kingdom held hearings on tobacco advertising and 
concluded in 1992 that there was indeed a relationship between 
advertising and consumption.
<P>
	In RJR-MacDonald Inc. v. Canada, the attorney general case, all 
nine judges of the Supreme Court of Canada agreed that there was a 
rational connection between tobacco advertising and increased 
consumption.
<P>
	Recent studies have documented a high awareness of recall of 
tobacco advertising among children and adolescents with, for 
example, Joe Camel, the cartoon character which promotes Camel 
cigarettes being just as recognizable among 6-year olds as Mickey 
Mouse. Just think of it.
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	Tobacco use is the cause of 30 per cent of cancer and more than 
80 per cent of lung cancer. The overwhelming number of new 
smokers are children. To protect our children it is essential that Bill 
C-71 be passed without being weakened by the tobacco lobby.
<P>
	How can we in Canada neglect this blight on society? Canadians 
want to protect the environment in the national sense. Therefore we 
must also help the victims of tobacco to protect them from this 
form of societal pollution.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
glad you recognized me right away. I am pleased to take the floor, 
because we know that there was not very much debate at second 
reading. This bill has repercussions in many parts of Quebec, and 
also in my riding, more about which later.
<P>
	I would like to speak briefly to the first group of amendments-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> In front of all these Liberals.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Brien:</B> -being discussed, in front of all these Liberal Party 
colleagues who are listening so attentively to us. There is a series 
of technical amendments, the main purpose of which is to translate 
terms that were poorly translated the first time around. This shows 
the half baked nature of this bill, which is being rushed through, at 
the last minute, a bill they want to see passed before the election.
<P>
	A lot is at stake for the Liberal Party. This is a promise everyone 
saw their minister make on television. He said that, if the 
government did not pass the tobacco bill before the election, people 
could vote against the Liberals. They are trying to save face by 
having this bill passed. They are trying to play down the 
controversy. But some large, very contentious problems remain 
that have a lot of people upset right now, particularly in Quebec. 
More about this later, because this has a major effect on Quebec.
<P>
	What sort of problems are we talking about? First, I would like 
to open a parenthesis. Nobody is going to argue with virtue. We 
would all like to see a drop in the number of people smoking, 
particularly young people.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Volpe: </B>You are speaking up for the tobacco industry.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Brien: </B>However, the jury is still out on the best way to 
achieve this. It has been said that prevention among young people 
might be the most promising.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Volpe:</B> You are promoting tobacco, cigarettes and ill health.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Sauvageau:</B> Where are your manners? Shut up.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Volpe:</B> Go on.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Brien:</B> Mr. Speaker, I hear a fly buzzing around my head.
<P>
	My colleague might want to go for relaxation therapy, it would 
do him a world of good.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> I believe, he has been smoking, but not 
tobacco.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Brien:</B> I would even say that tobacco is not the only thing 
some of them abuse.
<P>
	Getting back to the areas affected, I will start with the cultural 
sector.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8456"> 8456 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Volpe:</B> Your position is shameful.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Brien:</B> In Montreal, we have the jazz festival, the World 
Film Festival, in Quebec City, the summer festival; the operating 
budget of many cultural events-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Mr. Speaker, give him a Valium.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Brien:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would ask you to call to order one of 
our colleagues who is getting overly excited.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister 
of Health has no manners.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ménard:</B> Calm down. Take a Valium.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Brien:</B> Getting back to cultural events, a few years ago we 
had asked them-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Volpe:</B> We are not talking about culture, we are talking 
about health.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Give him his tranquillizers.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ménard:</B> Kick him out. Send him a glass of water.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Volpe:</B> Say something that makes sense.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Brien:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would ask you to ask the 
parliamentary secretary to please-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order. Could you ask 
the parliamentary secretary to the health minister to contain 
himself. We are talking about tobacco and judging by his behaviour 
you would think he has been smoking something else.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Volpe:</B> Mr. Speaker, if the member opposite wants to play 
games with language about who is smoking what, making an 
allegation and a serious one that members on this side of the House 
are under the influence of some substance abuse, then I think what 
he should take a look at is recognizing that what they are doing is 
promoting-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> This is a subject on which there are very 
strong opinions held by all of us. I would ask, since the member has 
six minutes left, that all members please give him their attention.
<P>
	On a point of order again, the hon. parliamentary secretary.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Volpe:</B> Mr. Speaker, I guess it is because I am paying 
attention and I am looking for some validity to argument that I am 
expressing myself. If that is a little too much for the Bloc to take, 
too bad.
<P>
<B>(1225)</B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I would remind the hon. parliamentary 
secretary that I believe he was the first speaker in the debate. I 
think especially the people in the gallery and the Canadian public 
want us to listen to each other. I do not think they want us to shout 
at each other in here.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Brien:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would remind my colleague, the hon. 
parliamentary secretary, that in order to appreciate the validity of 
arguments and understand them, one must show a minimum of 
respect and listen to people when they talk.
<P>
	Getting back to the cultural sector, the hon. member is probably 
upset by my statement that the cultural sector in Quebec will be 
greatly affected. I was referring to events such as the World Film 
Festival, the Jazz Festival, the Quebec City Summer Festival and 
many other events which succeeded, through the years, in securing 
more private than public financial support.
<P>
	The organizers managed, on their own initiative, to find sources 
of funding. They were told: ``Be more autonomous''. With time 
they managed to find sources of funding for their events, which 
have become great successes. These events have become profitable 
and have helped enhance the city of Montreal and Quebec as a 
whole. Other events elsewhere in Canada do the same.
<P>
	Today, they plan to deprive them of their sources of funding by 
going after the sponsors. Naturally, the ban is not total but the 
consequences will be the same. We know very well what the 
consequences of overregulation will be. Such events will become 
much less attractive, hence the strong reaction of the people 
concerned.
<P>
	The same can be said about sporting events. Take for instance the 
Montreal Grand Prix and the Trois-Rivières Grand Prix. Vancouver 
and Toronto also have car races. Prohibiting sponsorship will have 
a major impact.
<P>
	At home, we have international regattas, which follow a circuit 
in Quebec and the United States and which will be seriously 
affected, because a major sponsor is Export ``A''. Anticipating 
events, the company chose to not necessarily renew their financial 
commitments, in case sponsorship is banned.
<P>
	Think about it. I remember a sign in the middle of a lake at 
home. If only 10 per cent of the sign may be used to display the 
company name, you would need binoculars to see the print at the 
bottom. This is crazy. It would take signs of 1,000 feet by 1,000 
feet, an incredible size, for any kind of visibility, if only tiny 
lettering is permitted on these signs.
<P>
	I have some questions in this regard. What is the real purpose? 
We all know this will have an effect, particularly on Montreal. The 
Liberals take great pleasure in saying they want to help get 
Montreal and Quebec's economy rolling again.
<P>
	The events being targeted work well. There are so many things 
that do not work well here that we should spend our time trying to 
fix them rather than going after the things that do work. This is 
what makes people sick.
<P>
	It colours the credibility of all members of this House. I was 
listening to an open line radio show on my way  home. People were 
calling to express their mistrust of politicians and saying: ``Look at 
all the time they waste making stupid laws''. This is what we are 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8457"> 8457 </A></B>
<P>
talking about today. These people have a very hard time believing 
politicians after that.
<P>
	The hon. parliamentary secretary, who travels extensively, 
reminds me of a chihuahua, a breed of dog that barks all the time. 
Where was he when cabinet made the decision to go ahead with 
this? In Quebec, he goes around passing himself off as a great 
champion of that province. He is also the member representing 
Outremont in this House, and the Montreal area as well. Where was 
he? Who exactly did he protect in this matter? He makes public 
appearances now and then to say he will stand up for cultural and 
sports events. He then disappears for a few days. He was nowhere 
to be found. One wonders what has happened to him, why he is so 
silent.
<P>
	The day of reckoning is coming. I hope his voters will send him a 
very clear message in the next federal election, one he will not soon 
forget.
<P>
	There are other aspects to this bill. Take the regulations they 
want to impose on convenience stores. Amendments have been 
made; still, there is a desire to regulate convenience stores left, 
right and center. Imagine this, they even want to ensure that 
cigarettes are paid for before they are handed over to the client. 
Will the exchange have to take place within a specified time, just in 
case the client changed his mind between the time he asked for the 
cigarettes and the time he received them? Why not? That may be 
the next step. It makes no sense.
<P>
<B>(1230)</B>
<P>
	Convenience stores will also have to make physical changes to 
the premises to comply with a number of provisions. They will not 
be allowed to display tobacco products on counters.
<P>
	Look, when people go to a store to buy a product, the fact that it 
is displayed on a shelf, whether it is on the left, the right or the 
middle, will not make them change their minds. Location will not 
make any difference. We have to strike at the root of the problem: 
the reasons why people, and young people in particular, start 
smoking. Those are the people who need to be educated about the 
dangers of tobacco use.
<P>
	I am not a smoker. I am not defending my own interests here; 
quite the contrary, I am allergic to tobacco smoke. There is no 
smoking in my house. There is no smoking around my house and 
people I see on a regular basis do not smoke. But there is a limit to 
going after people who made a choice at some point. They must 
comply with regulations in the workplace and elsewhere, but this is 
going very far.
<P>
	In the minute I have left, I want to discuss another aspect of the 
bill. The government says: ``Trust us regarding the regulations that 
have yet to be drafted.  Take our word. Give us a blank cheque''. 
But we sure know what it does with its promises and its 
commitments. We all know what this government does with its 
promises, starting with the Prime Minister. When the example 
comes from above, it makes people suspicious. I am convinced the 
public would not forgive us if we gave a blank cheque to this 
government regarding regulations.
<P>
	We will do all we can to keep the government from passing a bill 
that would have devastating effects.
<P>
	The minister said: If we do not pass a bill on tobacco, you will 
vote against us. I say to the minister: Go ahead with this bill. There 
are already a lot of people in Quebec who will vote against you; 
there will simply be more. You will pay the political price at the 
next election. Withdraw this legislation. Raise the issue during the 
election campaign. Let us have a public debate and give people an 
opportunity to be heard. You will see what they think. You will see 
how Quebecers feel about this issue.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to take part in this debate on 
Bill C-71, a debate which demonstrates this government's 
arrogance and lack of cohesion. The behaviour of the parliamentary 
secretary to the health minister is exactly like the behaviour of his 
government in general, with its pompous arrogance, trying to prove 
that they are always right.
<P>
	They are wrong this time, and we will explain why. In this 
matter, the Liberals remind me of what a group of Quebec 
comedians in the 1970s, les Cyniques, used to say: ``We want 
nothing but your good-and your goods''. So that is the Liberals' 
attitude: it wants to preserve the health of Quebecers and 
Canadians in general, to protect them against everything possible. 
Now, I am an ex-smoker, and I respect those who want to smoke. I 
denounce the Tobacco Police, the likes of the parliamentary 
secretary to the health minister, who are trying to convince our 
fellow citizens that they are concerned about their health.
<P>
	I will say this to the government: the major danger to the overall 
health of Canadians, especially their economic health, is the 
presence of this Liberal government. I would tell the parliamentary 
secretary to make sure not to inhale, or he will have to face the 
consequences. The quicker we can get rid of this government, the 
better off Canadians and Quebecers will be.
<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
	Although the Minister of Health and the government 
spokespersons suggest that this is not a bill on culture, that it is not 
a bill on sports, but that it is a bill on health, this is not true. We say 
to them ``Take care of your own health. Health comes under 
provincial jurisdiction. Mind your own business, we will take care 
of our health, we will take care of our economic development''. 
That is what we want to do.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8458"> 8458 </A></B>
<P>
	The actual impact of this bill must be considered. Again, it will 
have no impact on Canadians' health. All they we want is for the 
government not to meddle in something that does not concern it. 
The government wants to ruin something that is working well, that 
is the impact of tobacco advertising on cultural and sports events.
<P>
	I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health to 
tell us which youngster of his acquaintance started smoking after 
having seen Villeneuve drive by at 200 kilometres an hour on 
television with a Marlborough sticker on his helmet? It is totally 
ridiculous. I invite the parliamentary secretary to appear on stage 
during the Just for Laughs festival. He could make us laugh for 
weeks.
<P>
	During next election campaign, when the Parliamentary 
Secretary to Minister of Health comes to Quebec, I am sure he will 
bring Quebecers to stop smoking just because they know that what 
he is saying is a smoke screen because, generally speaking, it is all 
smoke and mirrors. Such is the Liberal Party.
<P>
	I am proud to be part of a group of parliamentarians that stand 
tall. Yes we would like people to stop smoking; everybody, all 
smokers would like to quit. We all recognize that tobacco is 
harmful for our health. Everybody admits that. But it is a personal 
choice. Each individual must decide for himself. When I stopped 
smoking, it was not because I had seen the parliamentary secretary. 
On the contrary, seeing him would drive me to start smoking again. 
I stopped because I had decided it was bad for my health. That was 
the basis for my decision.
<P>
	However, we must respect fundamental freedoms. How can the 
government interfere to the point where it can tell merchants how 
to organize the sale of their products? How can it tell promoters of 
cultural and sports events who will be allowed to sponsor their 
events? Even in Russia they would never have gone that far. That is 
the Liberal government we have in front of us today. ``Mind your 
own business''. That is the message that the whole population of 
Canada, and Quebec in particular, is sending you repeatedly. ``You 
have no business in the health sector. Let the provincial 
governments do their job''. In Quebec, we will have that debate on 
the impact of tobacco and we will decide whether or not we want to 
restrain, to keep people from smoking.
<P>
	Furthermore, once again, as we see in all the government's bills 
and in the budget tabled this week, not only are the things we find 
in the bill appalling, but worse than that, there are the things in the 
bill we know nothing about, specifically, the regulations. We do not 
know what kind of regulations will come after this bill is passed. 
We are kept totally in the dark. We are in a thick cloud of smoke, as 
far as the regulations are concerned.
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
	Small merchants have every reason to fear the implications of 
the decisions that the government will make. As we have seen on 
many issues, this would not be the first time it changed its mind. If 
we take the example of the GST, the government got elected the 
last time by saying it would scrap the GST and would create 
thousands of jobs. Yet what do we see today? The GST is still here 
and Canadians are anxious to be able the scrap the government.
<P>
	In 1993, there were 1 million children living in poverty; there are 
now 1.5 million. I would say to the parliamentary secretary that 
poverty has much more impact on our children's health than an ad 
during the regattas on Lake Témiscamingue. Let them make the 
real decisions and stop cutting into unemployment insurance to get 
rid of the deficit. This government is letting billions of dollars get 
out of Quebec with family trusts; that is the action that the 
government is taking. We are having a fake debate with a 
government that is a fake. However, we, in the Bloc Quebecois, 
will make a real decision: we will stand up and vote against this 
government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak to the amendments to Bill C-71. 
I would like to thank the hon. member for his passionate speech; it 
was probably because of the subject: tobacco.
<P>
	The core of the problem with this bill is indeed sponsorship. The 
measures included in the bill could eliminate a number of cultural, 
sporting, and social events. Most Bloc members decided today, a 
Friday, to come back from Montreal to oppose this crazy bill, as 
Quebecers have asked us to.
<P>
	On this entire issue, things are far from clear. Members opposite 
are telling us that it is clearly a health issue, and that we must 
legislate. Everybody recognizes that smoking is not healthy, and 
that we must do all we can to prevent our young people from 
starting to smoke. Unlike the two previous speakers, I am a long 
time smoker and, despite several tries, I have not been able to quit. 
I think it is important to tell our young people not to start smoking, 
so they will avoid the problem of trying to quit later.
<P>
	Since we agreed on this in principle, we voted for the bill at 
second reading. However, we must admit that sponsored cultural 
and sporting events are basically healthy and may even encourage 
potential smokers to be more active. We know that, generally 
speaking, athletes are not heavy smokers.
<P>
	We are here today to speak to this bill. I would like to point out 
that not too many members across the way stood up for Quebec's 
interests in this matter. If I may, I would like to quote from an 
article published in <I>La Presse</I> on February 16, in which the Liberal 
member for  Outremont, who was just mentioned as the exception 
in that he stood up for Quebec, is quoted by Réjean Tremblay as 
saying something like the following: ``Everyone agrees with the 
intent of the legislation put forward by the Minister of Health of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8459"> 8459 </A></B>
<P>
Canada.'' So do we. ``Trade in tobacco should be regulated, not 
with a view to ban its sale but rather to control it. We must look at 
the 10 per cent rule for advertising, the notion of site for events, 
merchandise and the possible extension of the transition period''.
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
	Note that, after this was written, we have never seen the hon. 
member for Outremont again, and there is a fundamental reason for 
this: he is a Quebecer, a Liberal member from Quebec who, even if 
he wanted to defend Quebec or positions taken in Quebec, could 
not do so because his caucus, which is of another mind, would not 
let him. That is a fact, and that is why we will not see the hon. 
member for Outremont stand up and speak on this issue.
<P>
	We must recognize also that the spinoffs generated by 
sponsorships are very important to Canadians and Quebecers. I 
would like to mention some of the major events that will be 
affected, some of which have already been mentioned: the Just for 
Laughs Festival, the Montreal Grand Prix, the Trois-Rivières 
Grand Prix, the Montreal film festival, the Toronto film festival, 
the Montreal jazz festival, the Vancouver jazz festival, the Benson 
and Hedges international championships, the Player's international 
tennis championships and many other sports and cultural events.
<P>
	As we know, the cultural community too is not at all happy with 
the proposed limitation of sponsorships because it will lose a major 
source of revenues at a time of government budget cuts. We know 
how much culture has always suffered from lack of funding. The 
cultural sector had finally managed to find patrons, but we are now 
taking them away. As my colleague was saying, we are stopping 
something that is working when we should be going after lots of 
other things.
<P>
	As for revenues, here are some data about it. According to the 
Canadian Tobacco Manufacturers Council, sponsorship of arts 
amounts to about $25 million whereas that of sports organizations 
amounts to about $35 million, totalling $60 million in Canada, 
including close to $30 million in Quebec. That is why we are in the 
House today, to defend this position that should be considered.
<P>
	The health minister questions these figures, saying that, for 
several events, only a small proportion of the funding is coming 
from tobacco companies. However, he cannot say what the 
sponsorships amount to and, moreover, he fails to mention that for 
some events the proportion is much higher than what he is says.
<P>
	For example, here are the figures reported in <I>The Gazette</I> on 
December 5 of last year. The Montreal Jazz Festival costs $9.5 
million, and tobacco company sponsorships bring in $1.5 million, 
or about 16 per cent of all sponsorship revenues.
<P>
	We all know how much the jazz festival is an integral part of 
Montreal's image, and we know also that fireworks attract visitors 
in droves. Well, fireworks cost $1.4 million, of which $1 million 
comes from tobacco companies. Tobacco sponsorship represents 
72 per cent of costs.
<P>
	The Festival Juste pour rire, and that probably includes Just for 
Laughs too, costs $10 million, and tobacco sponsors fork out $1 
million, or 10 per cent.
<P>
	The Festival d'été de Québec costs $4.5 million, and tobacco 
companies pour in $500,000, or 11 per cent.
<P>
	Some 16 comparable analyses of 88 cultural and sport events 
throughout Canada estimate that economic benefits stand at $133 
million and that 2,179 jobs depend on these investments. The 
member who spoke before me made the point, which is 
fundamental here, that there is no consensus on the real impact on 
tobacco use of the visibility of sponsors' trademarks in cultural and 
sport events.
<P>
	In that same vein, we should keep in mind the remarks of the 
minister on December 6. He stated that, within three years, the 
number of smokers would drop 1.5 million because of this 
legislation, some 15 to 22 per cent. But he has been unable to 
explain how these estimates have been figured out. They have no 
basis whatsoever.
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	Moreover, I remember two surveys, and this is important, 
because the essence of democracy, as my colleagues have pointed 
out, is that it is the people who decide. We will therefore talk about 
the people.
<P>
	Two surveys confirm that the majority of people do not want the 
proposed legislation to apply to cultural and sports events. In 
particular, the survey that appeared in <I>La Presse</I> on December 6 
showed that 81 per cent of respondents felt that the measures 
contained in the proposed legislation would not stop young people 
from smoking, and 68 per cent were against the ban on 
sponsorship. And we have a government determined to make laws 
that people want nothing to do with.
<P>
	Even if it does not ban sponsors, as the health minister keeps 
saying, there is a strong danger that the bill, through its restrictions, 
will effectively eliminate sponsorship by tobacco companies.
<P>
	Another survey, and I will close with this, was carried out by 
Insight Research Canada in September 1996. It found that 66 per 
cent of Canadians agreed that tobacco companies should be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8460"> 8460 </A></B>
<P>
allowed to sponsor events and organizations in the fields of arts, 
sports, entertainment  and fashion. Furthermore, 84 per cent of 
respondents felt that a company legally doing business in Canada 
should have the right to sponsor these events.
<P>
	In addition, 83 per cent thought that the decision of whether or 
not to allow sponsorship should rest with the organizations 
sponsored and those doing the sponsoring, rather than with the 
government.
<P>
	Clearly, people are not in favour of this bill. That is why the 
members of the Bloc Quebecois have returned in large numbers 
today to defend this position. If there is no change regarding 
sponsorship, we will be voting against this bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I think this is a wonderful example of the Liberal way of 
doing things.
<P>
	In December 1996, the government tabled a bill on tobacco 
products. It managed to keep speakers for the Bloc Quebecois to a 
minimum. The bill was passed on the quiet and quickly referred to 
committee. And now, on a Friday, in the very week the Minister of 
Finance tabled his budget, just before the House adjourns for a 
week, it quietly brings it before the House. They want to pass it 
without making waves. This is a controversial bill and no one in 
Quebec wants this bill. The minister knows that, that is why he 
wants to neak it by us. ``Maybe the Bloc will not be there, so we 
can pass it quickly''. Well they are wrong, once again: the Bloc is 
here, as we always are when it is time to defend the interests of 
Quebec.
<P>
	Once again, the Bloc will show that if it were left to the Liberals 
and federalists in this House, one more bill would be passed at the 
expense of Quebec, because that is what Bill C-71 is about. Who is 
going to suffer most? Quebecers. Amazing.
<P>
	I was listening earlier to the parliamentary secretary talking 
about the health of Canadians and Quebecers and telling us how 
much the use of tobacco products costs us in the way of health care. 
Amazingly the parliamentary secretary forgot to say how much 
revenue tobacco products pour into the Treasury every year. 
Cigarettes put $3.5 billion into the government's treasury. He did 
not mention that. Of course not.
<P>
	What would the Minister of Finance have done this week if $3.5 
billion had been cut from his budget? I know the answer: he would 
probably have offloaded the additional deficit to the provinces, as 
he has always done with transfer payments. For the time being, 
they are being holier than thou. The health of Canadians is terribly 
important, but meanwhile, they collect the cash, and that is 
something they do not talk about. Cigarettes and tobacco products 
represent $3.5 billion in revenue annually. They do not mention 
that.
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
	Another thing the parliamentary secretary and the Minister of 
Health failed to say was that this bill directly  affects sports and 
cultural events in Quebec. Sponsors annually invest between $30 
million and $35 million in these activities, in Quebec alone. It is 
odd that the minister and the parliamentary secretary did not 
mention that. I would like to have heard them say what they would 
do.
<P>
	As we saw in the budget, this week the government is dropping 
just about everyone. In the same week, it tables Bill C-71, which 
will cut funding directly and threaten the very survival of cultural 
and sporting events in Quebec. Between $30 million and $35 
million will thus be affected.
<P>
	This is money invested directly by sponsors. Do you know how 
much money is reinvested by the people who attend these festivals 
in Quebec, people from elsewhere, tourists? Do you know how 
much money they leave in Quebec? They bring in $133 million. Do 
you know how many direct jobs are created? Two thousand jobs are 
directly linked to cultural and sporting events.
<P>
	The government has been saying ``jobs, jobs, jobs'' since 1993. 
All it has done this week is invest a mere $25 million in the budget 
and cut 2,000 jobs in Quebec. These are jobs directly related to 
sports and cultural activities.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Volpe:</B> You are red as a beet. Better watch your pressure.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> What hurts me most in this bill is-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Volpe:</B> That will certainly hurt you too.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> -that in my own riding of 
Berthier-Montcalm Bill C-71 directly affects certain events. I did 
not hear the minister or the parliamentary secretary mention that 
either. The people of Berthierville are very proud of the Gilles 
Villeneuve museum. Why is there a museum? There was a racing 
driver named Gilles Villeneuve who put Berthierville on the world 
map. Today there is a museum in Berthierville in his honour.
<P>
	While the Grand Prix are going on in Montreal and 
Trois-Rivières, people from Switzerland, Italy and Monaco come 
to visit the Gilles Villeneuve museum. These people spend money 
at the corner store, hotels and restaurants. That means millions for 
Quebec, not just for the Montreal area. I did not hear the minister or 
the parliamentary secretary mention that.
<P>
	There is something else in this bill which I find unacceptable. 
This measure has a direct impact on tobacco production; it so 
happens that 80 per cent of that production comes from the 
Lanaudière region, which is in my riding and in the riding of 
Joliette.
<P>
	The bill has an impact on that industry, but the government does 
not talk about it. How many jobs are involved? The hon. member 
for Joliette can confirm that 1,500 jobs are directly related to 
tobacco production. Annual profits from that industry total about 
$20 million, for the ridings of Berthier-Montcalm and  Joliette. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8461"> 8461 </A></B>
<P>
But the parliamentary secretary and the Liberals are silent on that 
issue.
<P>
	Fortunately, there are Bloc members here to set the record 
straight. We work at protecting Quebec's interests, because the 
members opposite do not. Since we started debating the bill this 
morning, I have yet to see Liberal members from Quebec speak for 
our province's interests. Where are they? Since December, they 
have been telling the media and sports organizations: ``We will 
defend Bill C-71 and we will defend tobacco sponsorship''.
<P>
	Where are these members from Quebec who are supposed to 
look after the interests of their province? Where are these Liberal 
members? They are not here. They are hiding. They are ashamed of 
this bill. They are not here because they did not fulfil their duty as 
members of Parliament, which is to effectively represent their 
constituents before cabinet, before their party. That is why they are 
not here. They have failed. They tried to calm people down. They 
engaged in disinformation, as the parliamentary secretary is doing 
now. Perhaps he should listen.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Volpe:</B> Do not do that, your mother is watching you and she 
is embarrassed.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> Perhaps you should listen and tell your 
minister to withdraw his Bill C-71, which goes against Quebec's 
interests and hurts its economy. Such is the reality.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kilger:</B> Mr. Speaker, like the other hon. members in this 
House, I note the great passion in the speeches on this bill, a great 
interest in it. I would simply like to remind the hon. members, in 
order to make this a traditional debate, that we must continue to 
address the Speaker, so that this will be more parliamentary.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Brien:</B> You are doing the Speaker's job.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kilger: </B>I must support the Speaker in his duties. I believe it 
is perfectly normal for there to be a call to order from time to time.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Absolutely.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I would make the same request of 
everyone in the House. I would like a little more calm to prevail, 
for the sake of those in the galleries.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> Indeed, Mr. Speaker, you are right. The hon. 
member across the way is right.
<P>
	I think this is a bill that hits close to home with the Bloc 
Quebecois members. I would, however, also like to ask you to keep 
the parliamentary secretary quiet when members are defending 
Quebec in connection with this bill. He is the one who is stirring 
things up constantly with his inappropriate comments, when this 
matter is being discussed.
<P>
	In closing, I wish to state, so that the people of 
Berthier-Montcalm may be perfectly clear on my position-that I 
will be sending a letter out to all of the convenience stores. I have 
not had an opportunity to talk about convenience stores. We could 
find a lot to say about convenience stores, about the regulatory 
power the minister has reserved for himself to tell them how to run 
their business, where to put their cigarettes. They will now have to 
tell their customers: ``Pay for your cigarettes before you get them, 
and tough luck for you if you change your mind, because you will 
be stuck with them''.
<P>
	Did he also announce that he will compensate convenience 
stores for the fact that they will no longer be allowed to use tobacco 
company stands to display the packages of cigarettes? No. There 
are a lot of things relating to the bill which are not stated clearly.
<P>
	I will see that a letter goes out to all of the convenience stores, all 
of the supermarkets, all of the pharmacies, a very clear letter 
inviting people to reason with this government, to intervene, to 
realize that this government and the Liberal members from Quebec 
are not working on behalf of their fellow citizens.
<P>
	I am also inviting all of the hon. members on the government 
side to make this bill an election issue. Defer it, and we in the Bloc 
Quebecois will debate it in all of the municipalities of Quebec, in 
every corner of Quebec, and we will see whose side the public is 
on. Will it side with the Liberal government, which is passing 
irresponsible legislation, or with the people of Quebec, who do not 
want this bill?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is my duty to speak at the report stage of Bill C-71, the 
bill on tobacco.
<P>
	The committee of the House of Commons heard a total of 23 
groups that are affected by this bill. In fact, several bills on tobacco 
products have come before the House in the past but none were 
adopted. The control and marketing of tobacco products has been 
talked about in the House of Commons for nearly 34 years. The 
first bill on the subject was tabled in 1963.
<P>
	The government is now trying to rush this particular bill through 
the House by proposing only one amendment that deals with 
corporate sponsorships. It has given tobacco companies a grace 
period of 12 months after royal assent to give them time to find 
alternatives for their sponsorships. Even the Conservative leader in 
the Senate believes that a transition period of one year is not 
enough.
<P>
	On second reading the Bloc Quebecois voted in favour of the 
principle of the bill to protect the health of the public, but at the 
report stage, the Bloc Quebecois cannot vote in favour of this bill, 
for the following reasons: the government and the Minister of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8462"> 8462 </A></B>
<P>
Health have given  themselves undue discretionary powers with 
respect to regulations.
<P>
	Bill C-71 is another excuse for the government to invade a 
provincial jurisdiction. In fact, the Constitution Act, 1867, 
subsection 92(7), provides exclusive jurisdiction over the operation 
of hospitals, asylums and other institutions, while subsection (16) 
gives the provinces exclusive power over all local and private 
matters.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	The federal government has jurisdiction over navy and 
quarantine hospitals. Since the provincial government intends to 
pass legislation on tobacco products, we are stuck with the 
perpetual duplication and overlap that makes things very confusing 
for all concerned.
<P>
	The government has tried to expedite this bill by refusing to 
allow the opposition to schedule speakers at second reading, except 
for my colleague from Lévis who spoke on December 5. The latter 
informed this House of his concern about the minister's timing in 
tabling his bill.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois urged the health minister and the minister of 
propaganda-pardon me, Mr. Speaker, I meant to say the Minister 
of Canadian Heritage-to find a solution in order to offset the 
financial losses to sports and arts events. The Minister of Health 
categorically rejected the Bloc Quebecois' proposals and did not 
take into account the testimony heard before the health committee.
<P>
	The events affected include the Just for Laughs festival, the 
Montreal and Trois-Rivières Grand Prix, the Montreal and Toronto 
film festivals, the Montreal and Vancouver jazz festivals, the 
Benson and Hedges Symphony of Fire, and the Players Tennis 
Internationals, to name just a few.
<P>
	I would also like to mention the wonderful work done by Gilbert 
Rozon, formerly of Saint-André-d'Argenteuil who, although born 
in Montreal, spent many years in the riding of Argenteuil, where 
some of his family still live. Mr. Rozon has repeatedly expressed 
his dismay at the government's position, which does not take into 
account the disastrous economic repercussions of this bill on these 
events.
<P>
	Mr. Rozon has been involved in numerous cultural and arts 
events. In 1980, he founded a dance and theatre festival, the Grande 
Virée, in Lachute in my riding, which will feature the top 
entertainers from Quebec and from France.
<P>
	In 1983, he founded the Just for Laughs festival, a one of a kind 
international event. He put Montreal on the map by founding an 
international festival, a school and a museum. Last December 10, 
Mr. Rozon told the health committee that, of the Just for Laughs 
festival's $15 million budget, $450,000 came from the government 
and just over $1 million from tobacco manufacturers.  Francis Fox, 
a former Liberal minister, told this same committee that, in the 
past, people like Mr. Rozon had moved heaven and earth to find 
sponsors.
<P>
	It is very important to mention his testimony before the health 
committee, because it reflects the government's refusal to take into 
consideration the importance of obtaining funding in order to 
continue to promote the culture of Quebec and of Canada.
<P>
	The minister of propaganda-excuse me, of Canadian 
Heritage-has no problem finding funds for propaganda, with her 
flags and her advertising, but she will not subsidize such 
remarkable events as the ones we just mentioned.
<P>
	I want to share with you another excerpt from the comments 
made by Mr. Rozon, who said, in essence: ``We have been under 
unbearable financial stress these past four years. We were asked to 
turn to the private sector for funding and we did. But should this 
bill pass, I cannot help but wonder what it will do to culture 
exactly. Generally, we are put on this Earth with the hope that we 
will have learned something by the time we leave it, and culture is a 
key element in the development of human beings, their souls and 
their identities.
<P>
	``The major events taking place in Montreal and across Canada 
are essential to the development of the Canadian identity. Funding 
is being cut six months before an event. To respond specifically to 
your question, I can assure you that, six months from now, every 
one of the events affected will be between $1.5 million and $2 
million in the red because alternative sources of financing will not 
have been found. We would not be here this morning if we had 
found a way around the problem''.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	What solutions has this government brought in to deal with this 
problem? The government has not found a solution, and it will not 
rectify the situation simply by delaying implementation of this 
measure. Those who promote Quebec and Canadian culture must 
go on with their work; they have the support of the people.
<P>
	The health minister maintains, without providing any exact 
figures, that several events have only a fraction of their funding 
coming from tobacco companies. It is important to note that, 
according to 16 compatible studies on 88 cultural and sporting 
events across Canada, it is estimated that these events generate 
$133 million in economic benefits as well as 2,179 jobs.
<P>
	In fact, the public is clear on the subject: cultural and sporting 
events are greatly appreciated by Canadians. Several of these 
events provide fun and relaxation to some people and jobs to other 
people.
<P>
	Bill C-71 is threatening these events and that is why the Bloc 
Quebecois cannot vote in favour of this bill at third reading. In 
Canada, tobacco companies sponsor cultural, sporting and other 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8463"> 8463 </A></B>
<P>
events to the tune of $60  million. In Quebec alone, sponsorship by 
tobacco companies totals nearly $30 million.
<P>
	One must not think that the Bloc Quebecois' voting against this 
bill at third reading means it does not care about the health of 
Canadians. On the contrary, by voting in favour of this bill at 
second reading, the official opposition recognized the validity of 
the government's objectives, particularly the importance of the 
health of our young people under 18. We disagree with the steps 
taken by the government to meet its goals.
<P>
	We agree with what was said by the representatives of the 
Quebec medical community who have formed a common front 
reminding federal and provincial governments that they 
unconditionally support any initiative to put an end to smoking. 
Unfortunately, Quebec is the province with the highest rate of 
smokers in the 15 to 19 age group, a third of whom start smoking 
before 13.
<P>
	Since my time is coming to an end, I will conclude by quoting 
the journalist Jean-Jacques Samson, who said in today's edition of 
<I>Le Soleil:</I> ``When governments try to sabotage a good thing, they 
have no equal''. He concludes by saying that the government is 
about to pass another piece of legislation that will make lawyers 
very happy.
<P>
	For all these reasons the Bloc Quebecois will vote against Bill 
C-71 at third reading.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am happy 
to rise today to speak to this bill. It is the first opportunity I have 
because, at the second reading stage, we were precluded from 
doing so because of the squabbling between the Reform Party and 
the Liberal Party which was meant to keep the parliamentarians 
from debating democratically. It is unfortunate, in a Parliament 
which should be a forum for discussion and where truth should be 
sought as much as possible. So there is nothing to be happy about.
<P>
	As far as Bill C-71 is concerned, I wonder if the Minister of 
Health was in good health when he introduced this bill. I doubt it, 
for various reasons. This is the same minister who, from one day to 
the next, had decided that raw milk represented a danger to human 
health and had drafted some kind of weird regulations which would 
have restricted our cheese consumption to Cheez Whiz and other 
products like it.
<P>
	This to say that I am not impressed by the minister. The Liberals 
are arguing that their only motivation is the health and best 
interests of Canadians and Quebecers, but I, for one, do not buy it. 
You just cut $4.5 billion out of health expenditures, including $1.3 
billion in Quebec. You did not even realize at that time how 
detrimental this could be to the health of Canadians. Strange that 
you should not have cared a bit about that.
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	Out of nowhere, the government introduced with a bill; health 
had become important overnight. If the impact had been the same 
in Toronto as it is in Montreal, I doubt that this bill would have 
been introduced by the minister. I think that members from the 
Toronto area would now be on the benches defending the bill, 
which is not what members of the government party coming from 
Quebec are doing.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, I feel that you will agree with me.
<P>
	There is more to it, there is something worse than the bill. I agree 
with everything my friends have said. Of course tobacco is 
harmful. I look at my package of cigarettes: 16 per cent tar-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> You are not allowed to show it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lebel: </B>-13 per cent nicotine. There is not even a cigarette 
in there. All there is is nicotine and tar.
<P>
	However, the government must still be honest. It has taken $3.5 
billion in taxes out of the smokers' pockets, over the past 35 years; 
in a way, the government has been acting as a go-between. It is no 
nobler than pimps when it taxes profits from prostitution, for 
instance. The same principle is involved here.
<P>
	The government gets $3.5 billion. The olympic stadium tax in 
Montreal, I have almost paid for it by myself with the taxes you 
have been taking on every cigarette I have been smoking since.
<P>
	All this to tell you that you are not honest. You are dishonest. 
Have the courage of your convictions. Simply ban tobacco in this 
country. Then I might be more inclined to listen to you. I do not 
think I would vote for the bill, for personal reasons, but at least I 
would say: ``This decision is based on logic, on a deep sense of 
justice and fairness, on the public's interests'', and that would not 
be so bad.
<P>
	But here, you take the profits in a roundabout way, you pocket 
every possible economic benefit, to the tune of $3.5 billion, and 
then you say no to the public. Your approach is illogical and 
dishonest, fundamentally dishonest, and this is why we are blaming 
you, the government members proposing this bill.
<P>
	But there is worse still. Government members have now teamed 
up with the fundamentalists who are opposed to tobacco. These are 
professional whiners, like the hired mourners in ancient Greece, 
who resurface whenever an issue might be a little touchy with the 
public. These are people who used the École Polytechnique tragedy 
to promote their own ideology; they showed no respect in that case 
as well. We are confronted with the same people regarding this bill. 
They say: ``Stop this; think about our health''. It is true that 
smoking is harmful. I believe a member here once said: ``Let us 
begin by putting money in this''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8464"> 8464 </A></B>
<P>
	Some day, we may discover that smokers like me, who are 
unable to stop-I must have tried 15 times and never 
succeeded-have a disease. If alcoholism is a disease, it may be 
that smoking is also a disease. It is not by clobbering anyone 
stuggling with this problem, by literally robbing that person every 
time you table a budget, as you have been doing for nearly 35 
years, that you will help that person get rid of the problem.
<P>
	Try to enhance public awareness, try to put some money into 
detoxification, into information, and do as they do with children in 
elementary schools. I am pretty sure that my grand-daughters will 
never smoke, because it is always a big fuss every time I light up.
<P>
	From an early age children are motivated against smoking, and I 
say it is good. But at least have the courage of your convictions. Do 
not try to collect $3.5 billion on the one hand, and then try to make 
us believe that you want to pass such a bill out of concern for public 
health on the other. You are much more concerned about your $3.5 
billion that about public health.
<P>
	This is another example of the neoliberal philosophy that 
prevails today. This is an ill-inspired bill that will give the Minister 
of Health poorly defined powers allowing him to implement 
regulations on a piecemeal basis depending on which way the wind 
is blowing.
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	Incidentally, these regulations may never be published. Bill 
C-25, which will be adopted soon, allows the minister to take 
everybody by surprise by drafting and implementing regulations 
without ever publishing them. That is what Bill C-25 is all about.
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary may not know it, or if he knows he 
is not telling, but it is coming. This excessive regulatory power that 
the minister of raw cheese is giving himself-I am glad to see you 
here, Madam Speaker-is a raw deal; it is utterly irresponsible.
<P>
	The minister will be able to play with the rules as he sees fit. The 
regulations may be good or bad, published or unpublished. And 
that is when the fun will really begin. The lawyers, who are the 
friends of the government, will have tons of cases to plead, all the 
way up to the Supreme Court of Canada. They will have cases and 
cases galore, all the way up to the Supreme Court. This is how the 
Liberal Party goes about rewarding the party faithful.
<P>
	They are already listening and are anxious that this bill be passed 
so they can go to court and pocket hundreds of thousands, maybe 
millions, of dollars in fees to defend a law that, as we already know, 
will be challenged in court. To begin with, this does not even come 
under the government's jurisdiction.
<P>
	Tobacco companies will be on the attack again. The money they 
will give to their lawyers will not go to sports or cultural events. 
They will enrich the Liberal Party.  Three years from now, there 
will be a minister, a new one, of course, who like his predecessor 
will stand there aghast and say: ``This is crazy. The Supreme Court 
has just dismissed our appeal''. Basically, it is the same old story 
we heard a few years ago.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, spare the rod and spoil the child is all very well, 
but it seems to me you are harder on me than on other members. 
However, I bow to the Chair.
<P>
	All this to say I will not vote for this bill. Not just because of the 
impact on sponsorships. I will vote against the bill because of the 
principles you decided to ignore. First, the principles of 
constitutional jurisdiction, but also principles of civil law such as 
reversing the onus of proof, and this unlimited power to make 
regulations in the minister's office with his pals, the parliamentary 
secretaries and the rest, all smoking away. However, I will have no 
part of this.
<P>
	There is also this cozy relationship with major lobbyists. On the 
weekend, the media published the names of members who were 
opposed to this bill. You would think we were in Iran. I will not be 
blackmailed. I will vote against your damned bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I will 
probably be the last member to talk about Bill C-71 today. I can 
only expand on what my colleagues have already said before me.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois did indeed support this bill at second 
reading. This party is not against virtue but is in favour of 
protecting the health of all Canadians and in particular the health of 
Quebecers. The Bloc will always support initiatives enhancing the 
quality of the environment and the health of Quebecers and 
Canadians.
<P>
	But there is a limit to what one can do in that regard. This bill is 
paternalistic, to an unheard of degree. This government wants to 
control the health of Quebecers, but they are perfectly able to take 
care of themselves. If the government wants to regulate the health 
of other Canadians and if they agree, fine. Let them submit to this 
legislation.
<P>
	Yet, as my colleague said earlier, the federal government has no 
right to interfere in health issues.
<P>
<B>(1325)</B>
<P>
	Quebecers are quite capable of looking after their own health and 
administering their other activities, as far as recreation and the 
environment are concerned. What does this bill do, under the guise 
of protecting the health of Canadians and Quebecers? It is as if 
someone wanted to treat an illness with medication without having 
evaluated its side effects. The government wants to eliminate 
cancer caused by smoking by giving us another illness as serious as 
or even more damaging than cancer: the cancer of unemployment.
<P>
	Once everyone has died of unemployment cancer, there will be 
no victim left for cancer caused by smoking.  It is as if someone 
decided to make everybody die of heart disease, so that there would 
be no one left to die of lung cancer. The government is taking steps 
<P>

<B><A NAME="8465"> 8465 </A></B>
<P>
that will result in honourable citizens being asked to sacrifice their 
jobs in order to have a healthy unemployment; in Joliette this 
means 1,200 to 1,500 jobs. They have their jobs taken away from 
them, but they are told ``Well, at least while you are unemployed, 
you will be healthy''.
<P>
	That is not how a good citizen should be treated. Our citizens are 
treated with far too much interference, far too much paternalism. 
You do not replace one evil with another. Ideally, we would like all 
Quebecers, and all Canadians, to quit smoking. I would call myself 
an occasional smoker, since I do not have a cigarette in hand all the 
time. I have stopped smoking many times, I have started over again 
many times too.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lebel:</B> An equal number of times.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Laurin: </B>An equal number of times, of course, because when 
a person starts smoking again, he has already quit. Now, continuing 
in the same vein, to explain what I had started on. People make 
choices, but I do not think anyone would choose one illness in order 
to cure another. Nobody would agree to have their left hand cut off 
in order to save their right or to quit working tomorrow and put 
their job at risk in order to live in better healthier life.
<P>
	That is not what they want. We have nothing against the 
principle of this bill. What we oppose is the extent of the means the 
government takes to reach its ends. This bill needs further study. 
We were prevented from debating it. We had only one speaker at 
second reading. Because of government trickery, we were 
prevented from going any further.
<P>
	Today, they are going hell bent for election, but they seem in less 
of a hurry to apply certain parts of the bill. The parts that could 
prove difficult and could hurt the government during the election 
campaign are being put off until next year. In other words, because 
of side effects, the dose is being altered. Instead of a pill every 
hour, it will be every three hours. It will still hurt, but it will take 
you a little longer to notice it.
<P>
	This is what we oppose. We cannot accept that the fallout from 
this bill will upset the lives of Canadians, and Quebecers in 
particular, who are responsible for cultural events, who organize 
their fellow citizens' leisure activities. Why should we always 
throw a monkey wrench into the works?
<P>
	Once again, when certain events work out well, let us not 
interfere, and let us resort to more creative means in our fight 
against tobacco. If the government lacks imagination, the 
opposition is by no means short of ideas. We have already made 
one suggestion, which is to provide some kind of compensation.
<P>
	But the government would not have none of that. We have 
suggested positive ways to wage the fight nicotine addiction 
without jeopardizing worthwhile events.
<P>
	Obviously, we are still supportive of this bill's principle which 
will govern smokers and non-smokers activities, but not at any 
price. The cure should not be causing another problem.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It being 1.30 p.m., the House will now 
proceed to the consideration of private members' business.

	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.)</B> 
moved that Bill C-250, an act to amend the Parliament of Canada 
Act and the Canada Elections Act (confidence votes), be read the 
second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure and privilege to lead off 
the debate on my private member's Bill C-250 which would fix the 
election date for federal elections in Canada.
<P>
	Once again, Canadians are left wondering about the timing of the 
next election. After the three year anniversary of a government has 
passed the speculation begins in earnest about when the Prime 
Minister will call the next election.
<P>
	Canada is one of the few democracies that still leaves it up to the 
government of the day to decide when to call an election. We feel 
that this represents a type of conflict of interest. In other words, the 
Prime Minister will time the election to whenever best suits his 
own political interests. Also, incumbency already has its own 
built-in advantages and that is well known.
<P>
	Why should the timing of the election also be left to the 
government? We would not let the government arbitrarily set the 
conditions of an election such as where the electoral boundaries 
would be. Fixed elections dates would lessen the government's 
advantage and create a more accountable, representative and fair 
system.
<P>
	Therefore I have proposed a bill that would cause federal 
elections to be held on a fixed date every four years unless the 
government was defeated by a vote of non-confidence. More 
specifically, if passed, the bill would cause a general election to be 
called on the third Monday in October every four years and would 
ensure that byelections occur promptly when vacancies occur 
between general elections.
<P>
	Our Constitution does not contain many provisions regarding 
elections in Canada. Most election rules are by convention or by 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8466"> 8466 </A></B>
<P>
federal statute. However, the charter  provides that the House of 
Commons cannot continue longer than five years, except in time of 
war, invasion or insurrection, unless it has the support of at least 
two thirds of the members of the House of Commons.
<P>
	The Constitution Act of 1867 also states that the House of 
Commons cannot continue longer than five years. Section 5 of the 
charter also states that there is to be a sitting of the House of 
Commons at least once every 12 months. These are some of the 
rules and parameters under which the House of Commons is 
required to operate.
<P>
	As a result of these provisions there could be in some 
circumstances a Parliament that last for longer than five years, 
perhaps even closer to six years, although this has never happened 
and would really be stretching the limits of the Constitution a great 
deal.
<P>
	In his book Election Law in Canada, ex Tory MP Patrick Boyer 
writes: ``It is theoretically possible for an election to be delayed 
approximately nine months after the end of a five year term''.
<P>
	Although the Constitution sets out the maximum time limits for 
a Parliament there is no minimum time limit. That is a greater part 
of the problem we face in the country with the uncertainty of when 
elections will be held.
<P>
	Federal elections in Canada can be called any time up to the end 
of that five year limit by the governor general on the advice of the 
Prime Minister or they can be called if Parliament is dissolved 
because the government lost a vote of confidence in the House.
<P>
<B>(1335 )</B>
<P>
	Therefore a general election can be held at virtually any time 
during the government's mandate. This has led to problems of 
elections being held too frequently or not frequently enough. For 
majority governments it means they can hold out for as long as five 
years and for minority governments it means that another election 
can be called after just a few months in office.
<P>
	A minority government or even one with a slim majority can 
implement one popular decision or even make a promise and then 
hold an election to try to gain a larger number of seats in the House. 
This would be done at great cost and expense to the country.
<P>
	The lack of fixed election days has led to abuses and 
irregularities. For instance, many of the Liberal members here will 
remember the last two years of the Tory government. The Tories 
held on to power as long as they thought they dared. They had been 
re-elected in November 1988 but rather than calling the election in 
the fall of 1992, when I believe Canadians were ready for a federal 
election, they held on for almost a full year and went to the people 
in October 1993.
<P>
	The Tory government of Grant Devine in Saskatchewan did the 
same thing, stretched out a  mandate to the full five years, 
obviously realizing that it would not be re-elected by the people of 
Saskatchewan. Both the Mulroney and Devine Tories held on to 
power despite being hopelessly unpopular and even involved an 
alleged unsavoury and even possibly criminal activity.
<P>
	The power to call elections has also backfired several time. I 
guess the most blatant example was when the voters of Ontario 
rejected the Liberal government of David Peterson because they 
thought that the timing of the election was based on what was best 
for it and not what was best for the citizens of Ontario.
<P>
	There have also been abuses in terms of the timing of 
byelections. We do not have to go back very far to see a very 
blatant abuse of the timing of byelections because it was done by 
this very Liberal government that we have today. The byelection 
was the Ottawa-Vanier byelection that was held in February 1995. 
The candidates had to prepare for the campaign over the Christmas 
holiday period. Imagine that. In fact, the writ was dropped on 
December 28, 1994 for the election on February 13, 1995.
<P>
	Obviously the government knew it was going to call a 
byelection. It had arranged the vacancy where the member who had 
held that seat was appointed to the Senate. All this happened very 
quickly and it was manipulated by the federal government in a very 
undemocratic and very arrogant manner. Candidates had to go door 
to door in the dead of winter. Obviously this favoured the 
incumbent party. In this case it happened to be the Liberals.
<P>
	I am not making these examples solely on a partisan basis. Any 
political party in power, the way our election act of Parliament is 
set up, can place those same abuses of power on to the other 
political parties at a disadvantage.
<P>
	In the Labrador byelection the seat sat empty from September 
21, 1995 until the writ was dropped on February 7, 1996 for a 
March 25 election date. For Canadians and members who have not 
been in Labrador in February or March, it is extremely cold. It is a 
time of high snowfall, impassable roads, not the right time to call 
an election if one wants the democratic process to be properly 
undertaken. It was again another blatant attempt by the Liberals to 
use whatever advantages they could to hold on to a seat they 
believed to be safe. They did not want any other parties 
campaigning against them in an effective manner.
<P>
	It may to some governments' benefit to hold the byelection in 
the summer when certain professional and labour groups are away 
on holidays, such as teachers and public servants. That too is an 
abuse of power. But the way our laws are written right now that is 
possible and has been used.
<P>
	This would be a legal attempt to disenfranchise potentially 
hostile voters. Our election act should not  allow that possibility. It 
may not ever happen but it certainly can happen the way the laws of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8467"> 8467 </A></B>
<P>
the land currently stand. Therefore we are asking this House to 
consider the idea that general elections and byelections be held at 
fixed intervals.
<P>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
	I have talked about the history that has led me to introduce Bill 
C-250, but what are the other benefits of having a system of fixed 
election terms? There is enhanced accountability. In conjunction 
with other reforms that we are proposing, such as free votes in the 
House of Commons, the use of referenda, citizens' initiatives, and 
the use of recall, this act would make Parliament more accountable 
to the Canadian electorate.
<P>
	It would allow for better representation. It would reduce the 
threat of dissolution, which is a major factor used by the governing 
parties to keep their MPs in line. The result would be less party 
discipline and more independence for backbenchers.
<P>
	Also because the act's provisions are related to byelections, 
voters in those constituencies would not be unrepresented for 
extended periods of time. The reason that the Prime Minister keeps 
the date to himself or herself regarding calling a federal election is 
not only to keep the opposition parties off guard but also to keep his 
own members in line.
<P>
	Any time they would tend to want to represent their constituents, 
even if it were in opposition to the governing party's position, the 
government could say ``We are going to call an election. We might 
call an election pretty soon. You will put yourself in a very 
vulnerable position. You better go with the flow, member, or else 
you may lose your seat or we may help you lose your seat when we 
call the next election''.
<P>
	With regard to byelections, the federal government can call it at 
the most opportune time for itself to win the byelection. If it is a 
seat that it knows it cannot win, a safe seat that belongs to another 
party, it can leave that seat unrepresented for an unduly long time, 
disenfranchising Canadians of the representation they are entitled 
to.
<P>
	Another benefit of passing Bill C-250 would be the creation of 
greater fairness. It would remove the governing party's advantage 
of choosing the most opportune moment to call an election. The 
result would be a more level playing field for all political parties.
<P>
	Any party and any politician who minimalizes this point does 
not truly respect the importance of the democratic process 
unfettered by government manipulation. I cannot emphasize that 
point enough. It is paramount to the democratic principles that we 
all adhere to. Any party or any politician who minimalizes this 
point does not truly respect the importance of the democratic 
process unfettered by government manipulation.
<P>
	Another benefit of this bill would be more certainty. It would 
give the government reasonable and sufficient time to develop and 
implement its legislative agenda and would allow it to take some of 
the more difficult decisions.
<P>
	This bill is not all weighted in favour of the opposition parties. A 
government needs a fair amount of time to implement its mandate. 
It tells the people that it wants to, for instance as the Liberals said, 
create jobs, jobs, jobs. Possibly in two years the government could 
say ``We would like to have fulfilled that promise but we see an 
opportune time to call an election. Give us another mandate and we 
will finish the job''.
<P>
	Canadians want to see a measurable period of time in which a 
government can implement the mandate it was elected on. This 
way, a government can reasonably deliver on a mandate it received 
from the people.
<P>
	Another benefit of Bill C-250 would be healthier, more open 
public debate. It would allow for more constructive debate in the 
House since opposition parties would know that the government 
has a fixed term.
<P>
	Opposition parties would not be fighting the next election 18 
months after the previous one. I noticed in the House in the first 
year or two we were looking at the government's record, its 
intentions. As we passed that 18 month mark, focus began to be 
that the government has completed perhaps the first half of its 
mandate. The government side becomes more political. The 
opposition side becomes more political and Canadians often take a 
back seat as a result of the focus on when the next election will be.
<P>
	Fixed election dates would postpone some of the time that is 
wasted in posturing for the next election. That is a very good reason 
why this bill should be passed.
<P>
	Finally, if Bill C-250 is passed it would be a cost efficient 
measure. It would allow political parties, election officials and 
candidates to better plan for elections. Therefore procedures could 
be streamlined and costs reduced.
<P>
	The 1990s are a time of scarce resources and of demands for 
efficiency. This bill prepares Canada for the environment of the 
next century.
<P>
<B>(1345 )</B>
<P>
	Bill C-250, an act to amend the Parliament of Canada Act and 
the Canada Elections Act (confidence votes) was first introduced 
on March 27, 1996. The key elements of the bill are as follows: 
Clause 1 provides that the maximum duration of a Parliament 
would be four years. A federal election would be held on October 
20, 1997 and every four years thereafter on the third Monday of 
October.
<P>
	Provision is also made in clause 1 for the House to continue 
beyond four years in the time of war, invasion or insurrection, so 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8468"> 8468 </A></B>
<P>
long as such the continuation is not  opposed by more than 
one-third of the members of the House.
<P>
	Clause 1 of the bill also provides that no dissolution of 
Parliament can be sought except when the House adopts a 
non-confidence motion and the Governor General is satisfied that it 
is not possible for a government to be formed with has the 
confidence of the House.
<P>
	Clause 1 also states that the Prime Minister must request the 
Governor General to dissolve Parliament. It is very important that 
the bill does not require the Governor General to accede to the 
Prime Minister's request.
<P>
	Clause 2 of the bill specifically provides that these provisions do 
not alter or affect the power of the crown to prorogue or dissolve 
Parliament. Perhaps I should expand on that by saying that when 
we drafted the bill we were very careful to not infringe on the 
Constitution of the nation. This bill would not require a 
constitutional amendment.
<P>
	If I had stated in the bill that the Governor General must accede 
to the Prime Minister's request to hold a general election, that 
would infringe on the power of the crown, and we were not 
prepared to introduce a bill that would necessitate an amendment to 
the Constitution. That is why we ask the Prime Minister merely to 
advise the Governor General of his desire to have an election held. 
Under the powers given to him under the Constitution, the 
Governor General will choose whether or not to abide by the Prime 
Minister's wishes.
<P>
	Clause 3 of the bill provides that writs for byelections are to be 
issued within two months of a vacancy occurring in the House of 
Commons unless the vacancy occurs within two months of the date 
fixed for a general election. The byelections would be held on the 
third Monday of April or October except in the year prior to a 
general election.
<P>
	Since I began to draft this bill over two years ago I have received 
a great deal of assistance and advice. I want to inform the House 
that I have been co-operating with Elections Canada and have 
incorporated many of its suggestions into my bill. This was not a 
hastily drafted bill but considerable time was spent consulting with 
those who knew what was required under the Constitution, what 
would best fit Canada's parliamentary system and what would best 
fit into the existing laws that must be agreed on.
<P>
	I have also received a lot of encouragement and support from 
others. Many academics and journalists have commented 
extensively in support of a fixed election date. It was not planned 
by me but it is very interesting that on February 11 an article was 
written by Andrew Coyne that appeared in the Montreal <I>Gazette</I>. It 
made a case for a fixed election date in a very articulate and 
concise fashion. I encourage all members to read the article entitled 
``Fixed Voting Date Would Lessen  Government Advantage''. It is 
an excellent piece, reinforcing many of the arguments I made to the 
House in my opening address on Bill C-250.
<P>
	All members of the House are invited to examine this bill and the 
surrounding issues. I do not come to this House with an attitude of 
arrogance. I do not come to this House with an attitude of ``it's my 
way or the highway'' or of ``it's the Reform Party's way or let's not 
do anything at all''.
<P>
	This is an election year and the focus is on how the timing of 
elections is determined. It is an opportunity for us to seize the issue 
and engage in a healthy and vigorous debate. I urge members not to 
mindlessly reject this bill and also not to blindly accept all the 
proposals. I welcome and am open to amendments to the bill. I 
encourage members to discuss parts of the bill with me. Certainly 
members from various parties have argued the need for reform in 
the setting and calling of byelections. I know several Liberal 
members have called for that. There have been debates in the past 
by parties other than the Reform Party calling for fixed election 
dates.
<P>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
	There is a need for electoral reform in this area. Let us work 
together to achieve it. Let us see if we cannot, with an issue as 
sensitive as the calling of election dates, see some co-operation 
between among the political parties. Let us set aside some of the 
sparring that we do over the issues such as CPP, budgets and other 
issues that we disagree on, to see if we cannot provide a service for 
Canadians so that they would know when elections were going to 
be held, there would be some certainty, some continuity and some 
good reason behind when elections were called.
<P>
	Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for this opportunity to address my bill. 
Unfortunately I have to catch a plane in just a couple of minutes 
and I will be leaving the House. Certainly it is not out of disrespect 
for those who will follow me to speak. I will certainly read all their 
comments in <I>Hansard</I> with great interest. Should they want to 
come and speak to me personally about any matter with regard to 
this bill I would be more than happy to do that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mauril Bélanger (Ottawa-Vanier, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to speak on this private member's bill, Bill C-250, since 
it would bring about a major change to the regime by which general 
elections and byelections are called. Thus it would be worthwhile 
to take a few minutes to outline the current regime and to note its 
historical development.
<P>
	Governments under our Canadian system of parliamentary 
democracy do not have a free rein in calling general elections. 
There is a constitutional constraint. Section 4 of the Canadian 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms provides for a maximum duration 
of five years for Parliament, barring exceptional circumstances  
such as times of war or a national crisis. Within this constitutional 
limit, the conventions of responsible government make the Prime 
Minister personally responsible for tendering advice to the 
Governor 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8469"> 8469 </A></B>
<P>
General as to when Parliament should be dissolved and the general 
election called.
<P>
	The obvious exception to this practice is in the event that the 
governing party loses the support of the majority of members of the 
House of Commons. If this should occur, the governing party 
would be forced to seek the Governor General's advice which 
would include the possibility of Parliament's dissolution and a 
general election call.
<P>
	Byelections occur within the life of an existing Parliament. 
When a vacancy occurs in the House of Commons the Speaker, 
once advised, sends a warrant to this effect to the Chief Electoral 
Officer. Under the Parliament of Canada Act the government is 
required to issue a writ advising of the date for the byelection. This 
writ must be issued within six months after the receipt by the Chief 
Electoral Officer of the warrant of the Speaker.
<P>
	This regime has evolved over several hundred years of 
parliamentary practice. At its core is the relationship between the 
House of Commons and the executive branch of government. The 
cabinet is ultimately responsible to the House of Commons. The 
leadership provided by the cabinet drives the overall work of a 
parliamentary session. The cabinet has a key influence on the 
House's legislative agenda. The cabinet plays a pivotal role in 
controlling the time, regulating the business and to a large extent 
harnessing the energies of the House. It is within this overall 
context that Parliament is summoned and dissolved on the advice 
of the Prime Minister to the Governor General. The Prime 
Minister, although not always, usually exercises this responsibility 
after consulting members of his or her cabinet.
<P>
	The House of Commons, on its part, is able to hold the cabinet 
accountable through its work. This includes subjecting the 
government to oversight and review through the House debates, 
question period, the work of parliamentary committees, the budget 
debates, and bills and resolutions introduced by private members, 
such as this one. The government cannot hold on to power after it 
has lost the support of the House of Commons.
<P>
	There is another important dimension to this relationship. It 
concerns the role of the Prime Minister as primus inter pares or 
first among equals. He or she must be able to give direction to the 
government's policies and legislative agenda, to bring about 
cabinet solidarity and to foster cohesion among its caucus 
members. Without this authority the government's ability to obtain 
and maintain the support of the House could be at risk. The Prime 
Minister's power to advise on the call for a general election is one 
of many key elements in our  parliamentary form of government 
which works to support the Prime Minister's pivotal leadership 
role.
<P>
<B>(1355 )</B>
<P>
	Bill C-250 would create a hybrid system for calling general 
elections. Within the constitutional limits of section 4 of the 
charter, the bill would provide for a set term of four years for each 
Parliament. Elections would be held every four years on the third 
Monday of October. The bill also provides for exceptions to this 
rule. It does not purport to take away non-confidence votes from 
the House of Commons. This could still be done and an election 
called if required. As I understand it, the four year election clock 
would then be re-started at this point. Of course the four-year rule 
would apply only if there were no immediate national crisis.
<P>
	This hybrid system would continue with respect to byelections. 
If required, Bill C-250 provides for two annual dates for 
byelections, on the third Monday of April and on the third Monday 
of October. There are exceptions to deal with unique situations.
<P>
	My colleagues on the opposite side of the House have advanced 
three arguments in support of this hybrid system: first, that fixed 
dates for general elections would remove what they view as a 
built-in bias in favour of the governing party, namely, the ability to 
call a general election at a time most favourable to its interests; 
second, that a hybrid system for calling elections would be less 
costly to administer and organize; and third, that setting fixed dates 
for general elections would end needless House time wasted on 
election speculation and remove one of our favourite national 
pastimes.
<P>
	We also heard criticism about the current regime for calling 
byelections, criticism that the period of time is too long between a 
vacancy being created and the calling of a byelection, thereby 
detrimentally affecting constituents, or criticism that this period of 
time is too short, a so-called snap byelection to favour the 
re-election of a member who has resigned in political difficulty.
<P>
	The Royal Commission on Electoral Reform and Party 
Financing, known commonly as the Lortie commission, also heard 
these arguments in 1990 and 1992, but the commission did not 
recommend moving to a system of fixed dates for general elections 
or a hybrid system as is represented by Bill C-250.
<P>
	The royal commission pointed to several drawbacks which it felt 
were persuasive. The commission emphasized that although fixed 
election terms are not uncommon in democracies, they are not the 
rule for parliamentary democracies. Rather, countries which have 
adopted fixed election terms are, as a rule, systems characterized 
by the separation of powers between the executive and the 
legislative branches of government. The United States is the best 
example of that.
<P>
	The commission went on to note that unlike the U.S. executive 
branch of government, the Canadian Prime  Minister and his or her 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8470"> 8470 </A></B>
<P>
cabinet are held accountable to Parliament and exercise power only 
so long as the confidence of the House is maintained.
<P>
	The commission indicated, as I did earlier, that the threat of a 
possible dissolution of the House by the Prime Minister assures his 
or her voice is the most influential in cabinet, as it should be, and 
also encourages the loyalty of caucus members toward government 
policies and legislation. The removal of this convention would 
undermine the role and responsibilities of the office of the Prime 
Minister and disrupt the balance between the legislative and 
executive branches of government.
<P>
	The commission also questioned whether a hybrid system would 
in practice remove the perceived bias of the governing party in 
calling elections to suit its political agenda. It noted that a hybrid 
system could still allow any governing party to take steps to 
engineer its own defeat in the House, should this be judged to be in 
its own political interest.
<P>
	Another concern was the commission's fear that fixed date 
elections might lead to lengthy and much more costly election 
campaigns. The commission pointed to the U.S. experience with 
fixed elections and long campaign periods. It noted the rising cost 
of U.S. presidential elections, which are often launched 18 months 
or more before election date. This was contrasted with the 
Canadian experience, which is a historic movement toward shorter 
campaigns, a longstanding tradition of not starting the campaign in 
earnest until the writs are issued, and the development of stringent 
election spending limits for candidates and political parties.
<P>
	I would like to turn to the issue of whether fixed dates for 
elections would actually reduce the cost of election administration. 
It has been assumed that savings would materialize largely through 
better scheduling and planning of door to door enumeration to 
register voters, but we are in the process of moving away from this 
system. Members will recall that Bill C-63, which was passed by 
Parliament last December, provides for a permanent register of 
electors. The permanent register will provide for a continuous, up 
to date listing of electors to replace the cumbersome and costly 
system of door to door enumeration.
<P>
<B>(1400 )</B>
<P>
	The more modern and efficient electoral system, which a 
permanent register will bring, will over the long term significantly 
reduce the cost of elections and thus largely remove the major cost 
disadvantage associated with calling elections at the discretion of 
the crown.
<P>
	I would also like to talk to the issue of byelections. Bill C-63, 
which I noted earlier, also amended the Parliament of Canada Act 
to ensure that any writ calling for a byelection could not be issued 
for at least 11 days prior to the receipt of the Speaker's warrants. 
This was intended  to address the opposition's long standing 
concerns about so-called snap byelections.
<P>
	Also, if we examine this government's record to date with 
respect to the calling of byelections, we would find that all were 
held within six months of the vacancy occurring. The majority 
were actually held within three months. In my case, it was held 
exactly three months after the seat became vacant.
<P>
	If we go back 10 years we would find that the average time 
period between the vacancy and polling day was approximately six 
months. So we are making progress in that sense.
<P>
	I would also note that to save on administration costs, if more 
than one vacancy occurred within the period of time, the practice 
has tended to be to set aside one polling day to run a series of 
byelections across the country. This practice is, in large part, 
responsible for some of the longer-
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure for me to speak today to Bill C-250 introduced by the hon. 
member for Kindersley-Lloydminster. The purpose of this bill is 
to amend the Parliament of Canada Act and the Canada Elections 
Act in order to implement a system of fixed dates for general 
elections in Canada.
<P>
	It is no easy task to draft or implement such a bill. Strictly 
speaking, it is not a constitutional matter affecting the Constitution 
of 1867, but it does seek to match differing components of a reality, 
to adapt certain rules under the congressional system to a 
parliamentary system.
<P>
	Quite apart from the actual wording of Bill C-250, there is the 
principle involved. The principle of having fixed dates for elections 
is, in my opinion, a principle of equity between the various 
political parties in Canada. I consider it an anomaly of our system 
that a person, or a very small group of persons in the Prime 
Minister's office, can decide more or less four years after an 
election is held to call another one-this, of course, when there is a 
majority government.
<P>
	We, the official opposition, have had to prepare for a general 
election that could have been held last fall, for an election that 
might be held this spring, and for another election that might be 
held this fall. It is up to the Prime Minister, who is the only one to 
make this decision, since his recommendation will be accepted by 
the Governor General.
<P>
	This is going far beyond the major principles underlying the 
Constitution of Canada. Allow me to quote the first ``whereas'' of 
the 1867 British North America Act, which was renamed the 
Constitution Act, 1867. What does it say? It says: ``Whereas the 
Provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick have  
expressed their Desire to be federally united into One Dominion 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8471"> 8471 </A></B>
<P>
under the Crown of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and 
Ireland, with a Constitution similar in Principle to that of the 
United Kingdom''.
<P>
	Therefore, according to the original act, which gave us the 
system we know today, the Canadian Constitution must be based on 
the same principles as the United Kingdom's Constitution. This 
does not apply only to the written constitution, since Great Britain 
does not have one. It is more like a constitutional tradition, 
whereby people alternate between governing and being in 
opposition.
<P>
	For some time now, elections in the United Kingdom have 
usually been held around the same date. In the past several years, 
the British government has called elections only after the 
constitutional five year mandate was over. However, the 
government could still lose a vote on a major issue in the House.
<P>
<B>(1405)</B>
<P>
	Mr. Major's government in Great Britain, which will soon come 
to the end of its five-year mandate, lost several votes in the House. 
No election was held during these five years. Every time, the 
government came back before the House to ask, despite the vote 
that was taken, despite the defeat of a government bill, whether the 
House would maintain its confidence in the government. Every 
time, the House maintained its confidence in the government, so 
there was no dissolution.
<P>
	Once the hon. member for Ottawa-Vanier finishes with his 
behind-the-scenes representations, I will continue.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Bellechasse still has 
five minutes left.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Langlois:</B> Mr. Speaker, I was talking about how things are 
done in Great Britain. Calling elections every five years became a 
tradition that then turned into a convention.
<P>
	There is no need for a constitutional amendment or a statutory 
amendment. All that is required is a ministerial order, perhaps 
endorsed by a vote in the House of Commons, where the Prime 
Minister would announce, or have announced when Parliament 
convened in January 1994, that the next election would be held on 
the third Monday of October 1998.
<P>
	Knowing this, all the parties would be on equal footing and could 
prepare accordingly. No party would have an unfair advantage over 
the others.
<P>
	We saw, in 1993 in particular, what can come of an unfair 
advantage. We all recall the PC leadership race. Mrs. Campbell, 
who was elected leader of the Conservative Party, chose not to ask 
for the dissolution of Parliament during the summer of 1993, but 
rather to try to woo the voters, courtesy of the Canadian taxpayers. 
All summer long, she travelled throughout Canada with  her 
ministers, all expenses paid by the taxpayers, to get the highest 
possible visibility. Of course, if she had known what the future held 
for her, she would probably have asked for the writ of election to be 
made out a lot sooner.
<P>
	We also had to campaign during the summer, but our expenses 
were paid not by the taxpayers but by our own political party. The 
other political parties in this House had to do the same thing, 
meaning they had to follow the Prime Minister wherever she 
travelled and provide all the proper answers, but we had no control 
at all on the time the writ was to be made.
<P>
	The writ of election was finally made out on September 8, 1993. 
That is when a new election campaign began. We could say that, 
from May 1993 to October 25, 1993, we were in a perpetual 
election campaign.
<P>
	Obviously, something is not working.
<P>
	Bill C-250 may not be the appropriate response, but I believe it 
deserves to be referred to the Standing Committee on Procedure 
and House Affairs for further study.
<P>
	If Americans, for 210 years now, have been able to live with the 
fact that on the Tuesday of the first week of November, every two 
years for the House of Representatives and one third of the Senate, 
and every four years for the President, there is an election at a fixed 
date, if they have managed to do that with the results that can been 
seen, and knowing that it does not disrupt political life, we can 
examine, at least, how to blend both systems in such a way that will 
allow us to maintain responsible government as well as fairness for 
political parties during election campaigns.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my colleague from Kindersley-Lloydminster has 
brought forward, as he has many times since coming to Parliament 
in 1993, a very logical and very well thought out and sensible bill, 
Bill C-250, which will provide for fixed elections to be held every 
four years. This is not a new idea. It is a new idea for Canada 
perhaps but in many other countries they have fixed elections. They 
work very well. As a matter of fact, one can find little fault with 
that formula. As a contrast I am going to outline some of the faults 
that we can find with the current formula what we operate under in 
Canada with regard to elections.
<P>
<B>(1410)</B>
<P>
	This bill also provides that byelections must be held within two 
months of a seat's becoming vacant in Canada. That again is very 
logical and sensible. Too often we have seen for one reason or 
another that a seat has become vacant and has been vacant for a 
considerable length of time before a byelection was held and most  
often until it was held most conveniently to the government of the 
day. In that time the people in that constituency have been without 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8472"> 8472 </A></B>
<P>
representation in this House. That is not a good practice to have in 
Canada. After all, we are as MPs duty bound to ensure that our 
constituents are well represented in Parliament and therefore a seat 
should not remain vacant for a period of time longer than two 
months.
<P>
	The other thing that is important about this bill is that this bill 
would be the first step to begin the process of shattering the near 
dictatorial powers which are enjoyed by a cabinet in our 
parliamentary system. As things now stand, and there is no 
difference in this Parliament with a Liberal cabinet, the Liberal 
cabinet sets the legislative agenda. The Liberal cabinet, as we have 
the case in this Parliament, also tells the Liberal backbenchers how 
to vote. That same Liberal cabinet, as in this government, also 
ensures the obedience of backbench members by doling out 
goodies to those same MPs if they simply do as they are told. These 
goodies can include committee chairs, trips abroad or 
parliamentary secretary positions.
<P>
	While cabinet enjoys these powers, it also enjoys the powers of 
calling a general election when it chooses. This is very unusual 
when we stop to think about it. The governing party, the party with 
the majority in the House with all the power and all the resources, 
has the ability in this country to call an election when it is most 
advantageous to it.
<P>
	Certainly incumbency has some benefits and brings some 
benefits with it but this is an extreme benefit for a sitting 
government, to be able to call an election whenever from a political 
point of view it is most advantageous to it.
<P>
	Andrew Coyne pointed out in an article in the Ottawa <I>Citizen</I>: 
``We would not trust the governing party alone to set electoral 
boundaries or to count votes. Yet it is fro some reason accepted as 
normal democratic procedure that the government of the day 
should time the election for its own purposes''. Those benefits are 
in every sense extreme and an impediment to true democracy in 
this country.
<P>
	I want to touch on some other things because curtailing this 
power of the government and the cabinet should be only one step in 
our path to parliamentary reform. Canadians have been asking for 
greater accountability within their highest political institutions. 
Certainly the Canadian people are very cynical, very distrustful of 
politicians. It has been because there has been this profound lack of 
accountability within the highest level of government in the land.
<P>
	Bill C-250 would help restore accountability but so would other 
measures such as freer votes, citizens' initiatives, referendums and 
recall. As members know, the electorate for the most part feels sort 
of left out of the democratic process. They feel that democracy 
occurs for them only once every four or five years as the  
government pleases. That is when they have a chance to cast their 
vote for the party that is representing what their greatest concerns 
are, or the party that they can associate with as having the same 
type of thinking. That only happens once every four or five years.
<P>
<B>(1415)</B>
<P>
	It is too often in this country-and we have seen it with this 
Liberal government-that a party will go out and campaign on 
certain issues and get the people's confidence. We saw it during the 
1993 election in particular on the GST issue when the Liberal 
candidates went around the country and told people that they would 
scrap, kill and abolish the GST. The Prime Minister himself on 
radio talk shows and on television said he would kill the GST, that 
he hated it. Many of the current cabinet ministers have said the 
same thing. When they got in the position of government, they 
refused to fulfil the promises they made to the people of Canada. 
They said: ``We never said that. If you had simply read our red 
book, you would have seen that we never said that''.
<P>
	Let us remember that Liberal candidates from all across the 
country talked to hundreds, possibly millions of Canadian voters 
and told them verbally that they were going to kill the GST. Yet 
they only printed 100,000 red books so how would the Canadian 
people know?
<P>
	My point is that Canadians do not have an opportunity to hold 
the government accountable between elections. That is why we 
think referendums, citizens initiatives and recall should be part of 
parliamentary reform. Instituting some of the reforms I just 
mentioned would go a long way to restoring accountability in this 
place. They would allow Canadians to actively participate in the 
workings of their government, not just once every four years but all 
the time. As their representatives we should be committed to 
parliamentary reform in order to restore the confidence that we 
would like to have from the Canadian people.
<P>
	Bill C-250 would also return a measure of fairness in our 
election campaigns. As it now stands, opposition parties must be 
prepared for an election virtually at any time. The opposition 
parties of course are at the mercy of the government and the 
shortening of the writ period to 37 days leaves them in even a more 
precarious position. Opposition parties have just over a month to 
get their message out and their campaigns up and running. The 
government has the advantage of knowing for months before an 
election is called exactly when the date will be.
<P>
	Bill C-250, by introducing fixed election dates, would restore 
fairness to our electoral system by levelling the playing field. All 
parties would know that an election would be held every four years 
on the third Monday in October. Not only would Bill C-250 create 
fairness within our system, it would also produce some tremendous 
cost savings.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="8473"> 8473 </A></B>
<P>
	In closing, I ask that all members see the logic in this bill, do 
the right thing and support it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pat O'Brien (London-Middlesex, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
addressing this private members' bill, I would first like to turn to 
some of the comments from the Reform member opposite who just 
spoke. I will address three or four of his points and try to clarify 
what are some obvious misunderstandings.
<P>
	The member spoke to the issue of accountability in government. 
I would remind him if he has not had the opportunity to study how 
the American system works that there the separation of the three 
branches of government virtually insulates the president from any 
accountability in the legislative branch whatsoever.
<P>
	The president of the United States is never in the Congress 
except at their invitation. He is not, like the Prime Minister of 
Canada who is present daily in the House of Commons, in the 
legislative branch daily along with his ministers fielding questions 
from opposition parties.
<P>
<B>(1420 )</B>
<P>
	We have in the parliamentary system the greatest possible degree 
of accountability of any democratic system in the world. For the 
member to raise that issue is simply for him to have a 
misunderstanding about our system and how accountable it is 
vis-à-vis the congressional system for example.
<P>
	I was reaching to see the relevance of some of the member's 
comments, but I guess he tied them in just enough to stay on top. 
The Reform member brought the GST into the debate and the fact 
that our party had only printed 100,000 red books. He asked how 
could we expect Canadians to understand what we said in writing 
on the GST.
<P>
	I welcome that comment and this is why. In January I held two 
town hall meetings in my riding. I knew this issue would come up, 
which it did. I shared with the people my own flyer which I 
distributed door to door in my own riding. It was a one page flyer, 
not a hundred page red book. It was a one page flyer which I 
personally took to their homes. The flyer spoke to the issue of the 
GST. It said that this party would harmonize the GST, that we 
would replace it with a tax that was fairer and simpler.
<P>
	It is an absolute red herring for the member to comment that 
because we had a limited number of red books our electorate could 
not be expected to know our stand on the GST. Any responsible 
member and all the colleagues on my side of the House 
campaigned responsibly and took their own literature to the doors 
of the constituents they were seeking to represent. They took the 
constituents' questions at their doorsteps.
<P>
	The Reform member also spoke to the issue that the opposition 
now has a very limited time to get its message  across under the 
36-day campaign period which has just been passed by the parties 
in the House of Commons. I would submit that if the opposition 
parties are relying strictly on the campaign period to explain their 
proposals to the people, their alternate visions of what the 
government should be in this country, then they are totally 
misunderstanding what the House of Commons is all about. They 
should be putting forth that message and those concepts day after 
day in the House of Commons.
<P>
	I have been very disappointed to see how badly the Reform Party 
uses question period. It gets hung up on irrelevant issues. Day after 
day it fails to take maximum benefit of question period. There have 
been many days when I and other colleagues of mine on this side of 
the House would have loved to have had the opportunity to be in 
opposition just for a day. Then we could fire some more relevant 
questions which would liven up the debate. Question period has 
been pathetically used by the Reform Party and frankly the record 
speaks for itself. The toughest and most relevant questions have 
often come from the Liberal members, as our own ministers are 
well aware.
<P>
	The Reform member failed to mention the fact that shortening 
the election campaign period to 36 days will save the Canadian 
taxpayers millions and millions of dollars. The creation of a 
permanent voters list will save millions and millions of dollars.
<P>
	Maybe he does not know Canadian history but he failed to note 
that the 47-day campaign period goes back to the last century when 
leaders travelled by train, when we did not have the advantage of 
television, when we did not have jet travel. Everyone who has been 
involved in a federal election campaign knows that the public 
basically tunes in during the last 10 days or two weeks. The interest 
becomes higher at that point, so there is no need for a 47-day 
campaign.
<P>
	To move to the issue of this private members' bill and to fixed 
dates for elections, I think it is a well intentioned but simplistic 
idea. This is not the United States. It is not a congressional system 
where we can fix the dates easily.
<P>
	One idea I have not heard in this debate is that the Governor 
General of Canada does not have to grant the Prime Minister a 
dissolution. There is the right of the Governor General, which has 
been used in this country in the past but not without some 
controversy, to say: ``I reject your reason for calling an election. I 
will not dissolve the House of Commons. If you are not prepared to 
carry on, I will call on another party to form the government''. No 
one has brought that into this debate.
<P>
<B>(1425 )</B>
<P>
	The idea that any government or any prime minister could 
frivolously, strictly for political advantage, call an unwarranted 
election simply does not bear scrutiny in a reading of Canadian 
history. I would invite the previous speaker to look up the 
King-Byng crisis if he does not  know to what I refer. It has not 
been done lately by a governor general but it is a power that he does 
have and can use if he feels that there is a frivolous call for an 
election by a prime minister.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="8474"> 8474 </A></B>
<P>
	The system we have has served us very well for 130 years. It has 
been responsibly used by prime ministers of different political 
stripes. I would submit that we are not the United States. I am not 
anxious to see an Americanization of our system. Quite frankly, I 
think some of that has happened with our supreme court which I for 
one am not very excited about. I do not think we want to further 
Americanize our parliamentary system of government by these 
fixed dates for elections.
<P>
	I come from a municipal government background. Fixed dates 
work well at the municipal level. However, that is not the case here 
at the federal level. I would submit that our system of leaving the 
responsibility to the prime minister and having that person and his 
party answer to the ultimate judge of the propriety of an election 
ought to be the Canadian electorate. They can very well determine 
if the election was warranted or not.
<P>
	The system has served us very well for 130 years. I submit it will 
continue to serve us very well. While I know the bill by the 
member of the Reform Party is well-intentioned, I cannot support 
it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I see I do 
not have much time, but I am supportive of the bill that has been 
introduced by my colleague.
<P>
	In my view, this is a non-partisan issue. I am surprised to hear 
that it has raised a few voices on the other side speaking against it. 
The last speaker has just said that municipal governments have 
used this system and it has worked well there. I suggest that it can 
work well in the federal Parliament as well.
<P>
	I know that this has been a long-time interest of my colleague 
from Kindersley-Lloydminster. The theory is that fixed election 
dates introduce an element of fairness, more certainty, more cost 
effectiveness and more independence by the MPs.
<P>
	We are all in favour of reform in a number of parliamentary 
areas to try to make MPs feel like they are more involved in the 
process, have more power in committees and have more free votes. 
I think that is what we are striving for. We are trying to represent 
our constituents to the best of our ability but sometimes the process 
has been in our way.
<P>
	The previous member talked about the need to change the 
election time from 47 days to 36 days and about why that was 
necessary. That a system that was used when people travelled by 
train. I suggest that the system we are using today for elections that 
can be called by the Prime Minister at his whim is in the same 
category. We need to move forward. It introduces more certainty 
into the system. I would support it.
<P>
	I would like to quote from an article in the Montreal <I>Gazette</I> by 
Andrew Coyne on February 11, 1997. It is interesting that he has 
raised the same issue. He is asking why the Prime Minister should 
go to the polls after a little more than three years. I will read the 
quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>But I have a more fundamental question: why should it be up to him? Canada is 
one of the few democracies that still leaves it up to the government of the day to 
decide when elections should be called-</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We would not trust the governing party alone to set electoral boundaries, or to 
count the votes. Yet it is accepted as normal democratic procedure that it should time 
the election to its own purposes at the zenith of its popularity-In most other 
democracies, elections are governed by a set timetable agreed upon and understood 
well in advance, rather than the Prime Minister's biorhythms.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This is popularly associated with presidential systems, like the United States and 
France, but there's no reason it could not apply to the parliamentary democracies as 
well: the existing five-year limit on the life of any Parliament, within which time new 
elections must be held, might be turned into a regular appointment.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He makes the argument why this could be case.
<P>
	The provincial election is on in Alberta right now and the 
election date is March 11. In my part of the world that could be 
minus 35 or 40 Celsius. I know that the politicians out campaigning 
are having a bit of a difficult time let alone some of the people who 
are travelling to the meetings to hear their potential elected 
representatives. I suggest that in a country like Canada October 
would be a good time and I see every reason for supporting the idea 
of changing to fixed election dates.
<P>
	I appreciate participating in this debate. I think that we should 
look at this as a non-partisan issue.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Peace River will 
have six minutes left if he wishes to use it the next time.
<P>
	The time provided for the consideration of Private Members' 
Business has now expired and the item is dropped to the bottom of 
the order of precedence on the Order Paper.
<P>
	The House stands adjourned until Monday, March 3, at 11 a.m.
